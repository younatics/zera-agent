Around 700 residents were evacuated early yesterday from the village of Estallencs on the popular holiday island as fires fanned by winds spread eastward along wooded hills, local officials said. The fire started on Friday east of the leisure port of Andratx and moved along the island's northern forested parkland. Some 360 firefighters and 26 water-carrying aircraft were tackling the flames.

Two newlyweds returned home from honeymoon to find their house sitter had sold all of their belongings - including a camcorder containing their ‘irreplaceable’ wedding video. Barry Holt, and his wife Claire, both 33, returned from their honeymoon in Alicante, Spain, to find items from their home in Laindon, Essex, missing. The couple had entrusted their friend Samuel Hawker, 23, to look after the property and their two dogs while they were away. Married: Mr and Mrs Holt, pictured on their wedding day, say the man also stole a 'priceless' video from the day . Instead, Hawker took an X-Box games console, games, cameras and jewellery to a local pawn shop and traded them in for less than £150. The couple estimate the gold jewellery alone was worth in the region of £5,000. It is claimed that Hawker also pawned a camcorder containing a priceless video of the couple’s wedding. Pawned: Samuel Hawker, 23, was house-sitting for the newlyweds. It is alleged that he sold their belongings for £150 . As soon as the couple returned in September this year, Hawker began acting suspiciously. Speaking at Basildon Magistrates Court, Philip Pearson, prosecuting, said: 'They thought they had been mislaid, but Mr Hawker soon started to become agitated. 'He started saying: ""I never took anything, I just stayed in the lounge"".' Hawker, of no fixed address, admitted one charge of theft and one charge of fraud in relation to falsely claiming to be the owner of the traded items. He has been released on bail ahead of sentencing next month. Heartbroken Mrs Holt, an equine therapist, said: 'I just feel really disappointed as he was a trusted friend. 'There are a lot of things that he stole which can’t be replaced - we worked out the jewellery alone was worth £5,000 but it also had a lot of sentimental value. 'We never even got to watch our wedding video before he took the camera away - it had been wiped by the time we got it back. Those are the things that are absolutely irreplaceable.' Mr Holt, a gas terminal operator, added: 'We are still very angry about this. It was a betrayal of our trust. If you can’t trust your friends then who can you trust? 'I gave that guy his first job years ago and I’ve known him since he was 15 so I thought we could trust him. 'We still don’t know why he did it - the amount of money he got for everything is ridiculous. 'I hope justice is done as he doesn’t deserve just a slap on the wrist - he needs to get prison time for what he has done.' The couple said Hawker only handed himself in after they named and shamed him on a Facebook post. Trauma: Barry Holt, and his wife, Claire, both 33, pictured, returned from their honeymoon to find a selection of their belongings has been sold . Taken: The couple claim their Samsung video camera, similar to the one pictured, was taken by Hawker . Mr Holt continued: 'He kept ducking and diving to avoid admitting he had stolen everything. 'He was blaming fictional friends and family members so eventually I posted all the details on Facebook and it was shared about 900 times. 'The police have retrieved a few items, including our camcorder but our wedding video had been wiped from it. 'We still don’t know where we stand with the insurance, or if we will get anything else back.'

Her rags-to-riches story, complete with a handsome prince, could have been taken straight from the pages of Hans Christian Andersen but it seems that Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit hasn't lost her taste for doing things the ordinary way. Faced with a wardrobe packed with old clothes, the 40-year-old chose to dispose of them in the same way as the rest of us - and is currently auctioning them off online. But there is one royal twist in the tale: Instead of pocketing the proceeds, all of the profit will be turned over to a green charity close to Mette-Marit's heart according to reports in the Telegraph. Good cause: Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit is auctioning her clothes for an environmental charity . Fairytale: Mette-Marit has a rags-to-riches story of her own and was a single mother before her marriage . Among the goods on sale on Bloppis, the Norwegian answer to eBay, are pieces by DKNY, Chloe, Marni and YSL, as well as high street pieces by Reiss and Fillipa K. Most popular of the items to sell so far was a pair of Dolce & Gabbana boots which cost the buyer 2700 Norwegian Kroner (£273). Unlike the Beckhams, who, after last week's closet clear out, handed their clothes to the Red Cross to sell, Norway's Crown Princess appeared to be doing the job herself and even took the opportunity to reveal why she picked an environmental charity. Writing on the website, Mette-Marit spoke of the importance of reusing old clothes as she explained her choice of Norwegian charity, Miljoagentene. 'Many of our clothes can be reused rather than discarded,' she wrote, adding: 'Protect the environment in a fun and easy way.' State visit: Mette-Marit joined Norway's King Harald V and her husband for a visit to the UK in 2005 . Popular: Since her 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, Mette-Marit has become a respected campaigner . The sale is the latest in a long line of charity endeavours undertaken by Mette-Marit since becoming Norway's Crown Princess in 2001. At the time of her wedding, the princess was the single mother of a four-year-old son named Magnus, but has since had another two children, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus with her husband, Crown Prince Haakon, 40. Although the run-up to the nuptials were marred by revelations concerning Mette-Marit's use of recreational drugs during the 1990s, in the years following the wedding, she has become widely respected for her charity work. Currently, the princess is a special representative for UNAIDS, a branch of the UN that focuses on dealing with HIV and AIDS. She also joined the Norwegian aid agency NORAD as an intern, and is a patron of several Norwegian charities, including the Oslo International Church Music Festival and the Norwegian Scouting Association.

A 13,000-square-foot San Francisco mansion has hit the market and its perfect for the trendy millionaire eager to jump on the speakeasy bar trend. The home complete with its own Prohibition-era bar tucked neatly behind hidden doors can be yours for a cool $27 million. ‘You press a button…and what looks like a paneled wall accordions open,’ said current owner John Murphy, and, voila! The perfect place for illicit booze consumption. Voila! This Prohibition-era bar is tucked away in an iconic mansion in San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood. The 13,000-square-foot home is on the market for $27 million . Speakeasy: Though the house was built in 1905 by the Spreckels family, years before Prohibition, subsequent owners added the bar--and a 1,200-square-foot ballroom--in 1929 when liquor was illegal across America . According to the Wall Street Journal, Murphy purchased the home in 1997 after he and his wife Paula Key discovered its hidden saloon. The couple paid $6.3 million for the Pacific Heights home at the time, but now say they’d like to downsize. ‘It's just time, at this point in our lives, to make a move to a simpler life,’ said Murphy, an author whose fortune was made after he helped found the for-profit University of Phoenix. Built in 1905 on the sugar fortune of the Spreckels family, the home features a walnut-paneled library, wine cellar, and two walk-out terraces with stunning views of the San Francisco Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, the city itself. The hidden bar wasn’t tucked away onto the  library clubroom until later in the handsome home’s life. In 1929, a few years before the 21st Amendment ended 13 years of Prohibition, then owners the Schwabachers hired an architect by the name of Albert Farr to remodel the home. In addition to the hidden bar, the Schwabachers had Farr tack on a 1,200-square-foot ballroom. Stunning: The sprawling home features five bedrooms, a ballroom, a walnut-lined library, floor-to-ceiling views of San Francisco Bay, and two walk-out terraces . 'Architectural tour de force': The stunning kitchen has even more stunning views of the city and bay . ‘The Art Deco ballroom - with abundant room for scores of celebrants - is complemented by a catering kitchen and wine cellar,’ reads the description for the ‘Iconic Pacific Heights Mansion’ on the Coldwell Banker Previews International website. The listing agent is David Bellings. Photos of the home come courtesy of Scott Hargis. After the Schwabachers and their additions came the family of Joseph Alioto, Jr., son of a former San Francisco mayor. Murphy became only the fourth owner of the nearly 100-year-old home. He and his wife are in search of the person who will be the fifth as they plan to spend more time at the Napa Valley residence. Keeping up appearances: The home has a total of five bedrooms, including two for the staff with separate entrance . Gorgeous: The lavish home was purchased by John Murphy, who bought it in 1997 for $6.3 million.

Families desperate to buy a home before house prices climb even higher are increasingly being asked to submit ‘sealed bids’, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday. For the first time in its history, it yesterday published guidance about how sealed bids work and how to boost your chances of beating other buyers. The advice provides further evidence of the country’s booming housing market with house prices rising in almost every region, particularly London and the South East. Families desperate to buy a home before house prices climb even higher are increasingly being asked to submit 'sealed bids', the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday . A spokesman for the NAEA said yesterday: ‘Sealed bids are a countrywide phenomenon.’ It comes as the Council of Mortgage Lenders said yesterday the number of homes sold this year will be more than one million for the first time since the financial crisis began in 2007. There has been ‘a particularly severe contraction’ in the number of homes bought and sold in Britain, it said, nearly halving from 1.6million in 2007 to just 886,000 in 2010. But the market has dramatically recovered, with more people keen to buy than at any time since the recession began. A separate report reveals how a local high-street with independent shops, rather than one dominated by supermarkets and other chains, added around £40,000 to the value of your home over the last decade. The report, published by American Express, looked at homes which have many independent shops within a ten to 15 minute drive by car, compared to ones which do not. Since 2003, it said homes have jumped by 55 per cent in value if they are close to independent shops, such as a local butcher, but only 46 per cent if they are not close to independents. A thriving local high-street was defined as one which has 20 per cent more independent shops than other high-streets, but may also have shopping giants on the high-street. For the first time in its history, it yesterday published guidance about how sealed bids work and how to boost your chances of beating other buyers . An independent is either a single shop, or one with no more than three outlets. Kirstie Allsopp, the TV property expert, said: ‘Building extensions, new kitchens and bathrooms are not the only ways to add value to your house. ‘By shopping locally and supporting local traders, you are investing in your home as well as your high-street.’ A sealed bid is when a buyer has so many people who want to buy their home - or wants to generate this level of interest - that they ask for secret bids to be submitted. The highest bid does not necessarily get the property, as the buyer might also evaluate who is in the best position to buy the property. That is, a cash bidder might beat a buyer who needs a mortgage, or needs to sell a property before being able to buy a new home. Jan Hÿtch, president of the NAEA, who works as an estate agent in Norwich, said the practice is particularly common in London but happening around the country. She said: ‘Sealed bids are often used when interest in a property is high, and it is likely that more than one party could and would wish to purchase.’","National Association of Estate Agents has  written guidance on sealed bids .

David Cameron will attempt to steal a £6billion Indian defence contract from under the nose of Francois Hollande next week. The Prime Minister will use a trip to India to try to persuade the New Delhi government to buy more than 100 Eurofighter jets after the French President left empty-handed this week. French contractor Dassault Aviation was chosen last year as the preferred bidder for the contract to supply Rafale jet fighters to the Indian air force - a blow for the UK-German-Spanish-Italian consortium, which includes Britain’s BAE Systems, which builds the Eurofighter. Amicable rivals: Despite cordial relations with France's President Francois Hollande, left, Prime Minister David Cameron is hoping to secure an Indian trade deal that France was eagerly pursuing . But Mr Hollande’s hopes of signing a final contract came to nothing this week - despite him squeezing in a visit before the Prime Minister. The French premier also failed to secure any major trade deals. That has sparked hopes in Downing Street that Mr Cameron can persuade the Indian authorities to rethink the deal and buy the Eurofighter instead. Officials made clear that the Prime Minister wants to steal a march on Mr Hollande, who has repeatedly clashed with Mr Cameron. The PM angered the French by offering to put out a ‘red carpet’ for entrepreneurs fleeing Mr Hollande’s new 75 per cent top rate of tax, while the French government retaliated with the same offer for British businessmen if the UK quits the EU in the referendum Mr Cameron has offered. A government source said: ‘Hollande was in India this week and a deal has not been signed so we will want to find out from the Indians how their talks are progressing with the French,” a Government source said. A No 10 official added: ‘We respect the fact that the Indians have chosen their preferred bidder and are currently negotiating with the French. Of course, we will continue to promote Eurofighter as a great fast jet not just in India but around the world.’ On a previous trip: Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron shakes hands with India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .

South African President Jacob Zuma has been ordered to repay some of the £12.9million of taxpayer's money spent on so-called 'security measures' at his private home after it emerged they  included a swimming pool, amphitheatre and tuckshop. An official report entitled 'Opulence on a Grand Scale' found Zuma had derived 'substantial' personal gain from improvements to his private compound at Nkandla in the rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal province. They reportedly include a visitors' centre, cattle enclosure, marquee area, football pitch, helipad, medical clinic, extensive paving and new houses for the polygamist president's large family. Jacob Zuma has been ordered to pay back some of the £12.9 million of public money spent on his private home after it emerged so-called 'security measures' included a swimming pool, football . pitch and tuckshop . The leaked findings of Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's investigation will reinforce a perception of runaway corruption under Zuma and could hurt him and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in an election due in six months. Zuma's spokesman declined to comment, while Madonsela's office said the leak was 'unethical and unlawful'. The ANC threw its weight behind Zuma, saying it believed he had done nothing wrong. Gain: South African President Jacob Zuma . The government went to court this month to try to prevent Madonsela from releasing the outcome of her investigation, arguing that cabinet ministers needed more time to work out whether its findings could jeopardise Zuma's security. It dropped its challenge after Madonsela, a quietly spoken lawyer seemingly unfazed by the pressure of her role, said she had gone to great lengths to ensure the report posed no threat. The Mail and Guardian newspapers said Madonsela's report accused Zuma, a polygamous Zulu traditionalist whose five years in office have been littered with scandals over violating ethics codes by failing to protect state resources and misleading parliament. Zuma told parliament last year all the buildings in the sprawling compound had been built 'by ourselves as family and not by the government'. Opposition parties seized on this particular aspect of the report to attack Zuma, who became president in 2009 only after corruption charges against him were withdrawn on a technicality. Prominent social campaigner Zackie Achmat launched an online petition for him to be impeached and the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called for no-confidence vote in parliament, even though Zuma is shielded by the ANC's nearly two-thirds majority. The report also found some of the more legitimate security features, such as 20 houses for police protection, a clinic and two helipads, were excessive and should have been placed in a nearby town to benefit the broader community, the paper said. The paper estimated some of the questionable features of the upgrade at 20 million rand ($2 million). It also said Zuma had had his private architect drafted in as 'principal agent' to oversee the upgrade, even though he was not a security expert. Anger: The government¿s decision to spend over £12.4 million ($20 million) of taxpayer money to revamp Zuma¿s private property has sparked public anger . Defiant: South African media have defied a government warning and splashed pictures of President Jacob Zuma's private home which was controversially revamped using taxpayers' money . The 215 million rand spent on Zuma's . home is in stark contrast to state money spent on improving the security . of previous South African presidents, the Mail and Guardian said. FW . de Klerk, South Africa's last white president, who left office in 1994, . received 236,000 rand for upgrades to his house, while 32 million rand . was spent on Nelson Mandela's home. The . Nkandla saga has been rich fodder for South Africa's newspapers, . especially since the government invoked apartheid-era security laws to . declare the compound a 'national key point' and prevent photographs of . it from being published. When . State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele reminded the media of the laws . at a news conference this month, newspapers responded by splashing . photos of the complex across their front pages beneath headlines such as . 'So, arrest us' and 'Look away!' There are now at least 20 buildings on . estate, including a number of large family homes, a medical clinic, . swimming pool, football pitch, secure underground living quarters, tuck . shop, helipad and visitors centre. How the other half live: The spending sparked public anger amid an economic crunch in a country where 10 million people live on social grants and many have only tin shacks for their homes .

He described Tips4jesus as friendly, polite, nice and a pleasure to serve and that he was told he would be taken care of the staff at the end of the night. Schultz had expectations that perhaps a $50 tip might be in the offing, but was flabbergasted when Tips4jesus reached for his black American Express card and tipped an amazing $7,000.

Californian workers could soon be earning a minimum wage of $10 an hour thanks to a bill that is expected to be signed by Governor Jerry Brown. If it is approved, California would have one of the highest rates in the nation once the increase takes place in three years. Washington state currently has the top minimum wage at $9.19 an hour, an amount that is pegged to rise with inflation. Some cities, including San Francisco, have slightly higher minimum wages. Scroll down for video . Pay day: A map shows which states pay above the Federal minimum wage. California is expected to raise its rate to $10 . The state Senate approved AB10 on a party-line 26-11 vote, sending it to the Assembly for a final vote that will be a mere formality before it goes to the governor. Mr Brown indicated earlier this week that he would sign the bill, calling it an overdue piece of legislation that would help working-class families. The bill would gradually raise California’s minimum wage from the current $8 an hour to $10 by 2016. It would be the first increase in the state’s minimum wage in six years, and comes amid a national debate over whether it is fair to pay fast-food workers, retail clerks and others wages so low that they often have to work second or third jobs. The rise would also be felt in Hollywood by putting pressure on pay rates for lower-rung production jobs, movie theater works and other entry-level positions. Democrats said the bill by assemblyman Luis Alejo would help workers left behind during the recent recession. The California Chamber of Commerce feared however that it would drive up businesses’ costs by ratcheting up other wages and compensation payments. 'We have it tagged as a job killer, given the increased costs businesses will be faced with,' Jennifer Barrera, an advocate for the chamber, said before the vote. The bill generated a detailed, statistic-laced, 40-minute debate in the Senate. 'If you give people a couple more dollars an hour … to spend in their communities, spend it they will. They’re not going to put it into a hedge fund,' San Diego Senator Marty Block said. He added: 'Nothing will make small businesses happier. This will stimulate the economy, as well as helping people’s lives.' But Republican lawmakers said it would harm the economy, price low-skilled workers out of the market and encourage businesses to cut jobs. 'This is a classic example with how out of touch state leaders are,' Senator Jim Nielsen said. Senator Ted Gaines likened the raise to calls to increase the price of tobacco as a way to deter people from using it. 'If you make something more expensive, people will buy less of it,' he said. Democrats who make up the majority of the Legislature called the wage hike a matter of economic justice. Raise: Luis Alejo, center, with Joel Anderson, left, and Mark Wyland, at the debate about raising California's minimum wage . 'The American Dream is clearly fading fast,' San Francisco Senator Mark Leno said. 'The income disparity in this country has not been this severe since 1917.' If it becomes law, California would gradually overtake Washington state. Neighboring Oregon and Nevada also have higher basic wages. Federal law sets a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, but California is among 19 states and the District of Columbia that set a higher state minimum wage. The federal minimum provides $15,080 a year assuming 40-hour work week, which is $50 below the federal poverty line for a family of two. More than 15 million workers nationally earn the national minimum, which compares to the median national salary of $40,350, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. President Obama has sought an increase of the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour.

The employers are to be warned about a series of imminent ‘targeted checks’ to make sure interns are being paid the correct national minimum wage. This is £6.31 an hour for people aged over 21. Michelle Wyer, HMRC’s assistant director of National Minimum Wage, said: ‘Any employer not playing by the National Minimum Wage rules needs to put things right now. ‘Those that don’t can expect a visit from HMRC - which could result in a penalty, payment of arrears, being publicly named and shamed by BIS or a prosecution.’ The action comes after Intern Aware, which campaigns against abuses of the internship process, passed the government a list of more than 100 companies which were advertising unpaid work in April. HMRC has also collated details of firms that could be flouting the law. It has already targeted London Fashion Week as the fashion industry takes on a high number of interns. Its enforcement action recently identified two employers not complying with National Minimum Wage law. While companies are free to offer work experience, where this amounts to a job - for example if the position lasts for a long time and hours and duties are set - companies are breaking employment law if they do not pay at least the minimum wage. Employment Relations Minister Jo Swinson will also unveil new guidance for interns today produced by BIS and 4Talent, Channel 4’s in-house scheme, offering internships in the creative industries. Warning: HM Revenue and Customs is writing to 200 employers which recently advertised unpaid internships . A video and posters will explain to young people what their rights are and how to take action if they feel exploited by companies. Miss Swinson said: ‘Not paying the National Minimum Wage is illegal and if an employer breaks the law, government will take tough action. ‘Already, this year HMRC has issued penalties to 466 employers. Anyone considered a worker under the law should be paid at least the minimum wage, whether they are an intern, or someone on work experience. She added: ‘We will continue to work closely with HMRC to clampdown on rogue employers. The targeted letters being sent to employers advertising internships today is just one example of this work. ‘By raising awareness of National Minimum Wage rates and the law we will make sure people play by the rules and treat their workers fairly.’ People are turning up at internships and . being treated as a full employee in every way, except at the end of the . month they don’t get a pay cheque through while everyone else does . Gus Baker, co-director of Intern Aware . Intern Aware said it had been prevented by HMRC from disclosing the list of employers it had submitted earlier this year, which included examples from marketing, PR and graphics. However, a quick search on the internet shows that firms are still advertising high-flying, long-term unpaid internships. Fortnum & Mason in Knightsbridge, West London, is currently offering a beauty buying internship for up to four months, with just ‘expenses’ covered. The post involves ‘working closely with the buying teams to carry out essential administrative tasks in a fast paced luxury retail environment’. Tasks will include ‘article creation and maintenance; assisting with presentations by collating samples and mood boards; communication with internal departments; researching latest buying trends and pricing; keeping up to date with competitors; maintaining good relationships with suppliers’. Gus Baker, co-director of Intern Aware, said yesterday: ‘We are delighted to see that action is being taken. Having said that, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and we will be expecting that enforcement action generates results as regards penalties due to non-payment of minimum wage. ‘Writing letters to companies and then failing to follow them up won’t do. It’s important that all interns are paid and that means HMRC making sure they fully enforce the law.’ He added: ‘People are turning up at internships and being treated as a full employee in every way, except at the end of the month they don’t get a pay cheque through while everyone else does. ‘They’re told to stay late, work on projects and to deliver stuff for clients. We’ve heard stories of people being billed out at nearly hundreds of pounds an hour while not being paid themselves.’","Investigations announced amid fears that workers are being exploited .

But researchers have unearthed a perfectly preserved skeleton of a baby dinosaur that’s more Disney than dangerous-looking. The remains are of a baby horned dinosaur called a Chasmosaurine, found in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada. It’s a distant cousin of the more famous Triceratops (the creature that was ill on Jurassic Park). Perfectly preserved: The remains are of a baby horned dinosaur called a Chasmosaurine . The Chasmosaurine was found by Professor Phil Currie of the University of Alberta. He told Everythingdinosaur.com: ‘The big ones just preserve better.  They don’t get eaten, they don’t get destroyed by animals.  You always hope that you’re going to find something small and that it will turn out to be a dinosaur.’ Professor Currie’s field team estimate that their baby dinosaur was about three years old when it died. Aww-some: What the baby dinosaur would have looked like when it was alive . Sizing things up: The Chasmosaurus as an adult . Relative-ly speaking: The Chasmosaurus's Triceratops cousins at Hancock Museum, Barras Bridge . It measures over 1.5 metres in length, but would have been five metres long and heavier than an Indian elephant had it reached adulthood. Analysis of the soil suggested that the dinosaur’s final resting place was watery – and so it had probably drowned. Professor Currie added: ‘I think it may have just gotten trapped out of its league in terms of water current.’ Location: The fossil was found in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Canada .","The baby dinosaur was around three years old when it died, say experts .

A convicted killer has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years after being found guilty of murdering a 17-year-old girl more than 30 years ago. Colin Campbell, 66, who is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury, killed Claire Woolterton three years earlier, in August 1981. The teenager’s naked body was found on the promenade by the River Thames in Barry Avenue in Windsor, Berkshire, by a man on his way to work. Colin Campbell (left), already serving a life sentence for manslaughter, killed Claire Woolterton (right) in 1981 . Deirdre Sainsbury (right) was found on a golf course in 1983 after being killed and mutilated by Campbell (right) She had initially been attacked at another, unknown location and her body showed physical signs consistent with having been partially asphyxiated and rendered unconscious. She had been stripped of her clothes and sexually assaulted and then murdered by having her throat cut, a trial at Reading Crown Court heard. Her mutilated body was also found to have several slash wounds and incisions around her vaginal area, jurors were told. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said that . ‘for 32 long years’ the identity of her killer was unknown until . advances in medical science and scientific technology came along . An . ‘adhesive tape lift’ had been used on the teenager’s body to take . ‘debris from the surface of her skin’. It was then stored by police for . 30 years until the case was reviewed in 2011. Campbell, . formerly from West London, was arrested in November last year and found . guilty of Claire’s murder by a majority verdict today, Thames Valley . Police said. The trial . heard that Claire, who lived in Northolt, north west London, with her . mother and her mother's partner, was last seen alive at around 10pm on . August 27, 1981, walking towards Hanwell after spending the evening in . Ealing with the older married man she was seeing. Usually after meeting her he drove her home, dropping her off nearby. This is the tow path in Windsor where Claire was found after being sexually assaulted and murdered . But . Mr Wright told the jury: ‘Sadly, on this night, she and he having had a . disagreement, she decided to make her own way home and set off at . around about 10 o'clock that evening. ‘It was a journey, sadly, that she did not complete.’ Claire, . who had left school at 16, was reported missing by her worried mother . the next day. That evening she learned that a girl's body had been found . and realised it could be her daughter, the court heard. Mr . Wright said Campbell, who pleaded guilty to hitch-hiker Ms Sainsbury's . manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, killed the . 29-year-old in December 1984. Her . body was found in a wooded area of Denham Golf Course in . Buckinghamshire, after Campbell picked her up in his car in Upper . Richmond Road, Roehampton, on the evening of December 22. There . were many similarities between the two killings: both women had been . mutilated with sharp instruments, both had their clothes removed by . their attacker and both bodies had been left in public places where they . could easily be found. Ms . Sainsbury's left breast was cut off and never recovered, while her . clothes were found in Campbell's garage. Claire's clothes were never . found. The killer of Claire (left), sister of Nick Woolterton (right), was found because of advances in medical science . Following the verdict, Pete Beirne, head of Thames Valley Police's major crime review team, said: . ‘Campbell has at no time shown any remorse for his actions and has delayed proceedings, adding to the strain on Claire's family and delaying the judicial process. ‘At the time of Claire's murder an extensive investigation was carried out, an investigation I was part of, and at that time Campbell did not feature in our inquiries. ‘Thanks to the work carried out by the major crime review team, working closely with our partners LGC Forensics and the Crown Prosecution Service, we were able to use modern-day technology to identify significant forensic evidence linking Campbell to the murder, which led to his arrest in November 2012. ‘I hope that Claire's family, who have shown courage during this difficult time, can take some comfort in knowing that her killer has finally received the justice he deserves.’ Ruth Bowskill, temporary chief Crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Claire Woolterton, who was making her way home in west London after a night out, had the misfortune to come across Campbell. ‘Claire was preyed upon, sexually assaulted, murdered and mutilated for his own sexual gratification. ‘Campbell is serving life for the manslaughter of a 29-year-old female hitch-hiker he picked up in west London December, 1984, and whose body was also dumped in Thames Valley and is clearly an extremely dangerous man. ‘Had it not been for his arrest for that offence, Campbell may never have been brought to justice for Claire's murder. It is thanks to cold case reviews and developments in DNA/forensic evidence techniques that we were able to secure this conviction today.’","Colin Campbell, 66, who is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury, killed Claire Woolterton in 1981 .

Iain Lowson had stopped in a lay-by near Torphichen in West Lothian to urinate behind a tree when he spotted what he initially thought was 'a funny-looking log' on the forest floor. The 'log' turned out to be a 6ft boa constrictor believed to have been dumped by its owners in the woods. Iain Lowson had stopped in a lay-by near Torphichen in West Lothian to urinate behind a tree when he spotted what he initially thought was 'a funny-looking log' on the forest floor... Mr Lowson (above), a retired civil servant, called the police, who informed the Scottish SPCA of his discovery . Mr Lowson, 63, said today: 'I had been driving back from Bathgate when I had a call of nature. 'I went into the woods and looked down and thought, ""That's a funny-looking log"". 'It took me a second but then I noticed the markings and headed round the tree and saw the rest of the body and the head and realised it was a big snake. 'I was surprised to say the least. 'Luckily I'm not one of those people who is very afraid of them and he was very sluggish but it was still a shock. 'You don't expect to pop into the woods and see a massive snake. 'It was lucky I didn't pee on it.' Mr Lowson, a retired civil servant, called the police, who informed the Scottish SPCA of his discovery. The animal charity believe the snake was abandoned and is fortunate to have survived out in the cold weather. The creature, which only weighs 5kg, is now in the care of the charity's Edinburgh and Lothians Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre at Balerno, where it has been named Hank. Inspector Jennifer Surgeon said: 'It's highly likely Hank has been abandoned due to the remoteness of the location he was found in. 'He is very lucky to have survived his ordeal as the cold weather could easily have killed him. 'Hank was extremely subdued and completely limp when I picked him up and we weren't sure whether he was even alive. 'However, after spending time warming him up beside the radiator in my van, Hank soon began moving again.' Mr Lowson said: 'There was straw nearby when I found the snake and I think someone had just stopped at the same lay-by as me and dumped it. 'There is really no need for this. I'm sure there are plenty of places that could have taken it.' The snake is now in the care of the charity's Edinburgh and Lothians Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre at Balerno, where it has been named Hank . Ms Surgeon added: 'He has now been vet checked and is receiving onward care and attention at our centre. 'Despite the circumstances Hank was found in, he appears to be in good overall health. 'We are appealing to the public to contact our Animal Helpline if they recognise Hank and know who might have owned him as abandoning an animal is an offence. 'In the meantime, we'll look after Hank until we can find him a loving new home.' Boa constrictors are native to Central and South America and can grow to up to 13ft long. They grab and hold onto their prey with small, hooked teeth and then wrap their bodies around their victims and squeeze tightly until the animal they've caught can no longer breathe.

A paranoid schizophrenic with a history of 'extreme violence' killed an innocent man after stabbing him 17 times with a Samurai sword because he thought the victim was 'reading his thoughts'. Marc Carter, 46, had been placed in a care home on 'trial release' from a secure hospital in Horfield, Bristol, last year when the unprovoked attack took place. He had been drinking cider before he stabbed fellow resident Gino Nelmes, 32, because he believed the father-of-two was 'reading his mind and repeating his thoughts'. Horror attack: Paranoid schizophrenic Marc Carter, left, stabbed victim Gino Nelmes, right, 17 times with a Samurai sword after being allowed out of a secure hospital on 'trial release' The ornamental weapon, which Carter had been keeping in his bedroom, pierced Mr Nelmes' heart, liver and spleen and he died from massive blood loss. By the time emergency services arrived Carter had already walked to a nearby police station and handed himself in saying 'I've just stabbed somebody with a knife'. Bristol Crown Court heard how Carter had a history of violent offences stretching back more than 20 years including assaulting a police officer. But despite his record, mental health bosses had released him from Fromeside secure hospital days earlier to live in a 'halfway house' which was attended by carers during the week, but not at the weekend when Mr Nelmes was killed. The Recorder of Bristol Judge Neil Ford QC ordered Carter be detained at Broadmoor hospital indefinitely, serving a minimum of 12 years before he can be considered for release, after he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Locked up: Marc Carter has been ordered to serve at least 12 years at Broadmoor secure hospital, pictured, before he is considered for release . He will not be released from custody without approval from the Secretary of State or a tribunal. 'In . my judgement you are particularly dangerous because it can appear to . professionals that your mental health is such that you can live in the . community, whereas, as this tragic case demonstrates, your behaviour is . unpredictable. 'I am wholly satisfied that you are a significant risk to the public of serious harm' said the judge. 'Gino had only been there for two weeks . before Carter took my son away. He could have lived a long, happy life, . with his two children, and he will never see them again.' Speaking outside court, Mr Nelmes' mother Rosa Hahn slammed mental health services for allowing Carter into the care home. She said: 'We didn't know Carter was in there with Gino. Gino had been living there happily for eight years before Carter came. 'He had only been there for two weeks . before he took my son away. Gino could have lived a long, happy life, . with his two children, and he will never see them again. 'I blame the doctors for releasing . Carter. What was in their minds to say that this man could walk the . streets and be in the community with people? 'I think it was also neglect by the place where Gino was, they didn't do their job. There should have been someone there. 'They must have known what kind of a person Carter is, they should have had staff there.' The judge said the latest psychiatric report on Carter found he was capable of 'extreme violence' towards other people at unpredictable intervals but had not been noted to be suffering any relapse before the killing. Carter's barrister, Paul Grumbar, told the court he did not think anyone was to blame for what happened. 'No science is perfect and no professional service can cover all eventualities, particularly when dealing with such a complicated person as Mr Carter,' he said. History of violence: Bristol Crown Court heard that Marc Carter had a record of violent offences stretching back more than 20 years . Speaking after the case, the victim's adoptive parents, Tony and Cheryl Nelmes, said: 'Gino was a loving, caring person whose smile was infectious. 'He had gone through a tough period in his life which we know now was due to mental health problems. Once these were diagnosed and he was given appropriate care and treatment, he was able to turn his life around. 'In recent years, Gino was the happiest that we have ever seen him. He had a loving family that he adored - he also had a partner and two young children that he absolutely doted on. 'For us, the pain of losing Gino has at times been unbearable. Thoughts of his last moments constantly fill our minds. There have been times when we have struggled to cope and wondered how we would ever get through this terrible time.' Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership, which runs Fromeside hospital, have launched an investigation into the case. A spokesman said: 'Decisions about the care and support provided to service users are always informed by the best clinical understanding of individual needs. 'We shall of course work closely with the independent investigation being commissioned by the strategic health authority designed to identify any lessons which can be learned from this tragic event.'","Marc Carter, 46, killed father-of-two Gino Nelmes, 32, at care home in Bristol .

Dazzling: For the last eight years, John and Teresa Baggott have transformed their front garden into a Santa's grotto with thousands of fairly lights, illuminated snowmen and a mechanical Father Christmas . Sanctuary Housing have reportedly also ordered the couple to tear down a shed they built to store their decorations. Mr Baggott says the family are so upset they want to move to a new home with their three boys - Zach, 18, Kai, 16, and disabled son Shea, 14, who suffers from a muscle and nerve-wasting condition. The security guard, 47, said: 'We did it (the decorations) for the kids. They would come round and go: ""wow!"" 'But a representative from Sanctuary Housing came round and told me I had to take down all the hooks and the electric boxes on the wall because he didn't want electrics outside the house. 'So if I wanted to put lights up, I couldn't.

'Serious concerns about the safety of these works': Housing bosses say the way they have altered their electrics to power the display at their home in Paignton, Devon, is a hazard . Mr Baggott said the family's Christmas decorations have raised more than £8,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and a nearby school for children with learning difficulties. The annual display, which takes around two weeks to assemble, last year earned them first place in the the residential category of the Torbay Winter Glitterland competition. Mr Baggott said they are now trying to find a new home to escape Sanctuary's 'Scrooge-like' rules. He added: 'We put a lot of work into it.

The sales assistant, 28, from South Wales always felt like the odd one out growing up. She says her four younger female siblings, Lindy, 26, Claire, 24, Morgan, 23, and Alice, 15, were all 'skinny minnies'. Approaching the peak of her weight, Sam with her sisters (from left to right) Lindy, Morgan, Claire and Alice . Sam Fitzgerald was sick of being the 'fat ugly one': (left to right) Morgan, Lindy, Sam, Alice and Claire . At her biggest, Samantha, who is only 5ft tall, weighed 15st 1lb. Wearing a dress size 20, she felt insecure next to her younger, slimmer sisters, whose sizes range from a diminutive size six to a 12 - 14, and she loathed being photographed next to them. Today, Samantha, one of six siblings in total, says she finally feels like 'one of the pack' after shedding six stone in just 12 months. Incredibly, she now weighs just 9 stone and is a slinky size 8. 'I feel amazing,' says Samantha. 'I no longer feel like the fat, ugly one. It was hard being the big one, strangers wouldn't believe we were related. Samantha pictured with her slim younger sister Alice . 'Although I love my sisters dearly, I used to feel left out at times. Whereas they used to have the usual sister squabbles over clothes, I couldn't borrow theirs as I was too big to fit into them. I used to feel envious and wonder why I had to be the fat one. It didn't seem fair.' Samantha first noticed she was different from her sisters when she was eight years old. 'I seemed to put weight on more easily and had a bigger appetite. Whereas my sisters were quite sensible with their food, I got into bad eating habits,' she says. 'It's started by going to the shops and buying a chocolate bar after dinner and then I'd scoff bags of crisps too. 'My mum was concerned and tried to put me on a diet but it didn't work. I would carry on buying junk food and would guzzle cans of full fat Coke too. Soon, my mum realised she wasn't getting anywhere with the diet and gave up in the end. Naturally, Samantha hoped it was just puppy fat but when her weight spiralled out of control in her teens she knew that wasn't the case. 'I was just getting bigger and bigger,' she says. 'Before I knew it I was a size 14 and weighed around 10 stone. Bearing in mind I am only 5ft, the extra weight looked ridiculous on me. 'I used to blame my slow metabolism and kid myself that I was bigger boned than my sisters, but that's clearly not the case as we're the same size now. But for a long time I used that as an excuse.' The fact her sisters' dress sizes ranged from a size six to a UK average 12-14 didn't help her self-esteem. 'They used to get excited about fashion. They would prance around the house in short skirt and crop tops. All the boys fancied them in school and they were pretty and popular. 'Sometimes people wouldn't even believe we were sisters. It was really hurtful and I would get really upset over it. It's not nice to feel like the fat, unattractive one when all your sisters are gorgeous and turn heads wherever they go,' she says. Despite their physical differences, Samantha says she's really close to all of her sisters and they would defend her if anyone said anything nasty about her size. 'One time I was walking along when some guys drove by and shouted ""fat b****"" out of the window. I burst into tears on the spot but my sisters were quick to shout back,' she says. 'They may be skinny little things but they're feisty madams when provoked. That night, I cried my eyes out. I hated the way people thought they could be cruel to me just because I was a bigger girl.' After school, Sam went on to study health, social care and secretarial skills at college. Her weight continued to spiral and Sam went up to 12 stone and was a dress size 16. Sam weighing 15 stone before (left) and at just nine stone after the weight loss (right) 'To be honest, I didn't try dieting. I just continued to eat the same junk food on top of my three meals a day.' And the pounds continued to pile on as Samantha became increasingly unhappy. 'When I started working at 18 I would be really tired when I got home and too lazy to make something for dinner. Because I had money I'd buy a greasy Chinese takeaway and eat it in front of the telly. 'That's Okay now and again as a treat, but I was doing it three times a week and seldom did any exercise.' Samantha continued to put on weight and by 26, she had ballooned to a size 20 and weighed 15.1 stone. 'It was horrible,' she says. 'I felt so uncomfortable and disgusted with myself for letting my weight get so out of control. On nights out I never felt attractive or sexy next to my sisters. They used to get attention left, right and centre and I had to pretend to be happy being the fat, bubbly one. 'It hurt when strangers wouldn't believe we were related. They'd act really shocked and say we didn't look anything alike. I knew what they meant by that, my sisters were hot and I was the fat, ugly one. 'It was a vicious circle, when I felt sad I'd eat more to feel better. Food was definitely a comfort for me.' Sam with her sister Claire (left) and relaxing on a day out (right) before weight loss . In June 2012, Samantha realised she had to do something drastic about her weight when she went to the doctors to get her blood pressure checked - but the Velcro belt didn't fit around her arm. 'I was horrified and wanted the world to swallow me up. That night, I went home and cried. I knew I had to change my life-style, it was now or never,' she says. Shortly after, she joined Slimming World. They devised a healthy eating plan for Samantha, swapping unhealthy meals and replacing them with pasta, jacket potatoes, fruit and veg. 'Finally I'd found a diet that worked for me,' she says. 'I could eat these carbs unlimited and was allowed 15 sins a day. After one week I lost over three pounds and the weight just continued to drop off. Instead of a sugary cereal for breakfast, I'd have porridge with a banana or a low-fat yogurt. 'I ditched fizzy drinks and guzzled litres of water instead. On top of this, I started to walk more.' Within just six months Samantha had lost four stone and was a dress size 12. Around this time, she met her fiancé, Sean Donnelly, 24, who works in construction, over the internet. 'Having a love interest in my life spurred me on even more so to lose the extra weight. Five months after meeting Sean, I shed another two stone - taking me to a tiny size eight.' Earlier this month, Sam won Slimmer of the month and Woman of the Year at Slimming World. 'I couldn't feel better,' she says. 'I finally feel one of the girls and when I go out with my sisters they're proud of me and show me off. 'Nowadays, strangers don't blink an eyelid when we say we're related. I'm no longer the fat, bubbly one - I'm also sexy and pretty like the rest of them. 'I can finally borrow their clothes and talk about fashion with them. I don't feel like the odd one out anymore.' Her sisters are incredibly proud. 'Sam's done so well, I'm so proud of her. It used to make me so mad angry when people called her fat and other nasty names,' says sister Morgan, 23. 'Even when she was minding her own business walking to walk people would shout horrible things about her weight. But she always held her head high and kept going. She's inspired me to lose weight, too.' 'I watched her lose weight bit by bit and she's literally transformed in front of my eyes. It's shed half her weight and it's changed her life,' says Lindy, 26. 'She's a lot happier now and much more confident. I've never seen her so determined to do something in her life, but she worked really hard to lose the weight and it's really paid off. I'm so proud of her, she's an inspiration to everyone.'","Samantha Fitzgerald, 28, from South Wales was the 'fat sister' growing up .

Under arrest: A mugshot of Kevin Kamooneh taken by police as they held him for 'stealing' electricity from a car-charging station at a Georgia school . An eco-conscious father has vowed to fight misdemeanour theft charges after he was arrested and held in jail overnight for plugging his electric car into a charging point at a school. Kaveh Kamooneh, 50, admitted charging his car at Chamblee Middle School in Chamblee, Georgia, but insists he had no idea that he wasn't allowed to. It's not clear how much electricity he used in charging his car, but Kamooneh said it was likely to have been worth only a few pennies. The former university professor turned investment advisor told ABC News: 'I'm waiting for them to arrest water drinkers and cell phone chargers.' Kamooneh had been plugging his car into the school's electric car charging station on Saturdays for several weeks while his son was having tennis lessons on courts nearby. It was one Saturday last month when he walked over from the lesson to find a Chamblee policeman inside his white Nissan Leaf, which was parked about 35ft from the tennis court. At first, said Kamooneh, the officer failed to answer when he asked him why he was in the car, which had been unplugged and its charger left on the ground. He said he provided his driving license and asked for the officer's information, and was later told the car had been abandoned on public property. According to ABC, the police officer wrote in his report: 'I asked him why his vehicle was plugged into the power at the school. He told me that was an excepted [sic] practice and that I was making to [sic] much of it. I asked him if he has [sic] asked the Dekalb County school system if he could take the power. He told me that I did not ask if my patrol car can dirty the air - did you? He says ""No you did not"".' A statement from the school said that a 'local citizen' contacted police to complain that Kamooneh's car was plugged in at the school. It added that the DeKalb County School District was cooperating with the investigation into the alleged theft. Kamooneh says his car was plugged into the outlet for about 20 minutes. An expert told WXIA Atlanta that it is likely it drew about five cents worth of electricity in that time. Kamooneh had been plugging his car into the electric car charging station at Chamblee Middle School (pictured) on Saturdays for several weeks while his son was having tennis lessons on courts nearby . Mr Kamooneh was arrested at his home on November 13, on a warrant for misdemeanour theft and spent 14.5 hours at a police station before being released on $150 bail. Marc Johnson, police chief and city manager of Chamblee, said that if Kamooneh had simply offered to unplug the car then no action would have been taken. But Kamooneh said the police officer had taken a 'confrontational' attitude after he had questioned his entry into the car, contributing to an uncooperative 'atmosphere'. 'It seemed like he was upset that I wasn't getting scared or wasn't intimidated at his threat of arrest,' he said. Kamooney said he is confident that when his case goes to court in February that the charge 'is going to be laughed out of court'.","Kevin Kamooneh, 50, vows to fight misdemeanour theft charge .

Fast-food workers and labor organizers are marching, waving signs and chanting in 100 cities across America today amid a push for higher minimum wages - currently placed at $7.25 an hour. Organizers say walkouts are planned, with rallies set for another 100 cities. But it's not clear what the actual turnout will be, how many of the participants are workers and what impact they'll have on restaurant operations. The actions would mark the largest showing yet in a push that began a year ago. Scroll down for video . Striking McDonald's worker Abran Escarzaga, 31, protests outside McDonald's in Los Angeles, California, today . Tremaine Tribble, of Charlotte, N.C., leads a chant inside a Burger King restaurant during a protest for a raise in the minimum wage today . At a time when there's growing national and international attention on economic disparities, labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats are hoping to build public support to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25, or about $15,000 a year for full-time work. Protesters are calling for pay of $15 an hour, but the figure is seen more as a rallying point than a near-term possibility. In New York City, about 100 protesters blew whistles and beat drums while marching into a McDonald's at around 6:30 a.m.; one startled customer grabbed his food and fled as they flooded the restaurant, while another didn't look up from eating and reading amid their chants of 'We can't survive on $7.25!' Community leaders took turns giving speeches for about 15 minutes until the police arrived and ordered protesters out of the store.

The crowd continued to demonstrate outside for about 45 minutes. A McDonald's manager declined to be interviewed and asked that the handful of customers in the store not be bothered. In Detroit, about 50 demonstrators turned out for a pre-dawn rally in front of a McDonald's. A handful of employees walked off the job, but the restaurant stayed open as a manager and other employees worked the front counter and drive-thru window. Julius Waters, a 29-year-old McDonald's maintenance worker who was among the protesters, said it's hard making ends meet on his wage of $7.40 an hour. 'I need a better wage for myself, because, right now, I'm relying on aid, and $7.40 is not able to help me maintain taking care of my son. I'm a single parent,' Waters said. In Atlanta, about 40 demonstrators rallied at a Burger King; another demonstration was planned later in the day. Activists hold posters of President Barack Obama during a protest outside a McDonald's restaurant at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. today . Fast food workers attend a protest against McDonald's outside one of its restaurants in New York . The push for higher pay in the fast-food industry faces an uphill battle. The industry competes aggressively on value offerings and companies have warned that they would need to raise prices if wages were hiked. Most fast-food locations are also owned and operated by franchisees, which lets companies such as McDonald's Corp., Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. say that they don't control worker pay. However, labor advocates have pointed out that companies control many other aspects of restaurant operations through their franchise agreements, including menus, suppliers and equipment. Fast-food workers have historically been seen as difficult to unionize, given the industry's high turnover rates. But the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers in health care, janitorial and other industries, has been providing considerable organizational and financial support to the push for higher pay over the past year. Protestors chant outside a Burger King restaurant during a protest for a raise in the minimum wage in Charlotte, N.C . Organizers were calling for a one-day labor walkout at fast-food restaurants in 100 cities (demonstrations seen today in Chicago) Berlin Rosen, a political consulting and public relations firm based in New York City, also has been coordinating communications efforts and connecting organizers with media outlets. The National Restaurant Association, an industry lobbying group, said most those protesting were union workers and that 'relatively few' workers have participated in past actions. It called the demonstrations a 'campaign engineered by national labor groups.' McDonald's said in a statement that it's 'committed to providing our employees with opportunities to succeed.' The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said it offers employees advancement opportunities, competitive pay and benefits. In the meantime, the protests are getting some high-powered support from the White House. In an economic policy speech Wednesday, President Barack Obama specifically mentioned fast-food and retail workers 'who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty' in his call for raising the federal minimum wage. Crowds of protesters gathered outside a McDonald's restaurant in New York . Labor Secretary Thomas Perez also offered words of support for the protesters on the agency's blog. 'We see momentum gathering and a consensus emerging around the idea that we need to increase the federal minimum wage, to give these workers and millions like them a fair day's pay for a fair day's work,' Perez said in the statement. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised a vote on the wage hike by the end of the year. But the measure is not expected to gain traction in the House, where Republican leaders oppose it. Supporters of wage hikes have been more successful at the state and local level. California, Connecticut and Rhode Island raised their minimum wages this year. Last month, voters in New Jersey approved an increase in the minimum to $8.25 an hour, up from $7.25 an hour.","Protesters want the minimum wage to be changed from $7.25 an hour to $15 .

Mystery: Two experts have demonstrated that it would have been almost impossible for Gareth Williams (above) to lock himself in the bag . The spy in the bag must have been dead or unconscious when he was locked into the holdall in which his body was found, an inquest heard yesterday. An escapology expert tried and failed 300 times to lock himself into an identical bag after being hired to try to crack the mystery of Gareth Williams' death. Peter Faulding said 'Harry Houdini would have struggled' to use the small brass travel padlock to seal himself inside, and someone else must have done it. Mr Faulding, a former Parachute Regiment reservist, described theories that the reclusive MI6 codebreaker got into the North Face holdall by himself as 'unbelievable scenarios'. His experiments appeared to be a key breakthrough in the riddle which has baffled Scotland Yard's most senior detectives. How Mr Williams died remains unknown. Mr Faulding's evidence came as details of material discovered on Mr Williams' laptops and mobile phones were revealed for the first time. A short film on his work iPhone showed the 31-year-old wearing nothing but calf high leather boots, 'wriggling and gyrating' around a chair before bending over with his back to the camera. Mr Williams had used other laptops to view fetish clothing websites and bondage and sadomasochism videos, as well as spending half his time on women's fashion sites and blogs. Images he viewed on a French website showed a model enclosed in plastic using a vacuum cleaner to suck air out. Others were of people tied up with ropes. Mr Faulding, a mine rescue specialist, was hired by police a month after the naked and decomposing body of Mr Williams was discovered in the bath in his flat in Pimlico, Central London, in August 2010. The case sparked a blizzard of conspiracy theories, including claims Mr Williams was murdered by foreign spies or died in a sex game that went wrong. Mr Faulding filmed himself attempting to get inside an identical heavy-duty holdall and lock himself in by threading a padlock through the eyelets of the zip. Asked by coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox how many times he had tried, he replied 'probably 300'. Scroll down for videos . A hundred attempts: A video was played to the jury showing a reconstruction in which a yoga specialist tried to lock himself in a sports holdall unaided . Contorted: A second video seen by the inquest shows a failed attempt at the 'frustrating, fiddly' task of pulling the zip within the 32in by 19in space . Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that . whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one . and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry' He said: 'I just cannot do it. This . case, I just cannot get it off my mind. It is very difficult. I am an . escapologist, I am thinking outside the box here and trying everything I . can to find a way.' Dr Wilcox added: 'With all your trials and failures do you think it would be impossible to padlock this bag from the inside?' Mr Faulding replied: 'I cannot say it was impossible, but even Houdini would struggle.' He said Mr Williams could not have . survived for more than 30 minutes as the temperature quickly rose and . oxygen levels dropped. Mr Faulding said he only lasted five minutes . before becoming 'delirious' after zipping himself inside with emergency . oxygen and a paramedic outside. He said other evidence reinforced his belief that someone else was involved. No fingerprints or DNA were found . where Mr Williams would have placed his hands on the bath and it would . have been difficult to put the key where it was found under his right . buttock. But Mr Faulding said it would have been 'easy' for one person to lift the sturdy bag carrying the body, into the bath. This may have been done to catch . leaking body fluids, while the bathroom door could have been closed to . contain the smell of decomposition, he said. Baffling: The inquest heard the absence of fingerprints on the sides of Mr Williams' bath (pictured) suggests he did not lower himself into it . Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence . 'My conclusion is Mr Williams was placed in the bag unconscious or he was dead when he was put in the bag,' he added. A second expert, William MacKay, said . he and a yoga-practising assistant made more than 100 attempts to . recreate the feat without success. But he refused to rule out the . possibility that Mr Williams locked himself inside, highlighting that . the rock climbing, fell running spy was extremely fit and dextrous. Mr . Williams' former landlady has already revealed she once found him tied . to the posts of his bed after he shouted for help one night. DC Simon Warren said the spy spent half of his time viewing haute couture fashion websites. But a small amount of material . revealed he also viewed websites about famous drag queens and niche . sexual fetishes, including bondage. The inquest has also heard how Mr . Williams may have been at risk from blackmail after making illicit . searches on the top secret MI6 database. But a senior official, known . only as SIS F, said there was no evidence that he had been identified by . hostile foreign agents, let along targeted. The inquest continues next week.

"By . Reuters  and Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 4 December 2013 . The Los Angeles International Airport shooter accused of killing a federal security screener and wounding three others last month appeared in court for the first time Wednesday sporting cuts on his face and a tracheostomy plug in his throat cut. A federal judge ordered Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, held without bond pending trial, saying the alleged shooter posed a danger to the community and was a potential flight risk. Ciancia, who was critically wounded by police during the shooting incident at one of the world's busiest airports, is charged with killing a Transportation Security Administration officer and committing an act of violence at an international airport. Because of his injuries, he was prevented from making an initial court appearance in the days following his arrest. Court sketch: A sketch by Bill Robles shows accused Los Angeles airport shooter Paul Ciancia, the man charged with killing a U.S. airport security officer, at a hearing at the San Bernardino County West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, California December 4, 2013. U.S. But he appeared at a hearing on Wednesday at a jail in Rancho Cucamonga, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Ciancia . is accused of walking into Terminal 3 at the airport, removing an . assault-style rifle from a bag and opening fire on an unarmed TSA agent . standing at the entrance to security checkpoint. Authorities . say he then went past metal detectors through the checkpoint and into . the airplane-boarding area, shooting and wounding two other TSA . employees and a traveler before he was critically wounded in a gunfight . with airport police. Checks: The FBI was granted a warrant to search the cellphone of Paul Ciancia, 23, on Monday . The . court appearance comes after it was revealed federal agents are . investigating the possibility that the alleged gunman believed in a . conspiracy theory about a global takeover by the government. The . FBI were given a warrant in early November to search Paul Ciancia's . cell phone for materials reflecting his 'views on the legitimacy or . activities of the United States government, including the existence of a . plot to impose a New World Order,' according to court documents. Ciancia, an unemployed motorcycle . mechanic, got a ride to LAX on November 1, walked inside and began . targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, authorities . said. By the time LAX police officers subdued him with several gunshots, one TSA officer, Gerardo I. Hernandez, had been killed and two others were injured. A . note found in a bag after the shooting mentioned the 'NWO,' an apparent . reference to the new world order belief that holds an international . cabal of elites is planning to take away the guns and personal freedoms . of Americans, authorities said. Perceived . masterminds behind the conspiracy have shifted over several . generations, among them bankers, communists and the government itself. Why airport security officers apparently came to personify oppression . for the gunman remains unclear. Judge: Magistrate Judge David Bristow, pictured, walks out from the hearing of accused Los Angeles airport shooter Paul Ciancia, after ordering him held without bond . The TSA does not regularly feature as a . target of the theory's ire, according to Mark Potok, who has studied . extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center. More . typically, believers focus on another homeland security agency, the . Federal Emergency Management Agency, which according to the theory plans . to build camps to detain resisters to the new order, Potok said. Potok said he has seen no evidence that Ciancia was personally involved in hate groups. The rant in his note also spoke of how . TSA searches were a violation of constitutional rights and a vulgar . term was used to refer to Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of the . Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA. A motive? They are investigating his ties to the belief in the New World Order - that a totalitarian regime will take away weapons and freedoms. Pictured, Los Angeles airport after the shooting . Conspiracy: A long note found in Ciancini's bag mentioned the New World Order, authorities have said . Ciancia's family, from Pennsville, New Jersey, have offered sympathy to the family of the victim. In a statement, they also expressed their shock at the rampage and hope for the recovery of the surviving victims. One of those officers, Tony Grigsby, spoke for the first time publicly, saying he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him in the right foot. He hobbled with a cane outside his South Los Angeles home, where he fought back tears recalling Hernandez as a wonderful person who will be missed. 'Only now it has hit me that I will never see him again,' Grigsby said. Co-workers, friends and others gathered Monday night for a tribute to Hernandez at a beach near the airport. Victim: TSA screener Gerardo I. Hernandez, pictured, was killed in the shooting and two others were hurt . 'He was loved,' Jose Araujo, one of hundreds of people who gathered at Dockweiler State Beach, told KNBC-TV. 'He's going to be missed and he's never going to be forgotten.' The other wounded TSA officer has been released from the hospital, the agency said, and the condition of high school teacher Brian Ludmer, who was shot in the calf, was upgraded from fair to good. Ciancia remained in critical condition and any court appearance on charges of first-degree murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport will depend on when his doctors say he's ready, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.","A federal judge said Wednesday he was denying bail for Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23 because he posed a danger to the community and was a potential flight risk .

The corporation has been accused of ‘fobbing us off’ with old programmes after it emerged almost half of its TV schedule over the festive period will be repeats. During Christmas week, viewers will be presented with nearly 300 hours of reruns on the four main channels, including vintage hits such as Dad’s Army, Morecambe & Wise and ’Allo ’Allo! Classic: Family favourites including Dad's Army are among the repeats to be shown on BBC over the festive period . The worst offender is BBC2, where seven out of ten programmes will be repeats –  prompting accusations the corporation is failing licence fee payers by not providing enough new shows. Last night Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The BBC needs to think long and hard about showing so many old programmes, because the licence fee payer will question why they are handing out £3.5billion for new material. If they continue to fob us off with the same old shows people will start asking for their money back.’ Between Saturday, December 21, and Friday, December 27, 47 per cent of the output on the BBC’s two main channels will be repeats. Of 186 shows scheduled to air on BBC1, 55 will be reruns – 10 per cent more than over the same period last year. Among the tried and tested family favourites will be The Vicar of Dibley, Miranda, and old episodes of Flog It! There is some good news, however – amid the glut of repeats, viewers will also be able to look forward to some new dramas. But because most of them have been scheduled at the same time on Christmas Day, it will be impossible to catch them all without using the record button. The biggest clash will be between the BBC and ITV on the afternoon of December 25. The much-hyped Downton Abbey special on ITV will be aired at the same time as EastEnders on BBC1, followed by Mrs Brown’s Boys. Other highlights will be the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special and an adaptation of M R James’s chilling ghost story The Tractate Middoth on BBC2. Viewers will also eagerly tune in to the Doctor Who Christmas special, which will see the departure of Matt Smith, the current Doctor, and the arrival of the new Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi. But fans of BBC1’s Sherlock, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch, will have to wait until New Year’s Day for the start of series three. Those who switch over to Channel 4 in the hope of something new will be confronted by a schedule filled with reruns of The Simpsons and Father Ted. Almost 60 per cent of the broadcaster’s output will be repeats, compared with a relatively modest 28 per cent on ITV. And viewers looking forward to blockbuster film premieres will instead have to make do with old favourites from the back catalogue, such as Finding Nemo and Emma. Of 56 films to be shown on BBC1 and BBC2 over the period, only seven will be network premieres. Those hoping to recover from their festive excesses by slumping down in front of the TV in the  days after Christmas will be particularly disappointed. On Friday December 27, BBC2 will show nothing but repeats between 7.30am and 7.30pm. In total, the main broadcasters will show 52 hours of second-hand programming that day. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Well over 90 per cent of programmes in peak on BBC1 will be brand new, including the regeneration of Doctor Who, and the eagerly anticipated return of Sherlock for example. ‘In daytime, there are some carefully chosen family film favourites alongside more premieres than any other channel and much loved treats from Christmases past including The Gruffalo.’ Insiders said BBC2 would offer a ‘complementary schedule’ with ‘classic favourites’ shown alongside some new shows. Channel 4 suffered a huge ratings slump this year as viewers switched off its flagship ‘sex season’ and accused it of dumbing down its news programmes. Its overall share of the TV audience dropped by more than 11 per cent on last year, while rivals ITV and Sky 1 saw their fortunes improve. The broadcaster’s ratings are now on a par with BBC2 and only slightly better than Channel 5, according to figures compiled by industry magazine Broadcast. The disappointing annual results come less than six months after regulator Ofcom wrote to Channel 4 executives expressing ‘concern’ over falling ratings. Viewing figures for some popular shows, such as Countdown, have halved in recent years, and the channel’s licence is set to expire at the end of 2014. Meanwhile, Channel 4 executives have continued to rake in huge salaries. Chief executive David Abraham received a £100,000 bonus in May, taking his total salary to £744,000. Over the past 12 months, the channel has had just under a 6 per cent share of all TV viewing, compared with 21 per cent for BBC1 and 17 per cent for ITV. In a desperate attempt to boost audiences, Channel 4 screened a season of sex-themed shows this autumn – but the flagship programme attracted fewer than 900,000 viewers. Others have accused Channel 4 News of being less serious than its competitors. But host Jon Snow defended it, saying: ‘It should be other. It should be for those, perhaps, who have less of a voice anywhere else.’ Re-runs: Between Saturday, December 21, and Friday, December 27, 47 per cent of the output on the BBC¿s two main channels will be repeats.

A man who spent 25 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted for the murder of his wife has revealed how he has reconnected with the son who was too embarrassed to visit him behind bars. Michael Morton, a former grocery store worker, walked free from Williamson County courthouse in Taylor, Texas, in October 2011 after new DNA evidence in the case exonerated him. Now in a new documentary for CNN, Morton has spoken of his pain at seeing his son, who was just three when he was jailed, drift further away from him - and how they are closer than ever today. Scroll down for video . Freed: Michael Morton spent 25 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of killing his wife in 1986 . In August 1986, Morton's wife, Christine, was bludgeoned to death by a blunt object at . their Williamson County, Texas home while he was . at work - but still, suspicion fell on him. He said that an intruder must have been responsible, but prosecutors accused of him of killing her after she refused to have sex with him on his birthday. He was convicted based on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to life in prison. Eric, who was just three, was sent to live with his aunt and visited his father twice a year in prison. 'It was always bitter sweet,' Morton told CNN's documentary, An Unreal Dream, which airs on Thursday. 'I would love seeing him, I was fascinated with his every move. 'But he was becoming more distant. He was becoming less mine.' Before tragedy: Morton is pictured with his wife Christine and their son Eric, who was three when she died . Confused: His son Eric, pictured today, said that he was embarrassed to visit his father in prison as a teen . As Eric grew up, his father felt more of a stranger to him, he told CNN. 'He barely existed in . my life,' Eric said. 'I didn't have memories of him outside of the visits to . prison... I think it was embarrassing for me to think that I had to go to jail to see my dad.' Eric added to Katie Couric in an . interview last year: 'When I was a teenager, I just wanted to . get on with my life. It just seemed strange. I didn't feel like I needed . to go. 'When I was 17 or . 18 I decided to research... and I came to the idea that he must've been . crazy. I thought that if he was innocent, he never would've been guilty . and never would've gone to jail.' Eventually, Eric said that he didn't want to see his father any more. Michael said it was 'numb, painful' - but that he could do nothing but ask his sister-in-law to take good care of his son. Together: The father and son, pictured on Katie Couric's show last year, say they are now close . Eric even changed his surname to Olson - the name of the family who raised him. But then the Innocence Project, a New York-based group working to help people wrongfully convicted, picked up Morton's case. Using techniques that . weren't available during his 1987 trial, authorities detected Christine . Morton's DNA on a bloody bandana discovered near the Morton home soon . after her death. Along with her DNA was the blood of a convicted felon, Mark Norwood, who went on to kill another woman, Debra Baker, in similar circumstances less that two years later. As well as the new evidence, the prosecutor in Morton's case, Ken Anderson, was accused of withholding crucial evidence. Accused: Prosecutors said Morton, seen in his mug shot, killed his wife after she refused to have sex with him . In addition to the bandana, he failed . to share that neighbors had described a man parking a green van behind . the house, or that Eric had seen the attack and said his father had not . been home. 'There was no scientific evidence, there . was no eyewitness, there was no murder weapon, there was no believable . motive,' Morton told CNN of his part in the killing. 'Innocent people think that if you just . tell the truth then you've got nothing to fear from the police. If you just stick to it that the system will work, it'll all . come to light, everything will be fine... 'I didn't see how any rational, thinking . person would say that's enough for a guilty verdict.' The new DNA evidence showed that he had indeed been wrongfully convicted, and last month, Ken Anderson pleaded no contest to criminal contempt for deliberately withholding exculpatory evidence. He stepped down from his position as a judge and agreed to serve 10 days in jail, although he served five due to good behavior laws - far, far less time than Morton was forced to endure. A free man: Morton, right, breathes in the fresh air after leaving the Williamson County courthouse in Taylor, Texas with his attorney on October 4, 2011. New DNA evidence exonerated him . Relief: He is pictured embracing his parents, Bill and Pat Morton, after gaining his freedom in 2011 . On October 4, Morton was released from . prison. Photographs taken on the moment show him holding his face to . the sun, breathing in the moment. Mark Norwood was later convicted after his DNA was found on a bloody bandana near the scene . 'I thank God it wasn't a capital case,' he said as he left. 'Colors seem real bright to me now. Women are real good looking.' Then he was reunited with his son - who he had last seen more than a decade before. 'He looked old,' Eric told Katie Couric. 'It was extremely awkward. I had no idea what to say.' But the pair worked on their relationship and Eric went on to have a daughter, whom he named Christine after his mother. 'I've never seen a more perfect child,' Michael added. 'I don't think Eric ever got me until he had her.' 'Life has come full circle,' Eric said. 'I do love him.' Morton now works on programs helping other innocent people behind bars and is religious, saying that his faith in God helped him through his ordeal and helps him to cope with what he lost. Earlier this year, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed the Michael Morton Act, which states prosecutors must turn evidence over to the defense upon the defendant's request, without needing a court order. 'Other people often feel far more anger than I do,' Morton told CNN. 'Vindication is very, very good, but it's something I knew all along.... It's really nothing new for me.'","Michael Morton was found guilty of killing his wife Christine at their Texas home in 1986 - even though he had been at work .

Criticism: Author Joanna Trollope has blamed such screen adaptations of Jane Austen's work for criticism of her own latest novel . Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in a wet white shirt is a scene many Jane Austen fans recall fondly. But therein lies the problem, novelist Joanne Trollope claimed yesterday. The best-selling writer, who has faced a backlash from ‘Jane-ites’ following the release of her modern day version of Sense and Sensibility, said many of her critics would have found it ‘very difficult’ to read Austen’s original work and will be basing their opinions on TV adaptations. Citing the example of Colin Firth playing Mr Darcy in the TV adaptation, she said: ‘They [Jane Austen] fans love Pride and Prejudice when Colin Firth emerges from the lake in the wet shirt, which at no point features in the book. I’m not saying there isn’t great accuracy in the films but it isn’t the same.’ Miss Trollope, 69, was making her comments at London book club Hidden Prologues  where she explained how she had adapted the classic, Sense and Sensibility published in 1811, by setting it in modern day society. The author told how she chose to reference social networking site YouTube and used colloquialisms such as ‘totes amaze-balls’ from ITV2 reality-soap The Only Way is Essex to bring it into 2013. The mother-of-two said many of the Austen themes were transferable to the 21st Century claiming many women are still driven by the sex appeal of money. Miss Trollope went on to joke that nobody ever had slept with Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone for his looks or that Fifty Shades of Grey character Christian Grey would not be as desirable if he was not as wealthy. Miss Trollope has written more than 30 novels but is best-known for her historical romance ‘The Rector’s Wife’. She said: ‘The one thing which Jane Austen understood was the sex appeal of money, and that’s a recurrence today. Do you really think anyone went to bed with Bernie Ecclestone for his good looks? ‘Fifty Shades of Grey would not have been an erotic best seller if Christian Grey had had no money. If that novel had been set in a bedsit above a take-away in suburban London it would have been a novel about sexual abuse and that is why it works.’ Defending her right to play around with the original Miss Trollope yesterday argued many fans found it ‘very difficult’ to read Austen and were more likely to watch the films. Miss Trollope’s Sense and Sensibility was released in October and she said: ‘People have to remember that I’m not writing a sequel. The problem we have is, there is a generation who claim to absolutely love her – they think they are Jane Austen fans but actually they know every frame of the films and the television. ‘The funny thing is people find Georgian English very hard to read, therefore most ‘fans’ seek adaptations. ‘‘When I was writing I took a paperback and I cannibalised it, I went through with a highlighter pen and looked to see which dialogue I wanted to use. ‘And I managed to translate Austen to ‘totes amazeballs’ and if you sit and watch The Only Way Is Essex the language is great so I had to have a play.’ Iconic scene: Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in TV¿s Pride and Prejudice is a scene many fans recall fondly . Sense and Sensibility was first adapted for television in 1981in a serial directed by Rodney Bennett then in 1995 it was made into film starring actress Emma Thompson. Most recently in 2008 the novel was once again adapted for television as part of an Austen series run by the BBC. Yesterday the romantic writer criticised devote ‘Janeities’ claiming their tributes to her are not in the spirit of Austen. The grandmother branded the Austen legacy as ‘Quality Street’ and argued it was wrong to ‘sanctify’ her. Miss Trollope, who is twice divorced and lives alone in London, added: ‘Janeites aren’t really in the spirit of Jane Austen. ‘I think she may have looked at ‘Jane Austen Day’ and gone – no god why. ‘There’s a slightly quality street element to what has become the Jane Austen legacy. ‘If you read her letters they are such fun, she’s mad about clothes and what everything costs and what we are going to have for dinner –They are full of parties and gossip. ‘She was a hugely intelligent women but she was very much of her time. She had a perfectly feminine appreciation of all the pleasures women would share. ‘To sanctify her and to make her separate her – to almond sugar coat her – is not doing her justice.’","Best-selling writer has faced a backlash from ‘Jane-ites'

'A sexualized attack': Dem Alison Grimes campaign condemned the sexist photo-shopped picture . The National Republican Senatorial Committee scrambled to apologize Tuesday amid outrage from an ‘extremely offensive’ photo-shopped image tweeted by a junior staffer. A tweet sent from NRSC’s official Twitter account asked if Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes is the new ‘Obama Girl’ and featured Ms Grimes’ face poorly pasted on to the body of the original ‘Obama Girl.’ A spokesperson for the campaign committee blamed the ill-advised tweet on a junior staffer and said ‘disciplinary action has been taken.' The amateurish photo-shop job shows Ms Grimes' face superimposed on the body of ‘Obama Girl,’ the model who made racy videos about her crush on then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2007. The woman is wearing a snug-fitting Obama T-shirt with her midriff showing. ‘We agree, it's extremely offensive, said the spokesperson. ‘It was a mistake made by a junior staffer and disciplinary action has been taken.’ ‘We took corrective action as soon as it was brought to our attention and have taken steps to ensure it will never happen again.’ Ms Grimes is the Democratic front-runner for her party's nomination to take on U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. She condemned the tweet as ‘sexist’ and issued a challenge of sorts to Mr McConnell. The NRSC has since deleted the tweet. Outraged: US Senate candidate Alison Grimes, shown here during her successful 2010 campaign for Kentucky Secretary of State, said the dress isn't what matters, 'it is what is in the head' ‘The NRSC should stand for Notoriously Repeating Sexist Comments – they cannot relate or connect with the women of Kentucky or our country,’ reads a statement from Ms Grimes. ‘As Kentucky's more than two million women know, it is not what is in the dress that matters,’ she added. ‘It is what is in the head, and I will stack my head up against Sen.

The McConnell campaign voiced no sympathy for Ms Grimes in a statement Tuesday afternoon. McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore instead accused Grimes of trying to use the incident to distract from ‘the real news’ that she attended a fundraiser with first lady Michelle Obama in New York on Monday. The original: Amber Ettinger made headlines as 'Obama Girl' during the 2008 presidential campaign . ""It is really pathetic that the Grimes campaign is more worried about what some intern in the basement of the NRSC is tweeting rather than talking about the real issues facing Kentucky,’ Ms Moore said before further bashing Ms Grimes. ‘Mitch McConnell is dedicated to running on the issues and challenges Alison Grimes to do the same.' Mr McConnell, a five-term incumbent, has made Barack Obama a focal point of his re-election campaign, trying to paint Grimes as a rubber stamp for a president who is widely unpopular in Kentucky. The NRSC has drawn the ire of Grimes supporters before, Politico noted. Only two months ago, a senior staffer called Ms Grimes an ‘empty dress’ who ‘babbles incoherently and stares blankly into the camera as though she’s a freshman in high school struggling to remember the CliffsNotes after forgetting to read her homework assignment.’ A recent poll showed both candidates in a virtual tie, the election will be held next year.","The tweet showed Alison Grimes' face photo-shopped on to a mid-riff flashing picture of 'Obama Girl'

A former security guard who posed as a wealthy investor to con £625,000 from a high-flying German businesswoman has been found guilty of fraud. Rizwan Butt, 45, tricked company chief executive Talke Stauss by pretending to be a go-between for a potential $1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund. Mrs Stauss, 46, held a series of business meetings with Butt at top London hotels The Dorchester and The Ritz - not realising the bachelor had been living with his mother in a £56,000 inner city terraced house in Longsight, Manchester. Charm: Talke Stauss, left, was duped by security guard Rizwan Butt, right, into paying a $1m deposit for a bogus investment . Modest: The home in Longsight, Manchester, where Rizwan Butt lived with his mother while posing as a billion-dollar investment adviser and renting a Bentley to visit top London hotels like the Ritz . She claimed that she was so in love with Butt that she believed his story. During the two month scam Butt went on 'a charm offensive' with his knowledge of finance, talk of introducing investors from the Middle East and of having a Swiss bank account. After one meeting he drove former semi professional tennis player Mrs Stauss back to her apartment in a Bentley and later professed his love for her. When he asked for a million dollars as a returnable 'security deposit' to clinch the deal, Mrs Stauss and her husband Roman, 44, agreed to transfer the money to Butt’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background. Trial: Mr and Mrs Stauss, who were conned out of £625,000, hid their faces as they left court . Roman Stauss, 44, said he knew paying a cash deposit was unusual but he agreed because Butt was from the Middle East . But the alarm was raised after Eddie George a fellow director at ATG Investment Managers Ltd found out about the deposit and was so worried, he himself researched Butt to discover he in fact ran a cleaning company with net assets of just £657. Mrs Stauss realised she had been duped when she returned from a business trip she had enjoyed with Butt in Shanghai with a plan to leave her husband - only to be faced by Mr George insisting her lover was a fraud. When Mrs Stauss asked for the money back, Butt - who had flown home early - sent a text message saying: 'Talke my dear. No problem my love. They should have it by five this evening. Take care love. Kisses.' Four weeks later when police caught up with Butt he was at the wheel of a black Audi Q7 carrying £1,000 in cash. He had recently bought a house for £175,000 and had a black Mercedes parked in the driveway. The Bentley turned out to be rented and before the scam he drove a 2003 Honda Accord. Before the scam, Butt worked as a security guard, lived with his mother and had bought his new house with a £30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends. Rizwan Butt, left, had claimed he had not conned Talke Stauss, right, and the deal fell through because her investment firm did not have a relevant trading licence . Fraud: The black Mercedes in which Rizwan Butt, 45, arrived at Manchester Crown Court . At Manchester Crown Court Butt, who is the sole carer to his mother who is 72 years old and undergoing cancer treatment, showed no emotion as he was convicted of fraud by false representation after jurors took an hour and 50 minutes to reach their verdict. He claimed the $1.5b deal would have gone through but it failed as ATG did not have a relevant trading licence. He will be sentenced on December 20 and faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing. Butt was granted bail on condition he surrenders his passport and does not contact Mr and Mrs Stauss.

An abandoned dog diagnosed with clinical depression has been nursed back to health - thanks to a course of acupuncture. Amber, a six-year-old mastiff cross, was emaciated and missing patches of fur with her eyes and ears covered in sores when her owner handed her to an animal rescue centre. Staff at K9 Crusaders in Bissoe, Cornwall, managed to treat her visible wounds but found the dejected pet's acute anxiety and depression far harder to fix. To the point: Abandoned mastiff cross Amber was treated for clinical depression with acupuncture by specialist vet Jennifer Williamson . They then decided to call on the services of vet Jennifer Williamson who specialises in animal acupuncture. Amber improved immediately with the first treatment and just six sessions later was a changed animal. Sanctuary volunteer Sue Smith said: 'Amber was in a bad way when we first took her to the vets and we were told she would need costly care for the rest of her life. 'That which meant it would have been difficult to re-home her so we decided to try acupuncture. Treatment: Amber, shown here receiving treatment, responded well to her course of acupuncture and her carers had seen a vast improvement after six sessions . Recovery: Following her acupuncture sessions, Amber no longer needs to take steroids or anti-depressants . 'Amber thankfully responded instantly, so much so in fact that when the first needle went in she dropped like a stone to the floor. 'Me and my colleague were so shocked we thought something was wrong - but she just relaxed immediately. 'From the first session she has continued to pick up and she is no longer on steroids or antibiotics. 'Not only did we see a vast improvement in her skin condition, but also in her demeanour and wellbeing. 'She's almost reverted to puppy-hood. She's gone from being a completely sad and dejected lost soul to a happy and excitable dog. 'She has the most gorgeous personality. She's a sensitive soul who craves affection.' Amber's acupuncture cost the charity £300, which was paid for with money from a grant from the Kennel Club Charitable Trust donated to help with vet's bills. The remainder of the money went to pay fees relating to the other 50 dogs in the centre's care. Sensitive soul: Staff at K9 Crusaders said Amber had a 'gorgeous personality' and craves attention . Animal acupuncture has been popular for years in Japan and is just starting to take off in the UK. Ms Williamson, of AcuVets in Redruth, Cornwall, says she uses the traditional Chinese treatment to cure depression in animals, and has also been successful with cats and horses as well as other dogs. She said: 'Amber was depressed, itchy and miserable. I recommended acupuncture as a way of boosting her immune system and calming the painful itching. 'I put one fine needle into the back of her neck and she immediately relaxed - so much so that she fell asleep for the rest of the session. 'Within four treatments Amber was off the drugs, her system supporting itself. Firm friends: Sue Smith of K9 Crusaders watches as animal acupuncture Ms Williamson treats Amber . 'By six treatments her skin and coat were beautifully healthy, and Amber herself, no longer so depressed, was having a second puppy-hood - lively, playing, running.' K9 crusaders, which looks after around 50 dogs at any one time, are now looking for a new home for Amber. Mrs Smith added: 'Amber's the first dog we've treated with acupuncture but the results have been fantastic. 'We get many dogs coming in who suffer from depression or psychological damage so we'll definitely be using acupuncture as a treatment more often. 'Amber's a one person dog - when someone shows her affection or kindness she gets exceptionally clingy. She would make a lovely dog for someone.' Following her dramatic recovery they plan to regularly use acupuncture which can only be carried out on animals by a qualified vet. The treatment has evolved from the ancient art of placing needles into special locations on the body and is used to alleviate pain, improve recovery rates and increase resistance to disease.","Mastiff cross Amber was emaciated and missing patches of fur .

A city high-flyer has been awarded a payout from banking giant Morgan Stanley after a tribunal ruled that he was unfairly dismissed from his £518,000-a-year job. Benjamin Price, who was forced to live on benefits of £71 a week after becoming unemployed, argued that he had sacked because he complained about being paid less than the firm had agreed. Today the East London Employment Tribunal ruled that his sacking was 'procedurally unfair', and ordered the American bank to pay Mr Price compensation. The trader was seeking a £1million payout, but the final amount of compensation has not been disclosed. 'We rule that the claimant was unfairly dismissed,' the tribunal panel said today. 'The claimant was employed from 1998 until his dismissal from redundancy, which involved the redundancies of other individuals. 'He claimed he was unfairly chosen for the redundancy process and the allegation was that when he had been in negotiations with Citibank, the respondent orally agreed to increase remunerations and increase his responsibilities. 'The dismissal was procedurally unfair. The respondent agrees to pay an undisclosed amount for unfair dismissal and there is no application for costs.' Mr Price dropped claims of breach of contract and whistleblowing after evidence emerged which suggested that Morgan Stanley's promise to match the pay packet he could have received at another bank was not legally binding. Mr Price, of Wimbledon, South London, said he had been headhunted by Citibank in 2010 and offered a deal worth $1.1million (£670,000) a year. But he agreed to stay at Morgan Stanley after his bosses promised to match the offer, he claimed. However, not only did his bosses fail to make good on the deal, they cut his wages from £533,000 to £518,000, he said. Mr Price, 39, had worked at Morgan Stanley for 14 years when he was made redundant in January 2012 . He was made redundant in January 2012 . after 14 years at the bank, having worked his way up from analyst to . senior trader in the company’s derivatives division. He said the culture at Morgan Stanley was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses. Mr . Price told the panel yesterday: ‘Despite my good performance, I was a . squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up. ‘This effectively was me signing my own . death warrant at Morgan Stanley. That was the deal,  $1.1million, they . offered when I turned down Citibank, and I would not just keep quiet . about it. I was made assurances by my senior manager at Morgan Stanley, . Craig Verdon, that they would match this offer. ‘I asked for a written contract from . Mr Verdon that he would match the $1.1million offered by Citibank, but . he told me due to the UK 50 per cent bonus tax at the time, he would not . provide one. ‘When I was . paid $850,000 [£518,000] the following year – not the deal agreed – I . was told there was not enough money to pay what was agreed.’ But . Citibank never put its offer in writing either, and was not ‘hammering . on his door’ to hire him, the tribunal heard. Mr Price told the tribunal he signed his own 'death warrant' with the company by complaining about pay . Thomas . Linden QC, representing Morgan Stanley, said Mr Price had never . received a written contract agreeing the new job or terms of the offer. During . a heated exchange, Mr Linden claimed: ‘The truth is you didn’t have an . offer to match. It is quite common for bankers at bonus time to say “it . isn’t enough”.

The war in Afghanistan may have brought progress in the medical field, but the international aid has not reached the remote villages of Afghanistan where traditional 'cures' sees patients imprisoned and forced to live on nothing but bread in stinking cells at the local shrines. The Mia Ali Baba shrine in village of Samar Khel, outside the eastern city of Jalalabad, is no different, and many locals still believe that the grim ordeal at the shrine will cure mental health problems, or as they see it, possession by 'evil spirits'. There are a myriad of reasons why the 'patients' are locked up at the shrine, a majority forced by family members, ranging from  depression to family arguments. A man named Din Muhammed explains that he has been chained up for 40 days over a fight with his father, but some of the unfortunate are never collected from the shrine and stay for six to eight months in the shrine. Not all survive, and their bodies are buried in the yard. Locked away: Abdul, aged 30, cannot explain why he has been chained to a wall at a holy shrine in the village of Samar Khel, on the outskirts of Jalalabad . ‘I had a big argument with my father,’ said Muhammed, a thin young man sitting on a dirty blanket with heavy chains around his ankles and wrists. ‘I took money from him to buy a motorbike. ‘I am very unhappy and I am angry at him that he put me here.’Muhammed, who says he has five war wounds after serving in the Afghan army, is incarcerated in a row of 20 miserable stone cells. The ceilings are low and damp, and there are no fans in the summer or heating in the winter. ‘The patient is kept in chains for 40 days on a diet of bread with black pepper,’ said Malik, the shrine supervisor. ‘He is given this to make bad spirits goes away. When someone is infected by ghosts, we read verses of the Koran, and married women without children give them amulets to make the spirits depart.’ ‘It has been the same for 360 years, and thousands of people have been cured.’ Ancient beliefs: The 'patients' are chained up for 40 days and forced to live on nothing but bread and water as their relatives hope the incarceration will 'cure' them of evil . Begging for help: A mentally ill Afghan man rests on the ground of his filthy cell Samar Khel's holy shrine, his hands chained and padlocked . Caged: There are varying reasons for why a person is locked up at the shrine, many suffer from mental health issues, while others have had a family argument . Visiting: Afghan children look on at a shrine, while a man in chains look out on the village of Samar Khel on the outskirts of Jalalabad . No escape: One of the mentally ill men smiles for the camera. Some of the 'patients' are never retrieved by their relatives and spend six to eight months at the shrine, some perishing as a result . At the end of the course, the ‘patients’ are given broth made from goat's head to complete the cleansing process. Those undergoing the gruelling regime appear in fast-deteriorating health and barely able to talk due to exhaustion. ‘I did not want to come, my brother forced me,’ said Abdul, in his 30s, in a weak voice, unable to explain why he was sent to the shrine. ‘They told me they would take me to a doctor and they took 5,000 Afghanis (£55) from my pocket for that. I feel dizzy and have headaches.’ Abdul's cell stinks of sweat and urine, and it is littered with trash and soiled linen. Children approach the cell to mock him, before running away laughing as he shakes in desperation. Shah Temor Mosamim, a doctor and director of a psychiatric hospital in Kabul, dismissed the shrine's treatment as ‘having no basis in scientific fact’. ‘No matter how aggressive a patient is, if you don't give him much food for 40 days, he will get quieter,’ Mosamim said. ‘In Afghanistan, there have been these traditional ways of treatment for mental patients, chaining them up in rooms or shrines. In some cases, patients are suffering from depression or mental problems.’ Few changes: Despite more than ten years of support and funding throughout the war in Afghanistan, medical progress has not reached the remote villages where tradition is king . Village life: An elderly man walks near the shrine, past the graves of 'patients' who have died while locked up to be 'cured' Trickery: Abdul's brother forced him into the shrine where he was told he would see a doctor and charged 5,000 Afghanis, approximately £55 before they chained him . The campaign group Human Rights Watch has called for the Mia Ali Baba shrine, named after a 17th-century holy man, to be closed and there is also concern from local rights activists. ‘This place should be shut down as its practices are not compatible with human rights,’ said HRW researcher Heather Barr. ‘Mental health treatment is at its basic stages in Afghanistan and unfortunately has not been a high priority for international donors in spite of the fact that many Afghans have experiences of serious trauma. ‘Rafiullah Bidar, of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, described how families leave patients to live in appalling conditions at the shrine. ‘They think that it is the last option... we cannot ignore it,’ he said. ‘These families are not satisfied with government medical services, that is why they rely on the shrine.’ ‘The environment that the patients live in is unhealthy, they defecate and urinate in their cells. I remember the stench and filthy environment when I visited.’ For Muhammed and Abdul, the greatest fear is that they have been incarcerated not to be cured, but to die. From their cells, they can see the rough graves of those who never left. ‘Some families do not come back for the sick who remain for six or eight months and sometimes die,’ said caretaker Mir Shafiqullah. ‘We bury them here.’","Afghanistan's medieval 'cure' for what local believe are evil spirits sees thousands locked away every year .

A runaway cow caused traffic chaos when it escaped from its field and ran loose on a motorway, evading capture for nearly three hours. It is the kind of sight you might expect to see on the streets of Pamplona but not on the fast lane of the A3, where motorists were stunned to witness the Highland cross heifer galloping along. They called 999 but the animal continued its journey for five miles before the police finally brought its adventure to an end. Moo-terway: The runaway cow, captured on camera by a shocked car passenger, caused havoc on the roads after it escaped onto a busy motorway and evaded capture for nearly three hours . The cow had escaped after being spooked, bolting out of its field in Farlington, near Portsmouth, charging through four fences, then onto a dual carriageway and then up a slip road onto the busy A3 (M) motorway. Drivers faced miles of tailbacks as officers tried to coax the out-of-control cow, which weighed around 60 stone, off the road and to waiting park rangers. Some worried motorists mistook the cow, with its large horns, for a raging bull and called the police. Startled passengers took photographs of the cow, which was also captured on Highways Agency cameras. Despite a two-and-a-half hour chase, the terrified animal was unable to be brought under control. As it was headed towards a school where the children were about to emerge from classes, the call was made to humanely shoot the cow before the afternoon’s rush-hour traffic kicked in, as she was deemed a danger to public safety. The stretch of road was closed to traffic while the animal roamed free on the usually busy stretch of motorway . The cow was shot dead by a police firearms officer after she left the motorway near Crookhorn, Hampshire for a golf course fairway. Russell Brown, animal rescue specialist for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was spooked, for whatever reason, and decided to run for it. 'Once they wind themselves up they can carry on and carry on.' The decision was made to kill the cow after it left the motorway and traipsed onto the 10th fairway of Crookhorn Golf Club - which is close to three primary schools. Mr Brown said: 'At that stage, because of conflicting reports, we were not sure if it was a Limousine bull. 'On advice from me, it was decided the best course of action would be to shoot it - to euthanise it. 'It was about 40 minutes from the three local schools packing up and it was a danger to human safety. 'Its temperament would not have allowed it to be easily corralled into a situation where it could have been calmed down.' The police are responsible for dealing with animal when they are loose in a public space. The RSPCA said shooting the animal on Tuesday was the most humane way of killing it to protect public safety.","Highland cross heifer travelled five miles up the A(3) motorway in Hampshire .

The prank by Mel Greig and her colleague Michael Christian in December last year was linked to the death of British nurse Jacintha Saldanha. Resigned: Radio DJ Mel Greig, left, has left her job after accusing the Australian radio station of failing to maintain a safe workplace following the prank call she made with colleague Michael Christian, right . Royal baby: The prank call was made to the King Edward VII hospital where The Duchess of Cambridge was treated for acute morning sickness shortly before her pregnancy was announced . Ms Greig and Mr Christian made a prank call to London's King Edward VII Hospital in December last year, where the Duchess was being treated for severe morning sickness. The presenters - pretending to be the Queen and Prince Philip - were put through to her ward by Bristol mother-of-two nurse Ms Saldanha, who took her own life three days after the hoax was widely publicised in the media. Jacintha Saldanha was duped by the prank call and put the DJs through to the ward . In a statement released in Australia, the Southern Cross Austereo said the dispute arising from the royal hoax had been ‘amicably resolved’ and Ms Greig had resigned, effective from December 31 this year. The company reiterated its position . that recording and broadcasting the fateful call was ‘not unlawful’ and . said 2Day FM decided to broadcast the call despite suggestions from Ms . Greig that it should be changed. In . a statement, Austero said: ‘Prior to the call being broadcast she made . suggestions for changes to be made to the recording of the call. ‘2Day FM decided that the call should be broadcast without alteration.’ Austero said Ms Greig intended to provide a statement to the UK coroner's inquest and that the station would co-operate fully. The inquest into Ms Saldanha's death has been opened and adjourned. The stunt drew widespread criticism with the the hospital's boss John Lofthouse saying: 'This was a foolish prank call that we . all deplore.'

This Gentoo penguin went to investigate a camera left in the snow by a geologist on Cuverville Island, in Antarctica. But the hungry bird was disappointed to discover it wasn't edible when it opened its red beak wide. Open wide: This Gentoo penguin went to investigate a camera left in the snow by a geologist on Cuverville Island, in Antarctica . The geologist was on a tour of Antarctica with G Adventures  which owns and operates the expedition vessel MS Expedition. The researcher left the camera near a penguin highway for a couple of hours which this clip is from. Cuverville Island is one of the largest Gentoo penguin colonies. A member of the expedition team posted the image on Twitter and wrote: 'This Gentoo #Penguin just ate our @GoPro. #Antarctica' Looks like as good a place for a snooze: A Gentoo penguin relaxes in the snow in Barrientos, Antarctica . Gentoo penguins have flamboyant red-orange beaks, white-feather caps, and peach-colored feet and  stand out against their drab, rock-strewn Antarctic habitat. These charismatic waddlers, who populate the Antarctic Peninsula and numerous islands around the frozen continent, are the penguin world’s third largest members, reaching a height of 30in and a weight of 12lbs. Gentoo parents, which often form long-lasting bonds, are highly nurturing. At breeding time, both parents will work to build a circular nest of stones, grass, moss, and feathers. The mother then deposits two spherical, white eggs, which both parents take turns incubating for more than a month. Members of the MS Expedition said they enjoyed a beautiful night camping at Neko Harbour, in Antarctica . Hatchlings remain in the nest for up to a month, and the parents alternate foraging and brooding duties. Like all penguins, gentoos are a bit awkward on land. But underwater they move gracefully. They have streamlined bodies and strong, paddle-shaped flippers that propel them up to 22 miles an hour, faster than any other diving bird. Adults spend the entire day hunting, usually close to shore, but occasionally ranging as far as 16 miles (26 kilometers) out. When pursuing prey, which includes fish, squid, and krill, they can remain below for up to seven minutes and dive as deep as 655ft. Gentoo numbers are increasing on the Antarctic Peninsula but have plummeted in some of their island enclaves, possibly due to local pollution or disrupted fisheries. They are protected by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and received near threatened status on the IUCN Red List in 2007.","Gentoo penguin discovered camera left in snow on Cuverville Island .

Pope Francis is assembling a panel of experts to advise him on sex abuse in the clergy, the archbishop of Boston said today. The panel will look at how to protect children from paedophiles, how to better screen men for the priesthood and how to help victims who have already been harmed. The creation of the panel was announced today following a meeting between the Pope and his cardinal advisors and will tackle the sexual abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church in recent years. Beacon of hope: Pope Francis is setting up an expert committee to investigate how to tackle sex abuse within the Catholic Church . Boston was the epicentre of the 2002 clerical sexual abuse scandal in the US and poignantly it was its archbishop, Cardinal Sean O’Malley, who announced the creation of the commission. The commission will be made up of international lay and religious experts on sex abuse, and is set to study current programs to protect children, better screen priests and to train church personnel, Cardinal O'Malley said. The findings will be used to suggest new initiatives for both the Holy See to implement inside the Vatican City State and for bishops to implement around the world, he added. To date, the Vatican’s involvement in the sex abuse crisis has been largely judicial in nature, with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2001 taking over church trials for priests accused of raping and molesting children. New ground: The commission, announced by Boston's archbisop Cardinal Sean O'Malley,  will be made up of international lay and religious experts on sex abuse, and is set to look at how to protect children from paedophiles, how to better screen men for the priesthood and how to help victims . Bringing change: Pope Francis, seen among an adoring crowd on Wednesday's Papal Audience in the Vatican, has been praised around the world for modernising the attitude of the Catholic Church . However, Cardinal O'Malley said he did not know whether one of the issue of how to hold bishops who shelter abusive priests . accountable would be studied by the commission. Advocates for victims of clerical abuse have long denounced the Vatican’s refusal to sanction bishops who shielded abusive priests and moved them from parish to parish rather than report them to police. ‘Quite frankly that’s something that the church needs to address,’ O’Malley said. ‘I’m not sure whether it will be this commission or the CDF (Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) or the Congregation for Bishops.’ The commission was announced just days after the Vatican submitted its responses to a U.N. committee monitoring its implementation of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Vatican dodged many of the committee’s questions about sex abuse by arguing that it is up to bishops and dioceses to implement programs to protect children, not the Holy See.","Pope Francis is creating a committee to tackle sex abuse in the clergy .

Found: The body of Mark Bamford, 67, was found three weeks after his stricken boat was discovered off the coast of Greece . The body of a British sailor has been found three weeks after his stricken boat was discovered off the coast of Greece. Mark Bamford, 67, had been missing since the start of October when he failed to rendezvous with partner Amanda Morgan in Syracuse, Sicily. The father-of-two, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, a life-long boating enthusiast and keen traveller, was sailing from Methoni in Greece to Syracuse when he, a fellow crewman and their 45ft trimaran, Pulau Tiga, disappeared. His body was discovered last Thursday, floating in the Adriatic, more than 280 miles from where the trimaran was picked up by a Russian cargo ship. There was no sign of the other sailor. Mr Bamford was taken to the nearest major port, Durres in Albania. An autopsy has been carried out in the Albanian capital, Tirana, and relatives are hoping to repatriate the body. The seven week search involved not only the Italian and Greek authorities but also Interpol, police forces in Britain and the coastguard of almost every country around the Mediterranean. Boats and planes had scanned the Med for weeks trying to trace the trimaran, and its two man crew - skipper Mr Bamford and an unnamed friend. Mrs Morgan, 65, from Brosdale Drive, Hinckley, had raised the alarm when the pair did not turn up to meet her as arranged in Sicily. She had travelled in a self-converted camper van, with pet dog Teddy, down to Syracuse and was expecting to join up with Mr Bamford sometime around October 10. Mrs Morgan said: 'I last spoke to Mark on a mobile on October 5.He had just left Methoni in southern Greece in the trimaran and was sailing across to Syracuse. 'He said everything was fine and the weather was lovely. It's about a 450 mile journey and it would take a sailing boat on average five days so when a week had passed and they had not arrived I started to get worried.' Happier times: Mr Bamford had been missing since the start of October when he failed to rendezvous with partner Amanda Morgan, pictured, in Syracuse, Sicily . Discovery: His body was discovered last Thursday, floating in the Adriatic, more than 280 miles from where the trimaran was picked up by a Russian cargo ship . Mrs Morgan, a grandmother of two, alerted the coastguard and by October 15 a full search and rescue operation was underway. She stayed in Sicily for three weeks, hoping for news but eventually decided to return home. On November 8 in Calais while waiting for the next day's ferry back to England she received a phone call saying the wrecked red and white trimaran had been found by a Russian cargo vessel, partially submerged near to Paxos, the smallest Greek island in the Ionian Sea. Both outer hulls had been ripped off, the wheel and mast were gone, puncture holes dotted the central hull and the rope was wrapped around the propeller. 'It was still a shock and I burst into tears,' said Mrs Morgan. 'From the damage reported I did doubt whether Mark was still alive. But I did still hold out hope. 'Then last Friday I had a visit from the police who told me Mark's body had been found off the coast of Albania. Arrangements: An autopsy has been carried out in the Albanian capital, Tirana, and relatives are hoping to repatriate the body . 'I think the reality of it only hit me then. To be honest I was not expecting him to be found but I am pleased that it was because it is closure. 'I just can't believe I will never see him again. We had some wonderful times on that boat and Mark was such an experienced sailor, what has happened seems unbelievable.' The couple met at Stoney Cove around 10 years ago after Mr Bamford, took up diving. A widow, Mrs Morgan said she was immediately intrigued and soon became smitten with this larger than life character. 'He was like no one else I'd ever met, very courageous, very strong and forceful. He was adventurous, he loved life, he loved travel and he loved sailing. 'He was originally from London and his family owned a large wooden skiff which they all used to holiday on. He learned to sail on that and from then always had a love of boats. 'He had a number of river boats and two sail boats before buying the Pulau Liga about 11 years ago. 'There were only three of her kind made and she was designed as a racing yacht.' The couple lived together in Brosdale Road, latterly spending more than half the year abroad, sailing around the Mediterranean, first Spain and Portugal then Greece, leaving the boat when they returned home. They had planned to begin exploring Sicily when Mr Bamford and the trimaran disappeared.","Mark Bamford, 67, had been missing since the start of October .

Cleared: Billy Murray thanked magistrates today after he was cleared of a speeding charge . Actor Billy Murray is used to appearing in court from his time in The Bill, but today he was the one making the defence. The 71-year-old, who also starred in Eastenders, was acquitted by magistrates after magistrates accepted his claim that he was not driving the vehicle. However, it remains a mystery who was driving his Ford Transit van when it was caught on camera traveling at 51mph in a 40mph zone in Laindon, Essex, this February. He admitted that he was in the habit of leaving a key inside the van underneath a floor mat so that other people could move it. During the hearing he told magistrates that he could not admit speeding as it would be a 'lie', since he was not driving at the time. Mr Murray, who represented himself, said: 'I used to leave the key under the mat in the van so it could be moved because it was often in the way.' After asking nine people who live in the area whether they had seen anything, he was still left none the wiser, the court heard. TV star: Mr Murray, pictured in 1997, played Detective Sergeant Don Beech in The Bill from 1995 to 2004 . Before leaving the court today, Mr Murray made a point of telling justices: 'Thank you and have a Merry Christmas'. Outside the building after the trial, he said: 'I'd like to say thanks to the court for seeing it my way.' He was found not guilty of failing to give information relating to the driver of the Ford Transit and the prosecution withdrew the speeding accusation.","Mr Murray appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court in Essex .

He first hit the headlines in the early nineties with . his books The Wrinkle Cure and The Perricone Prescription, which . claimed that a diet rich in salmon and berries could help you look . younger in just three days.

Ocado are introducing a Perricone food basket on their website, which means with just a few clicks all the ingredients can be added to your list and delivered together in your chosen time slot. This anti-inflammatory . diet, which is rich in lean proteins, antioxidants and essential fatty . acids, is said to be followed by celebrities such as Eva Mendes, Cate .

Dr Perricone believes that wrinkles, . lines, puffiness and sagging are a symptom of ‘inflammation’ at cellular . level, caused by poor diet, overexposure to sun, air pollution, and . other modern-day skin irritants. His . plan counteracts premature ageing by directly reducing cell level . inflammation through a special diet high in omega oils and other . nutritional wonder-foods, as opposed to Botox and surgery. Foods in his diet include salmon, tuna, turkey, olive oil, nuts, fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs. One of the key ingredients in the . food basket, which starts from £80, is salmon, which contains essential . fatty acids that help to dramatically reduce puffiness, increase . radiance and add firmness to the skin. Dr Perricone is so convinced by the power of salmon, he recommends you eat it twice a day, but you may substitute it for poultry or tofu if necessary.

Lorna Driver-Davies, NutriCentre Nutritional Therapist, said: 'My initial concern with this diet is the amount of salmon Dr Perricone suggests is consumed to achieve results. 'NHS advice says males and women past child-bearing age (or those who will not conceive) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week. Women of child-bearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week. 'This is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish, especially the heavy metal mercury which is toxic. As a nutritionist I would therefore not recommend someone eat this much salmon for any kind of diet. 'If they wanted to achieve the same effect, they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is certified as being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants. 'The rest of the diet is actually really good - particularly almonds, berries and plant oils such as olive oil - think how good Mediterranean skin often looks.'

A senior detective has warned parents to monitor the social networks their children use after three men were convicted of grooming girls as young as 13 and exploiting them for sex. Six girls in total were exploited by taxi driver Shakil Munir, 32, and Sakib Ahmed, 19, after they were groomed over Facebook and BlackBerry Messenger. Another man, Ateeq Latif, 17,  was found guilty of helping the commission of a child sex offence. Warning: A senior detective has warned parents to monitor their children's use of social networks after taxi driver Shakil Munir (left), 32, and Sakib Ahmed (right), 19, were convicted of grooming girls on Facebook and BlackBerry Messenger and exploiting them for sex . One of the young girls' mothers has called on other children to be careful . when using social networks, saying that her daughter had 2,200 friends . on Facebook, and described the site as a 'free for all'. Teesside Crown Court heard how taxi driver Munir had sent the 14-year-old girl hundreds of messages on Facebook, many of them explicit, one night after befriending her. He had picked up the child in his car, while she was in her pyjamas and slippers, and had sex with her in a lay-by off the A19. That same week, he took a 13-year-old to a 'chill-pad' flat for sex. Accomplice: Ateeq Latif, 17, was found guilty of helping the commission of a child sex offence after accompanying Ahmed on drives and leading off other girls so his friend would be alone with a young victim . Munir, who was thought to have many young 'friends' on Facebook was convicted of four counts of . sexual activity with a child and one of abduction - relating to driving . off with the 14-year-old. On the eve of the group's trial, Ahmed admitted sexual activity with a child, charges relating to five under-age victims. He used BlackBerry Messenger to contact his . victims, manipulating the girls into thinking he liked them, then . pressuring them for sex. He met one girl at an under-18s disco at a nightclub, and when she told him she was only 14, he replied: 'Pretend you’re 16.' He . grabbed her and kissed her roughly in the toilets. Later, when her . mother was driving her home, he began messaging her BlackBerry to set up . another meeting. He got her on a date and parked up near a field and pressured her into having sex. He would take girls out for a drive before pressurising them into giving him oral sex or full intercourse. Ahmed's friend Latif, 17, was convicted by the jury today of two counts of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence. He helped Ahmed by going along with him on drives, then taking one girl away for a walk to leave his friend alone in the car with a young victim. Judge John Walford agreed to lift a ban on the media reporting Latif’s identity which was in place during the trial. During the trial, Christopher Knox, prosecuting, said: 'This is not boyfriend-girlfriend, this is exploitation - exploitative relationships in which you have grooming.' The three men, all from Middlesbrough, were told they would be sentenced at a later date. Two other men, Ibrar Mahmood, 18, and Junaid Butt, 18, also from Middlesbrough, were cleared by the jury of all charges they faced. Awaiting sentence: Shakil Munir, who was thought to have many young 'friends' on Facebook, was convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of abduction - relating to driving off with a 14-year-old . After the case, senior investigating . officer Detective Inspector Dino Carlucci paid tribute to the bravery of . the girls who gave evidence. He warned parents to be vigilant about the dangers their children can face. 'This . has been an arduous and protracted inquiry for all involved and . particularly for the young victims, who I commend for having the . strength to see this through until the end. 'It . hasn’t been easy for them, or their loved ones, but hopefully now they . can put this behind them and look forward to bright futures. 'These men preyed on young, vulnerable girls by befriending them and securing their trust and then exploited it. Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Best was speaking after two Middlesbrough men were convicted of grooming girls as young as 13 for sex. A third man was found guilty of helping the comission of a child sex offence. Mr Best said: 'Child sexual exploitation is not a crime that is committed by one ethnic minority group. 'We have done some analysis locally and nationally and it's fair to say the biggest offending group when it comes to child sexual exploitation is white males. 'However with the high profile cases that there have been nationally, there also does appear to be a worrying trend in relation to the number of cases involving Asian males and that needs to be addressed. 'We shouldn't be afraid to say that. 'All communities, I am hoping, will come together to recognise this is a problem. 'It is all our jobs, as adults, to protect children.' After the first complainant came forward in January, Cleveland Police reacted by setting up a major investigation team, and up to 50 officers worked on Operation Fibre. The force was determined to learn the lesson of other child sexual exploitation cases around the country where victims were not initially believed. Mr Best said: 'In other areas the victims have come forward and have told people about their experiences and apparently they have not been listened to. 'In this case, after the first contact, we have gone looking and have encouraged victims and tried to support them, and have identified more suspects.' 'I . hope the verdicts send out a clear message to anyone involved in this . type of abuse and exploitation that we will catch up with you and you . will potentially be looking at going to prison. 'Grooming affects girls from all walks of life and different social backgrounds.

'If you don’t think they have the means to finance it, you must question yourself, and them.' The 14-year-old's mother said her daughter had become sexually promiscuous, taken drugs smashed up her home and refused to go to school after meeting Munir. Before twice-married Munir, who was born in Bradford and raised in Middlesbrough, came into her life, she never took drugs and only drank moderately, like many teens. But afterwards, she would go out all night and many times her mother has had to report her missing. 'She was putting herself in danger and had no respect for herself,' said the mother, who can not be named to protect her daughter's anonymity. The mother, who has a full-time job, advised other parents to closely monitor their children’s activities on Facebook. 'How do you keep them off networking sites when their life revolves around it? 'All the kids are on it and they lie about their age. 'It needs monitoring, there has to be structured protocols. 'My daughter had about 2,200 Facebook friends - it’s a free for all,” she said. 'Now she has deleted that account and has a new one, with just a handful of friends.' The mother said it was 'scary' how quickly Munir managed to groom the teenager online, having first made contact with her after he gave her and two friends a lift. After her daughter disappeared with him one night in January, the mother investigated his Facebook account and found hundreds of messages between the two. 'It was horrific, I couldn’t believe the filth,' she said. The mother advised: 'Kids need to be more careful, don’t just go on Facebook and add people as friends just because they associate with people you know. 'If you don’t know them as an individual, don’t add them. 'My daughter was angry, she blamed me for everything. 'But now she realises and she has closed down her old Facebook. 'She realises how dangerous it is, just adding strangers.'","Shakil Munir, Sakib Ahmed and Ateeq Latif convicted of sex offences .

Although the Queen usually plumps for simple black patent, the last year has seen her step out clutching bags in a rainbow of different hues and a variety of sizes.

'Launer continues to embrace more colour and design-led collections more than ever before, sales in colourful handbags have exploded both domestically and internationally this year,' added Gerald Bodmer, CEO of Launer.

Cooking wine isn't meant for consumption, but more and more teens are buying bottles of it to get drunk. According to CBS Philly, underage drinkers are increasingly turning to cooking wine for their alcohol fix because it isn't regulated by the liquor patrol board, meaning it can be purchased at grocery stores without an ID. Not only is this trend perpetuating underage drinking, but cooking wine is also very high in sodium, which can contribute to health problems like high blood pressure and kidney disease. Legal buzz: More and more underage drinkers are turning to cooking wine for their alcohol fix because it isn't regulated by the liquor patrol board, meaning it can be purchased at grocery stores without an ID . The sale of cooking wine isn't regulated because it is considered non-potable due to its large sodium content. Indeed, according to Emily Rubin, a dietician at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, a 12-ounce bottle contains almost one-and-a-half times the recommended daily allowance of sodium. But while the salty drink may not taste great, it can certainly get you drunk; most bottles have an alcohol content of around 17per cent, the same as a bottle of Cabernet. In terms of how drunk it gets you, . drinking a whole bottle of cooking wine is equivalent to drinking three . or four beers, says Ms Rubin. High salt content: Not only is this trend perpetuating underage drinking, but cooking wine is also very high in sodium, which can contribute to health problems like high blood pressure and kidney disease . What's more, the high level of sodium is likely to cause dehydration in the drinkers, which often leads to a bad hangover, according to Chemistry.com. Teens aren't the only demographic using cooking wine to get drunk. According to ForwardLookout.com, homeless and low-income people buy it, too, because it's inexpensive and is considered a food at the grocery store. This means that unlike other forms of alcohol, you can purchase cooking wine with food stamps .","A 12-ounce bottle of cooking wine contains almost one-and-a-half times the recommended daily allowance of sodium .

The career of one of the of the U.S. Navy's most experienced pilots may be sunk after his affair with a petty officer was revealed. Captain Jeffrey 'Chilly' Winter was the top pilot aboard the USS Carl Vinson, but was removed from his command on September 20 after Navy officials learned of his affair with the air wing's medical officer. Removal from a command post in the Navy generally is a career-ending moment. Top Gun: Capt. Jeffrey Winter was removed from command of the Vinson air wing on September 20 over an affair with the air wing's female medical officer . Winter's extracurricular activities with his subordinate only was revealed after the wife of a petty officer looked through files on a portable hard-drive her husband had brought home from work. The petty officer's wife told Navy investigators that she began snooping around her husband's hard-drive because she was 'extremely suspicious of her husband's activities on exercises and deployments due to past marital issues.' But the affair she discovered wasn't her husband's - it was that of his boss. In one of several emails released by the Navy under the Freedom of Information Act - first obtained by the San Diego Union-Tribune - Winter writes to his unidentified mistress, 'I was obviously missing the passionate, no-holds-barred aspects of my nature when I met you. You brought it alive in me.' He signed the email 'I love you a lot. Xoxoxo.' Floating fortress: The USS Carl Vinson was used to assist Haitian earthquake victims and to dump the body of Osama bin Laden in the Indian Ocean . In the emails Winter refers to the woman as 'Sugar.' According to an investigative report regarding the affair - in which the woman's name is redacted - 'Sugar' has since left the service. When questioned by Navy investigators, Winter did not deny the affair, and said it started in February of 2012, when he was a deputy wing commander. Winter told investigators that the affair ended in June of this year. In another email, Winter and 'Sugar' speak fondly of a stop in Perth, Australia, where the Vinson stopped for five days in April of 2012 in the middle of a six-month deployment. In one email, written in June, 'Sugar' wrote to Winter's Navy email account, 'I love you and miss you incredibly.' Winter is described in the report as a 'geographic bachelor' - he visited with his wife and family on weekends while stationed in California's Central Valley. Burial at sea: After he was killed by Navy SEALs, Osama bin Laden's body was taken to the Vinson for identification and burial at sea . The Vinson is one of the Navy's most prized possessions. It is widely believed to be the ship used to dump the body of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden into the Indian Ocean after he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. It also was sent to Haiti to assist in the country's recovery from the devastating 2010 earthquake. On the ship's Facebook page, it adamantly declares, 'loose lips sink ships.' Winter has logged more than 4,000 hours of air combat duty since he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1989. He as more than 800 successful carrier landings and served as instructor at the Navy's famed TOP GUN fighter pilot school in San Diego. After his removal from command aboard the Vinson, Winter has been found guilty of fraternization and adultery, both of which are crimes in the military justice system. At an October 4 administrative hearing, Winter was hit with a letter of reprimand, with a Navy official saying that further action was pending. Winter is just one of 20 Navy commanding officers to be removed from their post this year. Navy officials say they are publicizing these types of indiscretions in an attempt to hold officers to a higher standard.","Captain Jeffrey 'Chilly' Winter was one of the Navy's top pilots - serving as an instructor at the famed TOP GUN fighter pilot school - until an affair with an underling cost him his command post .

At three weeks old, this baby Asian elephant loves spending the day scampering around his enclosure in a bid to find his feet. But it seems the calf is still trying to get to grips with his tiny legs after he fell trunk-first into the mud when his feet got tangled up. Luckily, his doting mother was there in seconds to rescue her clumsy new-born and propped him back up on all fours before he ran off again. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unsteady: Three-week old Max looks a little wobbly while trying to stand up at Whipsnade Zoo in Dunstable . Unbalanced: The baby animal is still struggling to find its feet after entering the world and begins to slip as he runs around a log . Ouch! He falls trunk-first into the mud as his front legs give way . Most people think elephants are hairless animals - but the pictures of little Max show nothing could be further from the truth. Elephant calves are born with a lot of coarse hair on their heads and back, which they lose as they get older. It's not conclusively known why this head and back hair exists, although hair around the eyes and ears is usually for protection from elements and 'invading particles'. It could also provide an extra sense of touch to newborns, who rely heavily on their mother's presence for many years. It may just be a hangover of time in the womb. Elephant foetuses are covered in a felt of downy hair called 'lanugo'. Most of this is shed before birth. The longest hair on an adult elephant can be found in it's tail, which can grow to more than three feet long. The trunks is also covered in small sensory hairs that help in the animals 'feel' and identify objects. Baby Max was born on October 12 to . second-time mum Karishma at Whipsade Zoo in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. He has . spent the first few weeks of his life playing with the herd and rushing . around the seven-acre paddock. Zookeepers . say the 22-stone elephant has been a 'handful' ever since he was welcomed . into the world and sometimes needs a helping hand when he is on the . move. He was pictured having the ungainly moment at the zoo when his legs gave way while he was running around a tree trunk. Zookeeper Stefan Groeneveld, who is watching Max's development, said: 'He has come on so much in just three weeks and is already showing an independent streak. 'He’ll happily leave his mum’s side to go and play in the paddock with the rest of the herd. 'Karishma is proving to be an excellent mum and the other elephants are just so excited to be around Max. 'Elephants are very social animals and having youngsters joining the herd is what elephant life is all about.' Max shares Whipsnade’s seven acre paddock with nine other elephants – including brother George, aged three, and half siblings Donna, four, and Scott, two. Back up: Max's mother Karishma comes to his rescue within seconds and helps him back to his feet . Supportive: His doting mother has been keeping a close eye on him ever since he was born . Settling in: Max may have only been at the zoo for less than a month, but zookeepers say he is already loved by the herd and is very excitable . Mr Groenveld added: 'The herd love him, when he was first born they all wanted to see him and be with him. 'His younger brother Scott was nervous at first and stayed away with him but is now bullying him, which is a good sign. 'He runs around all the time, he is just full of energy at the moment. Eager: The speedy nipper was moving around on his feet within minutes of being born and is already amusing zookeepers as he gets to grips with his tiny trunk . By his side: Sometimes his mother needs to protect him a little bit more . Siblings: His half brother Scott, two, was uneasy with Max at the start, but is now bullying him which, according to zookeepers, is a good sign . Rascal: Staff at the zoo say the new-born is a 'handful' and does not seem to stop . 'He doesn't seem to stop at all so he is definitely a handful. The new arrival is an important addition to the European Endangered species Programme for Asian elephants because there are thought to be only around 35,000 left in the wild. Their numbers have declined by at least 50 per cent over the last three generations due to habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation.","Baby Max was playing at Whipsnade Zoo in Dunstable when he fell .

I never met the man but, on balance, I came to the conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill. 'I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion 20 years ago, or maybe 15.

Carl Packham added: 'Go home, Rod Liddle, you're an idiot.' Elsewhere on the microblogging site, users described Liddle as 'odious', 'vile', 'sick', 'offensive' and 'a pointless, unremarkable human'. Richard . Garside, director of the Centre For Crime And Justice Studies, used . Twitter to publish a 'Rod Liddle decision tree', which described him as . an 'attention seeking wind up merchant'. However, Liddle was not the only person to question the outpouring of coverage of Mandela's death on the BBC while parts of Britain are drowning beneath the worst tidal surges for six decades. Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford was also blasted on Twitter for criticising TV coverage surrounding the death - slamming the 'gargantuan montage' of the iconic leader being played on the news. The long jumper was tweeting about Channel 4 show 'What Happens in Kavos' at 10pm last night when news broke that the legendary South African leader had died. But responding to messages from some of his 138,242 followers telling him to watch the news, the 27-year-old launched a scathing attack on widespread coverage of Mandela's death. Remarkably, the ginger-haired Olympian - who won gold at London 2012 - even slammed fellow celebrities for jumping on 'the band wagon' by tweeting RIP messages. Rutherford tweeted: 'People, please stop telling me to put the news on. I am aware Mandela's dead, I don't need a gargantuan montage to remind me. Thank you.' He then added: 'Getting an onslaught of abuse because I don't want to watch the news? Good lord it's tragic Mandela is dead I know. 'But I refuse to jump on the band wagon and join the RIP tweeting. I've read news reports & that's enough for me thank you.' 'I just wanted to watch something else...' British Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford was also condemned on Twitter after he complained about the wall-to-wall coverage on TV of Mandela's death last night . Hundreds of Twitter users blasted Rutherford for 'lacking respect' for not paying tribute to the iconic leader. @Katehillsley tweeted: 'how insensitive..lost all respect for you after that! Go take a running jump...' And @Fahmida90 added: 'your lack of respect for the demise of a man who is held in the highest regards is shameful.' Another Twitter user, @Annax1603, said: 'I can't believe how rude he is tbh! #norespectwhatsoever' Defending himself after the barrage of abuse, Rutherford then tweeted: 'There is no disrespect. I agree with everyone the world lost an inspirational and great man. I just wanted to watch something else...' Bizarrely he then posted a picture of Paris Hilton's tweeted tribute to Nelson Mandela along with the comment: 'Ok can the abuse stop now?'","Liddle made the remark in blog post for right-wing magazine The Spectator .

Nick Clegg was yesterday accused of a betrayal on gambling reminiscent of his U-turn on tuition fees as Liberal Democrats refused to act to curb fixed odds betting machines. The Deputy Prime Minister had posed for pictures in March alongside campaigners trying to reduce the stakes and payouts on the machines where punters can lose £100 every  20 seconds. They have been dubbed the crack cocaine of the high street. But last night Mr Clegg and senior Lib Dem colleagues backed a government plan to keep the stakes and payouts of up to £500 the same. Nick Clegg with a betting curb campaigner in March but he has refused to act to curb fixed odds betting machines . Labour MPs had joined forces with the Stop the FOBTs (fixed odds betting terminals) group and the Campaign for Fairer Gambling to force a vote and urge MPs to throw out the plans. MPs voted by 322 to 231, a majority of 91, to approve a report by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which claimed there was no need to reduce the current maximum stake from £100. Campaigners want to reduce the maximum bet on the machines to just £2 in a bid to rein in high stakes gambling in bookmakers, who are allowed four terminals in each shop. Labour MP Tom Watson, who is campaigning to cut the stakes and prizes, said the behaviour of the Lib Dems was reminiscent of their willingness to be pictured signing a pledge not to increase university tuition fees – only to renege on that promise in government. The Mail published details yesterday of a report by the Gambling Commission watchdog which showed that profits have risen by approaching 50 per cent over four years on gambling machines in bookmakers. Tom Watson, who is campaigning to cut the stakes and prizes, likened the behaviour to the Lib Dems U-turn on increasing university tuition fees . Bookmakers dispute figures supplied by the Stop the FOBTs campaign that a total of £46billion is gambled on the machines each year. But they admit that the fixed odds machines yield profits of more than £1billion a year. Last night Dirk Vennix, chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers, said: ‘Problem gambling in the UK, by international comparisons, is very low. But one problem gambler is one too many for our industry and we are always looking at ways to increase player protection. ‘It’s why we introduced a new code of conduct recently which included a range of new measures to ensure responsible gambling. These include both voluntary limits and mandatory alerts on both time and money spent on a machine. ‘We believe a reduction in the maximum stake to £2 would have very little, if any impact on problem or illegal gambling but would devastate an industry which provides thousands of jobs up and down the country. ‘We remain determined to do all we can to help the Government and society tackle problem gambling. That is why we are devoting a significant amount of time, money and energy into addressing these concerns. We absolutely understand the responsibility on the industry to do everything it can to protect our customers.’ A Culture Department source said the Government would act ‘if there is evidence of harm’.","Nick Clegg posed for pictures in March alongside anti-betting campaigners .

Ministers are hoping to halt the creep of wind farms across the countryside by offering larger cash incentives to build them at sea. George Osborne has secured a 5 per cent cut in wind power subsidies amid increasing concerns about the hostility turbines have caused in rural areas, and to head off a revolt by Tory MPs. But the green levies paid to companies building them off the coast – and out of sight – will increase slightly in the coming years. Controversial: The turbines have caused hostility in rural areas . It does not mean there will be no new turbines on land, where there are already more than 4,000, but sources close to the Chancellor said that ‘protecting our natural environment’ was a key factor in the decision. Payments to unpopular large solar farms – but not household solar panels – will also go down. Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said the cuts were due to manufacturing costs falling. But Renewable UK, which represents the wind industry, warned ministers against making these decisions for ‘political reasons rather than economic ones’ and said some smaller community-led wind farms onshore would be ‘lost’ as a result. Household bills will not fall as a result of the changes yesterday, as other forms of green energy will now win higher subsidies. Guy Newey, of the Policy Exchange think-tank: said: ‘We must wean renewable energy off the subsidy drip.’ But . he called for the Government to scrap its target to generate 20 per . cent of energy from renewables by 2020, as it ‘pushes up bills and means . we aren’t cutting carbon emissions in the cheapest way’. Providers of green energy are given a . fixed price for every unit of electricity they generate, and prices for . the next five years were published yesterday by the Department of Energy . and Climate Change. The market price for power is around . £50 per megawatt hour, but the government says they need a subsidy to . compete with coal and gas. Onshore . wind, which was due to be paid £100 per megawatt hour (MWh) from next . year, will now get £95, going down to £90 by 2017-18. Solar farms will . get £120 per MWh, down from £125. But wind turbines at sea will get £155 . per MWh going down to £140 in three years’ time. 'Protecting our natural environment': Ministers hope the changes will mean more wind farms are built at sea . The Department of Energy and  Climate Change said: ‘This will  support the growth of the offshore wind industry.’ Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘Any slowing down in the rate of growth of onshore wind is good news.’ But the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the increase in subsidies for offshore wind – which is more expensive than nuclear power – was a ‘catastrophe for families struggling with their bills.’","George Osborne has secured a 5 per cent cut in wind power subsidies .

Warning: Steve Hart, a recent Unite political director, wrote the key report . Nigel Farage's anti-EU UKIP party has been condemned as ‘pre-fascist’ and ‘xenophobic’ in a secret report by Len McCluskey’s Unite union. The report accuses Ed Miliband of ‘pandering’ to Right-wingers, calls Ed Balls ‘deeply disappointing’, says Labour is not doing  enough to oppose the Government’s ‘austerity’ spending cuts and ‘prevaricated’ over fighting the so-called ‘bedroom tax.’ It praises ‘brave’ rebel Labour MPs who defied Mr Miliband by voting against new laws to force the unemployed to take jobs. It is scathing about the Labour leader’s decision to intervene in the row over claims that Unite tried to rig a Parliamentary selection contest in Falkirk, Scotland. And it reveals how Unite is to spend £10,000 on up to 100 Labour target seats, focusing on union- backed candidates – with the campaigns run by Unite ‘constituency captains’ – to try to gain more influence over Labour policies after the next Election. The document, seen by The Mail on Sunday, was written by Steve Hart, who has close links with the Labour leadership and was Unite’s political director until he left last month after a power struggle. Mr Hart is a former aide to Ken Livingstone and the son of the late Judith Hart, a Left-wing Cabinet Minister who served in Labour governments in the 1960s and 1970s. The confidential report, submitted to a meeting of Unite’s political committee, launches a highly provocative attack on UKIP leader Nigel Farage, warning Mr Miliband not to ‘chase’ his party’s votes. ‘The UKIP vote represents a dangerous, populist Right-wing vote which is swayed by anti-immigrant and anti-European rhetoric – and nostalgia for a comfortable world that never really existed,’ it states. ‘These are all the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements – which is not to say that UKIP is fascist, because it isn’t, but to point to the dangers of ignoring them and the issues or attempting to chase them.’ General Secretary of Unite union Len McCluskey is in the midst of a bitter dispute with Labour leader Ed Miliband over the Falkirk selection battle . Mr Hart adds: ‘The threat of xenophobic UKIP remains very real – in common with Right-wing populism and indeed fascism, which is growing dangerously across Europe.’ In the strongly-worded section on ‘anti-fascism’, the report deplores the ‘outpouring of racism’ over the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, adding: ‘Far too many, in the thrall of Islamophobia, sought to blame Islam. Yet rightly, no one blames Christianity for Jimmy Savile’s crimes.’ The disclosure of the report comes in the middle of a bitter dispute between Mr Miliband and Unite General Secretary Mr McCluskey over the Falkirk selection battle. The Unite-backed candidate, Karie Murphy, a close friend and ally of Mr McCluskey, was suspended from the Labour Party after claims that the union tried to rig the contest, a claim the union denies. It prompted Mr Miliband to order major changes in Labour’s links with the unions. Defiantly, the union’s ‘General Election plan’ says that ‘in spite of current frustrations and anger’ in the wake of the Falkirk row, its ‘strategic purpose and direction remain clear’. Slur: Nigel Farage's UKIP party supporters are described as dangerous . It makes no attempt to conceal its lukewarm support for Mr Miliband, stating: ‘The worst Labour government is better than the best Tory government.’ It gives details of Unite plans to run its own campaign ‘cells’ in 100 Labour target seats, which will provide supporters with resources, including clothes. ‘Unite will build a structure based on one Constituency Captain and field organisers. The Constituency 10 will have responsibility for organising 10 contacts with each Unite member in the seat 20 months before the Election.’ The document makes it clear that despite its setback in Falkirk,  it remains determined to get as many pro-Unite Labour candidates as possible, and in secrecy,  if necessary. ‘Our work in selections is a bit like a swan, all that can be seen is indication of support here or there, while below the water, activity is furious.’ It says the activities of Unite’s political department is ‘dominated currently by candidate selection matters’, and it adds: ‘We  have had to park some areas of  work temporarily – selections wait for no one.’","Scathing report written by former Unite political director Steve Hart .

Senior Conservatives have warned they could lose the independence referendum in Scotland because its campaign chief Alistair Darling is ‘useless’ and ‘comatose’. Momentum is even building up behind getting Gordon Brown to return to frontline politics to lead the campaign. There are fears that the Better Together campaign has no ‘fire in its belly’ and could end up being outfoxed by Alex Salmond’s nationalists. Senior Conservatives have warned they could lose the independence referendum in Scotland because its campaign chief Alistair Darling is 'useless' and 'comatose' One Cabinet minister said: ‘We could be in real danger, we are not in any way complacent about this. The independence side have an easier sell.’ The source said there was even talk of the former Prime Minister Mr Brown being brought ‘out of self-imposed exile’ to lead the campaign. ‘We have to remember he is more popular in Scotland than he is in the rest of the country. But God help us if it takes Gordon to win the referendum.’ Labour’s own anti-separation campaign, United with Labour, is using Mr Brown as its frontman. Sources said he would be ready to play a starring role in the main campaign if called on to do so and has already spoken about the economic stumbling blocks for an independent Scotland. Momentum is building for Gordon Brown to return to frontline politics to lead the campaign . Another member of the Tory high command said they blamed Mr Darling, the former Labour Chancellor, for the lacklustre campaign. ‘Alistair Darling has never run a campaign. He is comatose most of the time.’  The source added that he had a ‘gut feeling’ that the no camp could lose. Another senior parliamentary party figure said he thought Mr Darling was ‘useless’. The Tory said that the no campaign should have used the Education Secretary Michael Gove - who is Scottish - or Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ‘He’s not a very good communicator,’ he said of Mr Darling. ‘You need someone like Gove or Hunt, but it’s difficult because the head of the pro-union campaign has to be a Labour figure - it’s hard for a southern English Tory to criticise him publicly.’ While Mr Darling was seen as a credible Chancellor, his low-key personal charm has rattled senior Coalition figures. Supporters of Mr Darling insist that he has been doing a ‘steady’ job. ‘There has been no spike in the polls for the Better Together campaign since the white paper was released last week.’ The 670 page document set out the nationalist’s vision for a separate Scotland. The Tories have just one MP in Scotland and some have privately wondered if the party would be better off electorally if it did become independent. There are fears that the Better Together campaign has no 'fire in its belly' and could end up being outfoxed by Alex Salmond's nationalists . Another Better Campaign source said: ‘This is just nonsense. If you want any evidence as to why it is nonsense, you need only look at the work that Better Together - and Alistair Darling in particular - did last week to dismantle the nationalists’ white paper. 'The polls today show that support for Scotland leaving the UK is lower than it was when our campaign started.’ But the Tories themselves are largely unpopular north of the Border. David Cameron has refused to submit himself to one-on-one television debates with the Scottish First Minister ahead of the September 2014 referendum. The Prime Minister made his last major speech on Scotland in Edinburgh in February 2012. A Number 10 source said: ‘We are baffled by this. We do not recognise these concerns at all.' A Tory source added: ‘When we were casting around for a figure to lead this, we could think of no one better than Alistair and that remains the case. 'This was meant to be Salmond’s big week and they are no better placed in the polls than before the white paper.’","There are fears that the Better Together campaign has no ‘fire in its belly’

Lindsey Vonn, the reining Olympic downhill ski champion, had to be carted off a mountain in Colorado this morning after she crashed during a practice run. Vonn's accident comes just three months before the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February. Vonn, 29, had been rehabilitating her surgically-repaired knee after she tore her ACL in a crash at the World Championships in Austria in February. It is unknown whether she re-injured her right knee or whether the injury is severe enough to keep her out of the Olympics. Lindsey Vonn won two medals at the Vancouver Olympic Games in 2010 - including a gold in the downhill skiing event. Her performance on the world stage turned her into an international superstar . Vonn is helped of the slopes by two trainers after she crashed this morning during a practice run as she trained for the Olympics. She was later taken off the mountain in a sled . Vonn, pictured here earlier this month, has been training hard in an effort to recover from her February injury and be back in shape in time for the Sochi Olympics . U.S. Ski Team spokesman Tom Kelly said Tuesday that Vonn is being evaluated at a hospital after being taken off the slope at Copper Mountain, Colorado, on a sled. 'We have no reason to believe it's anything significant right now,' he said. The four-time overall World Cup champion tore her ACL and MCL in a crash at the world championships in February. She has been aiming to return to Word Cup competition next week in Beaver Creek, Colorado. She won the gold medal in downhill skiing and a bronze in the Super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Games. Before that, she won three consecutive World Cup titles - 2008, 2009 and 2010. She won a four in 2012 and became only the second American woman in history with four World Cup championships. Vonn posted this picture of one of her practice runs on Instagram on Monday. She had been pushing herself to regain her form after her ACL surgery . Vonn made an appearance in at the Brocos game in Denver Sunday with boyfriend Tiger Woods . Her victory in Vancouver turned her into an international superstar in the sport of alpine skiing. If she is unable to compete in Sochi, the U.S. Ski Team would lose one of its foremost athletes and the U.S. Winter Olympic Team would lose one of its biggest stars. On Monday she tweeted a photography of herself on the slopes with the message: 'Catching some air today in Downhill training.' With her knee feeling so good - she was months ahead of schedule - Vonn thought about pushing up her return to competitive ski racing to the season-opening race in Soelden, Austria, late last month. But, she changed her mind and skipped it to train even more. Vonn recently said her super-G is 'some of the best super-G I've ever skied, but my downhill still needs a little more time.' She's been training at the team's speed center in Copper Mountain. The 29-year-old Vonn showed up on the sideline Sunday night for the Chiefs-Broncos game with boyfriend Tiger Woods.

A furious coalition row erupted last night, with the Liberal Democrats accusing Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove of 'lying' about a flagship policy to give children free school meals. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced £150million to to build and extend kitchens to cope with the expected demand for the scheme to give free hot lunches to every child under the age of seven. But the Department for Education claims an £80million underspend in schools maintenance budget earmarked for the work does not exist, which the Lib Dems dismissed as 'b*******'. Clash: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insists the free school meals will boost attainment but Education Secretary Michael Gove hoped to spend the money on more free schools . A total of 1.8million children in England in reception, year one and year two will benefit from the free school meals from next September . More than 1.8million children in reception, year one and year two will benefit in England will be given free school meals from next September, saving parents . more than £430-a-year. After many headteachers and . governors warned they did not have kitchens and dining halls big enough . to offer cooked meals for every child, £150million has been found for . building work to expand. Mr Clegg said £70million of this will be new money from the Treasury and around £80million will be from unspent DfE maintenance budgets. Some £70million has come from the Treasury with £80million from unspent maintenance funds within the DfE. But a DfE source said: 'There is no spare money in either the basic needs or maintenance budget to pay for Clegg's kitchens.' It was suggested the money would be taken from funds used to provide extra school places. But furious Lib Dems hit back, insisting the policy had been agreed by David Cameron and George Osborne, and Mr Gove's ministry should fall into line. Senior Lib Dem source . 'The DfE are talking b*******,' a senior Lib Dem source said. 'Gove and the DfE had their eye on the underspend for free schools... which I think explains the slight bitterness from the DfE in some of the briefing. 'What we are seeing from DfE is them going rogue. They are completely out of step. 'It is time for them to stop whining and get behind a policy that they are going to have to deliver. The DfE are lying if they say there is no money. 'The Deputy Prime Minister wants the DfE now to row back and get with the rest of the government in backing a popular, innovative and exciting policy.' Downing Street then made clear that it was Tory Mr Gove's department that were out of line. 'The position is absolutely the one the DPM's office have set out,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. Mr Clegg joined children for lunch at Walnut Tree Walk Primary School in London to promote the scheme . The . policy has also been criticised by some senior Liberal Democrats for . offering free lunches to even the wealthiest parents of young . schoolchildren, while denying up to poor families whose children are . older. The decision to spend £600million-a-year on the meals was first announced by Mr Clegg at his party conference in September. Yesterday he revealed it is new money from the Treasury into the budget of the Department for Education. Chancellor George Osborne will use tomorrow’s Autumn Statement to reveal how the money has been raised. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . Mr Clegg said: ‘Early on I made it . very clear that universal free school meals would be my personal . priority in this Autumn Statement and I’m proud that we are now . delivering it. ‘From the start of the next school year, every single infant school pupil will be able to sit to down to a free school lunch.’ He said the extra £1billion over two years will ‘ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day’ and also make sure ‘that schools are not left out of pocket’. He went on: ‘Every child deserves the best possible start in life, and at the same time we are doing all we can to help ease the pressure on household budgets. ‘This not only encourages positive eating habits and helps improve concentration and performance in the classroom, but this will also mean significant savings for families. ‘Providing universal free school meals will help give every child the future they deserve, building a stronger economy and a fairer society.’ Mr Clegg has previously boasted of securing the £600million to fund the policy in a deal which will see the Tories offer a £150 tax break to some married couples. Where the idea of free school meals was piloted, pupils who had the hot lunch were found to be on average two months ahead of children who did not. The Lib Dem leader insists the policy will increase attainment and make pupils healthier . The poorest children saw the biggest improvements in their academic achievements, with a 23 per cent increase in the number of children eating vegetables at lunch and an 18 per cent drop in those eating crisps. Being given a free lunch also saw between three and five per cent more children reaching target levels in maths and English – more than the 3.6 per cent rise seen after the introduction of a compulsory literacy hour in 1998. The current free school meals scheme for underprivileged children in England costs £428million every year. A school food review by Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent, founders of the Leon restaurant chain, recommended that Government offer free meals to all primary school children. Extending it to all pupils up to the age of 11 would cost £1billion; the entire education budget is £57.2billion. Sir Nick Harvey, former Lib Dem defence minister, has repeatedly criticised the scheme for not being targeted at those most in need. ‘Some 1.2 million children living within the Government’s own definition of childhood poverty do not get a free school meal,’ he said recently. ‘Why do the Government consider it a higher priority to give free school meals to all five, six and seven-year-olds, 1.3 million of whom can perfectly well afford to pay?’","Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announces £600m free meals policy .

Mark Lyall-Grant, British ambassador to the U.N, is calling for members of the Security Council to sign a resolution banning the payment of ransoms . Terrorist cell al-Qaeda has made £50million in ransom payments from kidnaps in the last three years, according to the British UN ambassador. Mark Lyall Grant, the UK Government's representative in New York, revealed the shocking statistic as he attempts to persuade members of the United Nations security council to sign up to a blanket ban on the deals. His claims were backed up by a top UN diplomat who said that ransom payments were now the biggest source of income for Northern Africa's al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula. Mr Lyall Grant is now urging member states to sign a resolution which calls on all countries not to pay ransom to kidnappers who use the money to finance terrorist groups. The Ambassador circulated a draft resolution to the council on Tuesday calling on the 193 nations to 'prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments.' A U.N. resolution adopted weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States already bans all countries from financing terrorism. But Lyall Grant said the proposed new resolution highlights 'the increasing threat' from kidnapping for ransom to benefit terrorists. He said: 'We want to make it much more difficult for terrorists to benefit from this sort of financing.' Lyall Grant hopes the Security Council of 15 members will approve the resolution this month. The British resolution follows up on the communique issued by leaders of eight major industrial powers at their summit in Northern Ireland in June. The G-8 expressed their concern at 'the increasingly fragmented and geographically diverse threat posed by terrorist groups including al-Qaida and its affiliates' and 'the threat posed by kidnapping for ransom by terrorists.' While the international community has made 'significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations', the G-8 estimated that al-Qaida-affiliated and other Islamist extremist groups worldwide have collected tens of millions of dollars in ransoms since 2010. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb emir Mokhtar Belmokhtar, above, masterminded the an attack which saw 41 foreigners taken hostage at a gas field in eastern Algeria . Former French hostage Daniel Larribe is greeted by family members after being taken prisoner by al Qaeda linked forces in Niger. The circumstances surrounding Mr Larribe's release were unclear . 'Payments to terrorists from Sahel to the Horn of Africa helped fuel instability in the region, and contributed to large scale attacks,"" the communique said. The G-8 added that ransom money also supports recruitment efforts and improvements in the operational capability of terrorist groups . The leaders of the U.S., Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan said they 'unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists'. Britain have held face-to-face talks with the Syrian Islamist rebels currently embroiled in fighting   Bashar al-Assad. Included in the meetings were representatives from hardline groups demanding the implementation of Sharia law in the war-torn country. Representatives from other western nations joined the Brits in the talks which took place in Ankara, Turkey. The Western allies are closely monitoring the progress of the al Qaeda linked forces who are growing in strength and now have control over large parts of Syria. They have previously backed the secular Syrian Free Army and are hoping that those rebels can form an alliance with other non-Jihadist factions as they bid to topple the Syrian leader. But the allies have been reluctant to show their support in the form of funding or the provision of arms, for fear that weapons could fall into the hands of al Qaeda. The decision to hold talks with hardline Islamist factions marks in approach by Western nation, who have until recently, exclusively dealt with groups who share their opposition to al Qaeda operations. The G-8 urged the Security Council to consider a new resolution 'to increase international awareness of the threat of kidnapping for ransom, and ... to address and mitigate the threat.' A U.N. diplomat said there has been an upward trend in the overall number of kidnappings by terrorist groups, and an average of over $2 million is being paid per foreign hostage. The draft resolution only addresses ransom to finance terrorism - not criminal kidnapping for ransom or piracy for financial purposes.","Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant is calling for ban on ransom payments .

A man convicted 21 years ago of child abuse involving satanic rituals at a day care he ran with his wife was freed Thursday amid questions about the evidence in the case. Dan Keller was released on bond barely a week after the release of his now ex-wife, Fran. The Kellers were convicted and sentenced to 48 years each in 1992, after therapists testified that they helped three children recover memories of satanic rituals and sexual abuse at an Austin preschool the couple operated out of their home. Free: Dan Keller, 72, was released from jail on Thursday after spending 21 years behind bars for child abuse which he claimed he never committed. His ex-wife was released from her charges last week . The only physical evidence came from an emergency room doctor who testified that internal lacerations on one child were evidence of abuse. But in court documents filed earlier this year, Dr. Michael Mouw says what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology. That prompted prosecutors in Travis County, which includes Austin, to agree that the case's evidence was faulty and release the couple on bond. Freed: Frances Keller, 63, pictured, was released on bond on November 26 . The couple, who have always maintained their innocence, hope that appeals courts will now exonerate them. Mr Keller, 72, was met outside the county jail by his ex-wife, 63, who was released November 26. The pair - who divorced while in prison, but who remain close - hugged warmly. Dan Keller told reporters he wasn't bitter and planned to spend his first moments of freedom grabbing a cheeseburger. Dr Mouw said in an affidavit . presented to court this year that he had little training at the time on . how to examine sexual abuse in children and came to the wrong . conclusions in examining a child in the Keller case. 'While . my testimony was based on a good faith belief at that time, I now . realize my conclusion is not scientifically or medically valid, and that . I was mistaken,' he said in the affidavit. The Kellers were convicted of . sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care and faced accusations . of dismembering corpses, putting blood in Kool-Aid and flying children to Mexico where they would be sexually abused by soldiers. Mouw provided the only physical evidence in the case, telling the jury that lacerations on one of the alleged victims was indication of sexual abuse. He later learned that those slight lacerations were actually normal physiology. 'There is a reasonable likelihood that (the medical expert's) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated Frances Keller's right to a fair trial,' said Rosemary Lehmberg, the district attorney for Travis County, which is located in central Texas and includes the city of Austin. Day care center: Here is the home and former day care center owned and run by Fran Keller, who was swept up in a national hysteria over satanic ritual abuse . Fran . Keller's attorney, Keith Hampton, said: 'The case was a true witch hunt . because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a . wide satanic conspiracy.' He said the therapist's techniques — . which were used to convince the children, parents and investigators that . the Kellers committed human sacrifices, sexually abused them with pens and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked. The Kellers were sentence after just a six day trial, according to KUT. The couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who . were accused of being part of a group of Satan worshipers who engaged . in ritual child abuse across America during the 1980s and 1990s. Free: The couple have always maintained their innocence and even the children who initially claimed the couple sexually abused them and served them blood-laced Kool-Aid have retracted their testimony .

Like millions of tech fans around the world President Obama would reportedly love to get his hands on a shiny new iPhone 5 for Christmas, but sadly for him his security advisers won't allow it. Obama is instead being forced to carrying on using his trusty, yet now rather out-of-date, Blackberry device which is strictly limited to just 10 email contacts. Speaking to a group of young people at the White House during a pitch for his healthcare reforms Obama quipped: 'I am not allowed, for security reasons, to have an iPhone'. Tech savvy: President Obama taps out a message on his Blackberry last . month. He will be using the trusty device for some time to come after being told he cannot have an iPhone for security reasons . The President said that both his daughters Sasha and Malia had iPhones and that they 'seem to spend a lot of time using them'. Obama . famously managed to keep hold of his Blackberry after his . inauguration in 2009, despite saying his security advisors would 'pry it . from his hands'. But the . earlier-generation smartphone has been locked down with only 10 people . reportedly having access to his personal email account. Neither George W. Bush nor Bill Clinton used email during their presidencies. Apple fan: President Obama checks his iPad during the East Asia Summit in November last year. He was reportedly gifted one of the tablets by Apple founder Steve Jobs . Obama is a known fan of the Apple iPad having been gifted one of the tablet devices but none other than Steve Jobs himself. Although the exact reasons for denying the President an iPhone have not been released, it is feared such a high-tech device would pose a threat to both his personal and national security. Even if he were not using the device to tap out any politically sensitive messages, if successfully hacked, it could act as a beacon and give away his real-time physical location. Germany's Der Spiegel newspaper claims to have seen documents that revealed NSA agents loved the iphone because of sketchy scripts that allowed them to spy on 38 different features within the operating system. Owing to a stronger encryption processes Blackberrys have enjoyed a better reputation for security than both Apple and Android. In addition to this the President's Blackberry is limited to only 10 email contacts and is rumoured to have been heavily modified. One . theory however is that the National Security Agency are particularly well aware of . the problems with the IPhone's security because they have exploited them . as part of their clandestine PRISM surveillance program. Apple was one of several tech companies . that may have allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) direct access . to servers containing customer data, according to revelations by former . NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The companies deny the allegation. BlackBerry, a Canadian company formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd, virtually invented the idea of on-the-go email, but lost its market stranglehold as rivals brought out more consumer-friendly devices, like Apple's iPhone and phones using Google's Android software. The company recently halted plans to be sold and is trying to chart a new course by focusing on large business and government clients. A spokesman for Kaspersky security software said: 'In the uneasy times of rapidly growing cyber-espionage attacks, there is no wonder why governments and high-profile institutions tend to be very careful and adopt strict security procedures. 'At this point, it appears a necessity to do a thorough security check of every single device that will be used to hold or transmit sensitive data, before handing it over to the high-profile government official, such as the President. 'There are two main vectors of risk; one is the software insecurities and vulnerabilities, that could be used by attackers to gain access to the device (e.g. in order to steal data, install spyware application, etc.); the second is the possibility of hardware backdoors or suspicious firmware changes, that could have been made to the device at the factory level. 'Auditing and approval of new devices must take into account all these concerns. This is especially true for high-profile organizations. Nevertheless, the White House's movement doesn't necessarily mean that there is a serious security issue with iPhone in general.'","Obama was speaking at White House during a pitch for healthcare reforms .

Residents in the upper U.S. Midwest need to finally get rid of their traditional 'cannibal sandwiches', according to government health officials, following a 40-year history of food borne illnesses linked to the curious appetizer and over a dozen recent outbreaks. A recent report issued by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed four cases of people eating the bloodied ground beef concoction have been tied to E.coli bacteria, along with 13 other likely cases. Gobbling up the raw beef spread with onions also led to more than 50 sicknesses in Wisconsin in 1972, 1978 and 1994, with numerous other unconfirmed reports. E.coli bacteria can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps and, in the most severe cases, kidney failure. Yummy?: Cannibal sandwiches - raw ground beef with onions on rye or cocktail bread popular in the U.S. Midwest - have been linked to over 50 illnesses since the 1970's, with over a dozen recent cases . The CDC urged retailers to discourage customers from consuming raw ground beef, which it said should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit . This is how it's done: A Midwesterner shows people how to make (and eat) a controversial Cannibal Sandwich in a YouTube video . The meat responsible for each of the most recent cases - which occurred over the 2012 winter holiday season - came from a market in Watertown, Wisconsin. The market was later forced to recall more than 2,500 pounds of meat. Also known as 'tiger meat', 'steak tartare' or a 'raw dog', Cannibal Sandwiches are usually a simple dish of lean ground meat seasoned with salt and pepper on rye cocktail bread, that is served with sliced raw onion, said Milwaukee historian John Gurda, who served it at his 1977 wedding reception. Occasionally, a raw egg will be mixed with the meat. Cannibal sandwiches have been a festive dish in German, Polish and other ethnic communities in the Milwaukee area since the 19th century. The 66-year-old said it was once common to see them at wedding receptions, meals following funerals and Christmas and New Year's Eve parties. The dish has become less common in recent years with greater awareness of the risks of uncooked meat and fewer people eating beef, but Gurda said he still runs into it. 'It's like a coarse pate and when you put the onions on, there's a crunch as well and that kind of cuts the softness,' he said. The how-to guide: A demonstrator on YouTube shows how to make a cannibal sandwich using ground beef, rye bread and raw onions. A holiday tradition in Wisconsin, health officials say the appetizer is not safe to eat . According to cannibal sandwich lovers, raw onion is key because it adds crunch. The tradition became popular in the 1970's and has been making people sick ever since, say health officials . The holiday snack were popular at wedding receptions and wakes, according to a Wisconsin historian . Keith Meyer, who runs L&M Meats, a Kenosha butcher shop started by his father, recalled his German grandfather and other 'old guys' gobbling the ground beef when he was growing up. With his grandfather gone, Meyer's family no longer serves the dish, but the 57-year-old said that it's not bad 'if you get by the texture of it'. 'It's like eating a cold hamburger that's a little on the raw side,' Meyer added. His butcher shop sells 50 to 100 pounds of freshly ground round on Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and perhaps a day before those holidays to people wishing to make cannibal sandwiches. Glenn's Market and Catering, the Watertown butcher involved in the recall, does a similar holiday business, vice president Jeff Roberts said. Both stores label their ground beef with warnings about consuming raw or undercooked meat, but the men said it's unlikely people are buying it to cook. With the fat trimmed off before grinding, the meat is too lean to make a decent hamburger, Meyer said. Carol Quest, director of the Watertown health department, said its investigation found no health or other violations at Glenn's Market. It's hard to say what happened to the meat once it left the store, she said. 'The big message is that people need to cook their food properly and make sure they're taking temperatures of their meat,' Quest said. Ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a food thermometer. The state health and agriculture departments issued a warning Thursday telling residents to avoid cannibal sandwiches, and Quest said her department plans one as well. Its investigation into the E. coli outbreak, which included interviews with more than 50 people who ordered meat from Glenn's, found some weren't aware of the dangers but others felt safe because they'd eaten the dish before with no ill effects, she said. Symptoms of an E. coli infection include stomach cramps and diarrhea. It can lead to kidney failure, particularly in the elderly, children and people with weak immune systems.","'Cannibal sandwiches' - raw ground beef with onion on rye bread or crackers - became a popular snack in the early 1970's at wedding receptions and Christmas and New Years Eve parties in Wisconsin .

Kennedy put himself in charge of helping shape his brother's legacy after JFK's assassination in November 1963 . Previously sealed papers now reveal how Robert F. Kennedy and the rest of his family balanced the stream of international condolences they received after President Kennedy’s death while also parsing through the practical issues like what kind of grave he should have. The documents that the Kennedy library opened to public viewing on Thursday were only a few of the thousands from Robert Kennedy's tenure as attorney general. 'The accomplishments of presidents in office are usually measured in rather exact terms, but your brother gave the country something immeasurable and almost indescribable, for which we all will be forever grateful,' wrote author E.B. White in a December 24, 1963 letter to the attorney general. Artist Andrew Wyeth and author Thornton Wilder- who along with White had been recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963- also wrote letters of condolence. Bobby Kennedy often used short letters to express his gratitude for expressions of sympathy, such as one sent to James A. Wechsler, editorial page editor of the New York Post, thanking him for a series of articles after JFK's death. 'I just wanted you to know how much he would have appreciated them - I think as much as anyone could do you captured what he was,' Kennedy wrote in the letter, dated February 4, 1964. A series of correspondences from John Carl Warnecke, the architect who designed JFK's gravesite, reveal how intimately involved Robert Kennedy was in planning his brother's permanent memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Close: Jack and Bobby (seen here with their brother Ted, right) worked together as Bobby was the President's Attorney General and continued the post after his death . In a letter dated December 20, 1963, Warnecke asks RFK for the 'benefit of your thoughts and ideas.' Robert Kennedy appeared to make his general vision of the memorial known in a one-sentence memo from February 21: 'I hope that whatever they do is simple and conservative.' Correspondences from presidential chronicler and Kennedy confidante Theodore White speak to some of the delicate issues stemming from what would be the inevitable spate of books and movies of the president's life. 'My dear, dear Bobby,' White, responding to an invitation from the family to pen a definitive biography, begins a December 27, 1963, letter in which he confides to being still in such 'emotional shock' over the assassination that he 'can't yet think clearly about anything.' His vision: The new letters reveal that Bobby wanted JFK's grave at Arlington National Cemetery to be 'simple and conservative' (members of the Irish Defense Forces gathered there on the 50th anniversary of his assassination) White asks if he would be given exclusive access to some of the late president's papers, and also relates his desire to avoid any perception that he was seeking to profit off the tragedy. The files also include notes, apparently given to RFK, that describe a secret visit made to Moscow by William Walton, a journalist and painter who was a close friend of President Kennedy, one week after the assassination. Walton, who met with top Soviet officials, wrote of sadness and uncertainty JFK's death had brought in Moscow. Family men: Bobby took it upon himself to thank newspaper editors for favorable stories and coverage of his brother's death . 'It is difficult to describe the depth of the Russian reaction to the President's death - on all levels, from top bureaucrats who brushed aside tears as they spoke of him, to chairwomen who sobbed and gave me paper flowers to put on JFK's grave,' Walton wrote. Walton, whose visit would not be revealed until decades later, also wrote that Soviet officials were unsure of the new U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, and wanted a meeting between Johnson and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev arranged as quickly as possible. It was the third and final release of papers from Kennedy's years as attorney general that had long been in the possession of the library but controlled by the Kennedy family under federal rules in effect at the time of RFK's murder in 1968.","Kennedy Library is now making a collection of Robert Kennedy's letters public in light of the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination .

The number of elderly people ‘living in sin’ with unmarried partners has doubled in a decade, it emerged yesterday. In 2001, there were just 8,000 people in their late 80s and 90s who declared they were cohabiting without being married. But as attitudes to relationships have become increasingly liberal, this has now jumped to 16,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. The figures, compiled from census forms, suggest elderly ‘silver sinners’ are increasingly shunning tradition and defying stigmas about living with a partner out of wedlock. The number of divorcees over the age of 85 in England and Wales has also more than doubled to 33,000 in the past decade. Relaxed relationships: The number of people in their late 80s and 90s cohabiting without being married has doubled in a decade, figures reveal . Claire Reid, a family lawyer at Pannone Solicitors, said: ‘Whereas people aged 80 and over might once have remained in an unhappy marriage because they feared that they might not have too many years of life left, now they are determining that they want to enjoy the rest of their lives and not necessarily remain in a relationship which isn’t working for the sake of it. ‘We have seen a number of older clients who want to test the water, who want to cohabit either with a view to marrying at some later date or maybe not. ‘Older people now believe the social stigma which previous generations associated with living together and not being married just doesn’t apply to them any more as it doesn’t to younger age groups.’ The revealing statistics come as the number of people living to the age of 85 has increased by a quarter in just ten years and women now outnumber men by two to one. In 2001, there were just over one million people were in the ‘oldest of the old’ age group, but that total grew by around 250,000 to 1.25million in 2011. Women in this group outnumber men by two to one - but the men’s numbers are up by nearly half in a decade. This has been attributed to fewer people smoking and the decline of heavy industry. Seven in ten of those women live on their own - a total of nearly half a million - and those numbers are growing. Charities said the figures showed more help was needed to help older people live fulfilling lives and not just get by. Aging population: The number of people living to the age of 85 has increased by a quarter in just ten years to 1.25million . Caroline Abrahams, charity director . for Age UK, said more needed to be done to ‘ensure that people in later . life are able to thrive, not just survive’. She said: ‘It is a cause for celebration that the number of people reaching their 85th birthday and beyond is rising. ‘Significant . improvements in healthcare, public health and living conditions at all . stages of life have led to real improvements in both life expectancy and . in older people’s health. ‘However living a longer life does not . necessarily mean living a healthier life, and there are still huge . disparities in healthy life expectancy across the country making it ever . more important that as a society we are fully prepared to adequately . meet the needs of our ageing population.' The figures show there are 850,000 women and 410,000 men aged 85 and older living in England and Wales. The number of men has risen by 45 per cent in a decade, from 280,000 in 2011, compared to a rise of just 16 per cent among women, from 730,000. Women aged over-85 are more likely than men to be living alone, the figures show. In 2001 there were 103,563 men and 398,498 women living alone. By 2011 that increased to 150,000 men and 474,000 women. Nearly seven in ten women live alone, compared to 41 per cent of men - who are also more likely to be married. For every 100 women aged 85 and over, 77 were widowed, 13 were married and ten were either single, separated or divorced. But almost half of men were still married, 43 per cent were widowed and just nine per cent were single. The ONS said: ‘Recent gains in life expectancy mean that more people are living to the age of 85 and beyond. ‘In the future more of the population, who are now just entering old age, will live to be 85 or older. The oldest old are among the most vulnerable in our society, but are also among the most resilient. ‘For some, but by no means all, their advancing years affects their physical and mental health, increases their level of dependency on others and the amount of support that they require from family, private and public institutions.’ Around one in ten men and one in five women live in a care home or other ‘communal establishment’.","In 2001, 8,000 unmarried people in their 80s and 90s were cohabiting .

New plans to crack down on 'heavy handed and aggressive' parking enforcement by councils who rake in £1.3billion a year from motorists were unveiled by the Government today. It includes giving drivers a decent 'grace period' of up to five minutes before imposing a ticket, stopping CCTV being used for on-street enforcement, a review of double yellow lines and cracking down on parking fines being used to subsidise other council spending. Ministers are also proposing a 25 per cent discount on fines for motorists who pay within seven days of losing an appeal. Also, penalty charge fines are to be frozen for the rest of this Parliament ‘with immediate effect’ and all councils will be required to make clear in their annual reports exactly how much money is raised from parking ‘and where that revenue goes’. The plans to tackle ‘aggressive parking policies’ which ‘blight’ the nation’s high streets are set out by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin in a new consultation document published on Friday. It says councils should act in a ‘fair and proportionate’ manner’ but cites evidence that many do not. Use of CCTV is ‘no longer proportionate’ so: ‘The Government therefore intends to put an end to this practice.’ The Department for Transport notes ‘increasing concerns’ about the direction of some council parking policies and says: ’These steps will make it cheaper and easier to park, encourage people to shop locally and help with the cost of living.' The main policy changes include limiting the use of CCTV for on–street parking enforcement 'in some or all circumstances’. The consultation asks people to consider whether there should be a statutory requirement for local authorities to allow a ‘grace period’ where a driver has over-stayed in a paid for parking place for a short period before they are lowed to issue a  parking ticket. To ensure transparency, councils should be forced to publish annual parking-charge reports to show where revenue comes from and where it is being used . It also considers allowing communities . and businesses to be given the right to require authorities to review . aspects of their parking strategies: ‘This includes the level of parking . charges, whether parking should be free for a time, and whether double . yellow lines are appropriate and necessary at particular locations.’ Parking enforcement guidance  should emphasise ‘a less heavy-handed approach’ to parking enforcement. Parking charges and fines ‘should not be used to subsidise other areas of local government spending’, it adds. More than eight million parking tickets were issued by local councils in England in 2011-12, said the Government. Support: AA president Edmund King welcomed the measures - particular the five minute 'grace period' The report notes how total parking revenues have more than doubled from £608million in 1997-8 to £1.3billion in 2010-11. Profits from parking also soared from £223million to £512million in the same period. And income form parking is set to increase by 5.6 per cent from £601million to £635million in the 12 months to 2013-14. The . report says: ’Local authorities need to  ensure that appropriate . parking spaces are available, that signs and road markings are clear, . that parking charges are reasonable and attractive to use the town . centre, and that enforcement is fair and proportionate.’ It . adds: ’The Government is aware of concerns that some  local authorities . appear not to be  using their powers to  meet the best interests of . road users.’ Transport . Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘Unfair parking fines blight the use . of our high streets and force shoppers out of towns. ‘We . want to rein back aggressive rules by banning the use of CCTV for . parking enforcement, reviewing the use of yellow lines, and giving . shoppers a ""grace period"" to get back to their car after their ticket . has run out before they get fined.’ He . added: ‘We will also update guidance to emphasise a less heavy-handed . approach to parking enforcement and to reinforce that charges and fines . cannot be used as a means to raise cash.' Professor . Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation said: ‘The majority of . drivers who break parking rules aren’t being malicious or calculating, . they have simply made a mistake. So now wonder landing them with a hefty . fine for a minor infringement breeds resentment. ‘The current system actively . discourages drivers who have been wrongly penalised from fighting for . justice, tempting them instead to pay up quickly to avoid further . aggravation and the possibility of a more hefty fine later.’ The . Government crackdown on dodgy council parking practices comes in the . wake of a damning report by the all-party Commons’  Transport Select . Committee, many of whose recommendations have been taken up by the . Government. Evidence given . to that committee led Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to rail against . councils and complain that drivers were being ‘ripped off’ by unfair . parking policy over-zealous enforcement.’ He said at the time: ‘Over-zealous enforcement is damaging local high streets and shops, as they lose business to out of town superstores and internet retailing. 'It is a clear abuse of the law that fines have became a cash cow for town hall coffers.’ And he has accused councils  of  ‘bending the law ‘ to fill their cash-shortfalls with what amounts to a back-door ‘stealth tax.’ Evidence to MPs from the Traffic Penalty Tribunal set up by Ministers to consider  drivers’ appeals against parking fines revealed concern over the ‘routine’ use of CCTV cameras to automatically  issue motorists with millions of parking fines. This flies in the face of current Department for Transport guidance which says  CCTV should only be used when it is impractical to use traffic wardens. They also highlighted a failure by wardens to use discretion when drivers . AA president Edmund King said: ‘We welcome the five-minute grace period as many drivers are petrified that rushing into the corner shop for change for the pay & display will cost them dearly.’","Plans include giving drivers a 'grace period' before a parking ticket can be issued and stopping CCTV being used for on-street enforcement .

The heroin addict who continued to abuse drugs after having a life-saving heart transplant is now on the waiting list for another one, his family have revealed. Drug dealer Derek Gates, 38, whose heart problems were caused by years of addiction, may get a second heart transplant despite refusing to kick his habit. For his first operation, Gates was fast-tracked up the waiting list, leapfrogging scores of other needy patients with heart disease. Many people wait for up to a year for the £40,000 surgery, but Gates was found a donor in just three weeks, from a woman who had died in a car crash. Second chance: Heart transplant survivor Derek Gates has been jailed after abusing heroin and other drugs for years. Mr Gates, 38, admitted possessing heroin and producing cannabis after his house was raided by officers last month . But shortly after being given a second chance at life, Gates was taking heroin – a drug known to weaken the cardiovascular system – and even became a dealer. Dealer: Shortly after being given a second chance at life, Gates was taking heroin - a drug known to weaken the cardiovascular system - and even became a dealer . On Monday he was jailed for 18 months for drug possession after police found £430 worth of heroin in his flat in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. But the case sparked outrage after Gates’s barrister told Hull Crown Court that his first heart had been damaged by drug abuse. Yesterday his family said he was back on the waiting list because the lifespan of his donor organ was nearing an end – but that he did not even deserve the first one. His sister Kathleen, 42, said: ‘I can understand why people are angry. He doesn’t deserve the one he’s got, let alone another one.’ His brother, who asked not to be named, added: ‘He’s scum. They should have given the heart to someone who deserved it. ‘Our father was a decent man and we all had a good upbringing. He’d turn in his grave if he knew what Derek was doing now.’ There . are currently 231 people who need a heart transplant. Patients can wait . anything from a few weeks to a year for a suitable donor, but 20 per . cent of people die while on the waiting list. Gates’s . partner Melanie Lock, 40, said: ‘He’s supposed to get 15 years of life . with the heart. It’s been 13 and a half so far, so that time is nearing . an end. ‘I think he would get another heart . after that. He’d be nervous about going in for the operation though – . he’s not sure if he wants to go through it all again.’ Miss . Lock, who has been in an on-off relationship with Gates for almost 20 . years, said he had the heart transplant in 2000 after being diagnosed . with cardiomyopathy  at the age of 24. She added: . ‘He was so ill that he would have died without the transplant. It was really touch and go. 'Derek recovered really fast. When he came round all he wanted to do was watch a DVD. He was happy that he was still here.’ After his operation, he stayed in hospital in Sheffield for two weeks before being cared for in a special rehabilitation flat. He . has claimed benefits ever since, although he was said to have a . reputation in the town as a drug dealer, and was able to make up to £750 . a day. The couple have . a son, 17-year-old Royd, and are expecting another child in June, when . Gates, who has 32 previous convictions, may be released on parole. Miss Lock added: ‘I’ve spoken to Derek and he is fuming about all the abuse he’s getting. People are saying he didn’t deserve the heart. ‘I’d like to tell them, don’t say something if you’re not in that situation. I hope that he will come out of prison and help to raise these children and won’t go back to drugs. He’s a great dad.’ A spokesman for NHS Blood and Transplant, which is responsible for organ donations, said it could not comment on individual cases. However, he added: ‘In circumstances where a patient is in need of a transplant because of substance abuse, our guidelines recommend patients adhere to strict conditions and are assessed by a panel, including addiction experts, before they can be accepted on to the transplant list. ‘Patients are only listed for a transplant if the operation will have a satisfactory outcome, and this includes compliance and avoidance of drug use.’","Derek Gates has heart problems caused by years of addiction .

Offerring a shy smile from behind mum’s cheek, Florence Rose Endellion Cameron is the star of Number 10’s official Christmas card, ready to be sent to world leaders and dignitaries. Captured by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the Camerons’ youngest child gripping her father’s neck while she snuggles against her mother. It is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because David Cameron has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving to Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are pixelated. Greeting: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha photographed with daughter Florence at 10 Downing Street for their 2013 Christmas card . It is the second time Florence has taken centre stage on the PM’s card, after appearing in 2010 just months after her birth. More than 2,000 cards have been printed for the Prime Minister to send in the coming weeks. However, he will not sign them all personally and many will be pre-printed with his signature. Mr Cameron has opted for a photograph of himself and wife Samantha each year since taking power in 2010, when they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby Florence on the steps of Number 10. Baby Florence Rose Endellion Cameron also appeared on the Prime Minister's card in 2010 . In 2011 it was a photograph taken during a street party to mark the Royal Wedding, and last year they were seen welcoming the Olympic flame to Downing Street on the eve of the London Games. This year’s card rounds off a year when young Florence has often made the news. Mr Cameron has spoken of his desire to take her to nursery in Westmister as often as possible and is often pictured leaving Number 10 carrying scooters, dolls and buggies. In July Florence was rushed to hospital after getting a sticker trapped up her nose. Doctors at St Thomas’ in London removed the sticker after her concerned parents’ unsuccessful attempts to do so at their Downing Street flat. This week Alex Salmond revealed his official Christmas card, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who . turned up too late to see Jesus. Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card . The Scottish First Minister has opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson. The . artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned . whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive. Since 2007 Mr Salmond . has raised £148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the . original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card. Today . he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the . New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice . Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic . International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by . the artist. He insisted the image of Artaban is a ‘hugely appropriate’ work for his card. Mr Salmond said: ‘The legend of . Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the . vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to . herald the birth of the Christ child. ‘Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching. ‘Now . an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a . sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery.

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 07:22 EST, 6 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:51 EST, 6 December 2013 . Millions of people with fixed price energy tariffs will not get a £50 reduction in bills promised by David Cameron. The energy giant E.ON yesterday announced that more than one million of its customers will get a reduction of only £12 – or 23p a week. EDF is taking the same line with its one million fixed rate customers, who include many pensioners and families. Npower, SSE and Scottish Power may follow suit. The decision is at odds with Government promises and British Gas, which announced a £53 cut for all customers. On average bills will be £60 higher than before this year's round of price hikes even after the government deal to reduce green levies by £50 . The Prime Minister, Chancellor George Osborne and Energy Secretary Ed Davey have made repeated pledges to protect customers by rolling back green levies. Mr Osborne said this week: ‘There’s going to be an average of £50 off people’s bills … We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in.’ Last night, Mr Davey’s Energy and Climate Change Department made clear they expected all customers to get the full reduction. A spokesman said: ‘We have announced a package that should lead to households seeing an average saving of around £50 a year. ‘There is no practical bar to these . savings being passed on to consumers on fixed tariffs and our . expectation is that all consumers will benefit from the £50 discount.’ The Big Six energy firms have agreed to pass on the £50 saving to customers . The smaller reduction of £12 covers the Government’s decision to switch funding of the Warm Homes Discount – a subsidy for poorer families – from bills to general taxation. The rest of the decrease was expected to come from changes to the Energy Companies’ Obligation scheme, a levy applied to all bills to raise money for energy-saving measures for poorer households. However, this element of the reduction is not being passed on to customers on fixed tariff deals by some companies. In contrast, British Gas, the largest of the ‘big six’ suppliers, announced that all customers on all tariffs and payment methods will get a reduction of £53 from January 1. Audrey Gallacher, of campaign group Consumer Futures, said: ‘The message has been that people were going to save £50 on their energy bill, but it seems a  fair chunk of people will not get that. This sort of behaviour is not going to do anything to reassure customers … People feel confused and angry about their energy bills. This latest development just adds insult to injury.’ She added: ‘I think in the current climate, bearing in mind how people are struggling, the right thing to do would be to apply the full reduction across the board. That is the expectation that the Government has created.’ E.ON announced yesterday a price rise of almost £60 a year for customers on standard tariffs. The changes will take effect from January 18. A spokesman for the provider said cutting the bills of fixed price customers by only £12 was justified because many of these people were already on relatively good tariffs. EDF took a similar line and said its short-term fixed deal is some £90 a year cheaper than its new standard prices.

Gemma Harvieu, 29, walked free from court after being given a suspended jail sentence for wiring cash to wanted fugitive Andrew Moran . A 'gangster’s moll' who helped one of Britain’s most wanted fugitives while he was on the run in Spain has walked free from court. Former Selfridge’s beautician Gemma Harvieu, 29, wired cash from the UK to career criminal Andrew Moran, 31, who fled to Spain after vaulting the dock of a courtroom while on trial over an armed robbery at a supermarket. A court heard how Harvieu joined him at a string of exotic locations before he was dramatically arrested by Spanish police while sunbathing . at his villa in Alicante. In the space of just one year she was said to have made 23 visits to Alicante. She also took trips to Paris, Vienna, Pisa, skied in the Alps and would shop on London's Bond Street. All the while she was earning a modest wage on the cosmetics counter of Selfridges at the Trafford Centre in Manchester. Harvieu, of High Lane, Chorlton, went on . trial this week on charges of assisting an offender and money . laundering which she initially denied as she claimed she was unaware her . boyfriend was a fugitive despite extensive national and local . publicity. But she changed her pleas to guilty on Wednesday at Preston Crown Court and today received a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. In . admitting transferring more than £3,600 for subsistence to Moran, Mr . Justice Turner said a custodial sentence was inevitable but he noted she . had not been to jail before and had effectively already served a . 12-month term after being on remand since June. He explained they were relatively small sums and that it was clear that Moran had other sources of income he had relied upon. Mr . Justice Turner said: 'Helping criminal careers is a very serious . matter, so serious in the set of circumstances that we meet in this . case. 'There can be no . justification for funding criminals like Andrew Moran. The message must . go out to the public that these sort of offences must not be condoned or . tolerated.' Together: Gemma Harvieu with Andre Moran. She initially denied knowing he was a fugitive or criminal . He pointed out though that Harvieu would be out of prison in a couple of weeks if he did not suspend the sentence. She was also ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work. Moran, 31, of Salford, had been on Crimestoppers’ most wanted list of criminals believed to be on the run in Spain. He . flew out of Manchester Airport on a false passport the following day . after he escaped custody at Burnley Crown Court in March 2009 where he . was eventually convicted in his absence of conspiracy to commit armed . robbery. Captured: Andrew Moran, pictured, was arrested by police in Spain earlier this year . He remained on the run for four years in Spain before he was finally arrested by police. Moran’s sister Simone Moran, 27, and her . fiance Jason Fitzgerald, 28, both of Edenbridge Drive, Radcliffe, . received the same sentences as they both pleaded guilty at earlier . hearings to assisting an offender. They too wired similar sums of cash to Moran while he was in Spain. Last . month, a fourth defendant, Leighton Craft, 39, of Parkhill, Prestwich, . was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, . after he previously admitted making an untrue statement to procure a . passport. Michael Bagley, . defending Harvieu, said his client was no longer in a relationship with . Moran, whom she said she had met in Spain by chance. As well as being ruthless and cunning, he was also manipulative and charming, said the barrister. He said: 'The long and short of it is that he took in Miss Harvieu. She fell in love with him. Once in that relationship, she let herself down and members of her family.' She was ashamed at her actions and had felt 'humiliated' by the caricature of her being a 'gangster’s moll', he said. 'She is emotionally disengaged with Andrew Moran,' Mr Bagley continued. 'One hopes and trusts that is right.' Mark . Ford, representing both Simone Moran and Fitzgerald, said they too were . manipulated by Moran, although some sense of family obligation may have . played its part. Devoted: The glamorous brunette, a former lap-dancer, flew to Alicante to see Moran 23 times in 12 months . This image, retrieved by police, shows Harvieu and her boyfriend having fun before they were caught by officers . Wendy . Chappell, senior Crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'It was the . prosecution case that these defendants were well aware that Andrew Moran . was wanted by law enforcement agencies in the UK, yet on various . occasions they transferred money over to him so that he could carry on . living in Spain. 'The evidence . showed that Gemma Harvieu regularly visited Moran in Spain whilst he . was unlawfully at large, holidaying with him throughout Europe and . enjoying all the trappings of a luxury lifestyle from money which had no . legitimate source. 'The CPS . has worked closely with the police to bring them all to justice. We are . determined to ensure that criminals do not evade the law and anyone who . assists them in doing so can expect to be prosecuted.' The court previously heard how Moran had been the gunman in a raid on a Royal Mail van outside the Asda supermarket in Colne, Lancashire, where £25,000 was stolen. And while in Spain he took to crime there like 'a duck to water', Preston Crown Court heard today. Escape: Andrew Moran pictured fleeing his trial for armed robbery at Burnley Crown Court in 2009 . In November 2012, Moran displayed 'a spectacular piece of behaviour' when he evaded arrest from the Spanish authorities as they set up an armed security cordon around his then flat. He smashed his 4x4 vehicle through the police block and then sped off along the wrong way of the motorway. Evidence of a luxury lifestyle was uncovered when officers searched his address, as well as loaded firearms, a stash of cannabis and a series of false identity documents which Moran was using on 'a persistent basis'. Prosecutor Tim Brennand said details linking him to Harvieu - whom he labelled as a 'gangster’s moll' - were also found, including travel documents surrounding the purchase of an expensive pedigree pitbull dog from Austria. More firearms, ammunition and two machetes - one under his bed - were recovered in this year’s arrest in Alicante with Moran suspected to be involved in a high-level conspiracy to supply cocaine. He is currently in custody in Spain and is awaiting trial in January. Dayjob: Harvieu sold cosmetics at Selfridges in Manchester, pictured .

Labour MP Sarah Champion accused Tory MPs of 'utterly appalling' behaviour in the Commons . Tory MPs have been accused of imitating ‘bums and breasts’ with their hands in the House of Commons. Women speaking during debates face ‘utterly appalling’ behaviour from MPs opposite, a Labour claimed. Sarah Champion condemned the ‘insidious’ culture in Parliament, which female MPs are forced to ignore. The claims by one of the newest women MPs will again turn the spotlight on behaviour in the Commons, after MailOnline revealed letters written to the Speaker John Bercow complaing about the ‘morons, donkeys and tw**s’ heckling during Prime Minister’s Questions. Miss Champion claimed some Conservatives were responsible for trying to degrade women during debates. The first woman MP for Rotherham said the abuse across the Chamber was ‘awful’ and ‘really bad’ but admitted she did not know if Labour MPs did the same to female Tory MPs. She told BBC Radio Sheffield: ‘Some Tories are very good at gesticulating about females' assets.’ Asked by presenter Rony Robinson whether she was referring to hand gestures and remarks about her ‘bum and breasts’ she said: ‘Yes ... I think it is utterly appalling, it's deliberately trying to degrade people, it's sexist and people ought to be pulled for it.’ Ms Champion said she had to ‘pretty much ignore it’ because responding would mean ‘you end up in a slagging match which I don't think is helpful’. Miss Champion was elected MP for Rotherham in November last year after Denis MacShane quit after being charged over expenses fraud. She previously ran a Chinese Arts Centre in Manchester and before entering Parliament was chief executive of the Bluebell Wood Children's Centre. Miss Champion said she did not know if male Labour MPs behave in the same way ‘because I'm on the bench looking forward, but the Tories definitely do it to Labour women’. Asked how she would react if her colleagues were acting in a similar way she said: ‘I would be utterly, utterly appalled and I would go and say something if I saw one of my Labour colleagues doing it.’ Abuse: MPs speaking in debates face heckling and ruse gestures from the benches opposite . She said she had not informed Speaker John Bercow about her concerns: ‘This is the problem, it's so insidious, it's so part of the culture there ... it's overlooked rather than ignored, I would say.’ However, dozens of members of the public about the behaviour of heckling, insulting and guffawing MPs during Prime Minister’s Questions. Letters, emails and web messages repeatedly accuse MPs of behaving like football hooligans, naughty schoolchildren, ‘rowdy buffoons’, ‘morons’ and ‘braying donkeys’ who do not live in the real world. It is claimed MPs behave like 19th century ‘public schoolboys’ who think they are still in the Bullingdon Club, the Oxford University dining society which counted Mr Cameron and George Osborne as members and is famed for smashing up restaurants. Just on of the dozens of letters sent to Parliament about the behaviour of MPs during PMQs . Most of the letters, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, raised concerns about the damage to Britain’s reputation overseas, the poor example set to young people and the effect it has on deterring people, especially women, from entering politics. One . of the most damning messages, posted on the Parliament website, said: . ‘Get Cameron to answer the questions at Prime Minister’s Questions. ‘It’s . beyond ridiculous. I hate you all with a colossal amount of passion . anyway, but there is only so much piss you can take. Thanks a bunch you . abhorrent t**ts.’ Some called for ‘red cards’, suspensions and even ‘fines’ to be imposed on MPs who refuse to be quiet.

Facebook has revealed its income in Ireland is 43 times higher than in the UK, despite being a fraction of the size. Accounts for the social networking site show how it earned £1.5billion last year through its offices in Ireland, compared to just £35million through Facebook UK Ltd. Ireland's corporation tax rate is significantly lower than in Britain and MPs have raised concerns about companies using legal methods to register profits in countries with lower tax rates. Latest figures reveal the huge amount of revenue Facebook says it raised in Ireland, compared to the UK which has a much higher population . The firm says it complies with the law and its Irish office acts as its European HQ. But it raises further questions about how the firm makes 43 times more money Ireland, despite the UK having 14 times more people. Facebook makes money from selling adverts targeted at its users based on their personal preferences. In a practice that is legal but has been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs, the social networking company records most of its UK sales in Ireland. Like other US technology firms such as Google, it bills its UK arm simply as a service and marketing division. MPs have urged HM Revenue and Customs to take legal action against global firms like Facebook, Amazon and Google to test their claims that they are paying their fair share in Britain. The Irish tax regime saw the Dublin branch pay only £4.3million in tax, of which £1.6million was corporation tax. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, claimed the government was not doing enough to stop firms from exporting profits . It comes after it emerged Facebook paid no corporation tax in Britain last year despite raking in more than £200million from its UK operations, documents reveal. It means the internet giant has paid just £1million in corporation tax on the half a billion pounds of revenue it has made since arriving in Britain in 2007. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the public accounts committee said: ‘These artificial tax structures are all too familiar. They are simply devised to avoid paying a fair share of tax on the profits made in the UK.’ She also criticised the government: ‘They are making it easier for companies to export their profits. Far from clamping down on it they are making it easier.’ A Facebook spokesperson said: ‘Facebook complies with all relevant corporate regulations including those related to filing company reports and taxation. 'We have our international headquarters in Ireland that employs almost five hundred people and a series of smaller local offices providing support services all over Europe. 'Dublin was selected as the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multi-lingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe.'","Accounts reveal huge revenue at website's Dublin headquarters .

He sent her pictures of himself aroused and texted her saying he wished she was sharing a bed with him. He also told her how much he was looking forward to her turning 16 so they could legally have sex and said she was not like any ‘other girl’. The pair eventually engaged in oral sex during two sexual liaisons at the home in Whitefield, Manchester, he shared with his mother. His mother was away at the time. But the girl - described as ‘highly intelligent and articulate’ - was said to have been left ‘very shaken and angry’ by her experiences and told a member of staff at her school. She later told police: ‘He talked me into everything and he assumed I wanted everything he wanted and in the end that's what I thought I wanted.’ The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, has since been treated for depression and has been referred to a counsellor after trying to self-harm. At Bolton Crown Court Harrison pleaded guilty to grooming a child for sexual activity and four counts of sexual activity with a child. The hearing was told the incidents occurred after Harrison took early retirement from St Monica's High School in Prestwich where he had worked for 17 years. He visited the school voluntarily afterwards and later met the girl. In March this year she sent him a friend request on Facebook and he accepted. ‘She developed a crush on Harrison,’ said Richard Orme, prosecuting. ‘She thought he was attractive and when he paid her attention she felt flattered and started to like him even more. ‘The two began regular contact on Facebook, messaging each other a couple of times a day and this soon became much more frequent and Harrison then asked that they continue their conversations on their mobile phones. ‘All communication has been via text - approximately 100 per day - never any verbal calls for fear of getting caught. 'These texts would be throughout the day, starting from very early in the morning to very late at night, leaving the girl very tired at school.’ On April 1 Harrison was at a wedding of a former work colleague when he texted the girl saying he wished that ‘she was there sharing a bed with him’. Mr Orme added: ‘She said that this was the first time that Harrison said anything to her which was of a sexual nature and she was freaked out by this at first and didn't know what to say but then just went along with it. ‘Harrison started telling the girl what he wanted to do to her sexually. He sent messages stating that he couldn't wait till she was 16 then it would be legal. Things developed gradually and Harrison said he loved her and that they would be together one day.’ The hearing was told the incidents occurred after Harrison took early retirement from St Monica's High School in Prestwich where he had worked for 17 years . At the end of April, Harrison invited the girl into his home when his mother was away. During the liaison he referred to her as his ‘girlfriend’ and they kissed and ‘dry humped’ on the sofa. The girl asked Harrison if she was like all the other girls but he told her: ‘No, it's completely different.’ The prosecutor said: ‘He said he couldn't wait until she was 16 and they could have sex. He showed her around the house, the last room being his bedroom and they both sat on the bed and began kissing. ‘Harrison undid her bra and touched her breasts and undressed her. She described them performing oral sex on each other.’ The pair met again a week later at Harrison's home and they engaged in more kissing and ‘dry humping’ on the sofa during which the teacher sucked the girl's breasts. Afterwards they continued to text but she tried to stop because she felt guilty. He said wanted to remain friends. She agreed but deleted Harrison as a Facebook friend. Harrison, pictured here leaving Bolton Crown Court, has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison . ‘She felt that she had been used for sex,’ added Mr Orme. ‘At this time she felt angry and scared and she took the decision to tell the inclusion officer at school what had been happening. ‘She had been suffering depression since Christmas she had also tried to self-harm and had been referred for specialist support. She is a quiet, highly intelligent articulate girl and she has been greatly affected by this ""relationship"" which had developed beyond her control.’ Harrison admitted to an affair but said the girl had instigated the explicit texts and the sexual acts at his home - and he ‘went along with it’. He was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for ten years. Judge Peter Davies told him: ‘These are serious matters because of your age gap. You were the adult and she was the child and it is for you to show responsibility, for you to say no and for you to desist. ‘When one is 14 years old and one has a sexual encounter with a 49-year-old former teacher the impact will be profound. The trauma to her psychology would have been intense and the extent will not be realised for some time to come. ‘She was a bright student who is now struggling with the consequences of what has happened and you should have realised the potential for this risk.’ In mitigation defence, Geoff Whelan said: ‘It is abundantly clear that when he did work as a teacher he was very good indeed. He has thrown away his life's work.’ But Det Sgt Louise Bentley, from Greater Manchester Police said after the case: ‘The victim's emotional and physical wellbeing has been affected as has her school work. ‘She has suffered enormously as a result of the abuse carried out by Harrison. ‘While he fully admitted what had happened he sought to minimise his responsibility and tried to blame the victim. As an experienced former teacher and middle-aged man I find such sentiments to be insulting to the victim and others in the profession.’","Mark Harrison swapped 100 text messages a day with the girl .

Fed up at seeing the local shopping centre boarded up for years after Sainsbury’s failed to deliver its ‘regeneration’ plan, Lynda Hatcher sprang into action. The mother of three took a photograph of the eyesore and posted it on the supermarket chain’s Facebook page, asking: ‘What are you doing?’ It was a question baffling the residents of Dorridge – not least because the village is where Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King grew up. Within 48 hours, her photo had been ‘liked’ by 500 people. So began a campaign by Mrs Hatcher which many in the village believe played a crucial role in shaming Sainsbury’s into building the store it had long promised them. It was in 2008 that the company spent £18million on a large piece of land in  Dorridge, near Solihull, West Midlands, including the 1960s shopping precinct. Two years later, it tried to get planning permission for a 25,000 sq ft store on the site but failed amid opposition from locals who felt it was too overbearing. A smaller proposal was approved the next year. But then, having helped traders relocate from the precinct, Sainsbury’s did nothing for over a year before declaring that its proposed supermarket was not commercially viable because of ‘continuing uncertainty’ in the economy. By the time Mrs Hatcher took her photograph in February, there was growing discontent, with some villagers fearing Dorridge had fallen foul of ‘land-banking’ – the practice whereby supermarkets buy land to prevent rivals moving in. The 49-year-old set up a Facebook page, customising the company logo to read ‘Shamesbury’s’, started a Twitter account @justinkinghome and launched an online petition. Eventually, Sainsbury’s moved into action, obtaining permission for a larger store and workmen were seen at the site this week in readiness for demolition of the  precinct and the opening of a supermarket for Christmas 2014. Boarded up: The precinct in Dorridge was bought with the rest of the land by Sainsbury's for £18m in 2008 . Yesterday Mrs Hatcher, a leadership coach, said: ‘I’ve never protested like this before but I was fed up at looking at a boarded-up site. ‘The supermarket plan was very divisive in the village from the start, but my own position was fairly  neutral towards it. Where I became very angry, and active, was that having got planning permission, I felt Sainsbury’s should build. ‘The promise was regeneration. There was a sense of betrayal when Sainsbury’s did nothing with the site for so long.’ Ian Spencer, chairman of  Dorridge Residents’ Association, said: ‘We asked Sainsbury’s what was going on and got fobbed off. ‘One wonders what would have happened if Lynda had not embarrassed the CEO.’ Sainsbury’s denied land-banking and blamed planning laws for the long delay.","Mother of three Lynda Hatcher launched social media campaign in home town of the chain's CEO Justin King after failed regeneration promise .

A racist drunk who was filmed ranting at a Japanese woman on the Underground was jailed today after celebrities, including Ricky Gervais, retweeted the video. Keith Hurdle, admitted shouting verbal abuse at HR worker Kuniko Ingram, yelling at her: 'You’re a vicious bunch of f****** c***s'. He was arrested after a commuter filmed the scene on his mobile phone and posted it on YouTube where it went viral. But the passenger only posted the footage after twice trying to report it to police only to find the police stations closed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: . Vile: Hurdle singles out HR worker Kuniko Ingram because she is Japanese and begins to hurl abuse . Sitting in the dock wearing a tweed jacket and dark rimmed glasses, Hurdle looked down at the floor when he was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. He will serve half the time on licence. The 52 year-old had earlier held his head in his hands as the racist video was played at Westminster Magistrates Court. But the passenger only posted the footage after twice trying to report it to police only to find the police stations closed. Sitting in the dock wearing a tweed jacket and dark rimmed glasses, Hurdle looked down at the floor when he was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. He will serve half the time on licence. The 52 year-old had earlier held his head in his hands as the racist video was played at Westminster Magistrates Court. In the five minute clip, Hurdle claims his uncle died in the World War 2 in Japan, yelling at Mrs Ingram: 'You tortured him. 'Get yourself off the train, get yourself off the train. You’re nasty people, yeah? F*** off, get out of my country. Sayonara'. Boozed-up Hurdle then turns to the passenger filming the incident and slurs 'Where are you from?' The film maker, named in court as Mr Ali, tries to help the woman by saying to Hurdle, 'Does it matter, really? 'Are you going to start sorting everyone on the train, man, one by one? What have you got against the Japanese?” In reply Hurdle, from Watford, north west London, brandishes a wine bottle he has been swigging from and says: 'Do you want some of that? No, because you don’t drink. You’re a f****** Somalian c**t'. Hurdle, who had been boozing while watching the England football match before the rant on October 15, then tells the tube carriage that he used to be a soldier with the Parachute Regiment and served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands. Star power: The video went viral after Ricky Gervais shared it with his five million followers on Twitter . Mrs Ingram told police that Hurdle had been 'mumbling' comments about the number of Chinese people in Britain. She became scared when he turned his attention to her, accusing the HR officer of not being able to read a paper. She said: 'At this point I felt chills down my spine and I was fearful because I was becoming a target of his abuse. Out of order: Hurdle said he disliked Japanese people because his grandfather had been killed in World War 2 . 'Then he asked ""Where are you from?"", I said ""I’m from Japan"". 'He said something like ‘Go back to your country’. 'He began shouting very loudly f***ing c***s and making gestures with his hands. 'He said: 'The Japanese are f***ing c***s and then said the Japanese are nasty people.” Another woman then approached Mrs Ingram and advised her to get off the train for her own safety, but Hurdle continued spouting abuse at her. After Mrs Ingram got off, Hurdle began hurling abuse at a man sat opposite him, Mr Ali, who had been filming the rant on his iphone. When Mr Ali challenged Hurdle’s abusive language, he lent forward and snarled 'Don’t give it all that, I’ll knock you out in one punch.' In a statement read in court, Mr Ali said: 'He lent towards me with his fist clenched and I thought he was going to punch me. 'He then continued shouting at me. He grabbed a wine bottle, took a sip and then closed it. He held it upside down, at this point I thought he was going to bottle me. Hurdle was tracked down and arrested after the YouTube clip when viral. When he was interviewed by police, Hurdle apologised and said he did not remember the incident because he had been so drunk. He told cops at the station: 'I was drinking, I do not recall anything about the exchange of words on the train and I would like to apologise to those concerned.' The court heard that Hurdle has been an alcoholic since the mid 1990’s when he turned to booze after his mum was diagnosed with cancer. Threat: Hurdle told the film maker he would 'knock him out in one punch' while brandishing a wine bottle . His drink problem led to the break up of his marriage and him losing his job, the court heard.

A computer hacker has been spared jail after selling virtual items he had stolen breaking into the accounts of fantasy game players. Steven Burrell, from Northampton, spent 16 months hacking profiles on RuneScape, an online game where more than 200 million players live in a medieval fantasy world and collect armour and food. The 21-year-old accessed accounts almost 4,000 times, using the money he made to pay off his gambling debts, Northampton Magistrates' Court was told. Fantasy: Items similar to the type Steven Burrell, 21, stole from more than 100 players of the online game RuneScape. He sold his hoard of items like capes, swords, gold and armour on fan forums for up to £3,000 . Popular: The game has run since 2001 and has more than 200 million users who 'train up' and fight monsters . Northampton Magistrates' Court heard Burrell sold his victims' virtual items on auction sites and forums to raise up to £3,000. Many of his victims complained to the game's developer, Jagex - taking up 1,000 hours of the company's time. RuneScape was launched by British brothers Andrew and Paul Gower in 2001 and has since become the largest online role-playing game in the world. Its 200 million players gain skills like mining, cooking, fishing and fighting and collect hundreds of items ranging from lobsters to swords. The most dedicated players are fiercely competitive and spend real-world money to help them gain fantasy 'skills' more quickly. One user on sythe.org was selling 30 million gold pieces for $11.88 (£7.27) - a practice banned by administrators but hard to police. Another sold a rare commemorative Christmas hat, which has no function other than kudos with the online community, for $40 (£25). One full account for sale on eBay today had more than 25 bids topping £40. But these amounts are chicken feed compared to the wealth of the game's founders - who together were ranked Britain's 740th richest people in this year's Sunday Times Rich List. Andrew Gower, 34, sold his stake in the game for £88m in 2011 while Paul, 36, and his family retain a stake worth £14m. Yet Burrell was charged with hacking, not theft, because the items he stole existed in a fantasy world. Databases and password-cracking software were found . on Burrell’s computer, which the court was told he went to 'great lengths' to hide. The 21-year-old was cautioned in July 2012 by Yorkshire Police in . relation to compromising a Facebook account of a Jagex employee. He was then arrested in April this year, after which he emailed Jagex to apologise. But he later hacked their game another 27 times, leading to a second arrest in July and criminal charges. He pleaded guilty to two charges of unauthorised computer access after the court heard he accessed player accounts 3,872 times, modifying 105 accounts. The game is the largest of its kind in the world. Prosecutor Russell Tyner said: 'This activity relates to an online game called RuneScape. 'It is recognised as one of the largest games currently in existence, taking place in the realm of a medieval fantasy world. 'Players have characters and they acquire resources. They have a real-world value. 'What the prosecution say is Mr Burrell has acquired some of these unlawfully. 'To do this, he accessed other players’ accounts, and has gone on to sell the items on auction sites and forums. 'By . his own admission, he has made between £2,500 and £3,000. It is quite . clear he has invested quite a lot of time and energy in this pursuit. 'His principal motivation was to gain . kudos among people on the internet. Once a player has lost gaming . resources, there is no redress.' Kudos: Characters are respected in the online world for fantasy skills such as mining, fishing and cookery . Players trading for virtual money. The court heard Burrell was 'foolish' but made up to £3,000 in real money . Online world: The game is popular and has made its founders, British brothers Andrew and Paul Gower, £100m . Stuart Jeffery, defending, said Burrell was 'foolish' and used fantasy to deal with problems in the real world. He added: 'He is a normal, rational human being, whose course of conduct has clearly caused a lot of trouble. 'He used a fantasy world to try to deal with problems in the real world, which were financial and related to gambling. 'It is clear he did not consider the long-term consequences because that world was not real.' Burrell was handed a 12-month community order and made to perform 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £100 costs and a £60 victim surcharge, and to forfeit his two computers. Another hacker was arrested for accessing RuneScape accounts in 2009 in what was, at the time, the first arrest of its kind. And in May this year Kieron Belmont, 19, from Swansea, was given an eight-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £16 compensation to a friend whose RuneScape money he stole. Burrell refused to comment outside court.","Steven Burrell, 21, spent 16 months hacking player profiles on RuneScape .

A carjacker who dragged a mother out of her vehicle at knifepoint in a tree-lined street then drove off with her two small children in the back was jailed for five years yesterday. Cedric Brown was being chased by police called to reports of an attempted burglary when he pulled Lucy Lawton from the driving seat and drove off. She had just strapped her children into their car seats ready to go to play group. Police cars followed the Ford Focus and cornered 6ft 4in Brown in a cul-de-sac half a mile away after he abandoned the car and tried to run. The children, a boy aged one and a two-year-old girl, were unharmed and quickly returned to their distraught mother at her home. At the time of the incident in Erdington, Birmingham, in April last year Brown was described as one of Britain’s most wanted men. He was also being sought in connection with a violent burglary in Bristol two years earlier. Yesterday Judge Stuart Rafferty QC described 26-year-old Miss Lawton’s terror at seeing the criminal ‘disappearing in the distance with her pride and joy’ – her children – in the back of her car. He jailed Brown, 46, of no fixed address, for five years after he admitted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon – a Second World War replica commando dagger. Brown escaped kidnap charges after prosecutors accepted he had not realised the children were in the car, even though police had managed to open the rear door in a bid to get to them before the robber drove away. Brown was not convicted of any offence in connection with the burglary allegations. Terrifying: The tree-lined road in Birmingham where a mother-of-two was dragged out of her Ford Focus . Dangerous: A previous photo of Cedric Brown from 2002. He was caught after a mile-long police chase . The judge said Miss Lawton had been confronted by a ‘powerfully built and threatening stranger’ and had been so panicked she believed the knife held under his jacket to be a gun. He told Brown: ‘She panicked completely... knowing full well her children were in the back. ‘The police succeeded in opening the rear door of that car which must have terrified her even more because there were her children sitting in the back of that vehicle with an open door which you then drove away.’ Judge Rafferty said Brown  would remain such a threat that he ordered him to remain on an extended licence for five years beyond his jail term, until 2023. Anthony Potter, prosecuting, told Birmingham Crown Court Miss Lawton had started the car when she saw Brown walk past and ‘feared the worst’. He added: ‘Brown began to approach the vehicle and she went to lock the doors but was not quick enough.’ Mr Potter said Miss Lawton, who lives with her partner, tried to hold on to the steering wheel but Brown pulled her out. The court heard that Brown had been tried earlier this year for the Bristol aggravated burglary, when a husband and wife were tied up and slashed with a knife, but was acquitted on the directions of the judge. After yesterday’s case Miss Lawton said she had suffered ‘18 months of hell’. She added: ‘I still think there’s a gap in the law where he wasn’t charged for taking my children.’","Police chased Cedric Brown, 46, for a mile through streets of Birmingham .

In . addition, staff even tried to cover up the ripped carpet in the lobby . by placing a ‘wet floor’ warning sign over the top of it. ‘It was horrible, it was like a hotel from hell,’ Ms Jakeman from Hunstanton, Norfolk said. ‘We have stayed there the two years before and it has always been fine so we didn’t expect it to be a problem. ‘We . checked in as normal and weren’t told of any problems but I ran a bath . and came back to dirty, brown, sludgey water. It was disgusting.' When staff arrived to attend to Ms Jakeman's complaint, they told her the boiler had not been working for a full day. 'They hadn’t mentioned a thing to us when we checked in,' Ms Jakeman added. Complaints: The two girls observed fire extinguishers being used as door stops in the hotel and when Ms Jakeman drained the bathtub, an unexplained substance was left at the bottom . Nightmare: Ms Jakeman, pictured on a night out, made the dirty discoveries as she went down to the hotel reception to complain about their room .

Disgusted: Staff blamed a broken boiler for the girls' tub filling up with 'thick brown gritty sludge' when they tried to run a bath . Despite a promise that the boiler was . going to be fixed within the hour, Ms Jakeman and Ms Hardy had to wash . in cold water before their birthday celebrations. ‘By . the time we got in the next morning there was nothing coming from the . hot tap at all and that was the same when we checked out.' Ms Hardy, a mother-of-one from Boston, . Lincolnshire, added: ‘We even overheard them calling all the guests and . moving them because they said they couldn’t get someone out on the . weekend to fix it. ‘It was so messy and looked like a building site. You could see the electric wires in the ceiling and there were panels missing. 'The carpet was torn in lots of places and they had tried to cover it up with a caution sign lying flat but it just looked a tip.' Bad maintenance: Staff attempted to cover up the ripped carpet within the hotel with a 'wet floor' warning sign . Cleaning complaint: As Ms Jakeman left her hotel room to complain about their bath, she discovered soiled mattresses propped up against a wall in the corridor . Compensated: After Ms Hardy and Ms Jakeman complained, the hotel chain gave them a full refund . Ruined stay: The pair had booked a room at the Leicester Central branch of Travelodge . Ms Hardy added: ‘It could have been really dangerous but they didn’t seem to care because there were dirty mattresses left in the corridor. ‘It has definitely put me off staying there again. What should have been a good night out turned into a night from hell.’ The friends checked into the hotel on a Saturday night last month and have since been given a full refund and an offer of a free weekend stay at a Travelodge. 'We are very sorry to hear of Miss Jakeman’s recent experience at our Leicester Central hotel,' a spokesperson for the hotel chain told MailOnline in a statement. 'On the day in question, a temporary fault with the boiler resulted in a loss of hot water throughout the hotel, and caused water to leak in some places. 'Because this was a busy Saturday night, the hotel staff informed all customers that they could either remain in the hotel and receive a full refund, or be booked into other nearby hotels with all transport costs paid for. 'We recognise that there were a number of other issues identified by the customer, many which were caused by the fault with the boiler, however we have worked with our staff and are confident these have been resolved.'","Friends' birthday celebrations turn into 'night from hell' at hotel .

An Islamic extremist admitted trying to behead Fusilier Lee Rigby because ‘the most humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular’, a court heard yesterday. Michael Adebolajo, 28, said he drove his car into Mr Rigby before he sawed his neck and then ‘attempted to remove his head’, the jury was told. During a series of police interviews which were played to the Old Bailey yesterday, Adebolajo said he and his accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, waited near Woolwich Barracks for a soldier to appear. Interview: Footage of Michael Adebolajo talking to police has been shown to an Old Bailey jury . Victim: The alleged killers of Lee Rigby cut his throat because it was 'humane', a court has heard . He said that they attacked the soldier as he was a ‘fair target’ and because they ‘wished to fulfil our promise to Allah’. The . defendant said they selected Mr Rigby simply because he was the first . soldier to appear on the South London street where they were waiting on . May 22. ‘It was almost as if Allah had chosen him,’ he said. When I . thought about obeying Allah in the past I thought maybe it is possible . to kill a man by driving into him. ‘When . he crossed the road in front of me so casually it was almost as if I . was not in control of myself.

He . replied: ‘To be killed on the battlefield is not something we shy away . from and, in fact, this is something that Allah loves.’ The . footage of the interviews at Southwark Police Station shows Adebolajo . wearing a blue blanket, which at some points almost completely covered . his face. At times the . suspect stooped down and appeared to read passages from a gold and black . copy of the Koran which was lying open on the table in front of him.

Damage: The Vauxhall Tigra allegedly driven into the soldier by Adebolajo and Adebowale . 'No vendetta': Adebolajo, pictured on May 22, insisted he had nothing against Lee Rigby personally . During . the first interview he ranted for 40 minutes, often wagging a finger in . the air, about British troops ‘committing mass murder’ in Muslim lands. He said there was a ‘war between Muslims and the British people’ and he . was a ‘soldier of Allah’. When . asked about the soldier’s killing, he said: ‘He was struck on the neck . with a sharp implement and it was sawn until his head, you know, became . almost unattached.

Ian Fleming wanted his first James Bond film to feature Mafia villains and be as fast-paced as possible to distract the audience from unlikely storylines, a previously unseen memo reveals. The message from the author, written in 1958, warned against any 'cardboard' acting and suggested the script writers should use an Italian phone directory to make the names as authentic as possible. While the Mafia did not feature in a Bond film, the plot ultimately formed the basis for the Thunderball movie, though with significant changes. No cardboard: This memo, written by Ian Fleming to Jack Whittingham in 1958, outlines the plot for a Bond film which would eventually become Thunderball . Memo: Ian Fleming, pictured, sent the suggested to playwright Jack Whittingham . Differences between the original script . and the Thunderball familiar to fans include dropping the Mafia villains . in favour of global terrorist group SPECTRE, and changing Bond's love . interest from straight-laced police investigator to a fiery, . sexually-aware young woman called Domino. He sent the page-long summary of ideas for the film - which had suggested titles of James Bond, Secret Agent, and later Longitude 78 West - to playwright Jack Whittingham, who was tasked with producing the first 007 screenplay. A secret memo in which Mr Fleming spells out his ideas for the first James Bond movie including using names from the phonebook for characters has come to light. The correspondences predates Dr No, the first Bond film to make it to cinemas, by four years. Although a final script was made for the film, it never went into production due to a legal wrangle. Along with the memo is a final edition bound script for Thunderball, which will be sold at auction in London this month. The items were held by Mr Whittingham, who died in 1972, and have now been made available by his estate. In his memo the prolific novelist outlined the plot, involving the Mafia blackmailing the British out of £100million pounds using a stolen nuclear warhead. Final cut: The script developed by Mr Fleming and Whittingham eventually became the film Thunderball, starring Sean Connery (pictured) Mr Fleming wrote: 'My concern is... to make it as fast-moving and packed with incidents as possible. To my mind the chief weakness is the thinness of the Mafia threat and this must be considerably strengthened. 'I am badly in need of good Italian names for the Mafia gangsters and these could perhaps be obtained from the Venice telephone directory! 'In order to keep the feet of this film firmly on the ground production will have to be particularly brisk so as not to allow the audience time to worry about probabilities. 'Production will have to be particularly strong in portraying the Secret Service and the Mafia. Any suspicion of cardboard must be avoided and the acting throughout should be under-played and without exaggeration. 'More subsidiary incidents should be added where there is any sign of the pace flagging but, for the time being, my invention has run out.' Novel: Mr Fleming later turned the script into a . novel (right) but did not credit Mr Whittingham or his producer, who . had helped craft it. A court case later awarded Mr Whittingham the film . rights to the book. The finished screenplay, right, is part of the . auction lot . Although the scrip was finalised, plans for the film were shelved in 1960 due to a disagreement with producer Kevin McClory. Mr Fleming went on to write Thunderball as a novel in 1961, but in doing so failed to credit Whittingham and McClory for their input. The case was settled out of court in November 1963 and McClory was awarded the film rights for Thunderball, which premiered in 1965, a year after Fleming's death. The memo along with a first draft 'continuity treatment' for Thunderball by Whittingham, and first draft shooting script for the film that are all for sale now were used as evidence in the case. Katherine Schofield, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Fleming decided in 1958 to turn one of his James Bond books into a film and this pre-dated Dr No by four years. Titles: Pages of the memo up for auction show potential titles for the film which would become Thunderball . 'The memo is Fleming's thoughts of what the film would be. He was an amazing novelist but found it difficult to convert his work to the big screen which is why he employed Whittingham. 'Fleming is saying in the memo ""let's do it like this"". One idea he had was to use the Mafia as the bad guys which is different to what was eventually made. 'But the most significant item for sale is the original final edition script because that is the script for the very first Bond movie.' The memo, Whittingham's first draft treatment and first draft shooting script are expected to sell for £5,000 each. The final edition script for Thunderball is tipped to go under the hammer for £12,000 in the auction in London on December 18.","Unseen memo from Fleming to playwright Jack Whittingham to be sold .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:42 EST, 6 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:53 EST, 6 December 2013 . Under pressure from the wind-power industry, the Obama administration said Friday it will allow companies to kill or injure eagles without the fear of prosecution for up to three decades. The new rule is designed to address environmental consequences that stand in the way of the nation's wind energy rush: the dozens of bald and golden eagles being killed each year by the giant, spinning blades of wind turbines. An investigation earlier this year documented the illegal killing of eagles around wind farms, the Obama administration's reluctance to prosecute such cases and its willingness to help keep the scope of the eagle deaths secret. Fair game: This April 18, 2013 file photo shows a golden eagle flying over a wind turbine on Duke energy's top of the world wind farm in Wyoming . President Barack Obama has championed the pollution-free energy, nearly doubling America's wind power in his first term as a way to tackle global warming. But all energy has costs, and the administration has been forced to accept the not-so-green sides of green energy as a means to an end. Another investigation recently showed that corn-based ethanol blended into the nation's gasoline has proven more damaging to the environment than politicians promised and worse than the government acknowledges. These examples highlight Obama's willingness to accept environmental trade-offs — pollution, loss of conservation land and the deaths of eagles — in hopes that green energy will help fight climate change. Death machines: This graphic shows how eagles are harmed by wind turbines . The new rule will provide legal protection for the lifespan of wind farms and other projects if companies obtain permits and make efforts to avoid killing protected birds. Companies would have to take additional measures if they killed or injured more eagles than they had estimated they would, or if new information suggested that eagle populations were being affected. The permits would be reviewed every five years, and companies would have to submit reports of how many eagles they killed. Now, such reporting is voluntary, and the Interior Department refuses to release the information. 'This is not a program to kill eagles,' said John Anderson, the director of siting policy at the American Wind Energy Association. 'This permit program is about conservation.' But conservation groups, which have been aligned with the industry on other issues, said the decision by the Interior Department sanctions the killing of an American icon. 'Instead of balancing the need for conservation and renewable energy, Interior wrote the wind industry a blank check,' said Audubon President and CEO David Yarnold in a statement. The group said it would challenge the decision. Wind farms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30-story buildings, with spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet's wingspan. Though the blades appear to move slowly, they can reach speeds of up to 170 mph at the tips, creating tornado-like vortexes. Flying eagles behave somewhat like drivers texting on cellphones; they don't look up. As they scan below for food, they don't notice the blades until it is too late. Until now, no wind energy company has obtained permission authorizing the killing, injuring or harassment of eagles, although five-year permits have been available since 2009. That has put the companies at legal risk and has discouraged private investment in renewable energy. It also hasn't helped eagles since, without permits, companies are not required to take steps to reduce their impact on the birds or report when they are killed. Lethal: Wind farms like this one, in Maine, are now allowed to kill protected eagles . The new rule makes clear that revoking a permit — which could undermine investments and interest in wind power — is a last resort under the administration's energy policy. 'We anticipate that implementing additional mitigation measures ... will reduce the likelihood of amendments to, or revocation of, the permit,' the rule says. The wind energy industry has said the change mirrors permits already in place for endangered species, which are more at risk than bald and golden eagles. Bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list in 2007 but are still protected under two federal laws. The regulation published Friday was not subjected to a full environmental review because the administration classified it as an administrative change. 'The federal government didn't study the impacts of this rule change even though the (law) requires it,' said Kelly Fuller, who formerly headed the wind campaign at the American Bird Conservancy. 'Instead, the feds have decided to break the law and use eagles as lab rats.' However, the Fish and Wildlife Service said the new rule will enable it to better monitor the long-term environmental effects of renewable energy projects. No longer protected: Eagles like this one would be well-advised to steer clear of wind farms . 'Our goal is to ensure that the wind industry sites and operates projects in ways that best minimize and avoid impacts to eagles and other wildlife,' the agency said in a statement. Last month, Duke Energy Corp. pleaded guilty to killing eagles and other birds at two wind farms in Wyoming, the first time a wind energy company had been prosecuted under a law protecting migratory birds. A study by federal biologists in September found that wind farms since 2008 had killed at least 67 bald and golden eagles, a number that the researchers said was likely underestimated. That did not include deaths at Altamont Pass, an area in northern California where wind farms kill an estimated 60 eagles a year. It's unclear what toll, if any, wind energy companies are having on eagle populations locally or regionally. Gunshots, electrocutions and poisonings almost certainly kill more bald and golden eagles than wind farms. But the toll could grow along with the industry. A recent assessment of the status of the golden eagle in the western U.S. showed that populations have been decreasing in some areas but rising in others.","The decision was made out of reluctance to prosecute such cases of wind farms harming protected eagles .
The permits would be reviewed every five years, and companies would have to submit reports of how many eagles they killed .
The Fish and Wildlife Service said the new rule will enable it to better monitor the long-term environmental effects of renewable energy projects ."
"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:12 EST, 6 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 6 December 2013 . A long-awaited study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms a link between tainted tap water at a U.S. Marine Corps base in North Carolina and increased risk of serious birth defects and childhood cancers. The study released late on Thursday by the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry surveyed the parents of 12,598 children born at Camp Lejeune between 1968 and 1985, the year drinking-water wells contaminated with chemicals from a leaky fuel depot and a dry cleaner were closed. Even though parents of children born in the 1950s and early 1960s were not surveyed, the water was contaminated from August 1953 through December 1987. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, in the early 1980s it was discovered that two of the base's water supplies were contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE), a metal degreaser, and perchloroetheylene (PCE), a dry cleaning agent. Camp Lejeune has since been cleaned up and now has a clean and highly regulated water source . Anna (left) and Susan (right) underwent surgery while Susan was still pregnant with her to correct an opening on Anna's spinal cord that was the result of spina bifida . Wral.com reports that parents reported 106 cases of serious birth defects and childhood hematopoietic cancers. Of those, researchers said they could obtain medical records to confirm the diagnoses in only 52 cases . ABC Cleaners turned out to be the primary source of the TCE and PCE contamination in the well water provided to Tarawa Terrace, a military housing development. But subsequent testing revealed even more extensive pollution from an outdated, poorly maintained fuel farm in the Hadnot Point area, where the Naval hospital and housing for most of the enlisted men and their families were located . The worst of the contamination occurred during the height of the Cold War. But records suggest that toxic substances began leaking — or were being intentionally dumped — into the ground almost immediately after the Department of War carved a spot for the 1st Marine Division out of the coastal pine forest at the mouth of the New River in late 1941. The Veterans Affairs website says that honorably discharged veterans who are able to prove they served in Lejeune during the period of contamination (August 1953-December 1987) may be eligible for compensation. Disability compensation is processed on a case by case basis. Evidence must show that the Veteran has a current disease and that the illness is thought by a doctor to be related to the water contamination. The CDC study concludes that babies born to mothers who drank the tap water while pregnant were four times more likely than normal to have such serious birth defects as spina bifida. Babies whose mothers were exposed also had an elevated risk of such childhood cancers as leukemia. The water contamination at Camp Lejeune is once of the largest ones in history . The cause of childhood Leukemia is not always known, but yesterday the CDC found a definite link between the illness and the contaminated water at Lejeune . According to Mayoclinic.com spina bifada is a birth defect that affects the neural tube in the embryonic structure that eventually becomes the bay's brain, spinal cord, and surrounding tissue. If spina bifida is severe, surgery may be necessary but may not entirely alleviate the problem. Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. The cause of Leukemia is not entirely known but exposure to chemicals, such as the ones in the tap water at Cap Lejeune between 1968 and 1985, is one surefire cause. Civilian Bob Lowder, head of environmental quality for the base, said that nowadays Lejeune drinking water is probably, 'the safest and most tested drinking water' people could find. 'We probably have the most aggressive sampling regime for our drinking water than anybody else in the nation,"" he says. 'Maybe in the world.'","In the early 1980s it was discovered .

Slapping a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks would cut the number of fat Britons by more than a quarter of a million, claim experts. Researchers say a price hike would drive down sales of the sugary beverages and therefore benefit the nation’s health. A new study claims a 20 per cent tax on sugar-sweetened drinks would reduce the number of adults who are obese or overweight by 285,000. Wide load: Slapping a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks would cut the number of fat Britons by more than a quarter of a million, claims a new report by experts from a range of groups including Oxford and Reading universities . The tax would raise £276million a year to help the NHS cope with the burden of obesity-related illnesses, says the report. People aged 16 to 30 would be most affected as they are the highest consumers of soft drinks. There have been growing calls for a tax on soft drinks with high sugar content as a way of cutting the rise in obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Researchers said the tax ‘is predicted to reduce the number of people in the UK who are obese by 1.3 per cent or 180,000 people, and the number who are overweight or obese by 0.9 per cent or 285,000 people’. The overall fall in the number of overweight and obese people would be 2.2 per cent, says the study published on Bmj.com. The report, which was carried out by researchers at the British Heart Foundation, Health Promotion Research Group at the University of Oxford and the Centre for Food Security at the University of Reading, estimates that a sugar tax would put 12p on a 330ml can bought in a supermarket. A typical soft drink contains between six and 15 teaspoons of sugar, with one teaspoon containing 16 calories. The . price of a 500ml bottle of Coca-Cola, which contains 210 calories and . 14 teaspoons of sugar, would rise from £1.15 to £1.38. And 500ml of Ribena, which has 13 teaspoons of sugar, would jump from £1.18 to £1.42. In an accompanying editorial for Bmj, Jason Block, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, backed a proposal by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges for Britain to pilot the effects of a one year 20 per cent tax on soft drinks. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the BHF, which helped fund the study, said: ‘Guzzling fizzy drinks is now the daily norm for around 40 per cent of 13-year-olds. 'The effects on young people’s health are a major concern. ‘This research suggests that a health-related food duty, alongside other measures such as the new front of pack food labelling scheme, could be an effective way – particularly in young people – to help reduce obesity.’ However, critics dismissed the tax proposal, saying it would only affect a minority of the population. Catherine Collins, Principal Dietitian at St George’s Hospital NHS Trust, said the tax might have a marginal effect on ‘cola addicts’. She added: ‘For the rest of us, sadly, this approach would have very little impact on adult weight management. 'Why? Because government data shows the incidence of obesity rises with increasing age, peaking in the 45-74 age group.’ Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics, School of Medicine, King’s College London, said it was ‘very naive’ to think tax could so easily manipulate calorie intake. ‘The cost of sugar-sweetened beverages is currently so low that any price increase would be so marginal that it would be unlikely to affect intake,’ he said. ‘You can buy 3 litres of orange squash (28 per cent sugar) for £1 in discount stores.’","Researchers say price hike would drive down sales of sugary beverages .

Hoax: Neil McArdle, 36, was jailed for 12 months after he sparked a bomb scare at his wedding venue rather than tell his fiancée he had failed to finalise their marriage plans at St George's Hall, Liverpool . A groom who made a hoax call pretending explosives were hidden at his wedding venue just days after the Boston bombings has been sentenced to a year in prison. Neil McArdle sparked the bomb scare because he did not want to tell his bride-to-be that he had failed to finalise their wedding plans. The 36-year-old, who has been jailed for 12 months, has been criticised by a Judge who told him that his call 'struck terror' into venue staff, who would have had the explosions in Boston at the forefront of their minds. Panic-stricken McArdle had telephoned St George's Hall in Liverpool and told how explosives had been planted in the building to hide his blunder with the booking because he could not face telling his fiancée. Bride-to-be Amy Williams turned up to . the famous Grade II listed venue wearing her white dress, only to discover the . venue for her big day was swarming with police. Although . the couple had pencilled in a date at the iconic building, the . embarrassed groom realised he had not filled in the ‘right to marry’ forms to legalise the marriage. McArdle, of Kirkby in Merseyside, admitted making a hoax call in a panic, from a phone box near his home. He told a receptionist: 'There’s a bomb in St George’s Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes.' Following the call the building was placed on lock down while bomb disposal units and police officers searched the venue from top to bottom. However, when the building was re-opened later in the day, the venue confirmed that no booking for the wedding had been made. McArdle had planned to marry Miss . Williams at Liverpool Register Office, which is situated within the . listed St George’s Hall, on April 24. It is understood McArdle and Miss . Williams are still together but, six months on from the incident, have . still not tied the knot and have no plans to do so. Threats: McArdle called the Grade II-listed St George's Hall in Liverpool and told staff that there were explosives hidden inside the famous building . Plans: McArdle and his fiancée had pencilled in a date to get married at the hall, but he never filled in the 'right to marry' forms to legalise the marriage . He pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at an earlier hearing at Liverpool Crown Court. Sentencing McArdle today, Judge Norman Wright said: 'I just don’t accept that the penny dropped on the night before the wedding. 'You are an intelligent man with a degree. Maybe there was an ambivalence in your mind about the wedding and suddenly you got yourself into quite a predicament. 'It seems that you buried your head in the sand until the day of the wedding.' The judge said that the hoax call had been made just days after two explosions went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, leaving three dead, and that the tragedy 'must have been at the very forefront of peoples’ minds'. He added: 'Your call to St George’s Hall must have struck sheer terror in the heart of the person that received the call and fear in the minds of the people who are charged with the responsibility of the safety of people inside the building. 'You knew that the wedding couldn’t take place and you didn’t try to level with your partner. 'Instead, you tried to weasel your way out of the situation. 'It seems there was a betrayal of trust in your relationship. I hope you learn from this experience but you have to understand that bomb hoaxes are extremely serious.'","Neil McArdle, 36, pretended explosives were hidden at his wedding venue .

Bailey then began gyrating on his stomach before he flipped over and began masturbating while having a toke on his crack pipe. Leslie Bailey was caught on a train in San Fransisco on his knees having sex with a train seat (file picture) When he eventually realised he had been caught, he apologised to the operator for smoking but his genitals were still hanging out from underneath his shirt. The incident happened on a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train travelling from Dublin-Pleasanton. Bailey was arrested by police and his crack pipe was confiscated. Bailey's attorney, Emily Dahm, said Baily had been taking anti-psychotic medication and binging on crack cocaine. The incident happened on a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train travelling from Dublin-Pleasanton . She argued that he was trying to have a private moment on the nearly empty carriage and that he was not trying to attract public attention. Prosecutors must prove that the defendant was seeking attention to successfully have someone convicted of felony indecent exposure. Court records show that Bailey was convicted of felony indecent exposure in 2007 in San Francisco. However, he was convicted of misdemeanor lewd acts and released. It is not known if the seat in question has been removed from the train. This is not the first time people have been known to get up close and personal with a mode of transport. Edward Smith, from Washington State, admitted having sex with 1,000 cars back in 2008. He claimed to first have sex with a car at the age of 15 and said he had never been attracted to men or women. His 'girlfriend' at the time was a white Volkswagen Beetle named Vanilla. Daniel Cooper, 24, from Wales, was banned from going out at night in September after he stripped naked and simulated a sex act against a Land Rover Discovery.

The Internal Revenue Service has paid out . more than $110 billion in tax credits over the past decade to people who . didn't qualify for them, a Treasury report has revealed. The Earned Income Tax Credits . were intended for poor working families but the report showed that one in five dollars paid out under the scheme was given to people who didn't deserve them. In a statement, IRS inspector . general J.

'The IRS must do a better job of reining in improper payments in this and in other programs,' he said. Mistakes: An IRS report has revealed that one in five dollars paid out under an anti-poverty tax credit scheme was given to people who didn't deserve them. This totals at $110 billion over ten years . Using IRS statistics, the . inspector general's report provides an estimated range of improper EITC . payments from 2003 through 2012. The report says the IRS paid out at . least $110.8 billion in improper payments during the period, and perhaps . as much as $132.6 billion. The IRS says it is impossible to know . the exact amount of improper EITC payments without auditing all 27 . million taxpayers who received them, which isn't feasible. The . amount of improper payments grew during the recent economic slump, . hitting at least $15.3 billion in 2010, the report said. For 2012, the . improper payments totaled between $11.6 billion and $13.6 billion. IRS . efforts to pay out the right amount are hampered by unscrupulous tax preparers as well as honest . families that have trouble figuring out how to calculate the complicated . credit, the report said. Probe: IRS Inspector General J. Russell George, who wrote the report, said the results were 'disturbing' 'The IRS appreciates the inspector . general's acknowledgement of all our work to implement processes that . identify and prevent improper EITC payments,' the IRS said in a . statement. The Earned Income Tax Credits - one of the nation's largest anti-poverty programs - are intended to transfer money to the working poor through the tax system. The . credit is attractive because, if it is larger than your total income tax . bill, the IRS will pay you the difference. This is especially helpful . to low-income families because many pay little or no federal income tax. Families . earn the credits by working and earning money, though there are income . limits. The size of the credit depends on your income and the number of . children you have. This year, a married couple with three or more . children can earn up to $51,567 and still qualify for the credit. A . married couple with two children can earn up to $48,378 and still . qualify, according to the IRS. The maximum credit this year is . $6,044 for families with three or more children. The maximum credit for . families with two children is $5,372. 'Every year, the IRS conducts 500,000 EITC audits as part of a . broader enforcement strategy, and EITC claims are twice as likely to be . audited as other tax returns.' The agency said it prevents 'nearly $4 billion in improper claims each year and is committed to . continuing to work to reduce improper claims'. The EITC is one of . the nation's largest anti-poverty programs. In 2011, more than 27 . million families received nearly $62 billion in credits.

The basic Apple 1 machine was the 46th of 50 that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built together in Jobs' bedroom at his parents house - and one of only 11 still existing. The computer, described as the best Apple 1 in the world, sold for £206,000 at an auction. Retro: The Apple 1 was one of only 50 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built to sell at a local shop . Auctioneers are being tight lipped on the identity of the buyer but revealed it was a 'young CEO of an American company similar to Apple.' They said the buyer felt he was in a similar situation to Jobs and Wozniak, who catapulted Apple from humble beginnings to the world's most valuable brand. The device was being sold by an American computer enthusiast who had owned it for 30 years. Sold along with it was a remarkable 1976 photo showing the 50 Apple 1s stacked up in boxes in Jobs' bedroom, representing the humble beginnings of the Apple empire. Uwe Breker, from auctioneers Team Breker in Cologne, Germany, said: 'We were expecting this Apple 1 to go for a bit more - after all, there are only 11 in the world and this is the best of the best. 'But that's just the way the market works. Similarities: Both Steve Jobs (left) and Mark Zuckerberg (right) had incredible success with their creations . 'The buyer was very surprised to have got the Apple 1 at that price but very happy he did. 'We can't reveal the buyer's name but he is the young CEO of an American world-leading company similar to Apple and sees a lot of similarities between himself and Steve Jobs. 'The Apple 1 is a symbol of the American dream and I think the buyer saw this purchase as a way of keeping that dream alive.' Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, was 21 when he and Wozniak sold the Apple 1s for £420 each in 1976. The devices were built on order for a local computer shop called The Byte Store before Jobs and . Wozniak moved their makeshift operation downstairs to his garage. A far cry from today's high-tech Apple devices, they came with a separate monitor, keyboard, motherboard and cassette player to load programmes and only had 8K of memory, not even enough to store one song. Yet the primitive machine gave birth to the Apple empire, including the MacBook, iPod, iPhone and iPad. The Byte Store's advertising slogan for the Apple 1 was 'Take a byte from an apple'. It is believed this inspired Apple's famous logo of an apple with a chunk bitten out of it.

I scrolled through the timeline and there was a photo of my boyfriend which had been tagged 'my baby' by a woman I didn't know. I posted a comment saying ""Who's baby?"" Diet starts here: She decided to lose weight after discovering her man had been cheating and is now a size 8, weighing 9st, right . Minutes later she received a private message from the woman asking Cassie how she knew him. When Cassie replied that he was her long-term boyfriend, she was shocked when the woman replied saying she was his girlfriend too. At first she didn't want to believe it: 'I convinced myself she was lying and just jealous because she fancied him.' 'I was angry with him, but I was angry with myself too. I had left myself go and I vowed to lose the weight' But then she found eight Facebook messages from different women all claiming to be dating her boyfriend. She confronted her man and was appalled when he admitted he had been cheating. But she was even more shocked when she looked at the profile pictures of the women he had seen behind her back. 'I wanted to know why he had cheated. I expected them all to be big girls like me because that was his thing. But they were all skinny minnies. It didn't make sense,' she said. When she asked him why, he told her he 'used to like big girls but now preferred skinny women.' 'He might as well have slapped me in the face, I was gutted,' Cassie recalled. 'I had spent the past four years eating everything thinking that he adored my curvy body when all the time he was slowly going off me. Moved on: Cassie was 10st 7lb, left, when she met her ex before gaining weight. Now she's slimmest she has ever been, right, and wasn't interested when her ex wanted her back . 'I was angry with him, but I was angry with myself too. I had left myself go and I vowed to lose the weight.' Cassie joined a gym and overhauled her diet. She said: 'Before I'd have a sausage and egg sandwich for breakfast followed by stacks of biscuits and a carton of fruit juice mid-morning before tucking into a jacket potato piled with cheese and coleslaw for lunch. Then a takeaway with bread and butter for dinner, as well as chocolate bars and packets of crisps as I watched TV in the evening. 'Instead I ate fruit for breakfast, a salad for lunch and chicken and vegetables for dinner. Snacks were out and I only drank water.' Using revenge against her ex as her . motivation, she stuck with her diet and exercise regime and the weight . began to fall off until she was a slim size 8, weighing nine stone. 'My confidence started to grow. I noticed other men seemed interested in me and stopped thinking about my ex so much,' she said.

'He walked over and I laughed and said to him ""you didn't recognize me did you?"" He admitted he hadn't and told me I looked amazing. 'He asked me if I fancied going out some time. Once I would have done anything to hear those words but I suddenly realised I just didn't care anymore. 'I said ""no thanks"" and walked away. Knowing his eyes were on my size eight bum as I walked off was the best feeling in the world. I haven’t seen him since and have no desire to.

Under attack: Clegg's 72-hour U-turn has drawn criticism from both his Conservative colleagues and his own party . Nick Clegg is under attack from the . Tories and even his own party after performing a 72-hour . U-turn on the Government’s flagship education policy. The Deputy Prime Minister was accused by one Government source of attempting to cling on to ‘chauffeurs and people greasing up to him’ by pandering to Labour in the hope of keeping his job in a Lib-Lab coalition after 2015. In the strongest condemnation of Mr Clegg since the coalition was formed, the source said his name had ‘become a byword for cheap sanctimony, opportunism, gimmicks and lying’. Jeremy Browne, the former Lib Dem Home Office minister, insisted the free schools programme now being criticised by Mr Clegg was ‘liberal with a small “l”’ and should be supported. Mr Clegg yesterday broke ranks with the Conservatives, declaring he will no longer support the fundamental principles of free schools, which have been set up by businesses, charities, religious organisations and groups of parents free from state control. He said he disagreed with several of the most important freedoms exercised by free school heads, including their power to set their own curriculum and hire teachers without union-recognised qualifications. Incredibly, his remarks came days after Lib Dem education minister David Laws enthusiastically praised the scheme, which has been largely opposed by Labour, in the Commons. Last Thursday, Mr Laws suggested the freedom to hire who they wanted had allowed free schools to take on ‘superb’ staff. But Mr Clegg suggested that the Lib Dem manifesto for the 2015 election will include a ‘parental guarantee’ that children in all schools are taught by qualified teachers, follow the national curriculum, and receive high-standard school meals. Mr Clegg said that the Tories are failing to apply the ‘minimum amount of basic standards’ to free schools by allowing them to employ whoever they want. He is expected to expand on the . remarks in a speech on Thursday in which he will criticise the Tory . ‘ideology’ which he says means free schools and academies have too much . freedom. The Deputy Prime Minister admitted . that his words on free schools contradict current Government policies, . but claimed the difference was not damaging. ‘It’s an open, grown-up . difference. It’s not a crisis,’ he said. One . Government source said: ‘It's no surprise that Nick Clegg - a man whose . name is a byword for cheap sanctimony, opportunism, gimmicks and lying - . wants to grab back power for MPs to meddle in schools. ‘Michael . Gove has pushed through academies to embed state schools' independence . from the meddling of MPs like Clegg - so he will never accept Clegg's . latest stunt as a serious policy. 'All . Clegg ever cares about in meetings is politics - never policy. He loves . the chauffeurs and people greasing up to him and he will try anything . to cling onto a cushy job if Miliband wins. But whenever he promises . anything, people should just think - how much was his cast iron promise . on tuition fees worth?' Conservative . planning minister Nick Boles, meanwhile, suggested Mr Clegg was a . hypocrite because he did not want state schools to have the same . freedoms enjoyed by his expensive private alma mater, Westminster . School. ‘Clegg thinks that . the freedoms enjoyed by his old school are too good for free schools. Don't look to Lib Dems to defend your freedoms, folks,’ he said. Mr Boles added that Mr Clegg, who sacked Mr Browne earlier this month to the dismay of those on the Right of his party, said the Deputy Prime Minister was ‘rejecting true Liberals’. Mr Browne, appearing on the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme, suggested that Mr Clegg was trying to distance the Lib Dems from some parts of the coalition agenda in order to appeal to left-leaning voters and party activists. ‘I support free schools. Free schools is a small ‘l’ liberal policy. I don’t want us to feel that we have to echo the policy positions of the Labour left… and crave the approval of columnists like Polly Toynbee [of the Guardian]. ‘I don’t want us to be a pale imitation of the Labour Party, I think we should be a proud and unambiguously liberal party. ‘If we look like a party that is uneasy and ambivalent about our role in government, people won’t give us credit for the successes of the government and we won’t be able to claim the authorship that we should be able to claim for our policy successes in government.’ Out of step: Clegg's outburst comes just a couple of days after Lib Dem education minister David Laws praised the scheme in the Commons last Thursday . Richard Cairns, headmaster of the independent Brighton College,  said: ‘I strongly believe that teachers are born not made and I will actively seek out teachers from all walks of life who have the potential to inspire children. ‘We have 39 teachers without formal teaching qualifications, including me. Some have come straight from university: our History and politics department has three recent graduates, all with Firsts from Oxford or Cambridge and all excellent teachers. Others have come from other careers: an investment analyst, a lawyer, a management consultant, a nuclear physicist and someone from the BBC.’ Langley Free School appointed a professional actor as a drama teacher, and a professional singer for music, while West London Free School has appointed the former head of classics at a renowned independent school, as its classics teacher. They have also appointed an artist with several degrees as an art teacher. Education minister Liz Truss said it was a ‘shame’ some Lib Dems did not back free schools and suggested Mr Clegg was pretending to be opposed to elements of the programme to appease left-wing activists. She said the ‘whole point’ of the schools was ‘that hey have these freedoms... that's what's helping them outperform maintained schools’. ‘You shouldn't kill of the goose that's laid the golden egg,’ she added. Tristram Hunt, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, said: ‘Michael Gove and David Cameron's divisive free schools programme is unravelling for all to see. But Nick Clegg is locked in to this failure too. It is his policies that have led to the mess we saw at the Al-Madinah free school earlier, the looming crisis in teacher recruitment and the 141 per cent rise in unqualified teachers since 2010. ‘What is clear is that Labour's policies of ensuring that all teachers should be qualified and that schools are subject to proper local oversight are the right ones for educating our children.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Free schools are raising standards and giving parents more choice. They are run by teachers – not local bureaucrats or Westminster politicians – and are free to set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job. This Government is not going to take these freedoms away. ‘Independent schools have always been able to hire brilliant people who have not got qualified teacher status. Free schools and academies now have the same freedoms as independent schools to hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists so they can inspire their pupils.’","Clegg made attack on the government's flagship education policy .

A family home was left covered in tumbleweeds this week after wind storms swept through west Texas. Frustrated homeowner Josh Pitman was expecting to spend the entire week clearing away the debris, which had piled up to the roof on one side of his house. Mr Pitman said it was the 'most ridiculous thing' he has ever seen, with the giant balls of dry plants also covering a large part of his garden. Scroll down for video . Where the wind blows: Tumbleweed covers the home of Josh Pitman following wind storms in Midland, Texas . Clean up: Mr Pitman had to clear away the plants on his own because the fire service classes it as yard waste . 'Ridiculous': Mr Pitman was alerted to the build up of tumbleweed at his home in a text message from his wife . But he has been left removing the tumbleweed by himself, with the fire service arguing that because it was on his land, it is classed as yard waste. Tumbleweeds can be formed by a number of plants that break away from their roots when mature and are carried by the wind. The plants curl into a ball when dry and uncurl when moist and are a common sight in steppe and desert areas, such as large parts of Texas and Arizona. It is because of the abundance of tumbleweeds in the more barren parts of North America that they have become a symbol of isolation. One of most common tumbleweeds in the U.S. is the Russian thistle, which is not native to North America. It was brought over by accident by migrants from the Ukraine, who settled in South Dakota in the 19th Century. Tumbleweed seeds, foliage and stems are eaten by a number of desert dwellers, including quail, ground squirrels, pocket mice, prairie dogs, kangaroo rats and mule deer. He also revealed the problem could have been averted, where it not for the fact that he had pulled down a fence, which would have blocked the unwelcome visitors. Mr Pitman said: 'You live here, the risks you take I guess. We're definitely in West Texas, where the wind blows.' The bizarre sight in Midland came on Monday as 60mph winds wreaked havoc across the Permian Basin area. Emergency services were called into action as roofs were ripped off buildings and vehicles flipped onto their sides. Mr Pitman was alerted to the tumbleweeds on Monday by his wife, who had sent her husband a text message. Speaking at the house, Mr Pitman told News West 9: 'It's just completely covered with tumbleweeds, most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I didn't even know this many tumbleweeds existed . Mr Pitman cleared the tumbleweeds by pushing them into a ditch behind his house, having been told he would have to deal with the problem on his own. He added: 'I called the fire department and they said that since it was on my yard, it was considered yard waste and that I had to take care of it. Wind storms: The bizarre sight came as 60mph winds wreaked havoc across western Texas this week . Unexpected: The homeowner had knocked down a fence which would have kept the tumbleweeds out . 'They or the city wouldn't be able to do anything. So I figured, I got to do what I got to do.' Tumbleweed is the name given to a number of plants which detach from their roots at maturity, and are carried by the wind. They form balls when they are dry and uncurl when moist. The plants are mostly associated with isolated desert areas of the United States, largely thanks to their regular appearances in Westerns. But North America's most common tumbleweed, the Russian thistle, is not native to the continent. It was instead brought over by accident by migrants from the Ukraine in the 19th Century. The strong winds also brought problems in Stanton, where a grounded helicopter was flipped upside down, while a motorist had to be freed from an overturned truck in Martin County.

Tony Blair last night admitted the Iraq War had made him a hate figure in Britain – and acknowledged it had failed to make the world a safer place. In a frank interview to mark the tenth anniversary of the conflict, the former prime minister said members of the public were still ‘very abusive’ towards him over his decision to take Britain to war alongside George W. Bush. Mr Blair acknowledged that the situation in Iraq was still ‘not nearly what it should be’, with the country suffering almost daily terrorist attacks. War talk: Tony Blair shakes the hand of George Bush in 2001 in Maryland . But he said he had ‘given up’ trying to persuade people he had made the right decision. And he insisted the situation would have been even worse if Saddam Hussein had been left in power. He made no apology for the conflict, which cost 179 British lives and led to the deaths of more than 100,000 Iraqis. And he suggested the West was in the middle of a ‘generational’ conflict which may also require military intervention in Syria and Iran. His comments sparked anger among opponents of the war.

It has gone down in British military history as one of the most astonishing triumphs - achieved against almost impossible odds. The heroic defence of the isolated British outpost of Rorke's Drift fewer than 150 colonial soldiers against the onslaught of up to 4,000 Zulu warriors resulted in 11 Victoria Crosses awarded for only a few hours of fierce fighting. And now, more than 130 years after the crucial battle, which was immortalised in the Michael Caine film Zulu, a new eyewitness account of the battle's bloody aftermath has emerged. The famous defence of Rorke's Drift house, pictured shortly after the heroic battle to defend the British outpost from the onslaught of upto 6,000 Zulus, resulted in 11 Victoria Crosses being awarded for valour . The heroic defence of Rorke's Drift was immortalised in the 1964 film Zulu staring Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead -  who was in joint command of the British outpost when it was almost overrun by upto 6,000 Zulu warriors on 23 January 1879 and one of the 11 soldiers to receive a Victoria Cross for gallantry as a result . An astonishing collection of drawings created by a soldier fighting in the Anglo-Zulu war - part of a series of military campaigns aimed at subduing a number of African Kingdoms and bringing them under the control of the British Empire - are about to go up for auction. Among the extraordinary sketches is one of Rorke's Drift house, the venue for the famous pitched battle in a war by native Zulus to which turned the Anglo-Zulu war in the British Empire's favour. William Whitelock Lloyd went to war in South Africa in 1879 with a sketchbook and watercolours stashed in his kit bag. The . accuracy of his paintings is remarkable and he recorded the entire . conflict from his perspective with the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of . Foot. The sketches show troop movements and studies of the British soldiers and the Zulu warriors they were fighting. William Whitelock Lloyd captured this image of fortified British troops keep watch as the sun goes down during the Anglo-Zulu war . William Whitelock Lloyd not only caught the bloody aftermath of battle but also recorded an intimate painting of a Zulu woman, left, and a gripping image of a charging Zulu warrior, right . Lloyd's beautiful image of resting British troops, was one of many pictured from the Anglo-Zulu war sketched with astonishing accuracy . His . battalion was part of the second invasion of Zululand in May 1879, . travelling with Lord Chelmsford into the heart of Zulu territory. Second . Lieutenant Lloyd sketched their progress, from the temporary cavalry . camp in Dundee (Natal) and the troops crossing the Blood River into . Zululand. He depicted the troops advancing to Ulundi - Zulu King Cetshwayo's capital - and the battle there where 1,500 tribesmen were killed. He . recorded the early skirmishes of the battle, the Zulus' advance, the . burning of Ulundi, the retreat of the Zulus and some of the prisoners . after battle. He also drew paintings showing the British defeat at Isandlwana where almost 1,300 British soldiers were . killed by a Zulu force of 20,000 determined to expel the invaders from . their homeland on January 22, 1879. A group of British soldiers are pictured on reconnaissance duties in Zulu territory, in this picture which forms part of an amazing collection of drawings by William Whitelock Lloyd chronicling the Anglo-Zulu war . On the same day in history, British forces also pulled off a rearguard stunning victory at the battle of Rorke's Drift, where 110 men defended a hospital post against 3,000-4,000 Zulus. The clash took place near . a drift, or ford, on the Buffalo River, which at the time formed the . border between the British colony of Natal and the Zulu kingdom, in . modern-day South Africa. He arrived shortly after the battle, which was made famous in . the film 'Zulu' starring Michael Caine who played Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead -  who was in joint command of the British outpost. With . the Zulus posing a threat to the stability of the region and standing . in the way of a confederation of the various colonies, war was . deemed necessary by the British Government. Between January and July the British won victory and ended the life of an independent Zulu nation. The British had 1,727 soldiers killed while the Zulus lost upwards of 6,000. The archive is being sold at auction by its private owner and is expected to fetch £60,000. Gabriel . Heaton from Sotheby's, which is selling the collection in London, said: . 'There are 100 watercolour paintings and some done in pen and ink. 'One . gets the impression that Lloyd was far more interested in art than in . war and as far as we know he was not an official artist and just took . his paints with him. 'He had gone to Oxford with Oscar Wilde but failed his exams and joined the army and went to South Africa. 'He was at Rorke's Drift shortly after the defence and recorded what he saw in the immediate aftermath. 'The . astonishing thing is how accurate his paintings were. The historian . David Rattray studied the locations and confirmed their accuracy. Mr Heaton added: 'He was a farmer who lives on the site of the battle and was murdered at his home in KwaZulu-Natal. 'They are good quality watercolours and some show how he had gone off to get good views of the troops and their movements. 'Whether he had permission or just went off we're not sure, but watercolour is a good medium for doing things quickly. 'As well as the views of the battlefields and topography and lines of troops, there are others of the soldiers. 'One shows daybreak at Helpmekaar where the battalion stayed and you can see the men and the mealy bags they used for defence.'The ones of Rorke's Drift house were done shortly afterwards and they show men sitting around outside. The defence of the British outpost of Rorke's Drift, in modern day South Africa, proved a turning point in the Anglo-Zulu war . 'The archive will be of interest to collectors as well as institutions.' The historian David Rattray wrote of the paintings after he discovered them in 2000: 'From the moment I laid eyes on the copies of Lloyd's paintings, I realised that his artwork was accurate to an extraordinary degree. 'The more famous landmarks were, of course, instantly recognisable, but I was fairly confident that we would find the locations of all his paintings.' He identified all the locations and photographed them and later published his results in a book. He was murdered by intruders in front of his wife at his house in his world-famous tourist lodge at Fugitives' Drift.

David Cameron yesterday joined the attacks on the Guardian for publishing secret files that have put national security at risk. The Prime Minister threw his full weight behind MI5 director-general Andrew Parker who has warned the leaks are a ‘gift’ to terrorists. MPs and security experts weighed in too, claiming the newspaper had exposed the UK’s intelligence secrets to Islamist fanatics and foreign spies. They said Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger had been naive to think it was harmless to publish the documents stolen by fugitive US agent Edward Snowden. Security sources pointed to remarks from the UK’s deputy national security adviser suggesting damage has already been done to Britain. Oliver Robbins, who reports directly to Mr Cameron, warned that revealing the techniques GCHQ uses to spy on terrorists may cause ‘widespread loss of life’. A No 10 spokesman – when asked whether Mr Cameron agreed with Mr Parker’s comments – said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe. I would happily point you to all parts of the director general’s speech.’ In another development, there were last night accusations of editorial bias at the BBC, which initially ignored the scathing criticisms of the Guardian. The corporation later offered Mr Rusbridger an interview on Radio Four’s World at One to defend his paper. He denied putting lives at risk and – defying security officials – said he would continue publishing top secret information, which the paper has been splashing across its front pages since June. Mr Rusbridger, who critics claimed was given an easy interview, said: ‘We are working slowly and responsibly but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate, the debate that everyone says is necessary, then we will go on publishing.’ Fury: The spy chief: MI5 director-general Andrew Parker has blasted the Guardian's publication of Britain's espionage capabilities . Security officials and MPs dismissed the suggestion that the newspaper was capable of knowing what would and would not assist Britain’s enemies. They pointed to a devastating legal submission drawn up by Mr Robbins in August. He said: ‘It is impossible for a journalist alone to form a proper judgment about what disclosure of protectively marked intelligence does or does not damage national security. ‘The fragmentary nature of intelligence means that even a seemingly innocuous piece of information can provide important clues to individuals involved in extremism or terrorism. ‘There is therefore a real risk that that publication or disclosure could cause unintended damage to that national security. Guardian newspaper editor Alan Rusbridger was described as 'naive' ‘It is worth reiterating the point that real damage has in fact already been done to UK national security by the media revelations (both in the UK and internationally).’ He said the leaking of the kind of top secret information held by the Guardian was likely to ‘lead directly to widespread loss of life’ and ‘to cause exceptionally grave damage to the effectiveness of security of the UK’. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of Westminster’s intelligence and security committee, also backed Mr Parker’s speech, which contained a warning that several thousand fanatics living in Britain see the public as a legitimate target. The former foreign secretary dismissed the idea that Snowden or journalists at the Guardian could judge which information it was safe to publish. ‘When we know that Snowden has over 50,000 classified documents relevant to UK interests the idea that he or others would be able identify which are damaging to national security is naive,’ he said. ‘Even knowing the technology that is available to GCHQ or MI5 or MI6 is valuable. Some of these terrorists are very, very smart. It’s not like the old days when communication could only be by letter or telephone call. ‘Unless they [the security services] are at the cutting edge of modern technology they will be behind the terrorists who are smart on encryption and trying to conceal what they are doing.’ Charlie Edwards, of the respected Royal United Services Institute, claimed the Guardian had been ‘wrong’ to ‘deliberately expose’ the UK’s intelligence secrets. He said: ‘The leaks we have seen from Snowden in the Guardian will provide information to terrorists, but also aggressive foreign intelligence agencies operating in the UK.’ The independent MP Patrick Mercer, a former Downing Street security adviser, said intelligence data should not be published if it compromised public security. GCHQ Headquarters. Thousands of classified documents about the NSA and GCHQ were published by The Guardian . Former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Some of the information was so sensitive that British agents had to be moved for their own safety . In August, police detained David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, for nine hours at Heathrow airport. Mr Miranda had been carrying intelligence files leaked by Snowden . ‘If in any way our security is compromised by revealing too much, that’s a mistake,’ he added. ‘Just imagine if we had revealed the whole Enigma secret during the Second World War.That might have been in the public’s interest – but we’d have lost the war.’ Mr Robbins’ remarks were made in a submission to judges in the case of David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was stopped at Heathrow in possession of at least 58,000 classified stolen documents. He had been ferrying them from a Snowden associate in Germany to Brazil, where he shares a home with Greenwald, the author of many of the controversial articles. Mr Robbins said the material was ‘highly likely to describe techniques crucial in life-saving counter-terrorist operations, and other activities vital to UK national security’.

A British-made electric motorcycle claims to be the first clean tech motorbike that can compete with other less environmentally friendly speedy bikes. The team behind the green motorbike has taken to the wide open roads of the U.S. this week to showcase its technology as part of a UK trade mission. Agility Global claims it has created a 100 per cent clean electric bike as an alternative to the conventional petrol-guzzling performance bike.

The Saietta R, which means 'thunderbolt' in Apennine Italian, can go from 0 to 60mph in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of 80mph. The bike is 80 per cent charged in an hour, uses a high-torque electric motor and can cover 74 miles (120km) in one charge, the company said. Its sleek, futuristic design means it would not look out of place in a James Bond film and the company’s founder said he has already had interest from a number of film franchises.

He describes the bike as the ‘world's first high-performance, clean tech motorcycle’. Mr Marazzi, 42, said the firm has been working with next generation electric technology over the past five years. ‘What sets us apart from our competitors is that we have started our design on a clean sheet of paper and the bike is not just derived from the format of traditional motorbikes, which makes us higher performance than a petrol bike,’ he said. The London-based business has transported its flagship model to Colorado to drum up interest in the motorbike-loving American market as it is looking for angel funding and needs investment to expand. Mr Marazzi said feedback so far on the trade mission had been ‘phenomenal’. ‘It's impossible to go anywhere without causing people to stop and stare - it's a real conversation starter,’ he said.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is set to target the Kent seaside seat of South Thanet at the next general election. Mr Farage will have to depose the incumbent Tory MP, Laura Sandys, who only won the seat in 2010. The leading Eurosceptic ran in the seat in 2005 but came a distance fourth. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is set to target the Kent seaside seat of South Thanet at the next general election . That was before UKIP’s surge in the polls, when it recently overtook the Liberal Democrats to become the third most popular party. In the May local elections, UKIP won seven out of eight local seats for the Kent county Council, eliminating all the Tories. Immigration is a key concern in the area after a rise in Polish migrants in recent years. South Thanet also has a higher than average number of pensioners, who might find UKIP’s right-of-centre politics appealing. UKIP hopes to win at least one Westminster seat in 2015 after its candidate came second in the Eastleigh by-election, beating the Tories into third place. Mr Farage was seriously injured when his light aircraft crashed during an election stunt when trying to unseat Commons speaker John Bercow in 2010 . Mr Farage, the South East England MEP, tried to unseat Speaker John Bercow in his Buckinghamshire seat at the last election. His dare-devil antics nearly cost him his life, however, as on election day a by-plane carrying him and his pilot crashed. Mr Farage was hospitalised with broken ribs and failed to win the seat. UKIP expected to do very well at the European elections next spring but observers point out that its backers may not automatically vote UKIP in the general election. South Thanet has swung between the Conservatives and Labour since the 1980s and is not unused to controversial MPs: Jonathan Aitken was once an MP for the constituency. Mrs Sandys, the local Tory incumbent told the Financial Times, who revealed Mr Thanet was poised to stand in South Thanet: ‘I am not like Nigel Farage, but I think that will help me. Bring it on.’ A UKIP spokesman said: ‘No decision will be made until after the European Parliament elections in May next year.’","Farage is MEP for South East England but has never been an MP .

A video has emerged of a motorist brandishing a baseball bat to confront members of a suburban Houston cycling team after allegedly hitting one of them with his car. Sherman Clark, 74, of Conroe, can be seen in the smartphone video wielding the aluminum bat after what the cyclists claim was a road rage incident where he ran one biker off the road and brake-checked another who seriously injured his wrist. The cyclists claim to be innocent victims of the old man’s anger, however, he disputes their version of events. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ready to rumble: Sherman Clark says the bat was for self-defense, the cyclist are not so sure . Members of the Woodlands Cycling Club Race Team claim 10 cyclists were riding single-file down the road where the altercation began, according to Fox 25. Cyclists say Mr Clark pulled in front of them and hit the brakes. Once he saw me in his mirror, he veered right and slammed on the brakes. I had no time to react,’  Rick Savageau told KHOU. 'Rick has nowhere to go because he's going 25mph,' Cyclist Steve Schoger told Click2Houston. 'Bang! He hits the pickup truck. He goes flying off of his bike. Ends up . breaking his wrist and having serious knee and shoulder injury as well,' Mr Schroger added. ‘I’m just going, this isn’t really happening is it?’ Mr Schoger said to KHOU. ‘This is like out of the movies.’ Booked: Mr Clark was handed two felony charges for the altercation . Frustrated: Mr Clark says his frustration with the bikers has been growing for some time . Mr Sauvageau fractured his wrist and injured both his shoulder and knee, he told the station. The video picks up shortly after Mr Clark stopped. Seen in the video holding a bat, the grandfather is asked why he has it. ‘To protect myself,’ Mr Clark replies. ‘What did we do wrong?’ The cyclist asks. ‘You were riding all over the damn road for one thing,’ an agitated Mr Clark snaps, waving the bat in the direction of the person taking the video. ‘You drove right past us, no problem,’’ another cyclist can be heard saying. ‘You got in front of us, didn't you… And then somebody tried, yeah, and you ran them off the road?’ ‘Yes, you're damn right,’ he replies. 'All over the damn road!': The grandfather is upset they always race on a local road, flouting traffic laws and ignoring motorists . Escape plan: The retiree hopped in his truck to drive off, threatening to run over cyclists if they didn't move . The next clip shows the retiree get into his pickup and drive away as cyclists kick the side of truck while he runs over one of the bikes, which local media estimated costs $5,000. Mr Clark defended his actions to MailOnline and disputed the cyclists version of events. ‘I pulled up to the side of them and rolled down my window and hollered ‘why don’t y’all get out of our neighbourhood?’ he said. He says he was surrounded by the cyclists when one of them slammed into the back of the truck because he was going too fast. He claims they have exchanged words with him in the past. ‘This guy that was shooting the video was questioning me like an attorney,’ he added. ‘They had my truck, totally circled, I got out with a baseball bat to have something to protect myself because there’s 10 of them, one of me,’ he explained. ‘I got back in my truck, said ‘I’m leaving, you can’t make stay here.

This was not the first incident Mr Clark has had with the group, he said he has exchanged profanities with them in the past as he grew frustrated with their ignorance of traffic laws and indifference to motorists.

Wine making is often though of as a fine and delicate art, but as these pictures show it requires a good amount of hard graft and a good head for heights. These workers on the Cruceiro Reixo and Cividade Cellar wine estates are harvesting Mencia grapes from precarious slopes near Monforte de Lemos in northwestern Spain. The only way up or down the dizzying canyons is on foot or riding in a tractor, and the grapes themselves are . transported in baskets suspended on wire down to the river below. These workers are on the Cruceiro Reixo plots harvesting Mencia grapes some of which will be used in the winemaker's Barrica Cruceiro Reixo red wine . The Romans were the first to grow grapes here 2,00 years ago as they marched across Europe, followed by monks . The dizzying slopes are so steep that they can only be accessed on foot by grape pickers who undertake the back-breaking work . Ramon Fernandez helps to harvest grapes on the slopes of land owned by his relative, Ramon Marcos Fernandez . On the banks of the Mino Hector de Leon carries a box of grapes at a Cruceiro Reixo's plot which produces red and white wine . They are then taken by boat back to the Adega Cruceiro Winery where they will be juiced and then fermented by Ramon Marcos Fernandez to make Cruceiro wines. The Mencia grapes are a red variety which produce the tradition wine of the region which has been making the alcoholic tipple for 2,000 years. The slopes were originally carved out by the Romans as they marched across Europe. Monks then took over and carved terraces of vines into the slopes of the rivers Sil, Miño and Bibei. These workers on the Cividade Cellar estate in Spain's Riberia Sacra region have to climb up and down the rocky slopes to reach the river which transports the grapes . As access to the slopes by vehicles is limited wine makers are forced to improvise, using makeshift pulley systems and boats to move their cargo . Jose Ramon (left), is the head winemaker for the Cividade cellar, and is pictured placing boxes of grapes inside a boat in the isolated region . Jose and his son Brais are just two producers in a region which now boasts tens of wineries producing thousands of bottles of wine a year . Jose Ramon (in red) drives a boat with his daughter, friends and boxes of grapes along the Sil River in the region of Amandi in Ribeira Sacra . However, in the 20th century a devastating plague of aphids killed off a lot of the plants before the Spanish civil war rocked the economy, leading to farmers deserting in droves. As a younger generation fled poverty on the slopes for a more prosperous life in the cities, nature moved in to reclaim the land which crumbled into disrepair. As recently as 2009 many of the terraces were abandoned, though producers had started moving back to the region, determined to make it a success once more. As fruit pickers continue their work on the stony banks, a boat speeds away taking grapes back to the Cividade winery for fermentation . The Cruceiro winery has won awards from both Spain and Italy since 1990 to recognise the quality of the wine it produces and its latest was given a distinction in 2011 . The banks around the river Mino need to have ladders fitted on to them so the labourers can climb up to where the grapes are growing . Once the grapes are back at the winery more workers sort through them on a conveyor belt to remove any spoiled or unripe ones before they are juiced . Jose Ramon pushes grapes down inside a barrel where they will sit while they ferment to make some of the region's most famous wines . Attracted by the indigenous grapes, the slate and granite soils and peculiar microclimates of the rivers and terraces, winemakers are now turning out some award-winning bottles. Dotting the old vineyards are lagares, crumbling stone structures that once provided shelter and a place to ferment grapes right in the vineyard. Every family would have a lagar, to which they would carry the grapes at harvest. Sometimes families would sleep there for the duration of harvest season and they are now being restored to use for storage and a place for vineyard workers to eat a meal away from the grueling heat of the sun. Because of the vallies and rivers of the region it has a unique micro-climate similar to Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy . In total 13 varieties of grape are grown in the region by more than 100 producers who call the breathtaking countryside home . Ramon Marcos Fernandez, the owner of the Adega Cruceiro wine estate enjoys the relative luxury of driving a tractor on the hills which are usually too steep for vehicles . The terraces have to be cut into the banks of the three rivers in the region because otherwise they would be impossible to work or plant on . Lagares are traditional stone huts built into the hills which are being restored to allow workers a place to relax from the heat or eat lunch with their fellow employees . The conditions found in Ribeira Sacra are similar to those found in some of the world's greatest wine regions such as Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy. So far this year 3,720 tonnes of Mencia grapes alone have been produced in the whole of the region, along with another 13 varieties being used to make both red and white wines. The term Ribeira Sacra means 'holy river bank' and harks back to a time when the hills were full of monks brewing wine, instead of the intrepid farmers of today. The hills are still littered with a multitude of medieval monasteries, churches and chapels which overlook the rivers or nestle in gentler terrain nearby.","Two wine estates in Spain's Riberia Sacra region are carved into the steep hills .

One in five immigrants in Europe arrives in Britain, shocking new figures have revealed. More than 560,000 people moved to Britain in 2011, the highest number in the EU and almost 20 per cent of all migrants moving in and around the continent. Most of the people moving to the UK come from outside the 27 European Union member states. One in five of all migrants in Europe settled in Britain in 2011, according to the European Commission's statistics body Eurostat . Latest figures from Eurostat, the . statistics body of the European Commission, reveal the full scale of . immigration across nations. In 2011, the UK topped the immigration league table welcoming 566,000 people, much higher than second place Germany which saw 489,400 migrants arrive. The next highest was Spain with 457,600, followed by Italy on 385,000 and France’s 267,000. Of those arriving in the UK, 174,100 were from elsewhere in Europe while 313,500 came from outside the EU – by far the largest number and three times the 90,000 who moved to France. Ministers have been under pressure to curb immigration, ahead of the relaxation of limits on Romania and Bulgaria next year. This graph shows the main countries of origin of non-nationals in EU countries in 2011 . Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday announced she was scrapping the dysfunctional UK Border Agency after a disastrous five years in which the backlog of immigration cases grew to 320,000. A Commons committee this week warned it would take 24 years to clear. David Cameron used a keynote speech on Monday to pledge to curb access to benefits, housing and the NHS to deter migrants moving to Britain. According to the Eurostat figures, just over 3 million people arrived in EU countries in 2011, either from around the globe or from other member states. It means that 18 per cent of all migrants settling in the EU choose Britain. Tough talk: David Cameron this week promised to curb benefits to deter migrants from coming to Britain while yesterday Theresa May told the Commons she was breaking up the dysfunctional UK Border Agency . UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The  statistical evidence is clear. The UK is clearly the one of the favourite ports of call for migration from within the EU. ‘According to the EU, almost half of the 4.8 million people living here who were born elsewhere came from other EU countries. ‘That is a city twice the size of Birmingham. And whatever Mr Cameron says, while we remain in the EU, there is absolutely nothing he can do about it,’ he told the Daily Express. The coalition insists that more recent figures show immigration into Britain has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a decade. The number of people coming to live here fell by 74,000 in the 12 months to June last year as curbs on students and workers from outside Europe began to bite. But Conservative MP Andrew Turner said the EU statistics were ‘alarming’. He told the newspaper: . ‘These levels are quite unsustainable. It shows that the Prime Minister’s drive to curb benefit levels for non-UK residents is desperately needed.  We must stop being the easy touch of Europe.’","Of 3 million migrants in the EU, 566,000 moved to the UK .

A mother-of-one with a cyst the size of a bowling ball on her uterus has overcome the debilitating condition to reach the finals of a curvy modelling contest. Elisha Perez, 37, from Greenwich in Connecticut, USA, was misdiagnosed by doctors who thought she was suffering from IBS. Over 15 years her condition continued to worsen, leaving her writhing in pain for hours at a time. Scroll down for video . Elisha Perez was misdiagnosed for years by doctors who thought she was suffering from IBS, now the mother-of-one has overcome a debilitating illness to feature in the final of a lingerie competition . She found it hard to walk, could hardly eat and had to struggle throughout the day and night to sleep and was eventually diagnosed with Adenomyosis - for which there is no known cure. After multiple consultations she decided to go ahead with an abdominal hysterectomy - the removal of her uterus and ovaries - to restrict the pain. The procedure was painful and frightening for Eliza but since the surgery she has found a new lease of life and felt confident enough to enter herself into the 'Star in a Bra' competition by fuller-figure lingerie firm Curvy Kate. She's, of course delighted to find herself in the final. Elisha, an administrative assistant, said: 'Every job I had I was in fear of losing because I was almost always late due to the fact I was incapacitated. 'I looked normal and healthy on the outside but inside I was losing a battle. By October 2012 I was in danger of losing a job for the third time and the pain was the worse it had ever been. 'After a trip to hospital and several large doses of painkillers - none of which worked - I accepted I would have to start the process of doctors, tests and medication again only this time I demanded certain things be done. Elisha found it hard to walk, could hardly eat and had to struggle throughout the day and night . 'Later that month after requesting an MRI I was told I had Ademomyosis and cysts on my ovaries, Adeno is a granular tissue disease - they don't really know what causes it and there's no cure. 'The uterus haemorrhages within the muscle and since it' in the muscle it doesn't shed, causing it to grow becoming larger and heavier. 'I was basically walking around with a small bowling ball in my pelvis. The weight of it was crushing my other organs and creating the digestive issues because the colon was in impinged. 'In the end they had to remove my entire uterus, ovaries and had to separate everything from my colon. I lost three organs including my gall bladder. 'One doctor also told me I was very lucky because had I waited much longer organs would have started to shut down.' Now recovering from her the ordeal Elisha says her confidence - although a work in progress - is starting to come back. She added: 'I feel like I get to start over - I was quite upset about feeling 'incomplete' as a woman and no longer having the option to make another baby which I really wanted. She was diagnosed with Adenomyosis - for which there is no known cure, and had multiple consultations . 'But then I looked in the mirror, the colour in my face had started to look healthier and I'm able to sleep through the night. It's the little things most people take for granted that I had to focus on. 'My daughter Ava is my blessing and my miracle. She has helped me to stay focused and love myself just as she does. 'It was that which gave me the energy to take a few minutes to put on eyeliner or lipstick or even put a little effort into my hair. I look in the mirror and I don't see less of a woman, I see a warrior, a survivor and a woman who still has much to explore. 'I decided to enter the competition because I loved that it was about real women & curves all shapes and sizes. I thought, how cool would it be to see a model I can relate to so why not me? 'I don't see women who are my shape and size and Curvy Kate has such beautiful designs so  I started to envision myself as a Pin Up for Curvy Kate. Elisha decided to go ahead with an abdominal hysterectomy to restrict the pain, and she has now been chosen as a finalist for fuller-figure lingerie firm Curvy Kate's annual 'Star in a Bra' competition . 'It's an opportunity of a life time - I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Quite frankly I was feeling rather confident and I felt that this would help me to continue focusing on the positive and moving forward. I want to be a role model why not a lingerie model as well.' A spokesman for Curvy Kate, said: 'The world is made up of different shapes and sizes and we feel not all sizes are represented. 'We want all our customers to feel that they are being catered for and that being above a D cup and curvy is something to be proud of.' Voting for the next Star in a Bra begins today and ends at midnight on November 19. The winner will be announced on November 21 and will gain a 12-month modelling contract with Curvy Kate and a year's supply of Curvy Kate lingerie.

"By . Paul Bentley and Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 18:21 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:53 EST, 4 November 2013 . The whistleblower at the centre of Labour’s vote-rigging scandal last night sensationally rejected claims by Unite that she had withdrawn her story. Lorraine Kane triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the Labour Party without their consent. It happened as Unite activists were waging a bitter battle to seize control of the safe Labour seat of Falkirk, where she lives. This led to claims that she and others had been signed up as Labour members without their agreement in a bid by the union to manipulate the candidates’ selection. They allegedly hoped to flood the seat with members who they thought could be persuaded to back Unite’s choice to be the party’s prospective MP. The whistleblower at the centre of the Labour vote-rigging scandal, which saw Karie Murphy (right) become the front-running candidate for the Falkirk seat vacated by Eric Joyce (left), says she has not withdrawn her story . Whistleblower Lorraine Kane, from Falkirk (pictured), Scotland, triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the Labour Party without their consent . The investigation into Mrs Kane’s case was dropped suddenly in September, after Unite officials produced documents stating that she had withdrawn her claims. But, speaking for the first time, Mrs Kane, 61, told the Mail: ‘I did not change the testimony. I did not change anything. I did not withdraw anything.’ She is now demanding to know whether the evidence she gave was tampered with by Unite. ‘I want all the emails to see what’s what,’ she said. ‘I haven’t seen them. This has been going on for months. I don’t know what the emails are saying. I want to see everything so I know what was said and if anything was changed from what I said.’ Her statement is entirely at odds with public claims made by the union. Only today Unite leader Len McCluskey said: ‘The evidence from the families has been withdrawn’, adding that Unite had ‘no case to answer.’ Mrs Kane’s bombshell claims appear to undermine the grounds on which Labour leader Ed Miliband closed his investigation into the vote-rigging allegations. They came as shocking evidence emerged of the practices Labour investigators uncovered at Falkirk. Labour has refused to publish its findings but yesterday leaked extracts of its initial inquiry were published. Only today, Unite leader Len McCluskey said that the 'evidence from the families has been withdrawn' They suggested that Unite activists falsified up to 112 membership documents, forging signatures on many, and ‘coerced’ and ‘badgered’ constituents into signing direct debit forms. In some cases they even paid the joining fees themselves to get more members on the books and established a secret system for signifying those signed up ‘specifically for the selection’. Last night Labour supporters and critics demanded that Mr Miliband publish the full report into the alleged vote-rigging. ‘We’ve heard umpteen reports, allegations, suppositions as to what did or did not happen. We can’t tell fact from fiction. We can’t tell what is and is not being spun,’ a local party spokesman said. ‘I want him to publish the report, the constituency wants him to publish the report, everyone I’ve spoken to wants him to publish the report. If errors have been made, then what you do is you get them on the table, you discuss them, you learn from them, and you move on.’ Conservative MP Priti Patel said: ‘These incendiary revelations show the full extent of Unite’s infiltration of the Labour party. But still Ed Miliband refuses to hold a proper inquiry, or to publish Labour’s internal report. This is further evidence that the Unite union tried to dupe Ed Miliband. ‘Yet despite calling it “bad practice”, Ed Miliband backed down in the face of pressure from Unite boss and Labour Party paymaster Len McCluskey. ‘From day one Miliband has shown that he is too weak to stand up to the trade unions. If Ed Miliband was forced into a deal with Unite to avoid bad publicity during this selection, how many other dodgy deals are being struck between Labour and their trade union paymasters?’ The Labour leader’s brother David Miliband said there was ‘no place’ for the style of politics being pursued by some trade unions. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Ed was right to say that he wants to reform the relationship with the unions. What you call “old politics”, rightly has no place, obviously.’ Mrs Kane wrote to Labour in March demanding to know how what information they had on her family after she discovered four of them had been enlisted as Labour members without signing any forms. Unite activist Stevie Deans, Labour’s Falkirk constituency chairman, was trying to get Karie Murphy – a close friend Mr McCluskey –selected as Labour candidate and allegedly started a recruitment drive. Ed Miliband's brother, David, said there was 'no place' for the style of politics being pursued by some unions . It is claimed that Mr Deans and Miss Murphy signed up people from the area - including the Kanes - without their knowledge. Last night it emerged that Mr Deans will not be seeking re-election as constituency chairman later this month. Linda Gow, who was running against Miss Murphy, acted as the intermediary with the Kanes in their original statements. ‘The statements were then allegedly changed,’ she told the Mail. ‘That’s murky. The Labour Party didn’t, as far as I’m aware, come back to ask the Kanes why they changed their statements, or if they changed their statements.’ After Mrs Kane made her claims, the affair was probed by Labour as well as the police. But Mr Miliband called off the investigation in September, claiming evidence from ‘key witnesses’ had been withdrawn. Key dates . His decision has come under increasing pressure. Last week emails showed Unite officials had themselves drafted the crucial new statement which exonerated them on Mrs Kane’s behalf. By speaking publicly for the first time, Mrs Kane has fatally undermined Unite’s claims that it has ‘no case to answer’. Unite has also faced furious criticism after the Mail last week revealed its shocking campaigns of bullying and intimidation against more than 60 businesses and the families and friends of bosses. Asked if there will be a new inquiry, a Labour spokesman said: ‘Information has been handed to the police. We think it is wise to let the process take its course.’","Whistleblower has rejected claims by Unite that she had withdrawn her story .

The family of a fit and healthy young woman who suddenly collapsed and died at work have paid tribute to the 'vibrant, sociable, witty and clever' 23-year-old. Stephanie McLean, from Gosforth, Newcastle, had been planning to run next year's London Marathon to raise money for the British Heart Foundation and had even had a swimming trial for the Athens Olympics in 2004. But her mother has now spoken of the pain of losing her child after she was struck down by sudden cardiac death. Lesley McLean, 62, said: 'It is just devastating to lose a child. It has been very painful for us all and there is now an emptiness that can never be filled. 'Stephanie had hardly started in life. She has lost her chance to have a career, get married and have children. It is so heartbreaking.' Miss McLean appeared to be fine as she worked at her desk at an online retailer in Wimbledon, London, before she collapsed and died in July this year. She was rushed to hospital but nothing could be done to save her life. Her mother received the news of her death while she was on holiday in France. She said: 'I got a call to tell me what had happened. It was dreadful and I flew back to Britain the next morning.' Miss McLean's oldest sister, Joanna, 31, said she had been in contact with her just hours before she died. She said: 'I was texting Stephanie the night before and I would never think that she was going to die the next day. That is something that you can never prepare yourself for. Miss McLean said she, her sister Stephanie and their other sister Katie, 25, were very close and would often do things together. She said: 'It is absolutely shattering what has happened and it has totally changed my life. We were friends as well as sisters and we were all part of each others lives. 'Stephanie’s death has left a massive gap that is never going to be filled, or could be filled. I love talking about Stephanie and want to talk about her as she will never be forgotten.' Tribute: Miss McLean's mother Lesley (right) and sister Joanna (left) have paid tribute to the 'vibrant and clever' 23-year-old . Miss McLean's main ambition was to be a writer and had been working as a copywriter for Lensestore, a contact lens and optical advice website, to gain experience. Miss McLean had been a competitive swimmer and even had a trial for the Athens Olympics in 2004. She . was also a keen netball player. The last time she saw her mother was . when she had travelled back to the North East for a netball match held . by her former school friends. 'Stephanie had hardly started in life. She has lost her chance to have a career, get married and have children. It is so heartbreaking' - Lesley McLean . Miss McLean had planned to run next year’s London Marathon in support of the British Heart Foundation. Her boyfriend, Harry Tulip, 26, is now doing the run in her memory. Mrs McLean said: 'I remember that Stephanie came home for the netball match and I was delighted to see her. 'When she left to go back to London I gave her a hug at the station and told her how much I loved her.' It is estimated that up to 12 young people die suddenly each week in the UK of cardiac abnormalities, also known as sudden death syndrome or sudden cardiac death. Sports activity in adolescents and young adults is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It is believed sports activity can trigger an adverse affect on the heart's rhythm in athletes. A charity walk in Durham for Cardiac Risk in Young People saw as many as 50 of Miss McLean's friends and relatives take part to raise awareness of sudden cardiac deaths in young people and raise funds to support medical research into the causes of the condition. More than £11,000 has so far been raised by friends and relatives in memory of Miss McLean. Her sister Joanna said: 'We want to raise the profile of young sudden cardiac deaths and make people aware that pre-emptive heart screening is available through CRY at their national screening days.' Miss McLean's sister and mother have both said more heart screening should be available for young people. They have said they have also been 'overwhelmed' by the generous support of Miss McLean’s friends. Her funeral was at West Road Crematorium, in Newcastle, where more than 200 people attended. She also leaves behind her dad Neil McLean, 62, a plastic surgeon.

According to authorities, the Selinsgrove couple picked up LaFerrara November 11, three weeks after they got married, for a sexual encounter in a parking lot. Mr Barbour allegedly choked LaFerrara with a cable cord while his petite, bespectacled spouse repeatedly stabbed him. LaFerrara's body covered in 20 knife wounds was found dumped in an alley. The Barbours had recently moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot October 22. LaFerra married his girlfriend of eight years, Colleen Keeney, in June 2011. The couple did not have children. According to his obituary, LaFerrara was employed as the senior resident engineer at the Lycoming County Landfill . The couple's arrests comes after Richard Beasley . was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men . to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in . cold blood. Sunbury Police . Chief Steve Mazzeo said Friday that on November 11, Elytte Barbour told . detectives that he was hiding under a blanket in the backseat of his . wife's red Honda CRV when they went to pick up Troy LaFerrara for his . rendezvous with the 18-year-old married escort. When . Miranda Barbour gave her husband a signal, Elytte pounced on LaFerrarra . from behind, wrapping a cord around his neck and tightening it as his . wife knifed the 42-year-old man all over his body. Sex worker: The teen-mom's husband said he knew about her habit of meeting men on the internet and sleeping with them for money . Mr Barbour has been charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime. The 22-year-old man told police that he and his wife had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success. It was not until they came across LaFerrara on Craigslist that their plan finally came together. ‘LaFerrara was just the one with whom it worked,’ Elytte Barbour told police. Earlier . this week, Miranda told police that she drove alone to a department . store and bought bleach wipes and other cleaning supplies to wash her . blood-spattered car. But following his arrest, Elytte Barbour told investigators that he was the one who went to the store. After cleaning up the gore, the couple drove to a strip club to celebrate Elytte Barbour's 22nd birthday. According . to Elytte Barbour, his wife has an 18-month-old baby from a man who has . died under what police are now considering suspicious circumstances. Police arrested Miranda Barbour after LeFerrara's mutilated body was found in a side street in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. After . a three-week investigation, officers traced the dead man's cell phone . call history, they found the teenager was the last person to have spoken . him before his death. Death wish: Barbour told detectives that he and Miranda had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success . Upon agreeing to be interviewed, Barbour admitted that she had met LaFerrara November 11 after setting up the meeting online. She told prosecutors that she would regularly use Craigslist to meet men for 'companionship', often being paid for the meetings up to $850, according to her husband. But in her first interview, the mom of one insisted that, despite setting up the meeting at the Susquehanna Valley Mall, Hummels Wharf, she didn't go through with it because she was too scared. Later, Barbour’s husband and friend were then interviewed and told officers they knew Barbour she met men who she had encountered online, and that she carried a pocket knife for her own protection. But just a day after her first questioning, Barbour voluntarily went to Selinsgrove state police barracks and asked to speak with investigators with an attorney present. In her second version of events, she said she met LaFerrara on Craigslist and after emailing back and forth, the two decided to meet at the mall, police said. LaFerrara entered Barbour’s vehicle, and once they arrived in Sunbury, LaFerrara told Barbour to pull over, police said. Original sinner: The first 'Craigslist killer' Richard Beasley, above, was convicted in April after posting job vacancies on the site which used the promise of work on an Ohio farm to lure three men to their deaths . Beasley, 53, was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to use the promise of jobs on a southeast Ohio farm to lure the men to their deaths. A self-proclaimed street preacher, he killed three men, all of who answered a Craigslist ad for a non-existent job. The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. All were looking for a fresh start in life, prosecutors said repeatedly during the trial. The murderer was sentenced to death in April this year, after hearing the details of his crime, Judge Lynne Callahan said 'I think I'm going to be sick. Victims: David Pauley (left) was found buried in a shallow grave in 2011. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (centre) and Ralph Geiger (right) was the Beasley's third victim . Barbour told police that she parked and LaFerrara began to grope her, touch her private areas and put his hands around her throat. According to the teen, it was then that she reached for the knife and began to stab LaFerrara in a frenzied attack. police said. She said she blacked out and didn’t remember the amount of the times she stabbed him, according to police. She made no mention of her husband playing a role in the killing, or even being present in the car. Barbour then drove away with the man 'choking and gasping for air', police said. She drove around the city and found the alley behind Catawissa Avenue. Controversial: The site will come under fresh scrutiny after its role in the latest death . She got out of the vehicle and walked around to the passenger’s door, which LaFerrara was leaning against, opened the door and watched him fall out, police said. Before driving off, the teenager took the man's wallet, the report said. At a secluded spot, she cleaned away as much of the blood as she could before driving on to join her husband at his birthday party in a strip club. It is alleged she threw the knife which was used in the attack into the Susquehanna River, which runs through Sunbury and Selinsgrove.","Miranda Barbour, 18, arranged to meet married engineer Troy LaFerrara in parking lot for sex .

Prosecutors are now investigating whether to bring forward charges following the incident that left 52-year-old Long Island man Charles Bruce dead. Bruce, who worked as an electrician and was part of the Malverne fire department, was on an annual weekend hunting trip in upstate Westford, N.Y., just east of Cooperstown, with a group of fellow firefighters. Authorities say the death occurred Saturday afternoon in the woods, according to NBC New York.

TV personality Dr Mehmet Oz has pulled a woman from her crumpled car after a head-on collision - saving her just minutes before the vehicle rolled backwards into a ravine. His quick thinking on Saturday came three months after he ran to the aid of a British tourist whose foot was severed by a New York City taxi cab that lost control and hurtled towards her. And that incident occurred just days after Dr Oz, wearing a red superhero cape, was pictured helping a man who collapsed beside him during a 5k run in Salt Lake City, Utah.

He said that he jumped out of his seat and ran to the vehicle that had been turning. 'The . door was stuck, so I pried it open. I asked her if she was okay.

'I . pulled her from the car because at that point, it was steaming and . there was oil dripping.

A paedophile is facing jail after his . victim spotted him on TV 30 years later - carrying the Olympic torch in . the London 2012 relay. Married Graham Cooper, 69, a butcher, was a regular churchgoer and a respected member of the community. His charity work saw him nominated by his wife of forty years, Sylvia, 62, to participate in the Olympic torch relay in July last year. Cooper appeared on television carrying the Olympic flame aloft but his greatest moment would prove to be his downfall . Cooper even appeared on television carrying the flame in his home town of Aldington, Kent. But one viewer recognised him as the man who put her through years of serious sexual abuse as a child. The victim’s previous complaints had fallen on deaf ears but after seeing her Cooper in the rally she contacted police again. Officers brought Cooper in for questioning and he admitted three of his crimes. He was convicted of further charges by a jury at Canterbury Crown Court on October 25. Warning Cooper he will face prison, Judge Adele Williams said ‘The ordering of reports should not be taken as any indication that I am looking at anything other than an immediate prison sentence.’ Graham Cooper claimed his young victim initiated sex but a judge warned him he now faces jail . His victim cannot be named for legal reasons but took to the witness stand to tell the court she lived in fear of ‘bumping into’ Cooper. The woman wept while giving evidence and revealed she sought counseling and hypnotherapy to cope with her ordeal. She said ‘I was thinking how could this happen? I looked things up on the internet. How could this person be chosen? ‘This man abused me. I read on the internet about him and why he was nominated, his charity work, singing in a local choir, raising money for local projects. ‘It said he was always cheerful. I read about him over and over again, about him going to the church and thought is he going there to repent or what? Smiling: But Cooper's victim told the court she lived in fear of bumping into him. He is seen here with the Olympic torch in Kent . Cooper claimed during his five-day trial that his young victim initiated sexual contact. But he added ‘I feel very sorry. I am shameful. It shouldn’t have happened. ‘I have regretted it for 30 years.’ He admitted two counts of indecent assault on a female under 14 and one count of gross indecency with a female aged under 14. The jury also found him guilty of indecent assault. He was cleared of two further allegations of indecent assault on a female under 14 and found not guilty of the rape of a girl under the age of 16. Cooper was released on bail for sentencing on a date to be fixed later next month.

A Tory MP is so fond of her two cats that she has set up a Facebook page to let them ‘talk’ to the world. Tracey Crouch, MP for Chatham in Kent since 2010, avidly reveals the views of Mungo and Basil on everything from their ‘Mummy’s’ time-keeping to what’s in the newspapers. In October, she even found time to record the cats’ supposed reaction to her own pronouncement on the nation’s drug laws. Lap of luxury: Mungo relaxes with Tracey Crouch MP who has set up a bizarre Facebook page 'written' by her cats . ‘Mummy’s been on TV talking about banning legal highs .  .  . I hope she doesn’t mean catnip!!’ said one post. Mungo and Basil also show their jealous side, apparently. Next to a picture of Ms Crouch with a group of trainee guide dogs is the message: ‘Mummy’s been cheating on us!! We are giving her the silent treatment until at least teatime.’ Ms Crouch, 38, who is single and a qualified football coach, hit the headlines in 2011 when she was banned from the Commons soccer team – because she was a woman. A former aide to senior Conservative David Davis, Ms Crouch began posting the Facebook messages from her cats’ perspective earlier this year, after picking Mungo and Basil from a cats’ home. Ballot box: Basil curls up in a cardboard box . The Facebook diary contains only veiled references to Ms Crouch’s day job at Westminster and says it is about ‘a troublesome two with a Mummy who rules elsewhere but not at home. 'We rule this house .  .  .’ This hasn’t stopped Mungo and Basil boasting that their names have appeared in Hansard, the official record of Commons proceedings, after Ms Crouch mentioned them during a parliamentary debate. But ‘Mummy’ Crouch and her cats also have their fallouts. Paws for thought: Mungo and Basil's page on Facebook . In July, one of them ‘wrote’: ‘Oops – Mummy said a bad word when she stood in a mess I accidentally did on the carpet. I think I am in the naughty corner now.’ Mungo demonstrates dubious sartorial taste when he records his liking for ‘Mummy’s new onesie’. ‘Sooo soft and comfy,’ he adds. Last month, the cats celebrated Ms Crouch being named winner of a parliamentary award. ‘Mummy won an award today *happy faces* but is not coming home until tomorrow *sad faces*,’ reads the entry. Ms Crouch said: ‘I got Mungo and Basil from a cats’ home. Nobody wanted them because of the old superstition about black cats, but they’re absolutely gorgeous. ‘I set the Facebook site up so I wouldn’t bore people with endless pictures of them on Twitter and there’s been a great reaction to it.’","Tracey Crouch MP avidly reveals the views of Mungo and Basil online .

In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson wrote to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling: ‘I am disappointed that the allocation has not been more intelligently crafted because there is now a real risk that funding levels will not match demand in London.’ Stephen Greenhalgh, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime in the capital, last night added: ‘The Government needs to think again before victims of crime are victims again of  a cruel postcode lottery.’ Javed Khan, chief executive of charity Victim Support, said: ‘It is unfortunate that some areas will benefit more than others.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are making more money available than ever to help victims cope and recover from the effects  of crime.’ The Mayor of London has written to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured, outlining his concerns .","Ministry of Justice plans to set victim support budgets according to how many people live in each area .

Anjelica Huston has lifted the lid on a series of stormy relationships with older men including the moment she slit her wrist with a razor in rage and desperation during the stormy love affair she had with celebrity photographer Bob Richardson. Huston was just 18 and Richardson was 42 when they first met in 1969 at a photo shoot for Harper's Bazaar as publicity for 'A Walk with Love and Death', the film she was in directed by her father. Writing in her new memoir out today, A Story Lately Told: Coming of Age in Ireland, London and New York, the first of her two-part autobiography, she says there was an instant attraction. Tempestuous: Huston was to meet Bob Richardson on a photo shoot for a film that she was in being directed by her father, John Huston, left. She was to have a string of high profile affairs with famous men . Dramatic: Bob Richardson, right, would be overwhelmed by vile moods that would last days. After one episode Anjelica Huston writes how she became so distraught she slit her wrist with a razor in the bathroom . The first time they had sex they were stoned and stood in front of a mirror together so it was like an 'out-of-body experience', she writes. Huston became his muse and inspiration but his mental health problems played havoc with their lives; he was bi-polar and suffering from schizophrenia and spent days in vile moods. 'A Story Lately Told' details how Richardson once threw a bottle of tequila at her head, tossed all her belongings around their hotel room and berated her for not being a 'real woman' because she wasn't pregnant. Huston effectively became his lover and carer at the same time. Huston writes: ‘I never felt so fragile or vulnerable as when Bob became demonic and flew into a rage, or worse, when afterward he retreated into his shell. 'One morning, four days into one of these ordeals, I walked into the bathroom at the Chelsea [Hotel] and, in desperation, drew a razor blade across my left wrist. I ran back into the bedroom, blood spurting from the vein, crying to him: ‘Will this make you love me?’ Huston writes that Richardson took her to the emergency room where doctors stitched her wounds and asked her many questions about how she had come to have such an injury.

A lot of these products are sold online rather than over the counter – they’re dangerous and the side effects can prove fatal.’ The Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Armed Forces has a zero-tolerance approach to any inappropriate behaviour, including substance misuse.’","590 soldiers failed tests between September 2012 and September 2013 .

The Prime Minister lived up to his laid back reputation this weekend by spending a low key Saturday night cooking lamb chops for his mother. David Cameron was spotted purchasing the lamb cutlets from the local butcher near the Prime Minister's official country residence Chequers on Saturday afternoon. Downing Street said he bought ten chops from A Cobb butchers in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire ahead of his mother Mary's visit for dinner Saturday night. Mr Cameron's visit tied in with Small Business Saturday - an initiative designed to encourage people to use local shops and businesses.

'Small businesses are the lifeblood of our country - essential for building a resilient, sustainable economy and a central part of my long-term economic plan for Britain,' Mr Cameron said. 'They account for 99 in every 100 businesses and keep more than 11 million people in work so this isn't about sentimentality, it's about the future of Britain, creating jobs and turning our economy around. 'I'm determined that we back them in every way we can - that's what today is all about and that's what this Government is about.' Many MPs took to social media to promote businesses in their constituencies. Meanwhile Ed Miliband bought gifts for his sons, Daniel and Sam, at the Bookseller Crow as he toured shops in Crystal Palace and bread and ham from nearby Good Taste Food and Drink. It comes after the government announced measures to help small businesses, including faster broadband and moves to tackle late payments. Mr Cameron opted for 10 lamb cutlets as he shopped in local stores to promote 'Small Business Saturday' 'Small Business Saturday' is an initiative designed to encourage people to use local shops and businesses . The announcement is aimed at removing some of the barriers faced by small businesses, such as accessing faster and better broadband connectivity and making it easier to switch energy suppliers. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'I meet with small businesses regularly who tell me about what Government support works well and what doesn't. Through our commitment to small firms we are directly addressing that feedback, freeing them from unnecessary burdens, providing more finance and improving access to advice and support. 'In particular we are tackling the issue of late payment, which can threaten the survival of otherwise healthy businesses. We are enforcing prompt payment through the entire public sector and asking what more we can do to get credit flowing in the private sector.' Enterprise and skills minister Matthew Hancock said: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of the British economy and responsible for nearly half the job creation in the UK. That's why we are removing barriers to growth and supporting them, so that they can create jobs and compete in the global race.'

Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The Government is right to say that Britain is a great place to start a business. Now it needs to become a great place to grow a business too. That means ensuring that fast-growing and dynamic small companies get access to the capital they need to expand, and access to practical business-to-business support to break into new markets around the world.' Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers organisation the EEF, said: 'Small businesses are a vital part of the economy and we need to make it easier for them to invest, grow and create the highly skilled innovative jobs our economy needs. 'The more we can grow into larger medium size companies, the better for UK plc. In order to enable this we need to examine every means to removing some of the barriers they face, improving the business environment and making it easier for them to fulfil their potential.'

In Suffolk, police said there was no further threat from coastal flooding but local authorities warned that people should take precautions around floodwater. These include preventing children from playing in flooded areas or with contaminated toys, discarding food grown in allotments or gardens and storing rubbish out of the reach of pests. Improving weather last night saw floods recede in many areas, and the EA removed more than 200 flood warnings. There were no severe flood warnings and just one flood warning in place as of 1pm. Emergency services downgraded risk levels, and most of the people evacuated from their homes have left evacuation centres.

The forecaster went on: 'As we go through into Monday the rain will gradually start to ease over Scotland leaving most areas generally dry.'

The break in the wintry weather couldn't come soon enough for inhabitants of Britain's east coast where this week a fierce storm in the North Sea caused widespread disruption and claimed two lives. Record-breaking sea levels were recorded along the east coast through a combination of large waves and a tidal surge, the EA said. The Thames Barrier, which had faced the biggest tide since it opened in 1982, reopened yesterday afternoon. Improved flood defences were said to have stopped the largest North Sea surge since 1953 from causing even more chaos, protecting at least 800,000 homes. But even with the protection some areas suffered severe damage. EA teams are expected to inspect and repair damage to walls, banks and other defences over the coming days. Devastated residents in Hemsby, Norfolk, watched their cliff-top homes disappear into the sea as the tidal surge hit on Thursday night. Five bungalows fell into the water as the high tide eroded the cliff below, while dozens of residents formed a human chain to help salvage the possessions of those affected. A lifeboat station was also reportedly washed into the sea. Devastated residents watched their cliff-top homes disappear into the sea as last night's tidal surge hit the east coast of Britain .

Monster: David Brierley, above, repeatedly assaulted the 18-year-old victim during a 45-minute attack . A psychopath who repeatedly raped a teenage girl just four months after being released from prison for an identical attack was jailed for life today. David Brierley, 34, repeatedly assaulted the 18-year-old victim during a 45-minute attack in Swindon town centre in February this year. A court heard how the victim thought she was going to die and begged Brierley to stop his violent attack but he ignored her pleas and carried on the attack. Brierley, who is 5ft 10 and weighs 19 stone had been jailed for eight years at Warwick Crown Court in 2001 for repeatedly raping and assaulting an 18-year-old girl in a Stratford upon Avon churchyard the previous year. But had only finally been freed from prison in October 2012 after being recalled for breaching the license of that release. Brierley had been living in Birmingham and had moved to Swindon just two days before he attacked his latest victim, the court was told. Swindon Crown Court heard he had been living under an assumed name in the Culvery Court hostel, but on the night of the rape had was refused entry by staff who believed he had been drinking. Tattooed Brierley had met the victim on the evening of February 23 in a takeaway in the town and bought her some food. They were said to have exchanged telephone numbers after Brierley told her he could help her get a job. The following evening he texted the teenager and they met up in the town centre. He took her to an area behind some bins near John Street where he violently raped her. Before the attack, the teenager sent a text to a former boyfriend which read: 'I'm in some trouble. He wants to take me away and do lots of bad things to me.' She told police afterwards: 'I begged him. God knows how many times and he wouldn't let me go. I kept thinking I would die that night.' Stephen Dent, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was to claim in interview that the girl had taken him to the area by the bins but she said he had taken her there. 'Once at the bins he asked her about her sexual preferences. She was at that point very uncomfortable and realised that she might be in trouble. 'He told police that she had initiated sex with him and he didn't use a condom because she wanted children.' Brierley has a long criminal record dating back to his teens for offences such as robbery, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, wounding and burglary. He had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two offences of rape. A further charge of rape and a charge of criminal damage were ordered to lie on file. Brierley had been living in Birmingham and had moved to Swindon, above, just two days before the attack . Brierley, who has now converted to Islam, had also unsuccessfully tried to change his guilty pleas after realising that he could be jailed for life and did not want to be portrayed as a 'horrible beast'. Nicholas O'Brien, defending, said Brierley has been diagnosed with a dangerous severe personality disorder but was not regarded by psychiatrists as mentally ill. He said: 'My best point is that in any event the complainant was not required to go into the witness box and give evidence' 'He wishes to tell the court that he now accepts he is guilty of rape but does not accept all the details the Crown puts forward.' Judge Douglas Field jailed Brierley for life and told him he would serve a minimum term of imprisonment of seven years and 41 days before he could be considered for parole. The judge told Brierley: 'I have come to the view that you are a very dangerous, violent sex offender. 'In my view the risk you pose cannot be satisfactorily met by the passing of a fixed period of imprisonment. 'These offences are so serious they call for a life sentence to be passed on each count. Only when the parole board is satisfied you no longer pose a risk of further offending will you be released.' The judge added: 'She was a vulnerable young woman of 18. In her words your behaviour became freaky. She was frightened and you told her to do as she wanted or you would punch her. Sentence: The rapist, who has now converted to Islam, was jailed for life at Swindon Crown Court, above . 'She was crying and you told her to 'shut the f*** up' and you spat in her face. She was begging you not to rape her and she was asking you to stop. 'This was a violent incident and the physical and mental harm you have done to this woman must be profound and long lasting.' Brierley was also placed on the sex offenders' register for life. Detective Superintendent Nick John, head of crime investigations at Wiltshire Police, said afterwards: 'David Brierley is a violent sexual predator who has proved to be a danger to women. 'Firstly, I would like to commend the bravery of Brierley's victim who was forced to relive the details of her horrific ordeal by providing full and frank details to Wiltshire Police during this investigation. 'She has displayed the utmost courage and strength during the course of this investigation and subsequent court case. 'Brierley was convicted of a rape in 2001 and was jailed for eight years. This second incident proves he has not been rehabilitated and remains a threat to women in our society.'","David Brierley had already served an eight-year sentence for a 2001 rape .

A three-year-old boy drowned his newborn twin brother and left the other permanently brain damaged as he tried to bathe them while his alcoholic mother slept. The boy said he wanted to make his siblings 'nice and clean' after their mother passed out having drunk four cans of super-strength lager. The shocking sequence of events emerged in court when the mother - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - was given a one-year suspended prison sentence for neglect. She had sought refuge at a Merseyside home with her children after escaping a relationship of domestic violence, Liverpool Crown Court heard yesterday. The jury heard she slept in a single bed with her eldest son, with the newborn babies cradled together in a drawer. The mother, an insomniac, fell asleep in the afternoon after drinking four cans of Special Brew, which is nine per cent alcohol. The toddler woke up and ran a 10-inch bath of cold water. The mother found her infant children naked and unconscious, not breathing, when she awoke. Judge Mrs Justice Cox said: 'The drink certainly played a part in you going to sleep and failing to wake up when the toddler woke up and got out of bed. 'While you slept the toddler decided to make the twins nice and clean and he put them in the bath. 'When he woke you up you found both of your babies floating in the bath water. They were cold, naked and they weren’t breathing.' The mother called police and paramedics, telling a 999 operator that she had found her newborn twins unresponsive. Both babies were given CPR and were taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in West Derby, Liverpool, where they were put on life support. Days later, one of the boys died in his father's arms. His brother, who suffered a cardiac arrest, was left with severe brain damage. The court heard he is likely to be severely affected by cerebral palsy and will need round-the-clock care for the rest of his life. Emergency: The boys were taken to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool. Days later one died in his father's arms . David McLaughlin, defending, said the mother will be haunted by what happened forever. He said: 'She bears full responsibility – not a day goes by when she doesn’t think about what happened. 'Every morning she wakes up with a vision of her babies’ faces in the bath, a vision that will haunt her forever-more.' He added: 'She wants it to be known that she holds herself fully responsible for what occurred and she wants her toddler son to know, if ever that time should arise when he is older, that through her plea of guilty she accepts full responsibility for what occurred and no blame should be laid against him.' She was handed a one-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and a supervision order after pleading guilty to three counts of neglect. Mrs Justice Cox revealed this is not the first time the mother has come into contact with social services. Sentenced: The mother received a one-year jail sentence, suspended for two years at Liverpool Crown Court . She had previously been warned by health workers of the dangers of drinking while caring for children. Mrs Justice Cox told her: 'This was not a case involving positive and deliberate acts of abuse or ill-treatment. I accept you intended no harm. 'But you chose to drink strong lager that day and its effects were devastating. 'I have noted you had been advised by health workers as to the risks of alcohol misuse and caring properly for young children. 'You were responsible for those young children in your care and there was a serious breach of the standards they were entitled to have.' The judge described the mother as 'in general terms, a loving and caring mother who understands the duties and responsibility of motherhood'. She added: 'Your real punishment will lie in the images that will stay with you, possibly permanently, of what happened that day.'","The mother from Merseyside drank four cans of super-strength lager .

A new mother has spoken of her horror at discovering that her loving boyfriend tried to abort their baby by slipping a pill into her food. Helen Dean thought that partner Karim Habibi was pleased to hear that she was pregnant - he even 'twirled her around' in celebration when she told him the news. But he secretly visited a GP's surgery and asked a nurse to give him an abortion pill - only for her to call the police when he admitted what it was for. Trauma: Helen Dean, pictured with her baby son Amin, discovered her partner tried to abort the child . Crime: Karim Habibi has been given a suspended sentence after admitting trying to slip Ms Dean a pill . The 26-year-old cafe owner has now been given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to stay away from his ex-girlfriend and their baby son Amin for the next five years. 'I thought it was a loving relationship and that he wanted children,' said Ms Dean, 32, who was five weeks pregnant at the time of Habibi's arrest in June 2012. 'I was so outraged that he tried to kill our baby. 'We'd been together for three years and decided it was the right time. 'When I first told him he seemed so excited. He twirled me around and said: ""You're going to have our baby.""' Ultrasound: A picture of Amin inside the womb; his father initially seemed pleased with his partner's pregnancy . Rebuilding: Ms Dean is now focussed on bringing up her son as a single mother after her partner's arrest . In fact, however, Habibi was plotting to end the pregnancy and made an appointment at his local GP's surgery in Newport, South Wales. There he told a practice nurse that he wanted a pill which would abort Ms Dean's baby - but she sent him away and called 999. Police rushed to the pregnant woman's home to make sure Habibi had not already tried to poison her, which she had to undergo tests in hospital. 'The police ransacked my house searching for evidence to see if he'd already tried to harm our baby,' Ms Dean said. 'I was too devastated to believe what I was hearing. Pregnant: Ms Dean in the later stages of her pregnancy, when Habibi was awaiting trial . Safehouse: During her pregnancy Ms Dean had to live in a women's refuge for her own protection . 'They took samples of my butter and milk. They tested food in my cupboards and all my medication. 'At hospital they took my blood and urine and kept me under observation for two days. I was terrified. And I had no one to turn to now that Karim was in custody.' She was moved to a women's refuge, and in February this year she gave birth to Amin, who weighed in at 8lb at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. Afghan-born Habibi initially insisted that the nurse had misunderstood his request, but in September he pleaded guilty to attempting to procure a poison to induce abortion at Newport Crown Court. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for two years, and given a five-year restraining order. Healthy: The 32-year-old gave birth to Amin in February in Cardiff and both are now doing well . Sentence: Habibi was given a suspended prison sentence although he initially denied the crime . Recorder Gregory Bull QC told him his crime was 'outrageous', adding that to trick his own girlfriend into having an abortion was 'a terrible thing to do'. Now Ms Dean has vowed to move on from the trauma as she continues to look after her young son. 'I have to look forward and rebuild a life for me and Amin,' she said. 'He is my world and reason to get up in the morning. 'Amin will be one in February and I can't wait to spoil him. I tell him every day how special he is. 'One day I will have to explain why he doesn't see his daddy like other little boys and that breaks my heart, but all that matters to me is that he is well.'","Helen Dean, 32, thought Karim Habibi, 26, was pleased she was pregnant .

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson and Dominic Prince . PUBLISHED: . 17:19 EST, 7 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:19 EST, 7 December 2013 . Art of the matter: Petra Ecclestone and her husband James Stunt, who want to take the Van Dyck to LA . It seems an unlikely place to hang an Old Master. Dubbed ‘Candyland’ by locals, Petra Ecclestone’s vast Los Angeles mansion has 14 bedrooms, three hair salons and a walk-in wardrobe so large it has a second level accessed by an internal staircase. And that’s not to mention the nightclub, bowling alley and ‘motor court’ for 100 vehicles, including her family’s white Ferrari, white Rolls-Royce Ghost and a black Lamborghini. Yet, extraordinarily, this is the intended home of Anthony Van Dyck’s last known self-portrait, a £12.5million painting regarded as one of Britain’s greatest cultural treasures. The Government and the National Portrait Gallery are currently trying to save it for the nation. The Mail on Sunday can reveal the Van Dyck has been bought by Petra’s 28-year-old husband, James Stunt. The painting was in private hands for more than four centuries and then bought by art dealer and Antiques Roadshow valuer Philip Mould at auction in 2009 for £8.3million. He recently sold it to Mr Stunt for £12.5million, but the Government has placed a temporary export ban on him taking it out of the country. The National Portrait Gallery and the Art Fund, the national fundraising charity for art, have now launched an unprecedented campaign to buy back the painting for the country. The former poet laureate Andrew Motion, who is leading the campaign, said: ‘This is a self-portrait everybody can enjoy. 'If we lose this painting, it will . disappear into private hands and eyes and it will be lost to the world. But this is a painting about living in the world and the world is where . it deserves to be.’ Masterpiece: The Van Dyck self-portrait was bought by Mr Stunt for £12.5m but the Government has placed a temporary export ban on him taking it out of the country . Perhaps understandably, Mr Stunt disagrees. Last night a spokesman for the businessman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘James quite understands the authorities’ point of view but he very much hopes he will be able to take it to his home in Los Angeles and enjoy it.’ Mr Stunt married Bernie Ecclestone’s younger daughter in September 2011, shortly after she bought the Dynasty-style property, once the largest private residence in the United States, for £55 million. F1 supremo Ecclestone is worth an estimated £2.2billion – more than enough to stock up on the odd artwork or two. Petra, 24, prefers modern art, once purchasing a Marc Quinn sculpture of twin Pamela Andersons in bikinis, but it seems her husband has more traditional tastes. The walls of the 123-room LA mansion are . said to be lined with portraits by Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey . Kneller, the leading portrait painters in England in the 17th and early . 18th Centuries. Petra Ecclestone's vast LA mansion, dubbed Candyland, is the intended home of Anthony Van Dyck's last known self-portrait, a painting regarded as one of Britain's greatest cultural treasures . Mr Stunt, who also collects vintage Chateau Petrus wine, told an American interviewer: ‘All my Lelys are important. 'In Althorp, the Earl of Spencer has the Windsor Beauties, which is a very famous group of pictures by the artist. 'I’ve been trying to rival the Windsor Beauties. I have more, I think, than him, and I’m just five off the Royal Collection.’ This leaves art critic Brian Sewell  distinctly unimpressed. ‘Oh dear,’ said Mr Sewell. ‘I don’t know him but if he’s setting out to rival Althorp and Buckingham Palace, that’s hardly a meritorious way of collecting. It’s cigarette cards.’ The smouldering Van Dyck self- portrait . would be the jewel in Mr Stunt’s collection. Painted by the Flemish . artist shortly before he died, possibly of the plague, in 1641, there is . no doubting its importance. James Stunt married Bernie Ecclestone's younger daughter in September 2011, shortly after she bought the Dynasty-style property, once the largest private residence in the United States . According to National Portrait Gallery’s director Sandy Nairne, Van Dyck, ‘is one of the greatest artists to have worked in Britain. No other artist has had such a dramatic impact on British portraiture’. The National Portrait Gallery and the Art Fund now have three months to raise the money. It is the largest fundraising campaign the gallery has ever undertaken and, if successful, would be the fifth most-expensive acquisition by a UK national museum. The National Gallery and National Galleries of Scotland bought two Titians in 2009 and 2011 for a combined total of £95million, the National Gallery paid £22million for a Raphael in 2004, and last summer the Tate paid £23.1million for a Constable. The National Portrait Gallery has secured £1.2million so far, including a £500,000 grant from the Art Fund and £700,000 from its own budget. Art critic Brian Sewell has questioned the validity of buying the painting for £12.5m when it could have been bought four years ago for a much lower price . And the campaign to save this great work is growing. In this week’s edition of Country Life magazine, the famous Girls In Pearls feature was replaced by a full-page reproduction of the painting and a plea to help ‘ensure the painting remains in Britain’. Critics, however, have questioned the validity of buying the painting for £12.5million when it could have been bought four years ago for a much lower price. Mr Sewell said: ‘The painting must have been as important in 2009 as it is now. Why did we not buy it then? They didn’t try. They said they put their heads together with Tate Britain to see whether they could do a joint purchase but they didn’t say a word in public. There was no question of raising funds from the public. ‘But now they’re perfectly happy to start a fundraising campaign at £12.5million. The logic of it completely escapes me. ‘I am of the opinion that Sandy Nairne is the most nittish wimp in the business. I think that really the man is so witless he shouldn’t be there. I think Andrew Motion is an ass. What I hate in all these things is the way they’ll trundle in any talking head/personality/celebrity of whom a lot of people have heard. ‘I think he’s the worst poet laureate we’ve ever had, absolutely useless. He wouldn’t know the back of a picture from the front. I really think if you’re going to adduce opinions on something, you should know something about it. ‘If the picture is as important as everyone’s saying it is, it should have been bought at £8.3million. Now that it hasn’t, they’re putting £4million in the pockets of Philip Mould.’ The decision to place an export ban on the Van Dyck was based entirely on the cultural importance of the work. Yet it must rub salt into the wounds of the art establishment that it may now end up in a property of such vulgar excess. ‘Candyland’ was built by former television producer Aaron Spelling. Legend has it that his wife Candy showed the architect a postcard of Buckingham Palace and said: ‘Build me this.’ Mr Sewell says: ‘Well it does rather colour the argument. In intellectual terms, it should not matter but I don’t know. ‘In the years I attempted to be an art dealer, I remember one rich man coming in to look at something. He decided he didn’t want it and, as he was leaving, he saw another picture and said, “What is that?” I replied, “Oh, that’s far too good for you.” ’ Bizarrely, had Mr Stunt decided to keep the Van Dyck at the couple’s  £66million London home (a seven-storey house in Eaton Square with 14 bedrooms) the painting would have been his by now. The Government only has the power to challenge the purchase of artworks if the owner wishes to remove them from the country. Mr Sewell explains: ‘There are a very large number of highly important pictures in private possession in this country and most owners are very happy to lend when a picture is required for an exhibition. ‘If you took all those pictures  away from all those people, you’d have to quadruple the size of the National Gallery. ‘So, in short, all those owners are, as it were, keepers and curators unpaid. They pay all the expense  of the maintenance of the pictures, so private ownership is really a blessing in disguise. ‘But when a painting goes abroad, it tends never to come back. In other words, the loans don’t happen so it’s not quite the same. ‘Quite often, when they’re sharing an exhibition with, say, the National Gallery of Washington and Berlin, you find that an American painting won’t come here. It’s probably because they have some slight misgivings that we might step in and say that’s a national treasure.’ If Mr Stunt’s experience is anything to go by, they might have a point.","Mail on Sunday can reveal the Van Dyck has been bought by Petra’s 28-year-old husband, James Stunt .

Voters want Britain to be run by a Tin Man politician who is ‘all brains and no heart’, according to new polling based on the Wizard of Oz which will be seen as a boost for David Cameron. In a blow for Ed Miliband’s emotional pitch to the electorate, fewer people would vote for a Scarecrow, who is ‘all heart and no brains’. The survey of voters in the UK is based on polling which has successfully predicted the outcome of US Presidential elections. Tin Man: Voters who prefer a leader who is 'all brains, no heart' are more likely to back David Cameron's Tories . Scarecrow: Ed Miliband's emotional pitch to voters is more likely to be viewed as 'all heart, no brains' Experts say voters will base their decision on who to back at the 2015 on whether they prefer someone smart enough to run the country or if their heart is in the right place. In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy is joined on her journey to the Emerald City by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion. Leading American pollster John Zogby has been posing the Wizard of Oz question since 2000. He asks: ‘Imagine you live in the land of Oz, and the candidates are the Tin Man, who's all brains and no heart, and the Scarecrow, who's all heart and no brains. Who would you vote for?' Amongst all voters, a majority prefer the Tin Man over the Scarecrow . It is designed to unpick voters’ reactions to differing leadership styles. In the 2000 race for the White House, Al Gore was well ahead of George W Bush in traditional polling, but the Tin Man was neck and neck with the Scarecrow. The result of the election was similarly close. Now YouGov has put the question to voters in the UK. Of all those surveyed, 41 per cent say they would prefer to be led by the Tin Man, compared to just 32 per cent who chose the Scarecrow. This suggests voters want someone to take hard-headed decisions, rather than someone whose heart is in the right place. The Tories will seize on the results as proof their commitment to economic competence is valued by voters more than the warm-hearted concerns about the cost of living expressed by Labour’s Ed Miliband. People who said they would back the Conservatives at the next election favour the Tin Man by 60 per cent to 21 per cent, but among Labour supports 41 per cent prefer the Scarecrow over 32 per cent who said Tin Man. There are also big differences in gender and region. Amongst men, 46 per cent back the Tin Man, well ahead of the 27 per cent who chose the Scercrow. But for women, 37 per cent said Scaregrow, one point ahead of Tin Man. Younger voters also support the Tin Man, with only the over-60s putting the Scarecrow ahead. Tories prefer Tin Men but Labour supporters prefer Scarecrows, the YouGov polling revelaed . Men prefer the Tin Man while women prefer the Scarecrow, while only the over-60s prefer the idea of being run by someone who is 'all heart and no brains' The Tin Man also has large majorities of around 17 points in London and the South, but in the North of England only one point separates the two choices. Separate polling by YouGov shows that just 23 per cent of voters think the Tories' ‘heart is in the right place’ and 86 per cent say the party is ‘very close’ or ‘fairly close’ to the rich. The difference in approach by the two political leaders was laid bare today. In a worrying sign for the Tories, the Tin Man is favoured in London and the South, but the gap is much narrower in the North where there are few Conservative-held seats . Mr Cameron is in China this week leading a trade delegation which has focussed on securing billsions of pounds of investment in the UK. But Mr Miliband was on the Daybreak sofa highlighting how women have been hit hard by the consequences of the financial crash which occurred under Labour. He claims those working full-time on average £2,500 out of pocket over the last three years. Mr Miliband said: ‘This cost-of-living crisis is hitting women particularly hard. Women have seen their wages on average, if you are working full-time, go down by £2,500 in just three years because prices have been rising faster than wages.’","41% prefer to be lead by a Tin Man over 32% who said Scarecrow .

Asda will offer offer its staff 'Nativity leave' this Christmas, giving parents extra time off to see their children perform in the school play. The scheme will give workers the option to take unpaid leave outside of their normal allowances so that they don't miss out on vital family moments this festive season. They will be allowed either to take the time off and forgo their pay, or swap shifts with other staff to make sure they have the crucial dates off. Little angels: Parents will be able to take unpaid leave to see their children perform at school . The move was introduced following a survey of 5,500 mothers who shop at the supermarket found the school Nativity play is one of the events they feel they cannot afford to miss. Hayley Tatum, Asda's executive people director, said: 'There's no doubt working mums have a lot on their plate at this time of year and we don't want our colleagues to miss out on the things that are really important to them this Christmas. 'Technology might help to take the pressure off busy working parents on a daily basis, but we know that it's just not the same watching your child's milestone moments back on a smartphone. '""Nativity Leave"" gives parents the opportunity to take time off for the school Christmas play or simply for some much needed family time outside of normal holidays.' However, while the scheme was designed with parents desperate to see their child's star turn in mind, any staff members can take advantage of the scheme. They will also be allowed the time off for Christmas shopping or seeing family, as they do not have to provide a specific reason for the time off. From mums: Asda made the decision after feedback from its 5,500-strong 'Mumdex' panel . An Asda spokesman added that the store expects lots of its staff who are grandparents to capitalise on the offer to see their young family members as much as possible. The latest report from the Asda 'Mumdex' panel also revealed that mums across the country will do their best to enforce a traditional Christmas experience this year.

Ayan Ismail, seen walking from Woolwich Crown Court today, fraudulently claimed £91,000 in benefits . A Somali asylum-seeker who has evaded deportation despite twice being convicted of ID fraud, has walked free from court again after pleading guilty to a £91,000 benefit scam. A judge ruled that Ayan Ismail, 39, could not be immediately removed from the country because she has a seven-year-old daughter who was born here, even though she was in the UK illegally when she became pregnant. Adding insult to the decision, crown court Judge David Tomlinson ruled that she would not repay any of the money she has fraudulently claimed, saying:  'Awarding compensation is undesirable in a case like this.' The mother-of-four's litany of deception began when she entered the country in 1998 as a Canadian citizen by marriage. Once in the UK, she applied for a national insurance number under a false identity and used it to claim housing benefit council tax benefit, income support, disability living allowance and employment and support allowance. Under that false name she was convicted at Warwick Crown Court on September 30, 2004 of seeking to remain in the UK, by deception, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for twelve months. Then, using another bogus name of Saediya Mohamed in October 2005 she then successfully applied for permanent leave to remain in the UK as an asylum seeker. Still in the country, she continued to use a false identity in a bid to claim permanent asylum. 1998 -  Ayan Ismail enters the country, a Canadian citizen by marriage, and attempts to claim benefits, income support, disability living allowance and employment and support allowance under a false name. 2004 - She is convicted at Warwick Crown Court of seeking to remain in the UK by deception and is sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for twelve months. 2005 - Ismail uses another bogus name of Saediya Mohamed to successfully apply for permanent leave to remain in the UK as an asylum seeker. 2009 - She was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for possession of the forged National Insurance card which bore the false name and seeking to obtain leave in the UK by deception. 2010 - Ismail is released and deportation papers are served against her. She begins claiming benefits again under the same false name of Saediya Mohamed . 2012 - Her house is raided and a search revealed correspondence in Ismail's name and her fake identity of Saediya Mohamed. 2013 - She is sentenced her to eighteen months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered her to obey a night time electronically monitored home curfew for four months. Still in the UK: Ismail is now married, her three oldest daughters were granted temporary visas to enter the UK for her wedding, all are still here. She has a seven-year-old daughter and can't be deported until a custody case is resolved. At Chelmsford Crown Court on June 26, 2009 she received eighteen months imprisonment for possession of a forged National Insurance card, and seeking to obtain leave in the UK by deception. During this time, Ismail married a UK citizen and her three oldest daughters were granted temporary visas to enter the UK for her wedding, all are still here. Deportation proceedings were served against the scammer on July 29 2010, but by that time she had given birth to fourth child in Britain and a pending custody case means she still cannot be removed. At Woolwich Crown Court today, the true cost of Ismail's deception was laid bare. From December 2005 she had continued to claim £46,634 in housing benefit, £5,047 in council tax benefit, £21,470 in income support, £15,092 in disability living allowance and £3,330 in employment and support allowance. She walked free from Woolwich Crown Court, above, having been sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, suspended for two years . The benefit payments spanned her second identity fraud conviction and the only gap in payments was between July, 2009 and January, 2010 when she was in custody. Her home was raided in November, last year and a search revealed correspondence in Ismail's name and her fake identity of Saediya Mohamed. She collapsed and an ambulance rushed her to hospital, postponing any questioning, and a second interview was abandoned when she turned up with all of her children. Prosecutor Miss Eleanor Mawrey told the court: 'Miss Ismail is a Canadian citizen with no entitlement to claim state benefits in the United Kingdom. She applied for a National Insurance number in a false name, claiming exceptional need, and for proof of identity included a child benefit claim form and a British Telecom bill. 'Despite those identity fraud convictions she was still signing forms in the name of Saediya Mohamed' added Miss Mawrey. 'All those claims were fraudulent from the outset.' Ismail, of Edington Rd, South East London, above, will remain in the UK because her daughter was born here . Ismail was sentenced her to eighteen months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered her to obey a night time electronically monitored home curfew for four months. Judge Tomlinson told Ismail, who needed the assistance of an interpreter: 'Not for the first time you have adopted a false identity and using that identity you have obtained this money from hard-working people in this country. 'The aggravating factor is that you have previous convictions and have served a custodial sentence. 'There is an overwhelming public interest to send out a message by sending you to prison, but there is also the impact this would have on your child.' Ismael pleaded guilty one week before her trial to three counts of obtaining a money transfer by deceptions, one count of evading a liability by deception and one count of fraud by failing to disclose information, with intent to make a gain.","Ayan Ismail has two convictions for identity fraud in 2004 and 2009 .

Prime Minister David Cameron has hailed a 'historic' global trade deal which he said could be worth £1 billion a year to British businesses and be a 'lifeline' for the world's poorest people . Prime Minister David Cameron has hailed a 'historic' global trade deal which he said could be worth £1 billion a year to British businesses and be a 'lifeline' for the world's poorest people. In a surprise breakthrough, a World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting in Bali secured a deal to lower barriers and speed up customs procedures after overcoming late objections from India and Cuba. As well as promising an estimated £613 billion boost to international trade, the deal - the first in nearly two decades - keeps alive the hope of a wider agreement being reached between rich and poor countries in the long-stalled Doha Round. Mr Cameron has made liberalising trade a key aim of the UK's presidency of the G8 group of developed economies - pushing for EU deals with both the US and China in the absence of WTO progress. 'Trade is a vital part of our long-term economic plan and was one of my G8 priorities this year,' he said. 'So I am delighted that we have secured an impressive global deal worth over £1 billion a year to British businesses and £70 billion globally. 'This deal will help boost our exports, meaning that UK companies can grow and employ more people. 'If just 100,000 small businesses either start exporting or spread to new markets over the next five years, this would generate an extra £30 billion for the UK economy and create 100,000 new jobs. 'By slashing barriers to trade, this deal will also provide a lifeline to the world's poorest people. 'Helping developing countries to grow is not only the right thing to do, but it also increases potential markets for us all. 'So this really is win-win and the World Trade Organisation is to be commended for this historic deal.' Such was the surprise at securing a deal between the WTO's 159 members that WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo wept as he announced it. He said: 'We have put the world back into the World Trade Organisation. For the first time in our history, the WTO has truly delivered.' Important: EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht described the deal as a 'stepping stone' A temporary dispensation for developing nations helped see off India's fears over grain subsidies, and late objections from Cuba over removing a reference to the US trade embargo on it were also overcome. EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht said: 'I believe it's a very important deal. It is the first one since the inception of the WTO two decades ago. 'I would argue that what we did today is a quarter of the Doha agenda. On top of that it's a stepping stone. Delighted: Trade Minister Lord Green described the deal as 'a great day for the global trading system' 'It will add a lot to the trading capacity of the least-developed countries and developing countries,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'If they have more trading capacity it will also result in more investment in logistics and infrastructure... in all kinds of procedures that are part of the trading process, thereby creating new opportunities."" Confederation of British Industry director-general John Cridland said: 'With many British businesses looking further afield at new export markets, this deal is good news. New business: Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Cutting red tape and breaking down barriers at borders will create new opportunities, especially for small businesses to export' 'The new binding commitments to streamline customs procedures and cut red tape will help British exporters of all sizes to move their products more efficiently around the world. 'Now we need to see ambitious bilateral trade and investment agreements with the US and Japan to provide an additional boost to UK export performance over the long term."" Trade Minister Lord Green, a vice-chair of the Bali conference representing developed nations, said: 'This is a great day for the global trading system. 'We've demonstrated that the WTO can deliver significant multilateral trade deals. 'The deal we have agreed here today is good for the UK and even better for developing countries. 'It will bring real benefits to businesses in every country, in particular to small firms which are hardest hit by the costs of trading across inefficient borders.' Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Cutting red tape and breaking down barriers at borders will create new opportunities, especially for small businesses to export. 'Trade plays a key role in creating jobs and supporting a stronger UK economy.

A council has made more than £150,000 in just two months from a yellow box junction, leaving motorists fuming. Local motorists have accused Kingston Council of 'predatory' behaviour after it emerged that a single hatched box in Tolworth, Surrey has been responsible for fines totaling around £2,500 a day. Another box junction in nearby Kingston town centre was almost as lucrative, raising £100,000 over the same period. A fine mess: The innocuous-looking box junction where drivers have had to pay £153,000 in Tolworth, Surrey . Law teacher David Mark, who was fined in October, lodged a Freedom of Information request after the council took over moving traffic enforcement from police. The figures reveal that in October and November, motorists paid out £153,835 in fines from the highest-grossing junction in Tolworth, and £100,203 from the one in Kingston. Mr Mark, who was handed a fine on October 16, said: 'It is very disturbing and I think it shows the council is not being proportionate. 'The word that I would use is predatory. I do really feel the council is just seeing drivers as targets.' Each fine costs £130, but is halved to £65 if motorists pay within two weeks. The Surrey town is in outer London and its roads are frequently gridlocked. Cash cow: The other junction in Kingston town centre where drivers had to pay £100,000 in fines . So town hall chiefs introduced more of the box junctions, which are reserved for moving traffic in order to stop junctions getting blocked when traffic lights change. Nudging into the painted area is a well-known offence in the Highway Code, and is described as 'entering and stopping in a box junction when prohibited'. Surbiton neighbourhood committee chairman, Cllr Malcolm Self, said he was 'surprised' by the high total. 'The idea is to get the roads moving,' he said. 'In my opinion it isn’t to raise revenue. 'The . dodgy lights phasing [on the worst junction, fixed last month] meant the . traffic was tailing back. But that is not a reason why people should . enter the box junction when the exit isn’t clear.' Spy camera: Circled, what is thought to be one of the cameras that registered motorists' numberplates . The Kingston Guardian newspaper obtained the November figures after Mr Mark revealed the figures for October. A Kingston Council spokesman said: 'We always take any mitigation submitted into account when reviewing a case.' Drivers who believe they were fined unfairly must first appeal to the council involved, then to an independent adjudicator - but many pay up, because of the time and bureaucracy involved. And if drivers lose an appeal at the highest level, they have to pay at the full £130 rate and sometimes even have to foot the council's costs. Communities secretary Eric Pickles has . launched frequent attacks on councils for employing 'over-zealous' traffic control measures, particularly through CCTV. By law, money from fines must be put back into road maintenance or public transport, after being used to pay for the cost of enforcement.","Fines costing £130 each were handed out by Kingston Council, Surrey .

Mandy Ashforth, 48, and Barrie Moat, 50, both from Rotherham, South Yorkshire met on holiday in Bridlington and were inseparable - until a week later a 19-year-old Barrie failed to turn up for a date with Mandy, leaving her alone at a bus station. He didn't have her home phone number or address so he couldn't contact her. Mandy, who first met Barrie in 1982, aged 17, said: 'We spent all our time together and at the end of the holiday he walked me to my coach and arranged to meet the following week on the Sunday.

'I searched for him numerous times but it always led to a dead end.' Mandy spent 30 years looking for Barrie and finally managed to track him down on Facebook.But when he accepted her friend request it was because he thought she was interested in his fishing business.

Questions: Gordon Coutts earns £165,000 a year running Colchester Hospital but last year received £20,000 dividends from Coutts Consulting Ltd, advising on leadership . The £165,000-a-year chief executive of a scandal-hit hospital is running a lucrative management consultancy alongside his role leading a struggling trust. Questions were raised over how Dr Gordon Coutts juggled his demanding role at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust with his own business. Last year, he received dividends of £20,000 from Coutts Consulting Ltd, which advises the health industry on how to improve performance and leadership. His consultancy role emerged three weeks ago after the Care Quality Commission watchdog published a report which claimed that employees had been ‘pressured or bullied’ by managers into changing data on patient waiting times for cancer treatment to meet national targets, potentially putting lives at risk. Essex Police announced last week that they had launched an investigation into the claims about the treatment of staff. If criminal offences are uncovered, staff could face jail. National guidelines say patients must wait a maximum of two months for their initial cancer treatment from the time they are referred to hospital by a GP. But some patients waited up to four months for cancer treatment at Colchester General Hospital, which is now in special measures. Dr Coutts has been accused of bullying by staff, including his personal assistant Mandy Tapfield who quit last month, and of presiding over a culture which was obsessed with government targets. Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell said: ‘I was not aware of Dr Coutts’ second role. The question now is did that impact on his paid job. That’s a matter the [trust] board now needs to comment on.’ Dr Mark Aitken, a retired consultant in endocrinology and diabetes at the hospital, said: ‘I think there could be a real conflict of interest here. It also shows a lack of commitment to the NHS. ‘Being chief executive is a very demanding role and his whole focus should be on that. He earns enough money for it.’ Dr Coutts founded his company in June . 2010 only two months after he became a non-executive director at . Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust. That July he was . catapulted into the role of trust chief executive. He . has made several presentations to the pharmaceutical industry through . Coutts Consulting, including one at Wellards’ annual conference when he . spoke about ‘inspiring our employees’. Wellards provides sales training . for staff in the pharmaceutical industry. Dr . Coutts, 52, whose foundation trust is semi-autonomous from the . Government, also lectured on ‘liberating the NHS’ during a presentation . entitled, New NHS, New Customers, New Approach – Foundation Trust . Perspective. Scandal: The head of cancer services was put on 'special leave' at Colchester General Hospital (pictured) It is unclear if he draws a salary from Coutts Consulting because only abbreviated accounts have been filed to Companies House. Dr Coutts worked as a doctor for four years, before moving into the pharmaceutical industry, where he made his fortune. He was a director of several pharmaceutical giants in the US, Japan and Belgium. When he returned to Britain in 2004, he bought a £2.5million Suffolk farmhouse outright. He lives with his wife Ann Marie Swart, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of East Anglia, and his two children. The Care Quality Commission report said the records of 22 patients had been changed to cover up the fact they had faced ‘extensive’ delays for treatment – which could have put their lives at risk. Alleged victims include four-year-old Mackenzie Cackett, who died from a brain tumour after waiting months for a diagnosis. A spokesman for the hospital trust said that although Dr Coutts was appointed chief executive in July 2010, he did not start the role until September that year. ‘Being chief executive of an acute hospital trust is a full-time plus post, so since taking up that role he has done only an extremely limited amount of work for Coutts Consulting, which, in the main, consists of giving talks,’ he said. ‘This has all been done in his own time and he has always declared Coutts Consulting on the [trust] board’s register of interests, which is publicly available on the trust’s website.’","Dr Gordon Coutts earns £165,000 a year running Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, recently hit by scandals .

A British man is facing up to ten years behind bars over an alleged sexual attack on a nine-year-old boy in Trinidad. Former teacher Derek Ide, 66, is said to have sexually assaulted the child on board his yacht in a coastal town on the Caribbean island. Ide, from Southampton, has pleaded guilty to serious indecency after prosecutors amended the charge from grievous sexual assault. Scene of the crime: Derek Ide, 66, is said to have sexually assaulted a nine-year-old on board his yacht Chaguaramas Marina on Trinidad . The incident is said to have occurred at a boat yard in Chaguaramas, in the St George West area of Trinidad where Ide has 'strong ties'. He has spent at least half a year in Trinidad for the past eight years, Port of Spain Magistrates Court heard. He was arrested in April after the boy told his parents - who are not native to Trinidad - about the assault on  Ide's yacht and the Briton was held by the boy's father, who then contacted police. During his first court appearance shortly after the offence, Ide cupped his hand over his left ear during the proceedings and sported a black eye. The Foreign Office say they are aware of the arrest and are providing consular assistance. Former tutor: Derek Ide used to be a teacher at Bellemoor High School for Boys, now Upper Shirley School in Southampton . Neighbours near Ide's home in Southampton, Hampshire, spoke of their shock at his arrest. Ide taught at the former Bellemoor High School for Boys in the town, and was elected president of the Southampton Schools Association in the 1970s. He was also an active member of the residents association at the block of flats where he lives. One resident, who asked not to be named, said ‘It's a big shock as whenever I saw him he was very nice and polite. ‘I haven't seen him for a couple of years, but he owned a boat here and a boat there and used to go to the Caribbean in the winter. He was really into sailing.’ Magistrate Maureen Baboolal-Gafoor denied Ide bail and instead remanded him in custody for sentencing at the same court on December 13. The Foreign Office say they are aware of the arrest and are providing consular assistance.","Derek Ide, 66, has pleaded guilty to serious indecency in Trinidad .

Fine: Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, is facing a £100 million lawsuit, after being accused of fathering seven children . One of China's most celebrated film directors is facing a £100million fine after allegedly violating the country's controversial one-child policy by fathering seven children. Zhang Yimou, who directed hit movies House of Flying Daggers and Hero as well as the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has admitted having two sons and a daughter with his current wife and a daughter with his ex wife. But rumours have been circulating for several months that he has had three more children other women. A lawsuit was sent to the . Intermediate People's Court in Wuxi on Thursday, the hometown of Zhang's . wife, half in compensation for public resources, and half in . punitive damages. Guo . Chengxi, one of the lawyers behind the action, confirmed reports that it demands a total of one billion yuan . ($100million) adding they decided to take action . against Zhang because he 'represents a typical case' of an elite trying . to skirt the law. She said: 'Right . now, in China, this phenomenon of wealthy people having more than one . child is very serious,' Jia . Fangyi, the other lawyer, was quoted in the government-run China Daily as saying the actions of wealthy . people such as Zhang were 'unfair to the poor and those who strictly . follow the national policy'. 'The . rich have become increasingly audacious by violating the family . planning policy just because they are rich enough to pay the fine... and . they take an extra share of resources from society,' The court might not accept the case, the newspaper added. Amid increasing pressure - including a . Nanjing newspaper's publication last month of a front-page 'wanted' poster seeking information on his whereabouts - Zhang finally issued an . apology on Sunday through his studio's microblogging account. Controversial: China's one-child policy was put in place to . control China's booming population, and officials say it has been key to . the country's rising prosperity . Critics . say China's late-1970s family-planning law, which restricts most . couples to one child, is selectively and sometimes brutally enforced, . while the wealthy and well-connected are easily able to pay the fines . levied for extra offspring. But . in recent days some users of China's popular online social networks . have directed their anger at the policy itself, rather than Zhang, with . some hoping the attention heaped on his case may hasten the eventual . demise of the law, which authorities have recently moved to relax. The . policy was put in place to control China's booming population, and . officials say it has been key to the country's rising prosperity. But . opposition to it has steadily grown among members of the public as well . as among demographic experts, who warn that it has led to a decline in . China's working-age population and a swelling of the ranks of the . elderly that could bring about a labour shortage within the next two . decades. Those fears appear to be shared by . China's Communist Party leaders, who after a key meeting in Beijing last . month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy to allow couples to . have two children if one of the parents is an only child. Talent: Many of Zhang Yimou's films, such as the 2002 hit Hero (pictured) have proved popular with audiences in the West as well as China . Spectacular: Zhang Yimou masterminded the breath-taking opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics . In the past Chinese web users have typically responded with fury to reports of celebrities escaping the one-child regulation, but sentiments over the past week have been more mixed, with some citing Zhang as an example of why the law should be scrapped. 'We should be grateful to Zhang Yimou!' one posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. 'Thanks to his popularity, he's made the whole society debate the problems of the 'family planning policy'! This might help speed up the abolition of this draconian law.' Another said the controversy was 'more than ridiculous', adding: 'Procreating is a fundamental human instinct and a way of passing things on to future generations. Here in China, it's actually become a crime.' In 2012, 24 of the country's 31 provinces and regions collected a total of nearly 20 billion yuan in penalties, the Beijing News reported Thursday. None of the provincial authorities has detailed how the money was spent.","Zhang Yimou directed hit movies House of Flying Daggers and Hero .

When police raided the apartment of Serdyukov's neighbour, 33-year-old female military bureaucrat Yevgeniya Vasilieva, they found valuable paintings, rare antiques and more than 100 expensive rings. A Russian tabloid newspaper with connections to security personnel reported that Serdyukov was in the apartment as well when the raid began. Vasilieva was reported on Tuesday to have left the country. Alexei Navalny, an influential anti-corruption blogger and opposition politician, wrote a post in which he said Serdyukov had broken one of Putin's most cherished unspoken rules that 'you must honour your family'. Mr Serdyukov's replacement in a job which had been long eyed by rivals, former emergencies minister Sergei Shoigu, 57, is untainted by corruption and popular among Russians. Close friends: Rumours are spreading that the real reason Serdyukov lost his job was because of an extra-marital affair that infuriated his powerful father-in-law and patron, Viktor Zubkov, (pictured) former Russian prime minister and close ally of Vladimir Putin (in background) Mr Shoigu has also proved immensely loyal and shown few signs of political ambitions in nearly two decades in senior posts. Mr Putin's announcement made at a meeting with Mr Shoigu appeared designed to show he will crack down on high-level corruption in his new, six-year presidential term. ‘Taking into consideration the situation around the Defence Ministry, in order to create conditions for an objective investigation into all matters, I have decided to free Defence Minister Serdyukov of his post,’ Putin said, sitting across the table from Mr Shoigu at a state residence outside Moscow. The defence minister wields immense power in Russia, channelling billions of pounds every year through the country's powerful defence industry, the second largest arms exporter in the world.

Mr Putin has promised to spend 23trillion roubles (£456billion) on the military by the end of the decade. He said that the new minister must continue ‘grandiose plans for the reform of the army’. Russian investigators raided the offices of Defence Ministry firm Oboronservis last month and opened a probe into the company on suspicion that it had sold assets to commercial firms at a loss of 3billion roubles (£60million). Anatoly Serdyukov (right), a one-time furniture salesman,  owed much of his career to the influence of his father-in-law Viktor Zubkov, a former prime minister and trusted associate of Mr Putin. Mr Serdyukov's control over Russia's arms budget had earned him enemies among ambitious Kremlin figures, including Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin who oversees the country's defence industry, government sources say. His military reforms, which reorganised troops, cut the number of officers by more than 100,000 and exposed high level corruption, also made him disliked in the ranks. However, his alleged role in helping to dismantle the assets of jailed former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky while he still worked in the tax office had led many analysts to believe Mr Serdyukov was untouchable and would weather the scandal. Sergei Shoigu (right), an army general, was emergencies minister from 1994 until this year, when he became governor of the Moscow region. Although the Russian authorities were criticised in 2010 over forest fires that caused Moscow to suffer for weeks under smoke and toxic fumes, his loyalty to Mr Putin and a background untainted by corruption have done him well. ‘Shoigu is unknown in our country as a great strategist or as a powerful military officer, but that is not needed in the post of the minister of defence,’ said Alexei Arbatov, a military analyst at the Russian Academy of Sciences. ‘If the defence minister is largely an administrative post, then Shoigu has very great merits,' he added. 'As an administrator he is already regarded very highly and moreover, he is popular in Russia and in social opinion.' When he was serving as emergencies minister he was the most highly regarded minister by Moscow-based pollster VTsIOM.","Russian president announces on TV that he's fired Anatoly Serdyukov, 50 .

A teenager waited an agonising eight months before finding the courage to mention he had found a lump - and died of testicular cancer just two weeks later. Now the heartbroken of family of Michael Rushby, known as Mikey, has urged young men to check themselves after the death of the much-loved 16-year-old. His mother Patricia, 52, said today: 'He was my baby. I loved him to pieces. I want other young people to know what we have gone through. I wouldn't want any family to go through what we have.' Michael Rushby, 16, spent eight months agonising over a lump in his testicle. He died two weeks after being diagnosed with cancer . Mikey, the youngest of six brothers and sisters, was having a drink with older brother John, 22, at the family home on April 17 when he finally spoke up. 'He said he had a problem and showed me one of his testicles,' said John. 'The lump was obvious so I took him straight to A&E. The doctor said just by looking at it there was an 80 per cent chance it was cancer.' Mikey, of Grangetown, Teesside, went home for the night and went back to Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital the next day for tests. Testicular cancer was diagnosed and it was also found the cancer had spread to his abdomen and chest. He was then transferred to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment. Despite the eight-month delay in diagnosis, Mikey was still given a 75 per cent chance of beating the disease. Heartbroken: Patricia Rushby with older son John, are now urging other young men to check themselves . He had a week of chemotherapy and was allowed to go home on Friday, April 26 at his own request . He was due back at the hospital on Monday April 29 and had got himself up, had a bath, and was heading down the stairs when he lost his strength and collapsed four steps from the bottom. He was taken by ambulance to James Cook hospital, where he died later that day, it is believed from an infection. His mother said: 'I think he knew himself he was dying. He was adamant about coming home and he never complained. 'I want to say to anyone who ever thinks they might have a problem, go to your mam, go to your dad, go to someone. Mikey could have come to his mum - I wouldn't have been embarrassed.' Mikey is survived by his father Michael Rushby, 61, his sisters Lisa, 30, Jacqueline, 27, Michelle, 26, and Leanne, 21, and his six nieces and nephews. Despite the eight-month delay in diagnosis, Michael was still given a 75 per cent chance of survival. But . he died just days later on April 29 at James Cook Hospital, Middlesbrough . They described him as a 'little charmer' who would always play jokes on people and had nicknames for everyone. Jacqueline said: 'Words can't describe how much he will be missed. The house is so different, so quiet.' His brother John said: 'He will never be replaced. He wasn't just a brother, he was a mate as well. A best mate.' An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned at Teesside Coroner's Court. Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15-44 and affects around 2,000 each year in the UK. The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in part of one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom. People with an undescended testicle have . a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history . of the disease and those with HIV or AIDS. It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men. It is, however, one of the most treatable cancers. Ninety-seven per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis and 96 per cent survive for more than ten years. Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:59 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:01 EST, 20 November 2013 . As the National Football League continues to deal with the fallout of the Richie Incognito/Jonathan Martin bullying scandal, a former player has revealed that he, too, was the victim of harassment from teammates as a professional football player - and former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb led the charge. Former NFL offensive lineman Shawn Andrews was teammates with McNabb for six years in Philadelphia - from 2004 to 2009 - and by the end of his time in the City of Brotherly Love, he'd considered suicide after enduring unsubstantiated rumors about his sexuality and constant harassment from McNabb and others. Andrews currently is married to a woman and has a son, J.J. 'Bullied': Shawn Andrews says he contemplated suicide after relentless harassment from teammate Donovan McNabb . The harassment was so bad that Andrews was forced to miss training camp before the 2008 season so he could get professional help to deal with depression. '[McNabb] was a big part of it — he was a big part of my issues there. Bully is a strong word, but he was degrading to me and spread rumors. It’s bothered me that I haven’t really spoken about it,' Andrews told syncweekly.com. Andrews says he doesn't understand why McNabb turned against him - after all, as an offensive lineman, it was Andrews' job to protect the former Syracuse star from linebackers looking to take his head off. Andrews isn't sure why he was made to be a target, but says it could have to do with a variety of factors - the way he wore his hair (a mohawk often dyed red or white) or the Vans sneakers he wore, could have contributed to other players' opinion of him. 'Some guys, they just find one thing and run with it,' his brother Stacy Andrews - also a former NFL lineman - says. 'Us having a little style and swag, they just ran with that. Big guys don’t usually wear Vans shoes, but we do. They made some comments and snickered about that. They may not like it that you dress a little different.' 'Center of attention': Andrews comes short of calling McNabb a bully, but says he was certainly no leader . Whatever the reason, the relentless harassment drove Andrews to consider suicide. 'One time I had a crazy idea of flipping my car. I knew I didn’t want to kill myself because I wouldn’t use a gun. I was a coward in that regard. Because if I flip my vehicle and I’m paralyzed and I live ... that’s the kind of stuff that went through my head,' Andrews says. 'I was kind of at my wit’s end, but I was still afraid to talk to somebody. The very first person I opened up to was a paid psychiatrist. It was hard to do.' After missing training camp, Andrews asked coach Andy Reid if he could address the team as a whole and apologize for his absence. 'I poured my heart out. I’m not a public speaker, so I was nervous,' Andrews says. 'But I felt it had to be done, so I was standing there . talking, and in the middle of talking to them I was making eye contact . with as many of the [players] as I could. So guess who was looking at me . rolling his eyeballs? Can you guess who was doing that while I was . pouring my heart out to my teammates? You know how that made me feel? After that, my thoughts were so screwed up. Then I started to stutter . and thought, ‘'These guys probably think I’m full of sh*t.’' At that point . I really cared. [McNabb] was rolling his eyes at me the whole time.' 'A living hell': Andrews says the Eagles locker room had little comradery and was full of immature players . Andrews describes the atmosphere in the Eagles locker room as 'cliquey,' with McNabb always needing to be the center of attention. 'I could be sitting in the players’ lounge with a group, having some laughs, and he’d get his say in so the attention can shift,' Andrews says. 'He was the type of person that had everything in the world he could want, but that still wasn’t enough. He wanted the attention on him. There was a whole lot of that behavior. He wasn’t just that way with me. I’m thinking, ''‘Every day I strap on my shoulder pads and helmet, I’m here to protect you.’'' Andrews also attributes the immaturity of other players to the rumors regarding his sexuality. He says he has nothing against homosexuals, but that being labeled one in the NFL is dangerous. He says that after he caught wind of the rumors, he would wait until other players were out of the shower before he would go in, as to make sure other players didn't think he was there to look at them. 'If you want to question someone, I’d see guys in the shower talking face to face,' Andrews says. 'If you want to go further, I’ve even seen a teammate piss on another teammate. They think it’s funny. They are having a conversation and the whole time one guy is peeing on him and the other doesn’t even know. This is the stuff that goes on, and I am the one having to defend myself. There were a lot of immature dudes on the team.' Class act: Andrews (center) says Giants QB Eli Manning (left) made him feel right at home in the locker room . After a series of injuries, Andrews was released by the Eagles. He was picked up by the New York Giants and had a much better experience with quarterback Eli Manning. 'We were in the weight room the day after a game, stretching, and Eli came up to me and said, '‘Shawn, thanks for protecting me,’” Andrews said. 'That never happened in Philadelphia. I had heard that Tom Brady bought his linemen Mercedes. That ‘'thank you'’ was my Mercedes. That meant a lot to me, but the entire organization was like that. 'I had the time of my life in New York. I just wished I could have played a few more seasons there.'","Shawn Andrews was McNabb's teammate for six years in Philadelphia .

The Asian civilian guard, who faces the sack, is said to have spat at the serviceman and made the abusive remark at the archery contest at Lord's Cricket Ground. The remark is believed to have been a reference to the soldier's service in Afghanistan. Security guards at the archery competition at Lord's Cricket Ground.

G4S, which had to be bailed out by troops after failing to provide enough guards to protect London 2012 venues, has begun an urgent investigation into the claims. It said the soldier, understood to be a member of 35 Engineers, had asked to search the security officer. The incident happened behind the scenes on Saturday evening as spectators watched Italy win the gold medal match against the U.S. in the men's team archery event.

But an expert on baseball from the United States has made a 'very significant' discovery that appears to prove his country's national sport, famously as American as apple pie, was first played in England in 1749 by royalty. Frederick Louis, son of George II, heir to the throne and the Prince of Wales, had a game with his friend Charles Sackville, Lord Middlesex, on what is now Ashley Park, in Walton on Thames. Scroll down for video . Evidence: This cutting from the Whitehall Evening post in 1749, proves baseball came from England not America, researchers have found . Significant: The match took place in Ashley Park, Walton on Thames, on an area now taken up by this cricket pitch (pictured) A report in The Whitehall Evening Post item from 264 years ago, dated September 19 reads: 'On Tuesday last, his Royal . Highness the Prince of Wales, and Lord Middlesex, played at Bass-Ball, . at Walton in Surry; notwithstanding the weather was extreme bad, they . continued playing several hours.' American researcher and author David Block, who specialises in the study of baseball’s origins, spotted the small news piece and believes the game was played a week earlier, on September 12. 'This is a very, very significant because it is the first known baseball game involving mature adults. And it is also one of the very, very first references to baseball overall,' he said. 'In fact it is the earliest one for which the original source survives, which makes it particularly significant.' Research: Baseball expert David Block (left) tracked down the cutting at the British Library, which discusses a match involving Frederick the Prince of Wales (right), which firmly places the sport's origins in Britain . Thriving: Baseball continues to be one of America's top sports buts its origins appear to be firmly across the Atlantic in the UK . The match was played at Ashley Park in Walton on Thames because Sackville’s wife, Grace Boyle, had inherited the 136 acre property from her parents in 1740. English baseball will have been very different to the American version, as it would probably similar to rounders and cricket. The then Prince of Wales who played in the first game was known to be cricket mad, and was a celebrated patron of the sport. But until the last five years it had always been believed the sport was conceived in the United States. The first mention of the game there came in 1791, when an order banned baseball within 80 yards of the town meeting hall in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. However, in 2008 a diary was found which described how teenagers played the game in 1755, again in Surrey. Lawyer William Bray wrote how he took part in a match between friends in Guildford on Easter Monday that year.","Newspaper cutting reveals match involving Prince of Wales in 1749 in Surrey .

'If a . colleague had been telling me what to do in those circumstances I would . have taken it on board. But as it was my dad I reverted to being like .

George said: 'He's constantly ducking out of Christmas which isn't in keeping with his usual sunny disposition! So we won't spend Christmas day together but will have some family time at some point.' Those living in hope of Larry one day returning to Christmas TV screens in a Gavin and Stacey special will be sadly disappointed though. 'There's more chance of getting kicked to death by a donkey on Southend Pier,' is how he put it. But the actor said he would be delighted if writers James Corden and Ruth Jones did decide to revive the much-loved sitcom - for a Christmas special, new series or even on the stage. He said: 'Perhaps we might do a stage show in the future like Monty Python. I'm sure all the cast would jump at the chance for a TV reunion. I was talking to Alison Steadman (who played his wife on the show) the other day about how we would love to do it again, it was a wonderful part of all our lives.'

Sweet-toothed Tracey Foster, 41, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, was 28st at her heaviest after becoming hooked on the biscuits for nearly 20 years. The mother-of-two would routinely skip lunch and breakfast and instead opt for Jammie Dodgers washed down with mugs of sugary tea. Sweet-tooth: Jammie Dodger addict, Tracey Foster, would eat 24 biscuits a day but has now lost 16st after ditching the treat . At the height of her addiction, Tracey would consume three packs of the treats a day - which accounted for 2,000 calories - the entire recommended daily amount for a woman. She spent £1,255 each year on Jammie Dodgers which she bought in bulk from a local supermarket. Tracey shot up to a size 30 after almost two decades of snacking on Jammie Dodgers during the day and eating takeaways in the evening. She explained: 'Ever since I had my children I have struggled with my weight. It slowly crept up on me over the years and my love for Jammie Dodgers didn’t help. Some days I could eat a pack in one sitting and managed three packs a day. I would definitely say it was my addiction. 'Then eating curries and takeaways at night just made it all worse. I would eat a day’s worth of food in the evening, snacking on lumps of cheese, crisps and chocolate throughout the night. 'Fruit and vegetables were swear words in my house. You would never see me with a salad.'

The family of a loving couple killed when their home was destroyed in a huge gas explosion have spoken of their 'insurmountable' grief. Suhail Akhtar, 46, and Dorota Kolasisnska, 34, had been together for ten years when the devastating blast ripped through their home, destroyed two other houses and left their bodies buried in the rubble. Friends and colleagues also remembered the generous, popular and hardworking couple, who loved to cycle and would raise money for charity in their spare time. 'Void': Friends and family spoke of their loss after Suhail Akhtar, left, and Dorota Kolasinska, right, died in a gas explosion on Monday . Mr Akhtar, an IT contracter, and Ms Kolasinska, a council traffic controller, will be 'sorely missed', their friends said, while Mr Akhtar's family, speaking for the first time since the tragedy, said the couple's 'passion for life' will be what they remember most. They said: 'Suhail and Dorota’s loss has left an . insurmountable void in our lives. Suhail’s passion for living life to . the max and their exuberance touched all our lives. It will be our . enduring memory of them both.' Speaking earlier in the week, after the couple were first named, close friend Sheldon Hawkshaw, . 42, said he was 'in shock'. Destruction: The gas explosion destroyed three homes and damaged more (pictured) Tragedy: The London Fire Brigade and National Grid have launched an investigation into the explosion . Mr Hawkshaw, who also works in IT, said he spoke to Mr Akhtar 'every day'. 'We went skiing together, motorcycling every weekend - he was very active, always in the gym. 'He . was a go-to guy. He always had time for everyone, he was a great friend . to us. He always made us laugh and will be sorely missed.' Colleagues of Ms Kolasinska, who had worked as a traffic controller at Hackney Council for nine months, described her as 'extremely popular and hard-working'. Speaking to the Evening Standard, Kim Wright, a service director at the east London council, said: 'This is a truly tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies are with Dorota's family, friends and colleagues.' Blast: The explosion left the bodies of Mr Akhtar and Ms Kolasinska buried in rubble . Search: Three people were also hospitalised by the blast, thought to have been caused by a falling tree (pictured) The explosion, which was reported at around 7.30am on Monday, destroyed three houses on the street in Hounslow and damaged two more. Three people were also injured by the explosion, one of whom was still in hospital the day after. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force was still awaiting results from post-mortem examinations on Mr Akhtar and Ms Kolasinska. The couple, who had been together for about 10 years, were keen cyclists who enjoyed taking part in charity events, friends said. Earlier this year they took part in the . London-to-Brighton charity cycle ride, and in 2012 raised money for . Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research as part of the London Bikeathon event.

A bouncing baby girl has made history by the 18th member of her family to be christened in a 140-year-old Victorian gown. The pretty hand-stitched frock worn by eight-month-old Ffion Olivia Evans was first used when her great, great, great grandfather Nicholas Henry Oates’ was baptised in 1874. Since then the treasured family heirloom has been passed down from generation to generation - and worn by at least 17 relations. Adorable: Eight-month-old Ffion Evans wearing her Victorian christening gown at her home in Abergavenny . Heirloom: The gown has been worn by at least 17 relations including Ffion's mother Tracey Carter, 35 . The bespoke cotton gown has also been lent out over the years to other relatives and friends who couldn’t afford their own and is still in remarkably good condition. Last month it was Ffion’s turn to don the garment as it became the centrepiece of yet another family christening in Pendeen, Cornwall. The tiny baby followed in the footsteps of her mother, Tracy Carter, 35, who wore the gown when she was baptised at the local church in 1978. Among those looking on was Ffion’s grandmother Jane Carter, 59, and great grandmother Joan Semmens, 81, who were also christened in the heirloom. Tracy said: 'We’ve had so many family members wear the gown it’s become very special. Both myself and my brother wore it, as well as quite a few cousins. Early outing: Ffion's Great Aunt Eva holding her uncle, Paul Carter, in the gown at his 1970s christening . Family affair: Ffion's great grandfather Godfrey Semmens, left, with relations holding second cousin Paul May . 'We had four generations of my family at the christening including my mum and grandmother who both wore the same dress at the same church. 'I wouldn’t have had Ffion dressed in anything else - it holds such sentimental value and I hope that she will be able to continue the family tradition by one day passing it on to her kids.' Tracy said her mother Jane hand-washed the cotton gown before the christening after finding it stored away in a family member’s attic. The proud mother now lives in Abergavenny, Wales with husband Oliver Evans, 31, but most of her family and friends still live in Pendeen. And the gown hasn't just been worn by family members: over the years, it has also been lent to friends and other members of the close-knit local community, among them, their former pub landlord. Tracy, an employment trainer, said: 'My mum washed the gown before the christening as she found it looking slightly yellow. Happy family: Ffion with her mother Tracey Carter, 35, and her father Oliver Evans, 31, at home in Wales .

'On the day it looked so pristine - I could tell my mum became quite emotional while we were putting Ffion in the gown. 'All the family members who are aware of the tradition were commenting on how lovely she looked - it was an amazing atmosphere. 'Pendeen church is at the centre of this tradition as many members of the family have also married there.' The Church traditionally insisted that babies were christened in white as a symbol of purity and innocence. Christening gowns gained popularity during the Victorian era when families were often large and it was useful to pass them down from one sibling to the next. The garments have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years thanks to period TV dramas such as Downton Abbey and The Paradise. The Royal family used the same christening gown, first commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1841, for 167 years.Prince George was christened in an exact replica after the vintage garment was retired in 2004 because it was too delicate to be used again.","Ffion Olivia Evans wore the vintage frock to her christening last month .

A wealthy crime tsar with two houses has been given a taxpayer-funded allowance so he can stay the night nearer his office. Tony Hogg, the £85,000-a-year Tory Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, is receiving £650 a month in public funds for accommodation to make his drive to work shorter. A former warship captain, he has chosen to bed down at a Navy camp where staying Monday to Friday would cost only £340 a month – but his office insists he is not profiting from the arrangement. Tony Hogg is receiving £650 a month in public funds for accommodation to make his drive to work shorter . The allowance has outraged rank-and-file police, who say he could stay free in an en suite room at the force HQ. Critics said last night that his spending was unjustifiable when the force has had to save £40 million over the past two years. Nigel Rabbitts, chairman of Devon and Cornwall Police Federation, said: ‘In times of austerity this is not an appropriate expenditure. Mr Hogg knew he would need to spend a lot of time in Exeter when he took the job.’ He added: ‘There is police accommodation at the constabulary’s HQ in Exeter. I have to use that when I need to stay overnight and so do other officers. It’s good, en suite accommodation but perhaps the PCC feels it’s not good enough for him.’ Tony Hogg owns two houses in West Cornwall including the one pictured above . Mr Hogg, 64, and his wife Chrissie live in a house in a ‘stunning location’ in Helston, West Cornwall, which cost £355,000 in 2000. They planned to open a B&B but say they have had no customers. They also bought a cottage nearby for £185,000, which they rent out. A veteran of the Falklands War, Mr Hogg . was elected to his post last November. Since then, the new PCC – who is . meant to make police more accountable to the public – has come under . fire for spending almost £250,000 on consultants and agency staff. The head of a sleaze watchdog that . has warned of cronyism and conflicts of interest among PCCs is to . lecture all the crime tsars after a series of scandals. David Prince, . head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, will tell the 41 . commissioners gathering in London next month that they must display . integrity and openness. Allegations have emerged of PCCs giving well-paid jobs to friends and allies without advertising the posts. Mr Rabbitts added: ‘We have seen a steady increase in his office’s expenditure and his staffing levels, at a time when the rest of us are losing staff and funding.’ Mr Hogg’s office agreed last week that he could receive £7,800 a year before tax towards the cost of staying overnight near the PCC office in Exeter. A meeting was told that it was ‘unreasonable and impractical’ for him to make the 200-mile round trip from his home in Helston to the office and back. A spokesman said last night that, after tax, Mr Hogg is left with just enough cash to stay at the Navy’s camp in Lympstone, just outside Exeter, where rooms cost £17 a night. Mr Hogg, who was unavailable for comment last night, is said to have decided it would be inappropriate to stay in the free en suite rooms at the Exeter Police HQ. But Councillor Brian Greenslade, former Liberal Democrat chairman of Devon County Council and runner-up to Mr Hogg in the PCC elections, said: ‘It is simply not acceptable. Why can’t he use police accommodation like I and others sometimes had to when we worked for the former police authority?’ And Councillor Alex Folkes, a member of the local Police and Crime Panel, said: ‘It seems Tony Hogg’s first instinct is to put his hand in the taxpayer’s pocket. He seems to forget he is already getting £85,000 a year of our money.’","Tony Hogg is receiving £650 a .

A teenager suffers from a condition that she says makes her look like she is nine months pregnant every time she eats. Rachael Harley has a problem with her digestive system which means her stomach swells and leaves her in tremendous pain. The 19-year-old was diagnosed with abdominal adhesions - bands of fibrous tissue between her organs - earlier this year. Rachael Harley, 19, has a problem with her digestive system which means she says she looks nine months pregnant every time she eats . Every time she eats her stomach balloons so much that people think she is pregnant. She has now been in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary since October and doctors don't know what to do to treat her problem. Rachael, of Balmedie, said: ‘My weight's gone up and down in a very small space of time. ‘I put on weight after surgery, but it did get down to six stone at one point because I couldn't eat. ‘My mum couldn't bring herself to look at me. I was just bones. ‘But every time I do eat, I look about nine months pregnant. Somebody in the hospital canteen actually asked me how far along I was. Rachael has abdominal adhesions - bands of fibrous tissue between her organs - which cause her extreme pain . ‘I didn't even know what to say. I . felt so awful that I lied. It's horrible. It feels as though my stomach . is about to stretch open.’ Rachael's problems began when her stomach suddenly swelled overnight and she was rushed to hospital on April 28. She had various tests and scans but doctors could not determine what was wrong. The teenager was released from hospital a few days later after she seemed to get better. But the crippling pain and swelling came back and she was readmitted later in the week. After a range of tests could not show what was wrong, an investigative operation in July finally revealed Rachael was suffering from adhesions, bands of fibrous tissue, on her bowel and appendix. They were removed and Rachael, who worked as a supervisor at clothes shop Warehouse before she became ill, returned home. But her symptoms soon began to resurface. She said: ‘Originally the adhesions were intertwined and were cut out. ‘They were causing an obstruction in my bowel and my organs were struggling to move about. ‘Everything was just fantastic and I started eating again. I went home and was looking forward to returning to my course. ‘But it didn't last long and I never got back to anything. I was put on different medications and even tried nerve-blocking injections, but nothing seemed to help. ‘Then eventually about eight weeks ago, I was taken back into hospital.’ Doctors have been at a loss with what to do, fearing that more investigative surgery could make her problems worse. Rachael said: 'Every time I do eat, I look about nine months pregnant. Somebody in the hospital canteen actually asked me how far along I was' Due to the seriousness of her condition, Rachael has now been in hospital since October, but she vows to remain positive. She . said: ‘Unfortunately, now a little down the line we are back to square . one. We believe that the adhesions have returned and are day by day . possibly causing damage to my bowel, stomach, gallbladder and fertility . organs. ‘I am unable to eat much and am deteriorating again. We are losing faith in the NHS doctors and in the care that I am receiving here in ARI. ‘You have to keep your spirits up, but it's difficult. I've managed with my mum to get into town in a wheelchair a few times. ‘I go clothes shopping, even though I can't wear them because my stomach swells so much.’ Rachael had to leave her photography course at Aberdeen College because she has missed classes through her illness. Rachael had surgery to remove the fibrous bands in her stomach but they soon returned and they are now threatening her reproductive organs - she fears she may have to have a hysterectomy . And she also had to turn down a place at London Metropolitan University to study fashion buying. But . she is now trying to raise money for specialist treatment which she . hopes will give her back her life – and she wants to train to be a . midwife. She said: ‘I've missed out on so much. I see photos on Facebook of all of my friends out enjoying themselves. It's heart-breaking. ‘After being in hospital now though, I want to be a midwife. I don't want to waste time. ‘Getting the right treatment would give everything back to me and my family. It would be brilliant. I want to start 2014 afresh.’ Rachael is hoping to raise enough money to pay for treatment from a private adhesions specialist in London, who would have the expert knowledge to investigate. Surgeons in Aberdeen have run out of options for treating Rachael - they fear if they perform another operation it will make the problem worse . Generous friends and family rallied round and have already raised almost £2,000 in just two days. Rachael said: ‘I can't believe how supportive everyone has been, especially in December. ‘It was a last chance thing and it's given me so much hope.’ If the tissues inside the body become injured, the immune system triggers a response that involves forming bands of scar tissue, called adhesions. This usually occurs after surgery. Most of the time, the adhesions don't cause any problems. However, sometimes the scar tissue can cause the bowels to stick together. This can cause it to become partially blocked - this causes pain and vomiting. Adhesions can also pull the fallopian tubes out of place causing infertility. Causes of adhesions include appendicitis, endometriosis, an infection and STIs. The main forms of treatment are surgery and painkillers. Source: BUPA . In London, a barrier mechanism would . be inserted to help prevent the adhesions from returning and hopefully . allow Rachael to carry on with a pain-free life. The . teenager believes that the adhesions formed and attached themselves to . her bowel and appendix after she suffered from appendicitis. They normally develop in patients after they have had surgery, but doctors believe that Rachael was born with the condition. She said: ‘My stomach doesn't empty fast enough so it just swells up. I can eat little things like snacks but when it's really bad I can barely even take in water because I just feel sick. ‘Other people I have spoken to [with the condition] are having to get hysterectomies because the adhesions have spread so much. ‘The pelvic pain I have is really severe and we're worried about mine. ‘We found out online that when you have them congenitally that there's 93 per cent chance of them coming back.’ Rachael now wants to raise as much money as she can in the hope that she can travel down to London for the surgery next year. The cost of the surgery and all the tests involved will be about £4,000.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:05 EST, 21 January 2012 . Forecasters are expecting up to eight inches of snow in the New York region as the first serious winter storm of the season blanketed much of the northeast. Armies of salt spreaders and plows, so far used only once or twice this winter, attacked about two inches of snow in New York and Philadelphia. The flurries began about 2.15am Saturday and were expected to let up by Saturday evening. This winter has been unseasonably dry and devoid of snowfall, thanks to the movement of air pressure above the North Atlantic Ocean, which has kept most of the cold Canadian air out of the northeastern United States. Socked in: Snow flurries Saturday morning left most of New York with low visibility and cut power to hundreds of homes . A day out: Many New Yorkers welcomed the first major snowfall of the winter by breaking out skis and playing in the snow . Winter storm: New Yorkers bundled up Saturday as they braved the first major storm the hit the northeast . Before the snow storm today, Philadelphia had received just half an inch of snowfall for the season -- well below the average of 7 inches the city usually sees. One person died after he slipped in the snow and was run over by a skidding SUV in East Harlem, New York. About 1,500 customers on Staten Island lost electricity for a few hours as the region coped with its first snow storm. In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg called a Saturday morning press conference, hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's highly-criticized slow response to heavy snowfall. The mayor said hundreds of sanitation workers were put on overnight shifts late Friday and began spraying down the streets with salt water to prepare for the onslaught. Some 1,500 snow plows and more than 230,000 tons of salt are at the city's disposal, though this storm will not require the full might of city resources, officials said. Weekend wonderland: The flurries Saturday brought snow-starved New Yorkers outside to play . First snow: This is the first major winter storm of the season, forcing residents to bundle up and shovel out . Forecasters said the white blanket . wouldn't stick around for too long, though. Freezing rain had already . begun to fall by 9.30am in Philadelphia as the temperatures warmed above . freezing. By Sunday, any precipitation was likely to come down in the form of rain as temperatures climb above 40 degrees Monday. 'So it's a short taste of winter and the temperatures continue to be warm through Monday and at least midweek,' Valerie Meola, meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Philadelphia office said. Flurries and freezing rain is expected for the Washington D.C. area. Region hit: Snow fell across the northeast, blanketing streets from Jersey City (pictured here) to Philadelphia to Washington DC . White blanket: Forecasters expected up to eight inches of snow in some parts of the New York region. About three inches had fallen by mid-morning Saturday . Philadelphia International Airport is under a ground delay for arriving . flights because of snow and ice accumulation. A spokeswoman says . arriving flights are experiencing delays of less than two hours, but . most departing flights are leaving on time. The storm marked the first significant snowfall for some East Coast . residents, including in Philadelphia. A rare October snowstorm knocked . out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses in the Northeast. The northeast flurries come after Chicago was hit by heavy snow yesterday evening as officials worked on Friday to prevent a repeat of last year's 'snowmageddon,' when a blizzard left hundreds of drivers stranded along one of the city's main thoroughfares for up to 12 hours overnight. Extreme weather is also set to hit the Northeast, with snow forecast to reach Boston, New York and Philadelphia on and Saturday morning. The snow could go as far south as Baltimore and Washington DC, forecasters say. Standstill: Extreme weather has grounded flights across the U.S., including at Seattle (pictured) and Chicago . Keep calm and carry on: Commuters walk toward a rail station as the snow continues to accumulate in downtown Chicago . With Chicago getting socked by its . first major snowstorm of the winter and drifts forming, officials . detoured buses off icy Lake Shore Drive, the iconic road running along . Lake Michigan. Bus service was partially restored by the end of rush hour except for the southern portion of the road. Last year's storm, which dumped more than 20 inches of snow, brought Chicago to a standstill and caused serious embarrassment to a city known for its ability to keep working in some of the most severe winter weather. Transit spokesman Brian Steele said icy ramps and drifting snow led to the decision to move buses away from the lakefront Friday and onto roads where there was less wind and slower traffic. Snow: Cold weather is set to hit the Northwest, Midwest and Northeast regions this weekend . Response: Many cities and towns have put emergency services on high alert after the weather predictions . No significant problems had developed yet, he said, adding, 'The decision was made solely as a precaution.' More than 700 flights were cancelled at Chicago's airports, the bulk of them at O'Hare International Airport, the Chicago Department of Aviation said. While the snow started in the morning, the worst of the storm hit just at rush hour. Eight inches of snow were expected by nightfall, and the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning lasting until late Friday. Chicago deployed its full fleet of 278 plows to push through the snow on main streets and Lake Shore Drive, but they had to inch along with commuters headed home in heavy traffic. A shrub is sheathed in ice in Seattle, showing the more picturesque side of the winter weather . Forecast: Cold weather is spreading across the whole of the U.S. 'The biggest challenge for us right now is congestion. We're caught in it just like everyone else,' said Guy Tridgell, a spokesman with the Illinois Department of Transportation. During last year's February blizzard, the city's third-worst storm on record, authorities had to remove 525 vehicles that got stuck on Lake Shore Drive, which was closed for 33 hours. City officials began work in November to create two turnaround points on the road to make it easier for cars to avoid getting stuck.","A pedestrian died after being run over by an SUV after slipping in the snow while crossing the street .

Official figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility published as part of the Autumn Statement show the cost of buying a house has been severely underestimated. House prices will on average rise by 5.2 per cent next year, 7.2 per cent in 2015 and will be 10 per cent higher in 2018 than predicted, the OBR says. This will crush many people's hopes of owning their own home. On the up: The OBR has today changed its predictions for house price rises to 8.2%, with the cost peaking in 2015 . But George Osborne said in his Autumn Statement today than the OBR's new forecasts still left real house prices 3.1% lower than their 2007 peak. The OBR sharply increased its forecasts, with homes expected to cost 10% more by 2018 than it had previously predicted, and Mr Osborne acknowledged there was a 'weakness of supply' in the market. Message: Mr Osborne used his Autumn Statement to say that he would get house building moving but admitted there was a 'shortage of supply' Mr Osborne said: 'Some of the most important infrastructure for British families is housing and we have to confront this simple truth: if we want more people to own a home, we have to build more homes. 'And the OBR is absolutely right today to draw attention to the weakness of housing supply in this country. 'The good news is the latest survey data showed residential construction growing at its fastest rate for a decade. And our hard-won planning reforms are delivering a 35% increase in approvals for new homes. 'But we need to do more.' The Housing Revenue Account borrowing limit will be raised by £300 million for councils, which will also be encouraged to sell off their most expensive properties to fund more cost-effective homes. Mr Osborne said: 'Aspiration isn't only for people who can afford their own home. We want to regenerate some of our most run-down urban housing estates. 'Councils will sell off the most expensive social housing, so they can house many more families for the same money. 'We are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job. 'Right to Buy applications have doubled under this Government and we'll expand it more.' The OBR noted that the growth in residential investment had left household finances in deficit and the gross debt to income ratio rising. Its report said that was consistent with low interest rates and schemes such as Help to Buy but 'may pose risks to the sustainability of the recovery over the medium term'. Mr Osborne acknowledged that the market should be 'functioning' but 'stable' and the Bank of England had powers to deal with any housing bubble. Rising high: House prices surged by 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November alone, according to the Nationwide . He said: 'Help to aspiring families and building more homes - that's what we stand for. But we must also avoid the mistakes of the last decade. 'We want a responsible recovery. 'That is why I am the first Chancellor to give the Bank of England the responsibility and the power not only to monitor overall debt levels, but to take action to deal with asset bubbles if they threaten our stability. 'We want a functioning, stable housing market. 'The OBR's latest house price forecast, while higher, still has real house prices 3.1% lower in 2018 than at their peak in 2007.' The Goverment's coffers will receive a boost from the buoyant housing market, with revenues from capital gains and stamp taxes forecast to increase. The OBR said: 'Our forecast for stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is much higher than in March. We now expect receipts to almost double over the forecast period, from £8.9 billion in 2013/14 to £16.8 billion in 2018/19.' Comparison: This graph shows how the OBR predictions were much lower in March this year compared to today . By 2017/18 higher house prices will contribute around £1.8 billion to the forecast, while a higher volume of transactions will add £1 billion to receipts. Increasing prices will mean 'a greater proportion of transactions' become subject to higher stamp duty bands, the OBR added. Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association's environment and housing board, said the measures would 'provide a glimmer of hope' to people facing lengthy waits for a council house. 'Government has today acknowledged councils' argument that the current restrictions on our ability to invest in new housing are not fit for purpose,' he said. 'This is an important first step towards untying the hands of local authorities to build the new social housing which millions on housing waiting lists desperately need.' It was also announced that families with granny flats or converted buildings will get 50 per cent off their council tax bill. The policy will save £500 off a £2,500 bill.","Office for Budget Responsibility sharply increases its estimates today .

NatWest and RBS online banking today stopped working for the second time in a week thanks to an apparent cyber-attack, in the latest blow to the State-owned financial giant. Thousands were left unable to pay for their purchases on 'Cyber Monday' four days ago after the group's cashpoints and online services suddenly crashed. And today customers were again shut out of their accounts when the Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest websites seemed to become inaccessible. The company blamed the error on a so-called 'DDoS attack', which occurs when hackers deliberately overwhelm a site by sending millions of requests for access all at the same time. Scroll down for video . Crash: NatWest's website has been hit with major technical problems for the second time this week . Dozens of the banks' users took to Twitter to complain that they could not access the company's websites. Some even suggested that the problems were once again affecting cash machines, claiming they were unable to withdraw money. NatWest's website went down around 11.30am, leading to floods of online complaints, and stayed offline for an hour. The bank's official Twitter account advised customers to follow an alternative link - goo.gl/ZPDdZ - to access online banking, suggesting that the problem related to the website's homepage. The RBS site was also reported to have crashed, although it was apparently working again after a few minutes. Complaints: Multiple users took to Twitter to complain that the banks' websites had crashed . Hayley Davis told MailOnline: 'I was just trying to log on to move some money but the website is down. I called NatWest customer care who didn't know about it - the gentleman I spoke to said he hoped it wasn't down, because he banked with them and needed to get online himself! 'He went off to check and came back to confirm, apologised and said they didn't know when it would be back on.' A spokesman for the banking group said: 'Due to a surge in internet traffic deliberately directed at the NatWest website, customers experienced difficulties accessing some of our customer websites today. 'This deliberate surge of traffic is commonly known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. We have taken the appropriate action to restore the affected web sites. 'At no time was there any risk to customers. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.' The bank has given no indication as to who could have been behind the attack, nor why it was targeted. Troubles: On Monday, RBS's systems crashed, leading to chaos for customers who could not access money . Jesse Moore wrote on Twitter: . 'NatWest website down from three internet connections. Mobile app not . working, given up. Time to switch.' RBS . customer Eilish Bennett claimed that she was unable to use her bank . card, tweeting: 'My bank card won't work and I can't withdraw a penny.' It is not known whether or not this was related to the web problems. On Monday supermarket trolleys full of food were abandoned, mothers were unable to buy milk for babies and motorists could not purchase fuel as RBS's payment systems crashed completely. Customers were unable to use their debit or credit cards, with some told they had gone into overdraft because payments could not be processed. The computer glitch lasted for around three hours, and affected cash machines, smartphone apps and websites belonging to RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan apologised for the technical problems which plagued 'Cyber Monday', said to be the biggest online shopping day of the year. He blamed it on years of underinvestment into the bank's computer systems, and vowed to 'do better' in the future. The problems have rekindled memories of the meltdown the bank suffered in the summer of 2012, which delivered days of disruption for customers. A technical glitch millions saw unable to access their salaries in what was branded one of the biggest IT failures at a UK bank. The British Government owns 81 per cent of RBS Group, and the string of issues affecting customers could harm its attempts to reduce its stake and return the bank to the private sector.

As well as babies, Cowell hinted at a possible X Factor return for Cheryl Cole after the pair's acrimonious falling out following her shortlived stint on the show's US version. With rumours abound as to his own return to the UK judging panel with Gary Barlow and Louis Walsh set to leave, Simon also discussed whether he will take up a vacant spot on the show he describes as his 'baby' himself.

Bode Miller's wife is now saying that it was 'fate' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they wouldn't have been able to spend as much time with his baby from a previous relationship. How much time they are able to spend with the 9-month old is the basis of a contentious custody battle between the Olympian skier and his ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna. McKenna, an ex-marine who moved from California to New York when she was seven months pregnant, was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the Thanksgiving holiday, but now the bitter exes and their legal teams will be back in a Manhattan court next week for the next hearing. Airing their views: Bode Miller and his wife Morgan Beck, who he married shortly after ending his relationship with Sara McKenna, announced that she miscarried in January . Holding on tight: Just before Thanksgiving, a judge overturned the previous custody ruling that gave the Millers the rights to the child he had with Sara McKenna (pictured), allowing her to care for the child until December 9 . Miller met McKenna through a high-end dating service after they both expressed interest in settling down. Their relationship didn't last long, however, but McKenna discovered she was pregnant with his child by the time he had already begun dating his now-wife Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player. McKenna later released a text she sent to Miller after asking him to join her at an ultrasound appointment. He refused to go and wrote: 'U made this choice against my wish'. In October, McKenna warned Miller that there was a possibility that she would be moving across the country: 'Just a heads up, I met with an advisor from Columbia today and we will probably be moving there in the fall.' That same month, he married Beck after dating for just five months and in November he submitted a 'Petition to Establish Parental Relationship' in a California court, identifying himself as the father of a child who was not yet born. Bode and Morgan announced that she was pregnant weeks later, only to reveal shortly after that she had a miscarriage. 'It was awful. Morgan and I hadn't planned on getting pregnant, but we were excited. In hindsight, now, we can see what an incredible challenge having two babies would have been. I don't believe in fate- that everything happens for a reason- but Morgan does,' Bode said in an interview with Us Weekly, a portion of which is online. That reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Bode's son with Sara, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. Sara calls him Sam after giving the boy Bode's legal name, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, when she gave birth to him in New York in February. Fighting for his son: Miller and his wife had custody of the boy, who they refer to as Nate while his mother calls him Sam, for months leading up to the reversal before Thanksgiving . Evolving: Morgan, a professional volleyball player, got pregnant expectantly but had a miscarriage shortly after announcing it . Virtual guilt trip: Bode, his wife and his daughter Dace (right) from another previous relationship celebrated an early Christmas in Colorado this week when McKenna had custody of 'Nate' and he posted this photo . Bode later petitioned a court in his home state of California to add Nathaniel as a middle name in honor of his brother who died in April. Now he and Morgan refer to the boy as Nate. The couple argues that McKenna has been conducting a virtual smear campaign against them, and while they maintain that they have not fought back, they are changing their ways now because it will effect the skier’s career as he trains for the Winter Olympics. Her strike back: McKenna posted multiple photos of she and 'Sam' over Thanksgiving, including this one of them at the Macy's parade . Bode, 36, told The Boston Globe on Thursday that Sara, who is now studying at Columbia University, is directly attacking his brand. '(McKenna has) been directly attacking that. It’s so pointless in this case because it has no bearing on anything. It doesn’t make any difference,' he told the paper. 'It’s just, when you are in a position where things aren’t going your way — my wife does it all the time if she’s losing a fight or something, she just switches the fight to something else that she thinks she can win at. Just totally changes the argument to something else. It’s not a bad tactic. It’s just kind of pointless.' Other factors are weighing in on the argument now, however, turning the case into a question of women's rights as one New York judge initially ruled that McKenna was 'forum shopping' for more favorable courts by moving from California in her third trimester. He awarded custody to Miller. After that September 3 decision, McKenna told The New York Times that her ex and new wife wasted no time uprooting the boy as they came back to her apartment 'took the baby out of my arms, dropped it in a car seat and drove away.' A second judge then reversed that decision though the case is still ongoing. The Millers arrived at the Manhattan court with 'Nate' in tow last week and McKenna took the child after the hearing as she was granted custody over the Thanksgiving holiday and through till the next hearing on December 9. Bi-coastal contention: After meeting Miller in San Diego, McKenna moved to New York when she was pregnant and gave birth to the boy there, but the Millers argue she moved to be in a more favorable state for the custody case . She has posted photos of she and 'Sam' together in New York over the past few days, including one of the pair attending the Thanksgiving Day parade. Even though he didn't have his son near him to post new photos, Bode didn't let the social media war stay put there: he posted an old photo of 'Nate' and Dace, his 5-year-old daughter from another previous relationship. He and Morgan had discussed online how they were celebrating an 'early' Christmas this week in Colorado, and the picture of 'Nate' and Dace read: 'She's super sad her brother isn't here to celebrate with us.' McKenna has custody of 'Sam' until at least the next hearing on Monday December 9.","Newlywed ski champ Bode Miller is in a custody battle with an ex-girlfriend who moved to New York while pregnant with his child .

Internet predator: Anthony Molina-Iglesias, 30, raped his victims in the forest after posing as a photographer on the Craigslist website . A Miami man who raped and assaulted aspiring models by luring them to the forest after posing as a photographer on the classified website Craigslist, was caught this week. Anthony Molina-Iglesias, 30, who was arrested on Tuesday, took his victims to the outskirts of Miami near wooded areas under the pretense of wanting to take pictures for a modelling shoot. In the most recent incident, on June 28, two women aged 20 and 23, travelled from Orlando to Miami to meet Molina-Iglesias after he promised them free modelling photographs. According to a Miami-Dade Police report, Molina-Iglesias met the two suspects at 3pm on the day of the crime, says the Miami Herald. He got into their car and directed them to a series of empty lots with wooded areas on the outskirts of Miami, close to 129th Avenue NW and 13th Street. Molina-Iglesias first took the 23-year-old deeper into the wooded area while the 20-year-old girl remained next to her car changing her clothes for what she thought was going to be a photo shoot. When he was far enough away from the car, Molina-Iglesias choked the first woman until she fainted and fell, according to the police report. Then he tied her hands behind her back with plastic bands, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Molina-Iglesias returned to the car and guided the second victim to the wooded area where he also strangled her and tied her hands. The suspect took the aspiring models to a remote wooded area outside Miami and strangled them before sexually assaulting them . Remote: The area on the outskirts of Miami where the man took his victims . The police report does not say whether Molina-Iglesias raped the second woman. He then fled the scene in the car of the first victim, leaving both women behind, naked with their hands tied. This is the second time Molina-Iglesias has been accused of posing as a photographer to rape a woman. On February 13 a 20-year-old woman claimed he took her to the same isolated wooded area outside Miami and raped her at gunpoint. The suspect attracted some of his victims posing as a photographer on Craigslist, the web page of classified ads, police said. Anthony Molina-Iglesias, 30, was charged with two counts of sexual assault after his arrest on Tuesday . José Iglesias, Molina-Iglesias’ uncle, told CBS 4 he was shocked. ‘I know he was charged. But I don’t know whether he did it or not,’ he said regarding the case in February. ‘We are stunned by this. In case he really did it.’ Molina-Iglesias was charged with two counts of sexual assault, including one with the use of a weapon.","Anthony Molina-Iglesias, 30, lured his victims to remote parts outside the city to assault them .

Jen Arnold, star of reality show The Little Couple which follows a husband and wife who have dwarfism, has announced that she is fighting a rare form of cancer. The Houston neonatologist broke the news just as she and husband Bill Klein, who both have dwarfism caused by a genetic condition, brought their second adopted child home to Texas. The 39-year-old is currently having surgery and chemotherapy and is keeping a positive outlook. Stars: Bill Klein and Jen Arnold, who is being treated for cancer, at the Gracie Awards Gala in 2011 .

Although she said she was ready to battle through the cancer treatments, a tweet from Ms Arnold's husband suggested she was feeling frail. Mr Klein tweeted: 'My darling wife released today that she is currently battling a form of cancer. Prayers are welcome, hugs are not due to her weakened state.' The couple met through an online dating website for little people and married in 2009. Mr Klein says he first saw his wife when she was 10 and they were both having surgery at the same hospital.

'I wanted us to . be parents before we were too old to enjoy being parents,' Jen said . recently. The couple decided to adopt because Jen's bone-growth disorder meant pregnancy was not advised for the 3ft 2in doctor and surrogacy failed. Initially they hoped to have a genetic child and her eggs were harvested and a surrogate found who was happy to carry the child. After several attempts the couple was overjoyed when they found out their surrogate, who was also featured on their show, was pregnant . But the joy ended tragically when she miscarried. Jen, who works at Texas Children's Hospital, was devastated after learning the news while at work. 'I cried my eyes out,' she told People at the time. 'I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you.'

Struggles: In her efforts to start a family Jen went through multiple grueling rounds of IVF egg retrieval and tried surrogacy. The couple's surrogate miscarried and they turned to adoption . 'We always thought we wanted two kids in general. What were we going to do, say no?' she told The Wrap. 'It wasn’t that we intended to, or tried to, adopt two children at one time. It’s just how the stars aligned, really.' Millions of viewers watch the show, which has followed the couple from their wedding and early days as newlyweds, through their attempts to start a family which resulted in the overseas adoptions. The couple have been praised by fans of the show for being able to turn the focus away from what makes them stand out to what they actually have in common with everyone else.

A dazzling solar eclipse ring was seen above the Australian Outback yesterday as the moon glided between Earth and the sun, blocking everything but a dazzling ring of light. The celestial spectacle, known as a 'ring of fire' eclipse, is the second solar eclipse visible from northern Australia in six months. In November, a total solar eclipse plunged the country's northeast into darkness, delighting astronomers and tourists who flocked to the region from across the globe to witness it. Symphony of the spheres: The moon crosses in front of the sun as seen from the Sydney Observatory . This combination of six photos shows the moon crossing in front of the sun (clockwise from top left) The moon moved across the sun for just a few minutes, giveing Joseph Cali these astonishing pictures . Friday's eclipse, also called an annular solar eclipse, is not considered as scientifically important or dramatic as November's, because the moon is too far from Earth - and therefore appears too small - to completely black out the sun. Unlike a total solar eclipse, which essentially turns day into night, an annular eclipse just dims the sunlight. 'A total eclipse is overall far more spectacular, far more emotional,' said Andrew Jacob, an astronomer at Sydney Observatory. Still, he said, the eclipse 'will give you a nice ring of sunlight in the sky - it will be quite different'. Australian eclipse hunter Joseph Cali, 49, took these dazzling images near Newman in Western Australia . Fireball: The annular solar eclipse as seen through the viewfinder of a telescope .

At remote outposts across Australia, scientists and spectators gathered to watch as the eclipse began casting its approximately 120-mile-wide shadow at dawn over Western Australia, before moving east through the Northern Territory and the top of Queensland state. The shadow was drifting across Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the tiny island nation of Kiribati, and will eventually end in a largely uninhabited area of the Pacific Ocean. The eclipse lasted between three and six minutes, depending on its location, and blacked out around 95 per cent of the sun at its peak. A partial eclipse was visible to people in other parts of Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and the South Pacific.

U.S. astronomer Jay Pasachoff, who traveled to Australia to view his 57th solar eclipse, drove to a remote hill in the Outback about 30 miles north of the Northern Territory town of Tennant Creek, where he and around 100 others enjoyed one of the best and longest views of the eclipse in Australia. Amateur astronomers clicked away on cameras and local high school students measured the drop in temperature as the moon moved in front of the sun and blocked out much of the light. The moment, Pasachoff said, was magical. 'The color of the light changes in an eerie fashion, and you sense that something very strange and weird and wonderful is going on,' said Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Massachusetts.

Reunited: Angela Palmer went her whole life believing that her mother abandoned her at an orphanage when she was a child, but learned the other side of the story when her mother requested to be her friend on Facebook last month . Angela Palmer got the ultimate early Christmas gift this year when she reconnected with her mother on Facebook. The 44-year-old California woman was born in Germany where she was raised by her father, Klaus Hostnik, who told her that her mother abandoned her as a child. But Palmer learned the other side of the story when a woman named Helga Simecki from Croatia asked to be her friend on Facebook, a week before Thanksgiving. Like most people, Palmer ignored the friend request at first, but then Simecki sent her a message she couldn't ignore. 'She said she was my mother. I was shocked because my mother had abandoned me when I was a baby,' Palmer told Yahoo Shine. Palmer was suspicious at first, but was soon convinced when Simecki sent her daughter's birth certificate and pictures of her as a child, answering questions only her mother would know. That's when the two started a conversation that would lead Palmer to learn the truth about her upbringing. For years, Palmer believed the story that her father told her: That when her mother gained full custody, she dropped her off at an orphanage. 'Later my father took me in, and although he was an alcoholic and mentally and physically abusive, he was the only parent I knew,' she said. Confirmed: Simecki proved she was Palmer's mother with a birth certificate and several family photos like the one above . Simecki says she did get full custody, because Hostnik was physically abusive but that she never willingly gave up her daughter. 'One day, under the guise of taking me to a doctor appointment - because my mother couldn't afford it - he took me and never came back,' Palmer told The Stir. Simecki told her daughter that he kidnapped her because his parents refused to financially support him unless he had custody of his daughter. While Simecki tried to get her daughter back, she had a hard time tracking her ex-husband down since he moved so often. According to Palmer, she and her dad moved 12 times in 18 years. 'What he was telling us was he was a traveling salesman, so we would have to move from area to area to get new clients and so on,' Palmer told San Diego 6, 'when in all actuality he was wanted by the German government.' First time: San Diego's News 6 set up a Skype meeting between mother and daughter, marking the first time they've seen each other face to face . Seeing her daughter: Simecki, calling from Croatia, was clearly choked up in the call. Palmer is currently fundraising to buy a ticket for her mom to visit the U.S. While living with her father in Europe, Palmer had contact with her mother just once - on her sixteenth birthday. 'A family member said my aunt was on the phone so I picked up and it was my mom,' she rememebrs. 'She started to explain but I hung up on her, angry that she had abandoned me.' Palmer soon left her father to go to attend school in North Carolina at age 18 and never went back. The last she heard, he died a few years ago. Now knowing the true reason behind her mother's separation, Palmer is working on organizing a face to face meeting. She has set up a fundraising campaign on Fundly, hoping to get 4,000 dollars to bring her mother to the U.S. for a visit. As of Saturday evening, the campaign had raised 3,310 of the goal. 'There's so much catching up to do and so much that needs to be filled in. Until last Friday [Nov. 15], I had no family. Now I have a mother… a big extended family. I don't know how to explain it. It just makes for a nice holiday,' Palmer said.","Anegla Palmer, 44, got a friend request from her mother in Croatia last month .

Reports suggest Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, had been made made to 'disappear' from a repeat of a documentary featuring Kim which has been shown at least nine times on state television. Marked man: People watch a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, and Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. But the Jang has disappeared from more recent showings .

According to viewers inside North Korea a recent showing had Jang was either edited out of scenes entirely or manipulated so that his face was out of focus. The vanishing of Jang from the documentary is seen by North Korean watchers as proof that he has fallen out of favour with his 32-year-old nephew. It had already been suggested Jang was removed from his number two position in the secretive country after one of his aides defected to South Korea, to the fury of the young leader. Jang's removal has also been seen as an . indication that Kim is ready to change the aging cabal who stood close . to his father and replacing them with younger faces. The pair are rumoured to have fallen out after one of Jang's closest aides defected to South Korea . Jang, who is married to Kim's aunt - the daughter of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il-Sung - is believed to have helped Kim establish his grip on power in the past two years since he took over from his late father Kim Jong-Il. His apparent fall from grace could mean he has lost his high-level titles, including that of vice chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission and membership of the ruling Workers' Party politiburo. While he has apparently been made to 'disappear', analysts in the South Korean capital, Seoul, believe he has not met the same fate as a number of other aides, including two of his own - execution by firing squad.

Christine Keith, 37, lost her life along with her teenage son Isaac Miller,14, after Randy Keith, 53, blasted them with one of his hunting rifles. After committing the murders, Keith then turned the gun on himself. The three were found dead at their home in Lansing, Michigan, on Thursday night and police confirmed Keith as the shooter. Scroll down for video... Murdered: Christine Keith, 37, was shot dead by her ex-husband Randy. After being shot her husband shot her 14-year-old son before taking his own life . Suspect: Randy Keith, 53, pictured here with one of his young children who is now an orphan . Caring: Christine was a mother of four who was heavily involved in her community . 'It seems surreal, you just don't think this is going to happen to someone that you know who is a wonderful human being and contributes so much to the world,' said Melissa Quon Huber, a family friend of Christine told WILX. A well as bringing up four children, Christine was heavily involved in her community teaching Zumba classes across the city. She was also an avid writer and kept a popular blog: 'Adventures of a Thrifty Mama...' which discussed how she was working to feed her family on a tight budget using only fresh, homemade ingredients. Family and friends who knew Christine and her family say they knew she had dealt with domestic abuse in the past and dreaded something like this would ultimately happen. Active: Christine taught Zumba classes across the city in East Lansing . Scene of the crime: The double murder-suicide happened Thursday night in the 700 block of Saginaw Highway in Lansing, Michigan . Cheryl Overly: 'Shocked But Not Surprised' by Murder Suicide . Family friend: 'It seems surreal, you just don't think this is going to happen to someone that you know who is a wonderful human being and contributes so much to the world,' said Melissa Quon Huber . My understanding is that she was very firm, and had basically told him they were done,' said attorney Steve Cornish, who represented Christine, told the Times Herald. 'I had very grave concerns for her safety, but I don’t think I expected something this extreme,” 'I was shocked but not surprised,' said friend Cheryl Overley. 'It's part of the cycle of violence. For people who see this and are moved by the story of people who died before their time... I hope they learn about (domestic violence) and start discussions.' Numerous times in recent years, Randy Keith reportedly threatened to kill his wife if she ever left him, court documents say. 'Threats of shooting me to death with one of his hunting rifles were par for the course,' Christine Keith wrote in a petition for a personal protection order filed in April in Ingham County Circuit Court. Sadly she later withdrew that order. Violent past: Christine Keith wrote had filed a petition for a personal protection order against her estranged husband Randy Keith . In her first divorce filing, as well as . in the personal protection order, Christine Keith outlined what she said . was her husband’s controlling, erratic and sometimes violent . behavior. The couple were married in 2003 but just five years later they . were filing for divorce. Police were called to their Jackson-area home after Randy pushed Christine to the floor, knocking her unconscious briefly. Christine said they had fought over his refusal to watch the children. In her petition for the personal protection order, Christine said that . in 2011, they were living in a trailer in Webberville, and Randy was . fired from his job and didn’t work for a year. 'I had to walk on eggshells not to trigger his abuse,' she wrote, noting that she had been diagnosed with depression and believed Randy also was depressed. '(He) stayed in bed for nearly the entire year, only rarely getting up other than to use the bathroom... At least once a week, he told me if I ever left him he would kill me.' Christine said she kept an old cell phone in the house, and told their children they could use it to call 911. She also said Randy was suicidal. In 2012, she said she was concerned he would hunt for his limit of deer and then kill himself. 'I need to be safe from Randy,' she wrote in the petition filed April 8. 'Based on Randy’s consistent pattern of action, once he’s released…I will not be safe.' Anger problems: Randy Keith was insecure and possessive over his wife. When she wanted a divorce, he wouldn't allow it. When it finally went through the courts he blasted her and he son with one of his hunting rifles . In October — for the second time this year — the 37-year-old Lansing woman filed for divorce. The new divorce case was proceeding toward becoming final, her attorney said. She dropped the initial divorce case in May. The Keiths had three other children 8, 6 and 4-years-old who were not home at the time of the shooting. The local church is to start a fund to help Christine's three surviving children as their entire community tries to move forward and cope. Happier times: The couple were married in 2003. They had three children together, ages 8, 6 and 4, who are now orphaned . Callous: Randy Keith shot both victims before taking his own life a short time later, according to police . 'There was always that possibility when you have someone in your past who has a tendency to be jealous or vindictive,' Huber said. 'It can happen to smart women, rich women, poor women, it doesn't take anything to be a victim of domestic violence.' Christine's three remaining children are staying with their grandparents.

Happier: Cile Precetaj, pictured, learned late Tuesday that her case is being reviewed and she can remain in her Detroit home pending the outcome . An illegal immigrant from Albania with three American-born children who was to be deported Tuesday has been granted a reprieve, gaining at least one more year in America.Cile Precetaj, 41, has also had her ankle tether removed, much to her relief and that of her children, who were bothered by the government ordered device. Precetaj received a call from authorities Friday afternoon telling her to report to the immigration office in Detroit for the removal of her tether. While there, she was given a letter which informed her that her stay of removal request had been granted for one year. 'Now I can [chaperone] my son’s field trip to Ohio,' Precetaj told the Detroit Free Press.The Free Press notes that when Precetaj's one year is up, her lawyer will file another stay of removal request, which likely be granted as long as she complies with the law.'I am very happy. This is good news. All I want is to stay here and raise my kids and have a normal life,' she said. Precetaj was told to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday but defied the order, choosing instead to stay home and wait for U.S. Immigrations Customs and Enforcement agents to come to her. But they never did, as late on Tuesday she learned her case was being reviewed. 'I was just hugging my kids, saying ""thank you, thank you, thank you."" I don't have to be scared,' Precetaj told the Detroit Free Press after hearing the news. Relief: Albanian immigrant Cile Precetaj and her family are celebrating her stay of removal order that came through yesterday . She said she was hopeful the authorities will allow her to stay in the U.S. permanently and 'raise my kids in this beautiful country.' 'I feel so glad, and I appreciate what they do for me right now,' she told FREEP. 'Hopefully, it's going to work for me and they're going to keep me here.' Precetaj came to the U.S. illegally through Canada 13 years ago fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She also had an abusive fiance. She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum. While in the U.S. illegally, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved to the U.S. 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, Mikey, 11, Migena, six and Martina, four, all U.S. citizens. In a statement late Tuesday, ICE confirmed the hard-working mother, who has no criminal convictions, would have her case reviewed. 'ICE is presently conducting a review of Ms Precetaj's case, therefore her removal is not imminent at this time,' agency spokesman Khaalid Walls told FREEP. Tears: Precetaj, pictured with her three U.S.-born children Mikey, 11, right, Migena, 6, center, and Martina, 4, left, was told Monday that she had to leave . Gojcevic said he hoped the government gives his wife another chance. 'Hopefully, they'll have a change of heart,' Gojcevic told FREEP. 'I hope they find it in their hearts not to split up a family.' The review comes after Precetaj's heartbreaking case made national headlines Tuesday and prompted an outpouring of support. Gojcevic said the whole ordeal has had a devastating impact on the couple's three children. 'The girls want to know why they're not going to school. They're on pins and needles,' Gojcevic said. Devastating: Cile Precetaj, pictured right, who came to the States seeking asylum 13 years ago, was ordered to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday for a flight back to her native Albania . 'There is a level of insanity in this . case,' Precetaj's attorney Andrew Johnson told . MailOnline earlier on Tuesday as he fought to keep Precetaj with her . husband and children. 'Someone is not doing what is ordinarily done. There is an abuse of power.' Precetaj . is the sole carer of her elderly mother-in-law, another U.S. citizen, . whose toes were amputated and needs help eating, walking and washing. But . her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her . testimony about fearing the prostitution trade and criminal activity in Albania lacked credibility. He . said even if her concerns were warranted 'young, attractive women are . not a social group for asylum.' Packing up: Precetaj, pictured center with her kids, chose not to go to the airport and remained at home with her packed bags, waiting for authorities but they didn't come . Seeking asylum: Precetaj came to the U.S. through Canada in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum . After losing her appeal in 2008, she was given a deportation order. An estimated 500,000 people are . living in the U.S. with a deportation order, however, U.S. Immigrations . Customs and Enforcement only acts on a portion of cases and the Obama . Administration specifically said targeting people with criminal . convictions was the priority. Precetaj . has none. In fact, she's a glowing member of her community, described . by friends and her children's teachers as a hard-working mother who pays . her taxes and helps her kids with schoolwork, not to mention keeping . her elderly mother-in-law out of a government-funded home. 'Detroit . has gone off the map here,' Johnson said before the case review was announced. 'They are doing something . that has not been done around the country. This person probably has as . many positive evaluations as you can, she has three children who are . U.S. citizens and has been here for a long time. I'm just baffled.' Settled in: While here, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, including Martina, 4, pictured . Precetaj . became concerned about two weeks ago, when at her regular six-month . check in with the deportation department she was fitted with a GPS ankle . bracelet. But the mother-of-three was convinced ICE wouldn't deport a . woman whose three kids are American-born. 'That is strange they put an ankle . bracelet on a mom with three kids,' Johnson said, referring to the low . risk of her fleeing. 'Then the day before her scheduled flight they said . ""You're flying out tomorrow, here's your information."" They didn't want . the bad press. 'I . think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they . understood how egregious this case is. It just doesn't make sense.' If officials did not decide to review her case, the authorities would have been forced to collect Precetaj from her home yesterday and take her into custody. At midday Tuesday, she was pictured in her living room, with her family surrounding her awaiting ICE officers. Precetaj . and her children were crying as they hugged by the Christmas tree, and . the woman's mother-in-law was asking what would become of her if her . daughter was sent home. Other relatives, including a cousin, were . visibly upset at the heartbreaking situation the family has been thrown . into. Hugs: Precetaj has not decided, if she is in fact deported, whether to take the kids, who have never been to Albania, with her . Review: The mother's case will be reviewed . 'They will jail . her for one to three weeks, however long it takes to organize another . flight,' Johnson told MailOnline of the process. 'Then border guards will drive her to . the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she's a mass murderer . or a terrorist going to Guantanamo.' Johnson and the family were working desperately for someone in Washington D.C. to interject. 'We need somebody in the White House, connected to ICE, to say ""stop this immediately. This is wrong."" If someone in DC hears about this, that is our best chance. Her story just hasn't been heard.' Understandably, Precetaj was beside herself, and was still trying to work out if she would take her children, who are enrolled in school and have never been to Albania, with her. Her husband works as a cook at restaurant in Detroit and said he can't afford to raise the children on his own. 'She is an emotional mess,' Johnson explained. Deportation: Precetaj was informed Monday that she had to report at Deport's McNamara terminal at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday as per the above order . Empty: But the terminal, pictured, was empty at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, as the mother-of-three defied the order by staying home . 'What she has been told by numerous people was that they don't deport women with three US citizen children and that is exactly what they're doing. 'She is crying all the time, trying to work out who she can take and who she can't. She's going back to Albania and that is not a good place to bring a 6-year-old girl, particularly.' He added: 'It happened in one day, she has no idea what to do.' Gojcevic told the Detroit Free Press Monday night the family was 'hoping for a miracle.' 'The basis of this request is that Ms. Precetaj would like to remain in the United States to care for her three children. After weighing the factors as related to Prosecutorial Discretion, I have determined that the stay of removal will be granted for a period of one year,' read the letter Precetaj received yesterday from the U.S. Immigration and Customs office.","Cile Precetaj, 41, of Detroit, Michigan, was told yesterday she has been granted a stay of removal for another year .

The New Mexico State Police officer who fired shots at a minivan full of children during a chaotic October traffic stop has been fired as its revealed that he was a mentor in a nonviolence program. New Mexico State Police spokesman Lt Emmanuel Gutierrez says he confirmed with State Police Chief Pete Kassetas that Officer Elias Montoya is no longer employed by the department. His termination was effective at 5pm Friday. Montoya has 30 days to appeal his firing to a public safety advisory council. Scroll down for video . Sacked: Elias Montoya, the officer that shot at a minivan full of children, was fired Friday from the New Mexico State Police . The officer was placed on administrative leave earlier this week following an investigation into the shooting outside the northern New Mexico tourist town of Taos. Video from a police cruiser's dashboard camera taken October 28 showed Montoya shooting at the minivan as a Memphis, Tennessee, woman drove away. The motorist, 39-year-old Oriana Farrell, had been stopped for speeding and fled twice after arguing with an officer. Montoya's dangerous reaction to Farrell's flight is strange considering he is a father himself, and had been a mentor to young men in a local nonviolence program. Appeal: Montoya has 30 days to appeal his firing with the public safety advisory council . A 2010 Taos News article called Montoya a 'devoted father' in an article about the local Men Engaged in Nonviolence Program. At the time, Montoya was a 'model mentor' to a 10-year-old boy in the program. 'My dad was a minister and things were expected of you. he taught me how to be responsible,' Montoya told the paper of his late father. 'If he can't get something from his dad, I want to be the person he can have confidence in. According to the article, Montoya taught his mentee how to play pool and took him to football games. 'They matched him with me because he wants to be a cop. I hope I can help him reach his goals,' Montoya said. Last month, Ms Farrell had her own account in the Taos News, giving an account of the dramatic traffic stop in October in which she claimed that she was only trying to protect her children from Montoya. Mother's instinct: Oriana Farrell, the woman who was driving the minivan, told the Taos News that she was just trying to protect her children . 'A uniformed officer can shoot three bullets at my van and be considered to be “doing his job”, but my doing what I can to get my own children away from such a terrifying individual has been termed “child abuse” and “endangerment,” according to New Mexico law,' she wrote. Calling herself a 'peace officer,' Farrell writes: 'As a single, African-American mother of five in this country, things are tough enough I should not have to endure harassment at the hands of someone who has been hired to protect the citizens of this land over an alleged “speeding offense.” No one should.' The . traffic stop took place south of Taos, New Mexico, on October 28 - but . it sparked local outrage after the video from a state police dashboard camera . went public. Footage shows the officer casually walk up to the vehicle and begin speaking with the driver. When the officer walks away, presumably to run the license and registration and decide whether to write a ticket, the van takes off. Coming to mom's rescue: At one point in the video, Ms Farrell's 14-year-old son is seen getting out of the vehicle to defend her . A short chase ensues before the driver again relents and the van makes its way to the side of the road. The . officer at this point has had enough. He storms up to and opens the . driver’s side door while ordering the driver out of the vehicle. She refuses and a struggle ensues as children inside the Ford can be heard screaming. The driver’s son, 14, according to ABC News, gets out of the van but thinks better of the idea as the cop pulls a Taser on him. Ms Farrell does eventually exit the vehicle and gets into a physical confrontation with the officer while he tries to arrest her. Cuffed: The officer moves to arrest Ms Farrell in front of her children . That's it: Having seen enough, the teen jumps out of the car to confront the officer . At this point, the teen appears to . attack the cop as Ms Farrell is at once being pulled back into the van . by a screaming younger girl and being pulled into the middle of the road . by the cop. The teen and the officer tussle before he runs back into the van as more police arrives to assist the over-matched officer. The primary officer is then shown . smashing the right rear passenger window with his baton as petrified . children trapped inside the van scream for help. Ms Farrell has had enough, she slams on the gas and drives away as a second officer opens fire on the back of her van – emptying multiple rounds in the direction of young children. A frantic chase through wrong-way traffic and a small town ensues before Ms Farrell finally gives herself up in front of a hotel. Multiple arrests: The teen can be seen led away in handcuffs in the foreground as his mother lie arrested on the sidewalk behind him . Both she and her son are seen being led away in handcuffs. The Taos News' editor said the paper does not usually publish op-ed pieces pertaining to ongoing legal cases, but made an exception in this case because of the huge public interest in the case. According to ABC News, she was charged with five counts of abuse of a child, aggravated fleeing an officer, resisting an officer, reckless driving and possession of drug paraphernalia. Her 14-year-old son was charged with battery of an officer. No word yet on whether the charges against Ms Farrell and her son will be dropped following the officer's dismissal. Ms Farrell, who refers to herself as a 'model parent,' was due to appear in court in April.","New Mexico State Police Officer Elias Montoya was fired Friday following an internal investigation into his actions on October 28 .

They were gathered nine days after the 'unsinkable' liner had gone down in the Atlantic Ocean with the loss of 1,512 lives. And this haunting black and white photograph taken on board one of the body recovery ships following the Titanic disaster shows a mass funeral for dozens of the dead being buried at sea. The image - which has been discovered a century on from the disaster in 1912 - shows body bags stacked on the windswept deck while two crewman tip up a stretcher to drop a victim over the side. First picture: Records show that 166 out of 306 bodies from the Titanic retrieved by the Mackay Bennett were buried at sea. The ship's priest, the Reverend Hind, is seen conducting the service in front of the crew . The ship's priest, the Reverend Hind, is seen conducting the service in front of the solemn crew, who were gathered days after the Titanic had sunk on its journey from Southampton to New York City. Although the records show that 166 out of 306 bodies retrieved by the Mackay Bennett ship were buried at sea, no images of the macabre event have been seen by the general public until now. Most of the victims dropped into the Atlantic were believed to have been chosen because they had no means of identification or were third-class passengers and therefore could not afford a funeral. In the photo - which has a pre-sale estimate of £5,000 - one of the bodies is clearly labelled number 177, which was William Mayo, a 28-year-old London man who was a leading fireman on the ship. The image has been owned by the family of one of the crew of the Mackay Bennett until now - as they have made it available for auction at Henry Aldridge and Sons Auctioneers in Devizes, Wiltshire. Picture: The photo was kept by Westy Legate (pictured left, with an unidentified woman), the fourth officer on the Mackay Bennett, whose family have owned it ever since. It is now going under the hammer . Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: ‘Despite the number of bodies buried at sea, visual records of the occasion, such as this photograph, are almost non-existent, even in period publications. 'This picture blows away the myth that the burials were an orderly and dignified process' Andrew Aldridge, auctioneer . ‘This picture blows away the myth that the burials were an orderly and dignified process. You can clearly see the bodies in brown sacks piled up on the deck, with some piled two or three high. ‘The Reverend Hind is seen holding a prayer book looking at two crewman who appear to be tipping up some kind of platform, presumably committing a body into the sea. ‘The Mackay Bennett spent five days retrieving bodies from the wreck site and had to request for a second vessel to join it because there were so many. This photo shows that the deck was pretty much full up with the victims.’ A century ago: The Titanic leaves from Southampton, on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. During the voyage, she hit an iceberg and sank off Newfoundland, resulting in the loss of 1,512 lives . In the aftermath of the Titanic disaster on April 15, 1912, the ship Carpathia picked up more than 700 survivors from lifeboats. 'The wild Atlantic may rage and toss but far below in the calm untroubled depth they rest in peace' Reverend Hind, Mackay Bennett's priest . The Mackay Bennet was a Canadian cable laying ship and the owners of the Titanic, White Star Line, contracted it at a rate of £300 a day to recover the bodies. It left Halifax, Nova Scotia, on April 17 and arrived at the wreck site on April 21. The crew conducted burials at sea on the evenings of April 21, 22 and 23 and then of the afternoon of April 24, when it is thought the picture was taken. In an account of the burials, Reverend Hind later wrote: ‘Anyone attending a burial at sea will most surely lose the common impression of the awfulness of a grave in the mighty deep.

Along with the picture is a telegram sent by a Canadian train company in the mistaken belief the Titanic was still afloat and limping to Halifax. It states that were sending extra trains and carriages from Montreal to Nova Scotia to collect the passengers and crew, who should have been arriving in New York. The telegram is also expected to sell for £5,000. The auction takes place on October 19.","Photo taken on board Mackay Bennett in 1912 going under the hammer .

Two Boston men previously believed to have been ‘cured’ of HIV are showing traces of the virus in their blood. Researchers said the fact that the two men were showing signs of the virus means that it can lurk in places in the body where it is hard to find. Dr. Timothy Henrich, associate professor of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, announced the resurgence of the virus at an international conference on AIDS research in Florida on Thursday, according to the Boston Globe. Not cured: Researcher Timothy Henrich, who said in July that the men were cured of HIV, said on Thursday that traces of the virus had been found again . He said the findings suggest that they need to look for the virus in other tissues, such as the liver, gut and brain. ‘These are all potential sources, but it’s very difficult to obtain tissue from these places so we don’t do that routinely.’ The two, unnamed, HIV-positive men made . headlines in July, when Henrich announced that they were no longer . showing any detectable traces of HIV in their body. The patients had received stem cell transplants after they had been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and doctors believed this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus. They had stopped taking antiretroviral medications for 15 weeks and seven weeks respectively at the time of the announcement. The . second patient decided to stay off the medication, but eight months . after he had been ‘cured’ the doctors found traces of HIV. He was placed . on antiretrovirals again. Hiding: This is an electron microscope image of an HIV-infected cell. Researchers say the new findings could mean the virus hides in harder-to-reach areas of the body, such as gut, liver or brain tissue . Stem cells: The men had received stem cell transplants for Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and doctors believed at the time this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus . According to government estimates, about 1,148,200 persons 13 and older were infected with HIV in the U.S. in 2009. Around 18.1 per cent of those people had not been diagnosed yet. Another man, Timothy Ray Brown, known as the 'Berlin patient', similarly announced that he had been cured of HIV when he received a stem cell transplant. Brown, who had leukemia, received a donation from a person with a genetic mutation called CCR5-delta32, which makes people HIV-resistant. Researchers said in July 2012 that they . found traces of HIV in Brown’s blood, but he claimed those viruses are . dead and cannot replicate, according to CBS News. 'Cured': Timothy Ray Brown, who had leukemia, claims he was cured after he got a stem cell transplant . Resistant DNA: Brown received a donation from a person with a genetic mutation called CCR5-delta32, which makes people HIV-resistant . The Boston men's stem cell donors did not have the CCR5-delta32mutation. A Mississippi baby born HIV-positive was also determined to be cured of the virus after she was given powerful three-drug infusion within 30 hours after birth. The mother had not been diagnosed with HIV until she was in labor, and did not receive any prenatal treatments to prevent the spread of the virus to her baby. Researchers said in October the baby still appears to be HIV-free. Henrich said that despite the failure to eradicate HIV from the two men, researchers learned a lot that would allow them to make improvements for future treatments. ‘We go back to the drawing board,’ Henrich said. ‘It’s exciting science, even if it’s not the outcome we would have liked.’","Researchers said the discovery means the virus can lurk in other, 'difficult to obtain', tissues, such as the liver, gut and brain .

A former Goldman Sachs trader was sentenced on Friday to nine months in prison for wire fraud by a judge who took sharp aim at both Goldman and the government, questioning why it took them so long to bring the misconduct to light. Matthew Taylor, 35, had admitted in a guilty plea this year that he concealed an unauthorized $8.3 billion trading position in 2007. He told Goldman within 36 hours but escaped criminal charges until this year. ‘Goldman was silent about Taylor's lies,’ U.S. District Judge William Pauley said in federal court in Manhattan. Rogue trader: Former Goldman Sachs trader Matthew Taylor was sentenced to nine months in prison for wire fraud on Friday . 'Guilty': Taylor pleaded guilty to defrauding the Wall Street bank with an unauthorized $8.3 billion futures trade in 2007 . The investment banking firm fired Taylor but didn't disclose the full extent of his misconduct, clearing the way for him to continue as a trader for Morgan Stanley for another four years, the judge said. ‘So much for Goldman's concerns about the credibility of the financial markets,’ he said. The judge also suggested the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and federal regulators went after the rogue trader years after his offense largely for publicity. He accused prosecutors of crafting an artificially low sentencing recommendation to secure a quick plea deal. ‘Everything about this case is sad,’ the judge said. ‘Your employer's response was sad. Your conduct was sad. The government's conduct - it's sad.’ 'Goldman was silent': Taylor had told Goldman within 36 hours of committing the crime, but escaped criminal charges until this year. The judge said the investment banking company had tried to cover it up . The judge said that by his own calculations of sentencing guidelines, Taylor could have received several years behind bars for making Goldman Sachs suffer a $118 million loss. But too much time had passed for that to make sense, he added. ‘Justice has to be swift to mean anything,’ he said. Along with the nine-month prison term, the judge ordered the MIT graduate to complete 400 hours of community service by tutoring children from low-income families in math. A Goldman spokesman responded Friday by insisting that it had filed timely paperwork reporting that Taylor was fired for ‘inappropriately large proprietary futures positions in a firm trading account’. 'No credibility': Goldman Sachs fired Taylor but didn't disclose the full extent of his misconduct, clearing the way for him to continue as a trader for Morgan Stanley for another four years, the judge said . The U.S. attorney's office said in a statement it learned of Taylor's fraud in November 2012 and charged him less than five months later, in April 2013. Taylor, 35, of West Palm Beach, Fla., has said he accumulated and concealed the massive trading position to enhance his reputation within Goldman and secure a bigger bonus. On Friday, he told the judge he was trying to set his life straight by starting a small pool-cleaning company to support his wife and two young children. ‘I can't undo what happened,’ he said, ‘... but I do offer a very sincere apology.’ Taylor will remain out on bail until early February, when he was ordered to begin his sentence.","Matthew Taylor, 35, was sentenced Friday to nine months for wire fraud in 2007 .

People who turn red-faced when they drink are less able to tolerate alcohol and need to watch their blood pressure, new research has shown. A study found the risk of alcohol-related hypertension, or high blood pressure, was greater in people who develop a warm glow after drinking. The risk was significantly increased when ‘flushers’ consumed more than four drinks per week. People who turn red-faced when they drink (right) are less able to tolerate alcohol and need to watch their blood pressure, new research has shown. If they drink more than four alcoholic drinks a week they are at increased risk of high blood pressure . The rosy-cheeked, often portly, drinker has long been a figure of fun and one of the cartoonist's favourite characters. But the new research from Korea suggests that flushing red after a drink is no joke. High blood pressure, including alcohol-related high blood pressure, is a major cause of heart attacks and strokes because it puts strain on the blood vessels. ‘Facial flushing after drinking is always considered as a symptom of high alcohol sensitivity or even intolerance to alcohol, unless a patient is taking special medicine,’ said lead researcher Dr Jong Sung Kim, from Chungnam National University School of Medicine. ‘The facial flushing response to drinking usually occurs in a person who cannot genetically break down acetaldehyde, [a toxic product of alcohol produced when alcohol is broken down in the liver]. ‘To my knowledge, there has been no detailed research that has analysed the relationship between drinking and hypertension while considering individual responses to alcohol. ‘Our results indicate that hypertension associated with drinking has a lower threshold value and higher risk in flushers than in non-flushers. Women and East Asians are most likely to turn red faced after drinking but the problem can also affect Westerners and men, such as Jeremy Clarkson (pictured) ‘After adjusting for age, body mass index, exercise status, and smoking status, the risk of hypertension was significantly increased when flushers consumed more than four drinks per week. ‘In contrast, in non-flushers, the risk increased with consuming more than eight drinks per week.’ ‘Facial flushing after alcohol drinking differs across gender, age, and ethnic groups,’ added Kyung Hwan Cho, president of the Korean Academy of Family Medicine. ‘In general, it is more common in women, the elderly, and East Asians versus Westerners.’ The team, whose findings appear online in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, examined the medical records of 1,763 Korean men, including 288 non-drinkers, 527 flushing drinkers, and 948 non-flushing drinkers. The risk of high blood pressure related to alcohol consumption was compared in flushers and non-flushers. Facial flushing after drinking may potentially serve as a marker of hypertension risk associated with alcohol, said Dr Kim. ‘Our research findings suggest that clinicians and researchers should, respectively, consider evaluating their patients' flushing response to alcohol as well as drinking amount in a daily routine care, and researching hazard by drinking,’ he added. The researchers admit it is not clear why people who turn red when they drink alcohol are at greater risk of high blood pressure.","People who turn red when they drink alcohol are less able to break down acetaldehyde - a toxic substance produced when alcohol is metabolised .

Family man: Pedro Maldonado, 53, shot dead his wife and 17-year-old son with a crossbow, attempted to kill his 21-year-old son and then took his own life . A South Florida man has used a crossbow to kill his wife and teenage son in their townhouse, drove across the state to try and murder his other son, and eventually committed suicide by slitting his own throat. Broward Sheriff's Office deputies said the body of Pedro Jose Maldonado Sr., 53, of Weston was found inside the bathroom of a motel room near Lake City. Before that, deputies said Maldonado called a friend to say he had killed his wife, 47-year-old Monica Narvaez-Maldonado, and son Pedro Jose Maldonado Jr., 17. Both victims had been shot inside the family’s Vineyard Circle home with what deputies described as a handheld crossbow that fires small darts. Deputies said Narvaez-Maldonado and her son were struck once in the head. Detective John Curcio said it does not appear that either victim put up a fight, Orlando Sun-Sentinel reported. Toxicology tests will be performed to see if the mother and son had been drugged before the deadly attack. Authorities believe they were killed sometime Monday. After that, they said, Maldonado got into his 2013 black Volvo SUV and drove some 460 miles to Tallahassee, where he rented a motel room. Scroll down for video . Brothers: Pedro Maldonado Jr, 17 (left) was found dead alongside his mother; his 21-year-old brother Jose (right), a student at Florida State University, suffered a wound to the ear when his father tried to shoot him with a crossbow . Massacre: The bloody rampage began at the Maldonados' Weston townhouse on Vineyard Circle, where Pedro Jr and his mother were shot dead Monday . Cruel end: Deputies said the victims were shot once in the head with short arrows . Just after 7am Tuesday, he apparently attacked his older son, 21-year-old Florida State University student Jose Maldonado, with the crossbow but the dart just grazed the son's ear. Deputies say the father tried to choke the son, but the younger Maldonado managed to escape. He did not report the attack. Authorities had responded to the Maldonado home Tuesday with a SWAT team after the man's long-time friend called 911 and said that Pedro Maldonado had confessed to him about the killings. Gifted musician: Friends of 17-year-old Pedro Maldonado said he was passionate about music and excelled as a drummer . After finding the bodies of the mother and son, they learned through unspecified means that Maldonado was staying at a Cabot Lodge Motel near Lake City, east of Tallahassee and hundreds of miles north of the original crime scene. Columbia County Sheriff's Office deputies found Maldonado dead about 2am. Wednesday. According to investigators, the man ended his life by slitting his throat and wrists with a knife. Investigators had offered no information about a possible motive for the rampage, but the Sun-Sentinel reported that Maldonado was in debt and feared that he and his family might be deported back to their native Ecuador after their visas had expired. The father had several business ventures involving import and export and oil trading with South America, while his wife worked as an oil industry consultant in Miami. Neighbors said the Maldonado family moved to Weston and settled in a $1,900-a-month, three-bedroom townhouse in the 4200 block of Vineyard Circle only a few months earlier and largely kept to themselves. However, Marie Saboutin, who lives in the area, told Miami Herald Mr Maldonado appeared aloof and would avoid eye contact. Another resident described the father of two sitting in his garage with the door open and watching children at play. On Wednesday, Pedro Maldonado Jr's shocked classmates at Cypress Bay High School described the teen as bright and kind. Memorial: Some 200 people gathered for an emotional candlelight vigil to celebrate the lives of Pedro Jr and his slain mother . According to his friends, the 17-year-old played drums in the school band and was taking advanced college-level courses, the station WSVN reported. Some 200 members of the community came together for a candlelight vigil Wednesday night to remember the victims, NBC Miami reported. The memorial concluded with the release of two white balloons bearing the names of Pedro Jr and his mother. Friend Santiago Estrada said Pedro, or Peter, as he was known in school, was passionate about his music and excelled at percussion.
