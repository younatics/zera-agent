"Staring confidently into the camera, these are the men who have made millions putting ‘profits before welfare’ with their infamous Ask.fm website. Yesterday, brothers Mark and Ilja Terebin, who are pictured with one of their tech-savvy partners, were in hiding, each refusing to discuss their website’s role in Hannah Smith’s suicide on Friday. But a whistleblower who worked at the site’s headquarters in Riga, Latvia’s capital, claims his former bosses are aware of the harm caused by Ask.fm but are more interested in the £5million a year they are making in advertising revenue. Pressure: Partners, from left, Marks Terebins, Oskars Liepiøö, Ilja Terebins of the Ask.fm website, but despite an open letter released today they haven't agreed to be interviewed . He told the Daily Mail: ‘They don’t care what happens to the children. No one in this project cares. ‘They have more than enough resources to moderate the site and get rid of the vile things that are written. ‘They believe the site’s popularity is down to the fact some young people want to write anonymously about others. ‘And they believe if they closed down that facility then they would lose customers and therefore money.’ The site provides the perfect opportunity for ‘trolling’ because contact with users can be made anonymously. The website claims to have ‘50 moderators monitoring 30 million questions and answers a day’ but the whistleblower, who does not wish to be named, said he ‘never saw any moderation’. Misery: The controversial Ask.fm website which has been blamed for the deaths of four UK children . ‘Most of the users are teenagers,’ he said. ‘It is believed that teenagers find it easier to ask questions if they are able to do so anonymously. ‘But this anonymity has created a place where anyone can write nasty and dirty things about children. ‘That really bothered me and that is why I left the company. ‘There is a philosophy that the internet should be completely free from regulation but it has gone too far at Ask.fm. ‘While I worked there we became aware that some teenagers had committed suicide because of things that were said on the site, but still the bosses refused to do anything. ‘They have put profits before welfare.’ Victim: Hannah Smith, 14, has killed herself after being bullied by anonymous trolls online. Ask.fm bosses have refused to discuss their website's part in her death . Party-loving founders Mark and Ilja Terebin are the sons of a wealthy former Soviet Red Army officer and they used family money to bankroll the online enterprise in 2010 before being joined by three partners with technical knowledge – Oskars Liepins, Valerijs Vesnakovs and Klavs Sinka. They copied the format of a successful American question and answer network to create Ask.fm. Initially it limped along employing a handful of technical staff until 2011, when the site took off almost overnight. In less than two years it has become a global social networking sensation and now has over 60 million registered users worldwide and is raking in at least £16,000 a day in advertising revenue. They moved into state-of-the-art offices in the heart of Latvia’s capital and employed teams of highly-trained computer technicians. Charming and good-looking, the brothers are described as ‘inseparable’. A friend said: ‘Mark and Ilja are always together and share a love of the good life.’ The older of the brothers Ilja, 35, is CEO and lives in an opulent home in the trendy coastal resort of Jarmala, some 20 miles from the capital. Mark, 29, lives in an upmarket apartment in the centre of Riga and has only recently settled down after years of ‘serious partying’. He has recently become engaged to a glamorous Russian, Natasha Dovgjalo, who is from Moscow. Last year Mark attracted huge criticism for comments he made following the death of two Irish teenagers, Ciara Pugsley, 15, and Erin Gallagher, 13, who both committed suicide after suffering abuse on the Ask.fm site. He claimed: ‘Of course there is a problem with cyber-bullying in social media. Under fire: Mark Terebin faced criticism over comments he made last year regarding the deaths of Erin Gallagher, left, and Ciara Pugsley, right . ‘But as far as we can see we only have this problem in Ireland and in the United Kingdom most of all, trust me. ‘There are no complaints regarding cyber-bullying from parents, children or other sources in other countries. ‘It seems that children are crueller in these countries (Ireland and the United Kingdom).’ He later said: ‘It’s not about the site, the problem is about education, about moral values that were devaluated lately. ‘Ask.fm is just a tool which helps people to communicate with each other, same as any other social network, same as phone, same as piece of paper and pen,’ he wrote. Terebin also told a Finnish journalist: ‘Kids lack attention, mainly because parents are doing other things such as watching TV, drinking beer and reading the tabloids. ‘When they come to sites like these, they start trolling themselves so that their peers start protecting them. In this absurd way, they get the attention.’","Mark and Ilja Terebin are refusing to discuss Ask.fm's role in Hannah Smith's suicide .

"Classical music: Fast-food chain McDonald's hopes its response will help pacify customers . Fast-food chain McDonald's has started playing classical music in an attempt to pacify late night customers and stop drunken fights breaking out on its premises. Yobbish behaviour has soared in Stockport town centre including in the area around McDonald's Grand Central restaurant. To help tackle the escalating problem, the outlet hopes playing classical music from Brahms to Beethoven will have a soothing effect on revellers, who have spilled out of the nearby clubs and pubs and are looking for something to help soak up the alcohol. Stockport council has used the tactic before. Two years ago classical music was piped into an alleyway near Councillor Lane in Cheadle to try and disperse nuisance youths. But it is the first time it has been used inside a business. Cllr Philip Harding said: 'The idea is they (yobs) would disperse as it's not their scene. I believed it was successful but it's a bit of a different suggestion inside a business. 'I like classical music but I'm not sure the patrons of McDonald's do.' McDonald's has already tried to tackle antisocial behaviour problems by joining a neighbourhood crime fighting team run by local police. Stockport Business Watch Exclusion has around 70 members and crimes committed against one can lead to a banning order covering all. Police have also sent letters home to the parents of antisocial youngsters caught misbehaving at the burger chain. Tried and tested: Two years ago Stockport council played classical music to deter youngsters hanging around an antisocial hotspot . A McDonald's spokesman said: 'Our first priority is to ensure that our restaurants are safe and welcoming environments for both customers and staff, so we take antisocial behaviour very seriously. 'We work closely with police to prevent incidents and where necessary exclude those who repeatedly cause a nuisance. 'We have also held meetings with young people and parents to encourage good behaviour.' A council spokesman said: 'The classical music clearly differentiates between the nightclub atmosphere that some customers have just left and the more serene family restaurant that McDonald's aims to provide.'","Fast-food chain turns to Beethoven and Brahms to curb violence .

"A Utah teenager arrested last year in a Columbine-inspired plot to . blow up his high school was eliminated in the race Tuesday for mayor of a . small Utah city. Results released by officials Tuesday evening . showed 18-year-old Joshua Kyler Hoggan received less than 5 percent of . the vote in the primary, preventing him from moving on as a general . election candidate on the ballot in the Roy, Utah, mayoral race. The . current mayor, Joe Ritchie, and Councilman Willard Cragun were the top . vote-getters and move on to face-off in the Nov. 5 general election. Joshua Kyler Hoggan, seen here at age 16, says he's rehabilitated and ready to lead the city of 37,000 people . Hoggan says he recognizes what he did was wrong but insists that he . never had any explosives or intent to bomb the school in early 2012 . when he and an older classmate were arrested. He says his six months in . juvenile detention helped him deal with personal issues that plagued him . then and says that he's rehabilitated and ready to lead the city of . about 37,000 people north of Salt Lake City. 'People should trust . me because I have proven one thing: That I am human,' Hoggan said in an . email to The Associated Press. 'I have made mistakes, just like the rest . of us. We've all made mistakes in our pasts, and I am no exception.' He . faced off in Tuesday's primary against the current mayor, Joe Ritchie, . and Councilman Willard Cragun. Most consider Hoggan a long shot to get . through the nonpartisan primary, in which voters will choose two of the . three to advance to the general election. Ritchie has been mayor for . eight years and Cragun a councilman for six years. The polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday. Hoggan . pleaded guilty in 2012 to possession of a weapon of mass destruction. Police said that Hoggan, then 16, and an older classmate at Roy High . School spent months plotting an attack inspired by the 1999 Columbine . shootings. Hoggan even visited with the Columbine principal about the . shootings and security measures. Their plan included a detailed . plot, school blueprints and a plan to fly away after the bombing, said . investigators who never found a bomb. A classmate tipped . authorities to the plot after receiving text messages from Hoggan, who . bragged that he planned to steal a plane from a nearby airport. The boy . had logged hundreds of hours on a flight simulator program to prepare. His classmate, Dallin Morgan, pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and . was given a 105-day jail sentence. Hoggan's plan to destroy the school was inspired by the mass-shooting at Columbine High School in 1999. where two students (pictured) killed 13 people . Ritchie, mayor since 2006, said . Hoggan has every right to be on the ballot but he questions his motives . and whether he's truly rehabilitated. He said many in Roy are still . shaken by Hoggan's bombing plan and are perplexed why he's in the race. 'I'm not so sure how sincere he is,' said Ritchie, who has never met Hoggan. 'I think he's in it for the notoriety.' Asked if he thinks Hoggan has a chance to win, Ritchie said, 'I sure hope not.' But . Hoggan likes his chances, predicting that he'll get through the . primary. He just completed his first semester at Weber State University . in Ogden, where he is studying political science with hopes to have a . career in the political realm. Hoggan said he was misguided in . high school. His meeting with the Columbine principal was for research . for an article about school security for his high school newspaper, he . said. Roy High School officials knew about the meeting prior to him . traveling to Colorado, he said. Columbine killer Eric Harris and friend Dylan Klebold planned the attack on Columbine High School for months before carrying it out . Dylan Klebold (pictured) and Harris committed suicide after killing 13 people and wounding dozens more at Columbine High School in 1999 . He didn't seek out the attention . that has come with his bid for mayor, he said, but seized the . opportunity to let residents get to know him better. 'Many people . still have serious questions about me that need answered,' Hoggan wrote . in the email. 'I think that, if nothing else, the citizens of Roy City . used a valuable opportunity to have their concerns addressed.'","Joshua Hoggan and a friend planned to detonate a bomb at their high school and then get away in a stolen airplane .

"author] . One in ten of the families given taxpayer-subsidised social housing last year was foreign, figures revealed yesterday. They show that the rate at which newly arrived immigrants acquire council and housing association homes has gathered pace even in the face of deep public concern. The proportion of foreign citizens taking advantage of the diminishing supply of publicly-subsidised homes has risen by more than 50 per cent in five years. Influx: The proportion of foreign citizens using social housing has risen by more than 50 er cent in five years (file photo) In March, David Cameron pledged to stop foreigners taking advantage of state housing by introducing a residence test. It would require immigrants to wait two years before qualifying for social housing. Yesterday, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles blamed Labour for allowing local people ‘to be pushed out of the housing queue by foreign nationals’. He said ‘tough new guidance’ to give priority to local residents would be published soon. The Daily Mail revealed in July that nearly half a million immigrants who came to Britain in the decade after 2001 were housed in taxpayer-subsidised social homes. The new count was published by the Department of Communities and Local Government in a rundown of social housing statistics for the year to March. They showed that foreign citizens made up 10 per cent of those newly given social housing, up from nine per cent the previous year and 6.5 per cent in 2008. That represents 23,000 homes. It is estimated that the cost to taxpayers for those homes over their useful life is £1.5billion. The true figure is likely to be higher because many immigrants take up British citizenship shortly after arrival. 'Something for nothing': David Cameron promised to crack down on the trend in March . The last national census in 2011 revealed that 13 per cent of people in state-subsidised homes were born outside Britain, which represents 1.2million households. One in five of the social tenants in London is a citizen of neither Britain nor Ireland. The new figures brought calls for action from the pressure group Migrationwatch, which has pushed for councils to provide better information on who is being given state housing. ‘These figures confirm that the occupancy of social housing by those born overseas is far higher than has been generally realised, or even admitted,’ said chairman Sir Andrew Green. ‘The Government’s proposed action on this front would be welcome to many people.’ Mr Cameron made his promise to intervene in a speech in March, in which he said: ‘We cannot have a culture of something for nothing. New migrants should not expect to be given a home on arrival. ‘So, I am going to introduce new statutory housing allocation guidance this spring to create a local residence test. What this should mean is that local people get priority in the social housing system. ‘And migrants will need to have lived here and contributed to this country for at least two years before they can qualify.’ However, the Immigration Bill that was to contain the residency test has yet to be published, and no guidance for councils and housing associations has been laid down. Mr Pickles said yesterday that it soon would be. ‘The Labour government opened the doors to uncontrolled immigration, and allowed local residents to be pushed out of the housing queue by foreign nationals,’ he said. ‘This perception of unfairness has undermined community cohesion and fuelled further unsustainable immigration. ‘This Government is introducing greater transparency and honesty in immigration statistics, stopping Labour councils from covering up the true level of social housing being given to foreigners. ‘Many Left-wing town halls, incorrectly obsessed with equality rules, have failed to use their new powers to give greater backing to local people.’","New social housing statistics show large number of immigrants are given subsidised homes .

"The two British women accused of attempting to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5 million out of Peru have been branded liars by the lawyer who prepared the preliminary case against them. And he says their refusal to confess increases their prospect of facing 15 years in prison. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney’s office anti-drugs unit, dismissed the women’s stories. Scroll down for video . Living a nightmare: Michaella McCollum Connolly, left, and Melissa Reid in a Lima court . He said their excuses were ‘very well practised’, they had been coached in what to say and their ‘demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened’. The lawyer, who led the investigation for the first 15 days, said that Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, had no proof to back up any of their claims. Last week The Mail on Sunday printed the women’s police statements in full and revealed that Miss Reid’s father, William, thinks she should plead guilty. Dr Mendoza Abarca said: ‘They don’t even have one element of proof. Unfortunately, their stories are not believable – their stories are incredible. They staged this whole thing from the beginning because they knew it was possible they would get caught and if they did get caught they had the excuses really well planned. ‘The problem is that they received the drugs, they packed the drugs in their bags and they went to the airport. But had they been given the bags packed already – which is what usually happens – then it’s another story. When somebody is threatened, you can tell. I have spoken to the girls and their demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened because of the way they acted.’ Dr Mendoza Abarca questioned the women for three hours and thinks they will end up pleading guilty to get a shorter sentence. Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney's office anti-drugs unit, is interviewed by reporter Simon Murphy . He added: ‘It’s very obvious that they were trained in what to say if they were caught. They were prepared in every sense. They were told to take pictures of themselves having a good time, to try to act as normal as possible. All of the excuses were very well practised.’ This comes as The Mail on Sunday has uncovered fresh information about the women’s capture at Lima  airport: . Michaella McCollum Connolly (L) and Melissa Reid (R) were detained allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to Madrid, Spain, at the international airport Jorge Chavez in Callao, near Lima, Peru . The case is now in the hands of the judiciary, but Dr Mendoza Abarca has been privy to all the evidence in the first 15 days of the case. His remarks provide a stark assessment of the women’s hopes of proving their innocence. If they continue to plead not guilty they will receive a minimum of eight and maximum of 15 years behind bars, he warns. ‘The biggest part, for me, was when they started crying when I asked them about their families,’ he said. ‘There’s no way in the world they would risk their families’ safety for that many days when they could have come forward and told the authorities they’d been threatened. ‘They are going to end up pleading guilty to get the minimum sentence, that’s what they always end up doing in my experience.’ He added: ‘When they were first questioned, their demeanour was very flat and they were just repeating their story. Usually when a mule is caught they come out with lots of different stories and explanations – they have lots of detail. These girls’ stories were just too superficial. ‘They could have come forward before. They had the opportunities to. The authorities in this country and their country would have done everything that was necessary to protect their families and to make sure nothing happened to them. ‘If that had happened, they actually would have had the opportunity to catch the real people involved because they would have done whatever was necessary to catch the real bosses. But they didn’t do that. They waited to be caught.’ Dr Mendoza Abarca also ruled out the possibility that the women were sacrificed to let a bigger load of drugs though, explaining that once the girls had been caught all flights were put on high alert. He added that CCTV showing the girls’ movements just before they went to the airport ‘showed nobody was holding a gun to their head’. ‘No one was seen to force them to do anything,’ he said. ‘They may have been used to carry drugs but they may also have been offered compensation for it because they were just freely walking around.’ Joke: Melissa Reid has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home . Melissa Reid has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home, describing  her nightmare ordeal in a squalid Peruvian prison. But she has managed to keep her sense of humour and was able to joke: ‘Hope I look good on TV! (as good as I can that is.)’ Reid has spent her first full week behind bars with Michaella McCollum Connolly in a grim prison alongside murderers and terrorists. She describes the experience as ‘frustrating and scary’ but is ‘taking it one day at a time’.  Melissa tells friends that Michaella, from Northern Ireland, is ‘like a sister to me now’. Writing to friends at home in Glasgow from Virgen de Fatima prison, Melissa says: ‘Makes me sick to think I was meant to still be having the summer of a lifetime in beefa [Ibiza] baby but instead I am in a woman’s prison in Peru. I suppose it hasn’t quite hit home.’ After complaining that she misses her mother’s cooking, Melissa describes to another friend how she witnessed a hungry inmate sucking chicken bones, calling it ‘a different ball game’. At the prison, the women undergo a military-style regime. There is a head count at 6am, the inmates are locked in their cells from 6pm and lights go out at 9pm. Melissa and Michaella face up to three years there while they await trial. They are forced to take cold showers, which often cut out, and are confined to their cell most of the day. They are kept isolated from the main prison population while officials monitor their progress. Writing to her friends, Melissa said: ‘I am taking it day by day. It’s too hard to look at the long term as I will drive myself insane!’ To another friend she wrote: ‘If it was someone I knew in this position I would set up like a petition for David Cameron or something? I don’t know if it will  help but surely it will put pressure on them! I just wish we were back having the summer of our lives everything is so f****d up now!’ She added: ‘My 21st [birthday] will be in a Peruvian prison ahhh!!!!’ The pair could spend up to three years in jail in Peru as they await their trial . Last night, Melissa’s father, William, bid an emotional goodbye to his daughter as he prepared to fly back to Britain. Breaking down in tears, Melissa told him: ‘I’m going to find it so hard not knowing when I’ll next see you or Mum.’ Mr Reid said: ‘I think prison has been a reality check for them both. They now know that this is going to be where they’re going to spend a considerable period of time. ‘Melissa has always been looking forward to my next visit but when I’m gone, she’ll not know when she’ll see her family again. ‘I’ve tried to explain to her why I think she should plead guilty. She is guilty of transporting drugs, but she can say she’s sorry for those actions and the hurt and misery it’s brought to her family. She’s just got to take the medicine that goes with that and move on.’","Lawyer brands women accused of attempting to smuggle cocaine as liars .

Reports suggest the suspected leader of the Nairobi mall-massacre may have been trained by British special forces . ‘The UK military have worked extensively with Kenyan forces, providing expertise and help,’ an official in Nairobi said. ‘It is highly likely that if this Omar was special forces he would have been trained or mentored at some time by the British. ‘They have provided considerable help and expertise to the Kenyans, especially on the subject of Somalia and its borders.’ Omar is one of at least two Christian converts to Islam who are said to have taken part in the slaughter of as many as 130 people by the Somali-based Al Shabaab terror group. Western security officials say there is no clear evidence that British fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite, widow of 7/7 suicide bomber  Jermaine Lindsay, took part. However, six witnesses have claimed independently that a white woman was involved in the 15-strong gun gang – several of whom are thought to have escaped in the chaos. The US authorities say police are trying to obtain DNA samples of Lewthwaite to see if there is a match with any of the bodies found in the rubble of the collapsed Westgate centre. As many as 130 people were slaughtered in the attack which lasted four days in Nairobi, trapping shoppers within the mall . Omar is one of at least 15 people who made up the gun wielding group which . terrorised civilians within the mall until Kenyan special forces (pictured) were able to bring them to safety . The 29-year-old is wanted by  Interpol in connection with a failed bomb plot in the Kenyan port of Mombasa two years ago. Joseph Ole Lenku, the country’s interior minister, said yesterday  that eight men were still being  held under anti-terrorism laws as officers ‘seek to unmask the face behind the terror attack’. Investigators believe they have found a  silver car used by the terrorists  and identified a house in which  the gang prepared for their murderous assault. The owner of the house, which is just 100 yards from the Israeli-run shopping centre, was arrested as he tried to leave the country on Tuesday. He is also understood to have leased a women’s clothing shop apparently used by the terrorists to store guns and ammunition. Anti-terror officers are looking into the records of special forces soldiers who left the Kenyan army around 2005 ¿ and those who received specialist training from the British . Kenya¿s defence and police forces and its National Intelligence Service are at odds with each other amid claims that agents had warned of the attacks but that their superiors had suppressed the reports . As many as 130 people could have been involved in the attack which Somali-based Al Shabaab terror group launched on non-Muslims within the shopping mall . Omar is said to have left Kenya for Somalia in 2005, where initially he joined a militant Islamist group before transferring to the Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab, which was formed in 2006. Channel 4 said he used to teach Al Shabaab fighters martial arts and boxing at a training camp in Somalia. They say he fell out with the leadership because they thought he lacked sufficient ambition. A second suspect, identified as Khadhab, is said to be a Somali national who was tortured by the CIA. Sources told Channel 4 that he fled to Al Shabaab-held territory after being released. Kenya’s security chiefs have been summoned to appear before parliament’s defence committee for questioning over the mall siege.‘The time for responsibility and accountability has come,’ the committee’s chairman, Ndung’u Gethenji, said. Kenya’s defence and police forces and its National Intelligence Service are at odds with each other amid claims that agents had warned of the attacks but that their superiors had suppressed the reports. It was reported that a pregnant policewoman has recorded a police statement after her brother, who worked for the NIS, warned her not to visit Westgate last Saturday. The officer is being sought.","Man, known only as Omar, is one of two Muslim converts who took part in attack .

"A man from southern Colombia had to have his penis amputated after he allegedly overdosed on Viagra to impress his girlfriend. The 66-year-old man from Gigante, Colombia, whose name has not been released, told a local newspaper that he intentionally overdosed on the erectile dysfunction medicine. He then is said to have suffered an erection for several days before being forced to seek medical advice. Impress: The 66-year old from Gigante, Colombia, said to have overdosed on the penis-enhancing medicine to show off to his new girlfriend (file picture) According to news website Colombia Reports, . the penis-enhancing drug caused the man, who is said to be a farmer and . a former politician, to develop signs of gangrene. When he sought medical help, doctors in Gigante referred the man to a medical facility in Neiva, where medical staff noted that the man's penis was inflamed and fractured. Doctors: Medical staff said the unnamed man was inflamed and had many fractues . They informed the patient his only option was amputation so the inflammation and gangrene would stop spreading to other parts of his body. A doctor told local newspaper La Nacion: 'The patient showed bruising on the testicles and penis, was treated and is recovering well.' As a result of the incident, Neiva hospital issued a warning for men . to not use penis enhancing drugs or erectile dysfunction medication without prescription from their doctors. Earlier this week, a Yemeni man died of a Viagra overdose as he prepared to sleep with his bride on their first day as a married couple. The 25-year-old Yemeni man dosed up on five Viagra pills at one time which killed him, according to Yemini Arabic Language daily newspapwer Okaz Al Youm. Once the wedding hall was cleared out, the unnamed man left to join his wife at their new home. When he arrived, he fainted and collapsed and died after being taken to hospital despite doctors’ attempts to revive him. Viagra contains the ingredient sildenafil citrate, which works by relaxing muscles in the walls of blood vessels. However, the action that Viagra has on nerve activity of muscles in the penis may also increase sympathetic nerve activity (which makes blood vessels constrict). There have been several reports of heart attack, heart arrhythmia and even deaths that have been related to men who were using Viagra. Men with unstable cardiovascular disease, including a history of heart attacks, are advised against using the drug.","The 66-year-old from Gigante, Colombia, is said to be a former politician .

"A 16-year-old boy is facing first degree murder charges after his mom’s body was found at the family’s home in the early hours of Saturday. The body of Tina Helms Spencer, 36, was found murdered in the backyard shed at the property in Mesa, Arizona. Her son, Mike Helms, has been booked into juvenile detention on charges including first-degree murder, aggravated assault and tampering with evidence. Mike Helms is facing first degree murder charges after the body of his mom, Tina Helms Spencer, 36, was found at the family's home in Mesa, Arizona, on Saturday . A 17-year-old friend of the son was booked into juvenile detention on charges of first-degree murder as an accomplice, evidence tampering and concealment of a body. Police say the 16-year-old had been grounded and had his phone taken away. After his mom returned home from work, they allegedly had a heated argument over the phone and he decided to kill her. Cops were alerted after receiving a phone call from the son’s stepfather. He also had been attacked by the boy after returning home from work but had managed to escape after a short struggle. Helms has been booked into juvenile detention on charges including first-degree murder, aggravated assault and tampering with evidence . When police arrived, a vehicle was missing from the home and there were signs of a struggle. During the investigation, police ended up speaking with a 17-year-old friend of the son at his nearby home, when the 16-year-old arrived, he was immediately taken into custody. Authorities expect a hearing will be held to determine if the juveniles will be charged as adults. A hammer and a frying pan were found at the scene, which police believe were involved in the incident. Police say the 16-year-old asked his friend to act as a lookout so he could attack her when she came home. School friend Mike O'Connor described Helms as a 'giant teddy' and a friendly kid who sometimes fought with his parents . Both boys allegedly moved Spencer to the shed, attempted to clean up the scene and then the 17-year-old left. Afterward, police say the 16-year-old decided to also kill his stepfather, but they don't believe the 17-year-old was part of that plan. A school friend of Helms described him as a friendly kid, a junior ROTC cadet in high school. 'He's a giant teddy. He's tough on the outside. He puts up that front, but when you get to know him, he's a standup guy,' Mike O'Connor told FOX10. 'He didn't really have home issues he talked about. If he did, it was typical stuff. One week he'd have a fight with this parents, the next week he was talking about how his mom was awesome and helping him out with something.'

"Ed Miliband’s popularity has slumped to its lowest level ever – rivalling even Iain Duncan Smith’s appalling personal ratings during his disastrous spell as Tory leader. The latest Ipsos MORI survey shows that six in ten British adults say they are dissatisfied with the Labour leader, compared to just 24 per cent who are satisfied. His net satisfaction rate of minus 36 per cent is comparable with the low point of Mr Duncan Smith's leadership, eight months before he was ousted as by the Tory party in 2003. Trouble: Ed Miliband has faced growing pressure, including his appearance at the TUC conference yesterday where his speech was met with near-silence . Even among Labour supporters Mr Miliband has negative ratings, with 52 per cent of Labour supporters dissatisfied with his performance compared to 40 per cent who are happy with it. Worryingly for the party as a whole, Labour’s support also continues its downward trend. It is now just three points ahead of the Conservatives. The disastrous ratings come just days after Mr Miliband received the silent treatment at the TUC congress and it emerged he had bottled plans to dilute the unions’ block vote at Labour conferences. And earlier this week, Chancellor George Osborne likened his Labour counterpart Ed Balls to Monty Python’s Black Knight for refusing to accept the recovery is gaining momentum. Thumbs down: Mr Miliband's satisfaction rating is now at the low levels seen when Iain Duncan Smith was Tory leader . Bad omen: Mr Miliband's ratings are as low as those seen when Iain Duncan Smith (left) and William Hague (right) lead the Tory party . The poll shows that only Nick Clegg is more unpopular than Mr Miliband, with a net satisfaction rating of minus 40 per cent, down five points over the past month. David Cameron has a rating of minus 20, down three points; although most Tory voters remain satisfied with his leadership. The most popular party leader is Nigel Farage of UKIP, although his net satisfaction rating is still minus seven, and more than a third say they did not know what they thought of him. The small print is even bleaker reading for Mr Miliband. Almost twice as many people think Mr Cameron is a capable leader as think the same of Mr Miliband (53 and 28 per cent respectively). While 47 per cent see Mr Cameron as good in a crisis, just 20 per cent say the same about the Labour leader. The Prime Minister is also seen as more likely to have sound judgement than any of his rivals. Leadership: Just 24 per cent of voters are satisfied with Mr Miliband, the same as Nick Clegg . Pressure: Among those intending to vote, the Labour leader is now down to just three points . Just one in five (19 per cent) think the Labour leader has got a lot of personality, compared to 40 per cent who say the same of Mr Cameron. However, Mr Cameron did worse on some questions – he is seen as more out of touch than other leaders, and eight in 10 believe he looks after some sections of society more than others. Both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg are seen as having more style than substance. Overall, Labour’s support stands at 37 per cent, down three points; with the Tories on 34 per cent, up four. The Lib Dems are on 10 per cent – below UKIP on 11 per cent. The poll also confirms the public’s economic optimism continues to improve, with 46 per cent believing conditions will improve over the next year. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘There has been much discussion over the perceived softness of Labour’s lead, and this poll shows that clearly – with a fall in Labour supporters’ certainty to vote giving them just a three point lead. ‘David Cameron maintains his lead on key prime ministerial qualities on being capable and good in a crisis – although remains vulnerable on being seen as out of touch. Ed Miliband’s satisfaction ratings, though, have fallen from 40 per cent at the end of last year to 24 per cent this month.’","Labour leader's net satisfaction rate slumps to -36% in Ipsos/Mori poll .

"The BBC yesterday came under fire for treating the christening of Prince George as a ‘tail end afterthought’ on its flagship news programmes. While the historic occasion was featured on front pages around the world, BBC1’s half-hour News at Six and Ten gave it bottom billing. Both programmes devoted just two minutes and 20 seconds to the ceremony on Wednesday. BBC2’s current affairs show Newsnight failed to mention it at all. Scroll down for video . The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the Royal christening in which two minutes and 20 seconds was devoted to the event and it was given bottom billing on BBC1's News at Six, presented by George Alagiah . BBC2's current affairs show Newsnight failed to mention the christening of the third in line to the throne at all . Yesterday, Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said he was ‘appalled’ an event of national importance had been given such scant attention. He added: ‘The BBC is the national broadcaster. An event such as that should have been given greater prominence. ‘People will be very surprised to see  that it was an “and finally” item bearing in mind that it is a slot usually reserved for non-serious items.’ The BBC’s News at Six found time only  for a short pre-recorded clip about the christening which was narrated by royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell. Instead of exploring the historical significance of the event or seeking comment from royal experts, he restricted his report to a brief rundown of the guests as they left the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace. The short clip was placed last in the news agenda, just before the weather at 6.30pm. The BBC has received four complaints about its coverage of the christening on Wednesday . It was deemed even less important than the story of a venomous spider outbreak in a school in Gloucestershire and a segment on proposals to give motorists a five-minute grace period after parking tickets run out. The News at Ten recycled the same Witchell clip, and also gave it bottom billing. On Newsnight at 10.30pm, the christening was omitted altogether. Instead, presenter Jeremy Paxman interviewed controversial comic Russell Brand, giving him a platform to espouse his desire for a political revolution. Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘I’m disappointed with the BBC’s coverage on the royal christening, which is an important occasion in the life of the nation. The monarchy is a cherished institution in this country. It attracts more support than almost any other aspect of our national political life. ‘This is the first, formal occasion on which three heirs to the throne are in one place for well over 100 years. The public want to see and hear as much of this as possible. ‘It’s disappointing that the BBC have chosen to relegate this to a tail end afterthought.’ Andrew Rosindell (left) said he was appalled by the coverage and Michael Ellis (right) was 'disappointed' The royal christening was featured on the front pages of seven of the UK’s national newspapers, and on the front pages of newspapers around the world. ITV News at 6.30pm and 10pm both devoted three minutes to the christening story, giving it top billing in the second half of each programme. The slot is typically reserved for major stories as the channel needs to regain the attention of its viewers after the advert break. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘The royal christening was an important national event which newspapers have given huge coverage to in response to their readers’ desire to properly commemorate the event. ‘After a very difficult year, it’s probably fair to suggest that the BBC is struggling to stay in touch with what its audience wants.’ ITV News devoted three minutes to the christening, giving it top billing in the second half of the programme . The BBC said it had received four complaints that its news coverage of the royal christening was insufficient. A spokesman added: ‘The BBC provided extensive coverage of the royal christening across all platforms yesterday, including live coverage on the BBC News Channel, as well as a range of reports across our television bulletins and radio and online. ‘The christening was in the BBC1 bulletin headlines at both 6pm and 10pm, with a full report by our royal correspondent Nick Witchell. 'There were several major news stories yesterday, including the loss of many jobs following the shutdown of Scotland’s biggest industrial site, and David Cameron’s announcement that day that the Government will review green taxes in response to rising energy prices. All our reports are there because we judge them important and of audience interest.’","BBC1's News at Six and Ten devoted two minutes and 20 seconds to event .

"Alexis Clarke was smaller than a soda can when she was born last April - three and a half months early. Weighing just 11 ounces, she was the smallest baby ever delivered at the University of San Diego Medical Center. Over the past six months, Alexis has miraculously thrived despite her premature birth and is nearly healthy enough to finally go home to her parents just in time for Thanksgiving. Alexis is now 7 pounds, 3 ounces. I'm a big kid now: Alexis Clarke was no larger than her mom's hand when she was born, but after six months in intensive care she has grown to 7 pounds, 3 ounces and is ready to go home . Tiny: When she was born, Alexis was about the size of a soda can. Her mom had to wait three months just for the opportunity to hold her daughter . Something to be thankful for: Alexis' parents hope to have her home by Thanksgiving . 'We have something definitely huge to be thankful for,' mother Laurie Clarke told NBC. The past six months have been a trying experience for Mrs Clarke, who wasn't even allowed to hold her daughter until three months after she was born. 'Honestly, it was a lot of ""what did I do wrong?"" Hearing that it wasn't anything that I did definitely helped,' she said. While babies born as early as Alexis survive 80 per cent of the time, the survival rate wasn't so high until recent years. Not responsible: At first, Alexis' mother was wracked with guilt, believing she did something to cause her baby's premature birth - but doctors assured her that wasn't the case . Good medicine: While 80 per cent of babies born as early as Alexis survive, that wasn't the case 20 years ago . Blessing: Alexis' early birth has taught her parents to be thankful for every day they have with their daughter . 'Twenty years ago, she wouldn't have survived,' Alexis' doctor Krishelle Marc-Aurele said. 'I can’t believe it. I can’t believe she’s 10 times bigger than she was. I can’t believe she looks like a normal baby.' Throughout her hospital stay, doctors warned Alexis parents that despite the odds, they should take their daughter as a 'day-by-day' situation. That's had a profound affect on mother Laurie who has learned not to waste any time spent with her miracle baby. 'We count every day as such a blessing with her, and we know we are so lucky to have her. Every day, you just never know,' she said. 'I couldn't imaging losing someone as much as we do her.' Alexis' family are now fundraising to give back to the UCSD intensive care unit that nursed their daughter for the past sic months.","Alexis Clarke was born three and a half months early last April .

"Alarming: Thefts of valuable ¿green¿ catalytic converters from cars have more than doubled over the past three years . Thefts of valuable ‘green’ catalytic converters from cars have more than doubled over the past three years, new figures reveal. Criminals are ripping out the anti-pollution devices from cars and vans because they contain increasingly precious and sought-after metals such as platinum and palladium - leaving motorists with repair bills of thousands of pounds. Soaring scrap metal prices have seen thefts increase ten fold in some areas. Altogether almost 25,000 thefts were reported to police forces across the UK between 2010 and the first half of this year. Police say 4x4 vehicles and vans are particularly at risk because they are easy to crawl underneath. The scale of the increase is revealed in a BBC investigation (must credit). Figures from 40 UK police forces revealed thefts UK had more than doubled from 3,957 in 2010 to 8,947 in 2012. But some parts of the country saw an even more significant rise. In Bedfordshire (up from 31 to 340) and South Yorkshire (up from 15 to 177) thefts increased more than ten-fold. And they more than tripled across Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Leicestershire during the same period. Dyfed-Powys in Wales has seen a 27-fold increase from just 2 thefts in 2010 to 55 in 2012.Catalytic converters reduce poisonous gases from the vehicle’s exhaust system. James Goodson, a senior analyst with British Transport Police, says rises in the global price of platinum have fuelled the illegal trade. He said: ‘We’ve seen that in the past metals such as platinum and palladium are affected by the changes in the market. That would be reflected at scrap metal dealer level by the dealer offering a better price for that material. ‘We’ve identified that when there are increases in the price of these metals and materials then we often see an increase in levels of theft reported to us.’ Det Supt Alison Evans, national co-ordinator for the National Metal Theft Task Force, said organised criminals were behind the increases in theft: ‘We have had depots and fleets being hit, and that suggests a level of pre-planning that isn’t involved in your spontaneous type of offending.’ She added: ‘We know from our intelligence from the arrests we’ve made that most of the people we have arrested are UK residents. There is an element of Eastern European involvement but a lot of these people are people who trawl around the country in order to attack particular locations that have been identified as vulnerable.’ Det Supt Evans said: ‘Catalytic converters can be processed through some scrap metal dealers, but they need to have a particular piece of equipment to be able to do that. ‘ . In another twist, police say some catalytic converters are exported directly in containers to emerging economies where they are either reused or broken down. Easy target: Police say 4x4 vehicles like this Nissan X-Trail are particularly at risk because they are easy for crooks to crawl underneath . New laws that came into force on 1 October banned cash payments for scrap metal with the aim of making it easier to trace people selling stolen metal. Among the victims are Jonathan Elvidge whose fleet of delivery vans was targeted by thieves just before Christmas 2011. Fifteen of his vehicles were stripped of their catalytic converters when his depot was raided one night. Mr Elvidge said the thief managed to saw through and remove all 15 catalytic converters within 45 minutes: ‘The cost to the business was significant. I mean keeping the vehicles on hire and bringing in new vehicles would have cost us £15,000 to £20,000.’ But he stressed: ‘The real cost is the lost revenue in the stores, which we estimate will be in excess of £100,000. So the real risk to the business, was going out of business.’ Up to 600 jobs were put at risk by the thefts, he added. Modern cars are fitted with catalytic converters to reduce harmful emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. They contain a ceramic honeycombed core coated with metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. The metals act as catalysts and convert the harmful gases into water vapour and less harmful emissions. A Department of Transport spokesman said it was not illegal to drive without a catalytic converter but you could be stopped by the police and prosecuted for breaking the law on harmful emissions. Most vehicles will also fail an MoT test without a catalytic converter. The police and AA say that to help foil the thieves, catalytic converters can be uniquely marked in acid with a serial number. Motorists are advised to keep their cars in garages or park in well-lit areas. Most converters are bolted on - but they can also be welded. Firms with fleets are advised to obstruct access to high vehicles by parking cars with lower ground clearance round them and to install CCTV cameras.","Figures from 40 UK police forces revealed thefts UK had more than doubled from 3,957 in 2010 to 8,947 in 2012 .

"Controversial data collected from NSA eavesdropping on U.S. citizens may have been used by intelligence officials in order to make a deadly drone strike on Somali militant leader. That’s what the defense is arguing in a California terrorism funding case that’s focused on al Shabaab, the same group that recently carried out a deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. Four San Diego men of Somali extraction were convicted of conspiracy to finance and support the Somali militant group in February. Now they argue that data illegally collected on one of them was used to justify the lethal strike and want a new trial. Illegal? Somalians walk through what remained after a U.S. strike that killed militant leader Aden Hashi Ayrow in 2008. Four men accused of helping fund his group now say intel obtained illegally by the NSA led directly to the strike . The revelation came Thursday from a court filing in which lawyers allege said an FBI email they obtained under disclosure rules constitutes evidence which, though cryptic, suggests that data collected by NSA eavesdropping on U.S. citizen Basaaly Moalin was used for the missile targeting in 2008. Questions about whether the data may have been collected illegally will likely fuel fresh controversy over NSA spying on U.S. citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used. Defense lawyers assert there may be legal grounds for a new trial for four men convicted in the case. The email, from an unnamed FBI official to an unnamed recipient at another agency, talks about how Aden Hashi Ayrow, the senior al Shabaab leader based in Somalia killed in the May 2008 missile strike, tried to call Moalin in January 2008 but failed to reach him. ‘We just heard from another agency that Ayrow tried to make a call to Basaaly today, but the call didn't go through. If you see anything today, can you give us a shout ? We're extremely interested in getting real time info (location/new #s) on Ayrow,’ the email says. Target: Senior al Shabaab leader Aden Hashi Ayrow was killed in the strike. U.S. citizen Basaaly Moalin's lawyers now say he was illegally wiretapped for info that led to the strike . Retrial? The militant leader was one of around 30 killed in the strike (aftermath pictured), which lawyers for Moalin say was justified with illegally obtained intel. They now want a retrial . One of the defense lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear if the information was legally obtained with a warrant. The new court filing calls for a new trial and for the U.S. government to turn over other evidence which may have been withheld at the original trial. Historically, it has been rare for the U.S. government to release, either through evidence-sharing rules or under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, internal government documents relating to counterterrorism armed drone operations. The email in question was uncovered during the lengthy government investigation and court proceedings about the four defendants and turned over to defense lawyers. Revelations this year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have provoked a major political debate in the United States on the extent of snooping on U.S. citizens and residents and its legality. In their court filing, the defense lawyers argued that the use of NSA eavesdropping authority employed in their case ‘would be beyond the scope of anything authorized by Congress or approved by the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) - unless of course that is the subject of another set of secret procedures and protocols yet to be exposed and subsequently acknowledged.’ ‘Given that the U.S. government had previously attempted to target Mr Ayrow via missile attack (unsuccessfully), and ultimately did so successfully May 1, 2008... the implications of 'real time' information on Mr. Ayrow's whereabouts are obvious, if not altogether ominous,’ it said. In congressional hearings following the Snowden revelations, law enforcement and intelligence officials publicly cited the San Diego prosecution as one of a handful of unclassified examples of how NSA surveillance had been a key tool in U.S. counterterrorism efforts, but gave only limited details. The NSA had no immediate comment and the CIA, which has conducted lethal drone operations against militants in Somalia and other countries, declined to comment. Renewed criticism? Revelations about Moalin et al could renew controversy over NSA spying on U.S. citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used .","Lawyers for San Diego resident Basaaly Moalin and three other men want a retrial for their clients who were convicted of conspiracy to aid the militant group in February .

"Jason Chan, a cancer survivor and Chicago restaurateur, sought sweet justice for one of his patrons last Thursday evening. Jason Chan, who is also a martial arts instructor and former bouncer, won an epic battle against a thief who tried to steal a customer's I-phone 5. Chan says he saw a suspicious man wearing ripped clothing walk into the restaurant --too messy an ensemble to be dining in a Michelin rated sushi restaurant like Juno in Chicago, Ill. Scroll Down For Video . Jason Chan or Jackie Chan? This picture captures the moment restaurant owner Jason Chan stopped a thief from stealing an I-phone . The thief, Justin Ballog, removed his coat and put it on the bar. He then asked the bartender for a pen and paper and sped out the door a few moments later. Chan noticed customer Gary Wolske's phone was no longer at the bar. After Wolske confirmed his phone was missing, Chan was out the door after the culprit. Chan got into his car and scoured the streets for the man in the red and black striped sweater. He saw him walking into nearby Lou Manalti's Pizzeria about to try the same trick. Chan confronted Ballog, 37, who threatened Chan with violence. 'He was adversarial, [so I used] hand-to-hand combat techniques to make sure he was unconscious,' Chan told the Chicago-Sun Times. Ballog was no match for the martial arts master who teaches Shidokan and who has been practicing the art for 19 years. Chan told ABC, 'He got into an aggressive stance with me, and I said, 'Don't try to hit . me, if you try to hit me, I'm going to defend myself,' and then I said . 'Don't even think about hitting me,'and then he tried to hit me,' said . Chan. Don't mess with a master: Jason Chan teaches Shidokan and has been practicing the martial art for 19 years . Justice is served: Justin Ballog tried to hit Jason Chan and in return he got a black-eye and a criminal charge . Chan told the Huffington Post, 'I have a protective nature I guess.' Chan also said, 'I grabbed him and threw him into the door.' Passersby witnessing the flight in the street called police. 'I put him in a maneuver called an arm bar and told him I would break his arm if he tried to get away,' said Chan. When police arrived, they arrested Justin Ballog of the 5000 block of North California, Chicago. He was charged with misdemeanor theft. And he's modest! Jason Chan thanks everyone for their support in his act of trying to help someone in trouble . Juno regular, Wolske, was beyond grateful for Chan's help in getting back his phone. In order to thank Chan, Wolske bought him a 12-year-old Glenlivet Scotch on Friday. 'He’s like the modern-day John Wayne, or Bruce Lee. . . . He takes it to heart: What’s right is right,' said Wolske. Wolske told the Sun Times that he won't be leaving his phone on a bar ever again. He is thankful for Chan's courageous actions. Juno is a Michelin rated sushi bar in Chicago, a city known for its spectacular cuisine . 'It does send a message: This tough guy, Jason, and his neighbors are not going to allow this,' Wolske said. This fight was the first time Chan used Shidokan outside the gymnasium in over a decade. ABC Chicago reports that Jason Chan also just won a battle against throat cancer. Chan, who was diagnosed in January 2012, didn't have health insurance so dedicated friends helped him by starting a fundraising campaign to pay for stage four cancer treatment. Jason Chan is now cancer free, but has since lost 50 pounds and is still recovering from chemotherapy. 'To have these health issues and to be able to do this is amazing,' said Wolske. Chan said he hoped thieves would avoid his neighborhood and establishment. He told ABC that he has had years of training, is a black belt, and that others should not try to interfere with crime unless they can properly defend themselves.","Jason Chan, owner of Juno restaurant, is also a Shidokan martial arts master and a former bouncer .
'I put him in a maneuver called an arm bar and told him I would break his arm if he tried to get away,' said Chan.

"Students at a Californian high school are in shock after one of their classmates - a talented track star - jumped to his death from a pedestrian bridge near campus. Some students at Otay Ranch High School in Chula Vista said Steven Liu, 17, had been bullied but friends claimed he suffered low self esteem and could be hard on himself, despite his many talents. 'Steven was a great guy,' his friend Jazmine . Lahbabi told the San Diego Union Tribune at a makeshift memorial on the bridge on Sunday, but 'he had been asking his friends for . the last couple of months what they thought of him. I . think he was looking for help.' Liu died after jumping from the Santa . Venetia Street bridge on Friday evening. Passersby who witnessed the . tragedy said the boy was crying on the ledge before falling to his . death. Scroll down for video . Tragic: 17-year-old Steven Liu, pictured left and right, jumped to his death from a bridge on Friday after his friends said he suffered from low self esteem and that he could be hard on himself . Aaron Bianco was driving past the bridge when he saw Liu about to jump, but said he was powerless to stop him. He rushed to help after seeing him fall. 'The . police officer I was with started first aid immediately,' he told News 10. 'To . be honest, it was obvious nothing was going to work.' He . added that Liu's mother, who had learned that her son was going to the bridge, arrived on the scene moments later and was . 'wailing on the ground'. More than 100 people gathered at the memorial on Saturday night to remember Liu, who was a star runner on the cross-country team, a talented photographer, an origami artist and a budding guitar player. His coach said he regularly finished in the top three at the school's cross country meets. Scene: Witnesses said they saw Liu crying before he jumped from this pedestrian bridge in Chula Vista . Friends and strangers left posters, candles, letters, pictures and jerseys on the bridge. Classmates wrote messages on Facebook and spoke to news channels explaining that the teenager took his life as he was the victim of bullying. John Melgar, who ran track with Liu, said other students would call him names and harass him. 'People took advantage of him,' he told News 10. 'They'd always ask for things. They'd tell him like, ""Oh, can you carry this for me"" and he'd just . carry it because he's a really nice guy.' Adrian Agbuia added that his brother had been in class with Liu last week when he had a breakdown. 'He . just finally lost it,' said Agbuia. 'All the bullying finally got to . him and he was just banging his head against the door in the classroom.' Remembered: On Saturday night, friends held a candle-lit memorial on the bridge for Liu . Loss: Friends described him as a talented track star and artist who was always willing to help others . But the school and other friends have expressed their skepticism over the claims he was bullied. Cross-country coach Ian Cumming, who said he was close to the young athlete, told UT San Diego that the situation was a lot more complicated. 'I think people who are saying that don’t know him and don't know his personal situation,' he said. 'He . was just a great person and had a lot of things going on, and like many . teenagers he just didn’t have the same self image as was true about . him.' Manuel Rubio, a spokesman for the Sweetwater Union High School District said he was aware that students had said Liu had been bullied, but he could not confirm that was true. Shock: Staff at Otay Ranch High School, pictured, disputed claims that the teenager had been bullied . 'This is a student who had a lot of personal issues going on,' Rubio said. His friend Jazmine said she was also . doubtful that he had been bullied. Instead, she said Liu was competitive . and could be hard on himself. 'We cared a lot for him and tried to show it, but sometimes he would shut it out,' she said. A crisis counseling team that includes . psychologists and administrators will be available at the high school to . speak with students, officials said.

"Iran has agreed with major global powers to temporarily suspend its controversial nuclear program in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions. The historic agreement calls for Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment for weapons and take several other steps to prove it is working towards a more permanent solution. In exchange, relief from some economic sanctions will be provided. 'The first step that we have taken today marks the most significant and tangible progress that we have made with Iran since I took office,' President Barack Obama said in Saturday night remarks from the White House. The still-to-be signed deal brings a partial end . to decades of sanctions imposed against a country infamously deemed a . member of 'the axis of evil' by former President George W Bush. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Another historic late night weekend announcement: US President Barack Obama makes a statement announcing an interim agreement on Iranian nuclear power that was reached in negotiations between Iran and six world powers . The gang's all here: World leaders including John Kerry (third from right) and Irainain Foreign Minister Javid Zarif (center left) during deal's announcement from Geneva . History has been made: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry talks with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov next to French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (L-R) In addition to suspending further uranium enrichment above five per cent, the country has also agreed to neutralize it's stockpile of near 20 per cent uranium, US officials said. The regime will not install any new centrifuges, disable roughly half of the country's centrifuge capabilities, and limit production of machines to that only needed to replace damaged ones necessary to continue a peaceful program aimed at producing nuclear power, said US officials. These actions include centrifuges at Natanz and Arak. 'While today's announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal,' said Mr Obama. The deal also calls for 'unprecedented transparency and intrusive monitoring of Iran’s nuclear program,' according to a White House statement. This transparency includes allowing International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors access to all previously disputed facilities and the providing of all previously requested information about their operation. 'These are substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon,' said the President. Some sanctions will be eased: The deal allows for the relaxing of some sanctions, but only if Iran continues to abide by the agreement . Major progress: President Barack Obama speaks Saturday in the State Dining Room at the White House . There will be a multi-step verification process to ensure Iran complies with the agreement. Iran agreed to these steps in exchange for a moderate relief from economic sanctions that have significantly derailed the country's economy over the past several years. 'The United States and our friends and allies have agreed to provide Iran modest relief, while continuing to apply our toughest sanctions,' President Obama added. The relief includes suspending embargoes against gold and precious medals, Iran's auto industry and petrochemical exports, which US officials said will give the country about $1.5billion in revenue. Additonally, further planned sanctions against Iranian oil will be put on hold and $400million in governmental tuition assistance will be made available from previously restricted accounts for use by Iranian students in other countries. The total relief will total about $7billion, according to officials, but the country's estimated $100billion in foreign exchange holdings will remain restricted. Iranmust prove itself: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry gestures as he speaks to the media about the deal that has been reached . Celebration: (L to R) EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . An amazing announcement: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (L) reacts next to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton (C) as US Secretary of State John Kerry (2nd R) embraces French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius . The President added that this development is proof that diplomacy can work, and that the US is committed to this course of action. Speaking from Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the deal is 'only the first step,' but 'a critical first step.' He also called the deal 'fail safe' and said that the President took great risks in coming to the agreement. Both the President and Mr Kerry were quick to note that no one will take Iran's words at face value and that the deal alone is just the beginning, the onus is now on the country to follow up. 'This would provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect,' Mr Obama said. 'But if Iran refuses, it will face growing pressure and isolation.' The world's most powerful countries brought their biggest diplomatic guns, with Mr Kerry flying in Saturday as it looked like an agreement was increasingly likely. Let's make a deal: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (R) shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif after the announcement . All smiles: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (L) and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (R) enjoy the moment . The country has reportedly agreed to stop enriching uranium for the next six months while the details of a more permanent agreement are hammered out. Mr Kerry joined the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany in Geneva, Switzerland, and his inclusion was seen as a sign a deal was imminent. Hassan . Rouhani, Iran's newly-elected moderate President, had previously spoke of hoping to bring to an end the Western sanctions that have . crippled his country's economy . The agreement is a 'first-step' deal, according to NBC News. It is binding for six months, but officials are hopeful that economic incentives will entice the previously . Until the announcement, which came early Sunday morning Geneva time, it was unclear whether the current round of negotiations would produce even a tentative agreement. Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke previously of 'very difficult negotiations,' saying 'narrow gaps' remain on the same issues that blocked agreement at the last round earlier this month. 'We're not here because things are necessarily finished,' Hague told reporters. 'We're here because they're difficult, and they remain difficult.' Kerry and his counterparts from Russia, Britain, France, China and Germany headed for Geneva after diplomats said Friday that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and top European Union diplomat Catherine Ashton had made progress on a key sticking point - Iran's claim to a right to produce nuclear fuel through uranium enrichment. A sense of relief: EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton (2nd L) is embraced by US Secretary of State John Kerry . News of the agreement was immediately followed by reports that the US and Iran held secret talks regarding the country's nuclear program since Mr Rouhani was elected President in June. The secret meetings were held in Oman and other secret locations and kept secret from all US allies, including Israel. The talks were held in Oman after Sultan Qaboos volunteered to mediate between the two nations, who have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1979. Several talks were held prior to August, but little progress was made before then. The early meetings have been characterized as exploratory and mainly to see if there was a basis for negotiation. Details were not previously released but it appeared the two sides were trying to reconcile Iran's insistence that it has a right to enrich for peaceful purposes while assuaging fears that Tehran was secretly trying to build a bomb, a charge the Iranians deny. As the talks entered an intensive phase, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the negotiations had reached 'the final moment,' according to China's Xinhua news agency. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters he wanted 'a deal - but a solid deal - and I am here to work toward that end.' France's concern that the negotiators were rushing into a flawed deal with Iran helped delay an agreement during a session nearly two weeks ago. Other obstacles include Iran's plutonium reactor under construction in Arak as well as a formula for providing limited sanctions relief without weakening international leverage against Iran. Kerry met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as part of the negotiations . Zarif appeared to allude to the toughening of demands after France's intervention. Iran's Mehr news agency quoted him as saying that back then, 'the two sides had agreement on issues but now it has reached a stage that there are various viewpoints and it is somehow difficult.' Enrichment is a hot-button issue because it can be used both to make reactor fuel and to make nuclear weapons. Iran argues it is enriching only for power, and scientific and medical purposes, and says it has no interest in nuclear arms. Washington and its allies point to Tehran's earlier efforts to hide enrichment and allege it worked on developing such weapons. Iran has insisted on that right throughout almost a decade of mostly fruitless negotiations. But Zarif last weekend indicated that Iran is ready to sign a deal that does not expressly state that claim. Iranian hard-liners have been suspicious of talk of nuclear compromise since moderate President Hassan Rouhani took office in September, fearing his team will give not get enough in terms of sanctions relief over the six-months of any first-stage agreement. Kerry was greeted by Ambassador Alexandre Fasel of the Swiss Mission in Geneva (2-R), Ambassador Jurg Lauber of the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2-L), and US Charge d'Affaires Peter Mulrean (L) Several U.S. senators - both Democrat and Republican - previously voiced displeasure with the parameters of the potential agreement, arguing that the U.S. and its partners are offering too much for something short of a full freeze on uranium enrichment. On Wednesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said his country would never compromise on 'red lines.' Since then Tehran had even publicly reverted to its original stance - that the six powers must recognize uranium enrichment as Iran's right, despite strong opposition by Israel and within the U.S. Congress. Still, comments from Iranian officials in Geneva indicated that reverting to tough talk on enrichment may have at least partially been meant for home consumption. In Geneva, a senior Iranian negotiator said the Iranian claim to the right to enrich did not need to be explicitly recognized in any initial deal, despite Khamenei's comment, adding that the supreme leader was not planning to intervene in the talks. He did suggest, however, that language on that point remained difficult and that there were other differences.","Iran has agreed to stop enriching uranium above five per cent for six months in exchange for limited lifting of sanctions .

"While the rest of the government was preparing to shut down this fall, the State Department was preparing to party - buying up nearly $200,000 worth of liquor for its overseas embassies. According to official records, the department spent about $180,000 in September, the final month of the fiscal year, on wine, whiskey and bourbon for events and presents in cities including Tokyo and Moscow. This last minute booze spree brought the year's total spend to more than $400,000, which is three times the entire liquor bill for 2008. Liquor: According to official records, the State Department spent about $180,000 in September, the final month of the fiscal year, on wine, whiskey and bourbon for events and presents in cities including Tokyo and Moscow (file photo) The Washington Times unearthed the costly alcohol bill that was split among purchase orders placed at embassies around the world, and some splurges were so last-minute, they occurred just hours before the government shutdown. According to the Times, $5,625 in 'gratuity wine' was ordered at the U.S. embassy in Rio de Janeiro on September 29, followed by $5,925 in 'gratuity whiskey' on the day the shutdown began. Meanwhile, $22,416 worth of wine was ordered at the embassy in Tokyo and their Moscow counterparts ordered $15,900 in bourbon and whiskey as the shutdown loomed. The Bucharest embassy bought Jack Daniels for its gratuities. U.S. embassies have always served alcohol at diplomatic events, irrespective of whether Democrats or Republicans are in power or the state of the economy. But the Post found the amount spend . on liquor has shot up starkly in recent years. According to the federal . government's procurement database, which includes a specific code . enabling the public to track alcoholic beverage purchase orders, the . State Department bought $415,000 worth of alcohol in fiscal 2012. Boss: Secretary of State John Kerry's department spend more than $400,000 on liquor in the last fiscal year. He is pictured Tuesday at the NATO Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting in Brussels . That staggering amount was 25 per cent more than the $331,000 spent in 2011 and more than triple the $118,000 spent in 2008. The ballooning taxpayer-funded booze bill needs to be more closely scrutinized, particularly with the current debt level, Taxpayers Protection Alliance president Dave Williams told the Post. The non profit watchdog group said that while it's unsurprising the department went on a buying binge pre-shutdown so as not to risk its budget getting cut in future. However, spending money on liquor for parties when families are reigning things in if crass, Williams said. 'This is what taxpayers don't understand,' he said. 'You have a looming government shutdown but then you have a ""use-it-or-lose-it"" mentality where someone is spending tens of thousands of dollars because they have to. 'If you're a family or a business and you're getting ready for a potential loss of revenue, the first thing you do is get rid of the parties,' he said. 'It's symbolic.' But the State Department told the Times that looking at 'a subset of purchases made by embassies overseas' would be an 'oversimplification' of the department's operation priorities. They also said throwing parties and giving gifts were important for diplomacy. 'The United States wishes to make the best impression in its dealings with foreign governments and other groups and carries out lawfully its representational activities, including its diplomatic receptions, in as effective and as culturally appropriate a manner as possible,' the statement to the Times read. 'The department also does so fully mindful of its duties as the steward of the public resources entrusted to it.' Not all embassies opted for alcohol as a diplomatic gesture, th Times found. The Athens embassy spent $7,300 on books by photographer Ansel Adams for Christmas gratuities, while the Tokyo embassy spent more than $50,000 on boxes of chocolates for the holidays.","The State Department spent about $180,000 in September, the final month of the fiscal year, on wine, whiskey and bourbon for events and presents at embassies in cities including Tokyo, Rio and Moscow .

"A witness says he heard the sarcastic final words of a Texas student moments before he was shot dead by a college police officer. Robert Cameron Redus, 23, was killed . when Corporal Chris Carter, 35, opened fire on him in the early hours of . Friday morning a few blocks away from the University of the Incarnate . Word in San Antonio where Redus studied, set to graduate in May. Neighbour Mohammad Haidaras told My San Antonio  that he heard a tense exchange between Redus and Carter sixty seconds before shots rang out. He told the website: 'I heard (a man) say, 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost.' The 22-year-old claims he heard gunshots less than a minute later and jumped into his closet. Investigators say an altercation began when Carter tried to pull Redus over for speeding and driving erratically. College shooting: Cameron Redus was killed after a campus cop shot him multiple times during a traffic stop . Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police . Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department told KSAT that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Tree House apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where Redus was a resident. Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates. According to Pruitt, Carter tried to pull him over on Broadway for driving erratically, despite the fact that Redus was off-campus. It is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments. Once there, both got out of their cars and some kind of struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot. A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings. 'I didn't hear him say anything like, ""Get down on your hands and knees,"" you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the man told KSAT. 'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.' Crime scene: Police investigate the street outside Cameron's apartment, where he was shot dead . Moving on: Cameron was due to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May . Gentle: Cameron Redus, who was described by friends as not being aggressive, was shot five times by a campus cop . Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments. He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter. 'I heard [a man] say, ""Oh, you're gonna shoot me?"" like sarcastic almost,' he said. Less than a minute later, Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.' Carter has been placed on administrative leave while officers investigate the shooting. University officials describe him as having 'extensive law enforcement background.' According to records viewed by My San Antonio, Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career. Devastated: Friends Sarah Davis (left) and Annie Jones (right) speak of their disbelief at the shooting of Cameron Redus . Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot . He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career. Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio. Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss. 'We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time,' the victim's family said in a statement. Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news. 'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.' 'He was an honor student, dean’s list every semester, incredibly intelligent,' said Annie Jones. 'So, so, so smart. He was our co-valedictorian in high school.'

"Airport arrest: Michael Hamlyn has been charged with possession of cocaine and amphetemines . Millionaire film and theatre producer Michael Hamlyn has been charged with possessing cocaine and amphetamines. Hamlyn, who made the Oscar-winning The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, was held by police at Stansted Airport. Officers are believed to have arrested him after allegedly finding the class A drugs on his return from a board meeting with a youth arts charity in Northern Ireland. If convicted, Hamlyn, 58, faces a . jail sentence of up to seven years. He is due to appear at Chelmsford . Magistrates’ Court on December 30. Friends . say he is worried about a possible drugs conviction barring him from . entering the US where he once had an office and often attends celebrity . parties in Los Angeles. Hamlyn is registered as living on his own at a £3.8million four-storey Georgian terraced house in North London. He . was originally due to appear in court next Monday but it is believed he . had the court appearance put back so he could travel to visit family in . Australia.

He . brought his 1994 hit film Priscilla, Queen of the Desert to the stage . in a musical in 2006. It has since played in the West End and on . Broadway, winning many awards. Hamlyn’s position in the art world was so prominent that he was once a governor of London’s Southbank Centre. The . drugs charge is likely to be highly embarrassing to Hamlyn’s family and . friends, who include Sir Terence Conran. He part-owns the Bibendum . restaurant in Chelsea with the British designer. Hamlyn has two children, Lili, 20, and Reuben, 18, with his former wife Sara. The couple divorced in 2000. Award: Hamlyn made the Oscar-winning The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert .

"It has been a year since Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis saved the lives of 15 children, as she barricaded her pupils in a tiny bathroom at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School. The teacher doesn't know if Adam Lanza ever entered her classroom, but her quick thinking  undoubtedly saved the lives of her pupils as they huddled together terrified. The 30-year-old, who has taken nearly a year off work, recalled the terrifying sounds during the 11-minute shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 six and seven year olds. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis has taken time away from teaching after barricading her class in a bathroom during the Sandy Hook shooting . 'I am so aware that roles . could have so easily been reversed,' Mrs Roig-DeBellis, who could hear gunfire and terrified pleas from the hallway and neighboring classroom, said. 'I remember, in the days after, it was so hard to get out of bed,' she said, as she sat on a sofa in her Greenwich, Connecticut home. 'I just walked around singing Amazing Grace just over and over and over, because it was just so incredibly hard.' 'In my mind constantly is what my students went through, and I think about the lives that were lost. So it’s not so much a realization that a year has passed. It truly is a constant, all the time,' she told the Daily Telegraph. The December 14 tragedy at Sandy Hook, among the most deadly school shootings in U.S. history, rocked the leafy, suburban town 70 miles northeast of New York City. Coming just five months after a gunman opened fire in a Colorado movie theater, killing 12, the murder of 20 six and seven-year-olds forced a national reckoning about gun violence. Lanza, a 20-year-old loner who appears to have had severe emotional problems, used guns that had been bought legally by his mother, Nancy. Never forget: Families of the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting have started a website, MySandyHookFamily.org to honor their loved ones . Victims: The six teachers and . 20 students who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last . December . Tribute: Crosses and a Star of David were erected in memory of the victims . He killed her in her bed, then drove to the elementary school he had once attended, shooting his way in just as the school day was getting started. After the rampage, he shot himself. When he entered the school, Mrs Roig-DeBellis's class was seated in a circle, sharing their holiday traditions. 'I . got up, I closed the door, I turned the lights off and I turned to my . students and I said: ""We need to get into the bathroom - right now"",' she said. Mark Barden, who lost his son, Daniel, gives a long pause when asked about forgiveness. 'I'm trying to approach every bit of this with an open heart and an open mind,' Mr Barden said. 'It's a work in progress.' Like . many other Sandy Hook parents, Mr Barden has kept up a punishing . schedule in the past year, traveling to Washington to meet lawmakers to . support a gun law that stalled in the Senate, and promoting the . work of Sandy Hook Promise. 'Maybe . it has saved me,' he said of the group. 'The way that Daniel lived his . short life, I know that he would have done a whole lot of good. We take . it very seriously now that it's our responsibility to do that good . work.' For Mr Barden, every day is an anniversary. The . last haircut. The last swim team practice. The last Thanksgiving. 'A . lot of the memories are happy. But we're still so new at this. It's . still so early on that it's hard not to get caught up in the grief,' he . said. The bathroom was . not more than 3ft by 4ft, too small to even hold a sink. Children climbed on to the toilet, behind the toilet. One perched on the . toilet paper dispenser. Mrs Roig-DeBellis used a storage unit to barricade the door. 'They were hearing exactly what I was hearing. It was extremely loud. It was extremely scary,' she said. 'I said to them, I said I need you to know that I love you all very much,' she told ABC News earlier this year. 'I thought that was the last thing they were ever going to hear. I thought we were all going to die.' About 45 minutes later, when the police arrived, Mrs Roig-DeBellis would not let . them in. 'I didn't believe them. I told them if they were cops, they could get the key,' she said. For days after, she was in a daze, unsure if she was alive or . dead. She ended up taking . more than a year off from teaching, and has devoted that time to . Classes4Classes, a charity that promotes acts of kindness between . groups of students. She plans to return to teaching . this summer. 'What happened that day has nothing to do with being a teacher,' she said. The . shootings shocked the nation and led President Obama to propose a . series of new gun-control measures, including an expansion of federal . background-check laws. Those efforts were blocked in the U.S. Senate . after some lawmakers argued the changes would be onerous to law-abiding . gun owners. Nightmare: Children are led out of the Sandy Hook elementary school after the shooting . In a report . released last month, state investigators said Lanza acted alone. His motive and reason for targeting Sandy Hook, a . school he once attended, remain a mystery, the report said. Gunman: Adam Lanza opened fire at his old elementary school on December 14, 2012 . As the nation prepares to mark the first anniversary of the massacre, Newtown has asked the public to stay away. For her part, Mrs Roig-DeBellis has planned a trip - a spa visit and maybe a dinner - anything to turn her focus from the excruciating sadness of that day. 'It’s the first thing I think of, I think of it all day long, and it’s the last thing I think of before I go to bed,' she said. After the attack, parents' group . Sandy Hook Promise opened up to help families who lost children, and to . campaign against gun violence. The parents often talk about their struggle to break through the . feeling of helplessness. Parent Together, an effort Sandy Hook Promise . began in November, works to show people, regardless of their politics, . that gun violence can be prevented. 'Nobody's pro gun violence. So, it's not like there's two sides to this,' Mark Barden, who lost his son Daniel, said. 'If . we can save another family from going through what we are going . through, then I can feel good about that for the rest of my life,' he . added. Residents have asked the media to stay away as they mark a year since the attack. Terrified: As Adam Lanza carried out his attack, Kaitlin and her class huddled in silence, listening to the gunfire and pleas for help . Traumatic: For days after the shooting Kaitlin says she was in a daze as she tried to come to terms with what happened . First Selectman Pat Llodra said on Monday: 'We . can't choose to not have this horrible thing happen to us. It happened. We cannot make it un-happen ... But we can choose how we . react to it.' 'We . don't need to be reminded. We don't need to relive it. We live it every . day. We carry it with us,' she added. The families of victims have created a website, Mysandyhookfamily.org, to honor their loved ones. The website is intended to create a 'singular place of sharing, communication, and contact with the families of those who lost their lives that day.'","Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis has taken nearly a year off from teaching after gunman Adam Lanza shot 20 children .

"Authorities in Iran have arrested a spy working for MI6, according to media reports in the country. The man was arrested in the city of Kerman in the south-east of the country after authorities spent months tracking him down, the ISNA news agency said. A Kerman judiciary official, who was not named, said the suspect had exchanged information with four British intelligence operatives on 11 occasions. Captured: The agent, who took months to track down, was arrested in the south-eastern city of Kerman . The man  has not been identified but the report said he is currently standing trial and has confessed. Iran regularly claims to have captured foreign agents but they are usually released without charge months later. The British Embassy in Tehran was closed in late 2011 after hardliners overran the building. Headquarters: The suspect is said to have been working on behalf of British intelligence service MI6 . The news comes as Iran and Britain begin attempting to re-establish diplomatic relations after the country's envoy made his first visit to London this week. The visit followed a temporary deal on Iran's nuclear programme. Iran last month agreed to curb some of its nuclear activities in return for £4.3bn relief from economic sanctions, after days of talks in Geneva. Earlier this week it was revealed that Robert Levinson, an American who was kidnapped in Iran nearly seven years ago and kept as a hostage, was working for the CIA on an off-the-books intelligence operation when he disappeared.","Suspect accused of exchanging information with intelligence operatives .

"Justice: Victor Nealon says he is considering suing the police after being given a life sentence in January 1997 for an attempted rape he did not commit . A postman who spent 17 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of attempted rape says he is a 'greater person' for his miscarriage of justice. Victor Nealon, 53, says he 'wants justice' and is considering suing the police after being given a life sentence in January 1997 for the attempted rape of a 22-year-old woman. But despite spending almost a third of his life behind bars for a crime he didn’t commit, Mr Nealon says he has no bitterness towards the prison system, and insists the experience was a positive one. Mr Nealon, from Redditch in Worcestershire, was finally freed from HMP Wakefield on December 13 after DNA evidence from the woman's blouse was examined, which revealed another unknown man was the perpetrator. He maintained his innocence throughout his spell in prison, even though it meant serving the full life sentence instead of pleading guilty and being released after serving half. Mr Nealon believes his original defence team were 'incompetent' and says that while on trial he came close to confessing as it appeared the only way to get a lighter sentence. He said: 'The police never had any evidence against me but my legal team in the trial were incompetent but I wasn't to know that at the time. I had never been at a trial before.' Mr Nealon added: 'The evidence has always been freely visible. I have had 17 years of this so now it is time for justice… I want my life back.' On how he found prison to be a . positive experience, Mr Nealon said: 'Really I am a greater person for . this experience, all experiences are valuable. Like Nelson Mandela said . 'there is no easy walk to freedom''. He added: 'Now I have to be rational, the system is as it is and I have to be patient. I have missed out on a lot. I still think I am in my 30s because prison has its own time.' Speaking of potentially suing over his wrongful imprisonment, Mr Nealon said: 'I would like to think there is potential for civil action but I don't want to pre-empt what the outcome might be.' Wrong man: Victor Nealon spent 17 years at HMP Wakefield, but says he found the experience positive . Changes: Victor Nealon was 36-years-old (left) when he was wrongly imprisoned for attempted rape. He was finally released 17 years later, aged 53 (right) Back home: Victor Nealon says he came close to confessing to the crime, despite not committing it, as it appeared the only way to get a lighter sentence . He added: 'I have called for the police to re-open the investigation and I think the victim should as well… Surely the bigger interest is justice for the victim - she has never received any apology.' Although he believes HMP Wakefield 'did all they could under the circumstances', Mr Nealon says the only way he survived 17 years in prison was by studying the details of his case 'like an academic'. Describing his case as an 'escape from prison life', Mr Nealon says he had to remove himself from the facts and comb through the details as if they had happened to somebody else. But as appeal after appeal failed, Mr Nealon says he became increasingly cynical about his prospects of release 'as a self defence mechanism'. Grim: The former postman says he only survived his time at HMP Wakefield by studying the details of his case . Mr Nealon's hard work eventually paid off when he was given seven days' notice of an appeal hearing. Freedom: Mr Nealon says 17 years in prison made him a 'greater person' Although he didn’t have long to prepare, 17 years of research ensured Mr Nealon was able to present a strong case. He left HMP Wakefield within three hours of the verdict being made and was released with just £46 in his pocket and nowhere to stay. After sleeping in cheap B&Bs and friend's floors Mr Nealon was given temporary accommodation above the constituency office of Birmingham Yardley MP John Hemming, who is helping him adjust to life outside prison. Recalling his sudden release, Mr Nealon told how he was forced to adjust to the modern world. He said: 'I just felt lost when I got out, the prison gave me £46, a random amount I will never know how they got to…They also gave me a train ticket to where I wanted to go, which was Shrewsbury.' Mr Nealon was taken to Leeds train station by the prison's deputy governor, where he says the reality of his time away from the outside world really hit him. He says he was shocked by how many people were crowded into the train station and couldn’t believe the price of a payphone call had risen from 10p to 60p. Despite claiming to find anonymity among the crowds 'calming', Mr Nealon says he chose to celebrate Christmas alone as having his freedom was enough. He says his biggest regret is not having children, but has big plans for 2014 – including finding a place of his own and possibly even travelling the world. Mr Nealon says: 'One place I want to go is Egypt but it will be a long time until then'. For now, however, Mr Nealon is content to enjoy his freedom by focusing on the simple things in life. He says: ‘Even going out to get milk still seems novel to me.’","Victor Nealon spent a third of his life in prison for a crime he didn't commit .

"Eastern European migrants are being offered expert help to fraudulently milk the benefits system by an accountants agency run by a Bulgarian businessman, a Mail on Sunday undercover investigation has revealed. Our reporter, posing as a newly arrived Bulgarian migrant seeking to claim benefits, was filmed being illegally offered bogus documents to support her application by an ‘advice’ agency in North London yesterday. The news comes as work and benefit restrictions were relaxed by the Government on New Year’s Day for migrants from the EU’s two poorest nations, Bulgaria and Romania. Galia, left, and Nina at Premium Advice 4 U Ltd in Wood Green, North London speaking to our undercover reporter . Our investigator, Maria, a 25-year-old Bulgarian graduate living in London, told the company – Premium Advice 4 U (PA4U) in Wood Green – that she had been in this country for two months, working cash-in-hand as a cleaner without paying tax or National Insurance, but now wanted to see what benefits she could claim. Two women employees, Galia and Nina, spoke to her for around 45 minutes and much of their advice was legal and correct. But they also told her they could draw up bogus paperwork, falsely stating she had cleaned both their houses to back up a housing benefit claim. PA4U, wedged between a shop with a hand-painted sign reading ‘Houses cleared’ and an accountancy firm, charges £20 for an hour-long consultation and its quarter-page advert  in London-based Bulgarian-language newspaper, BG Ben, claims that it can help with ‘any type  of benefits’. The sole director of the company, which was registered in October last year, is 37-year-old Bulgarian Hristo Trifonov. He also runs a firm called Right Cleaners Limited, which changed its name from Safetrans Logistic Ltd in June last year and lists its activities as ‘freight transport by road’. Change: Romanian migrants arriving at Luton Airport on the first day since the lifting of travel restrictions . When The Mail on Sunday contacted the company, a man who called himself Ilian said he offered face-to-face consultations on benefits for £20, plus additional charges for extra services. These include a £50 ‘registration fee’, £20 for help applying for a National Insurance number, £60 to register as self-employed, and £60 to prepare a tax return. PA4U also claims to provide help and advice with bank accounts, opening a limited company, arranging car insurance, MoTs, and exchanging a Bulgarian driving licence for a UK version. There is no suggestion that any of these activities involve any improper activity. At yesterday’s consultation, the first woman, Galia, advised Maria that if she wanted to claim housing benefit she would need a National Insurance number. But, as a self-employed person, she . would have to submit work records and references along with her . application to prove her past income. Galia . even suggested she and her colleague Nina would be prepared to lie in . writing to benefits officers, stating that their own homes had been . cleaned by our reporter. The true cost of our open borders: The Mail on Sunday story last week . Galia explained that Maria would need ‘contracts with clients, references from clients. If you do not have them, we can help you. ‘We can give you references and if they [the authorities] call, they will call us to confirm.’ When Maria asked whether the arrangement was legal, Galia assured her it was. To apply for housing benefit from a local authority, claimants must fill in a 40-page form giving details of their income and outgoings, including rent. Crucially, for self-employed people who have not been in business long, they must provide a ‘summary of their trading records’ plus copies of invoices and payments. When approached by The Mail on Sunday last night, Mr Trifonov said: ‘We did not offer to prepare bogus documents to support a housing benefit application. ‘We suggested that if she needed help with references to apply for National insurance number, she could clean our houses and we can confirm that she has done so.’ Another firm in Wood Green, called Alex Developments Ltd, also gives advice about benefits, tax and National Insurance, but its staff did not suggest anything improper or illegal. When Maria asked Bulgarian-born director Stroumen Paounov, 48, about claiming the Jobseeker’s Allowance while working, he replied: ‘I wouldn’t advise it because you will get caught.’ He charged £40 for an hour’s consultation in which he explained how to claim housing benefit, register for National Insurance, and he also offered help filling out the forms at the same hourly rate. Immigration pressure group Migration Watch UK has warned that a total of 250,000 migrants from the two countries are likely to travel to Britain in the next five years, increasing pressure on the Health Service and schools. The Government has banned Romanians and Bulgarians from claiming out-of-work benefits for the next three months, but Migration Watch forecasts that in-work benefits such as housing benefit and tax credits for low-paid workers will lure many of Romanians and Bulgarians currently working in Spain and Italy, as British handouts are significantly more generous. Migration Watch’s figures claim that single migrants from Romania and Bulgaria can earn five times more in the UK than at home, a wage topped up by the UK’s generous tax credits system.","MoS reporter posing as newly arrived Bulgarian offered illegal papers .

"Chinese nationals have been banned from boarding Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space flights – in case they steal the rocket technology. Tycoons from China have been told they cannot be among the space tourists because of anti-espionage regulations in the US, from where the British firm’s first commercial flights are due to take off later this year. Ironically, the ban comes as Britain opens our doors to Chinese involvement in the nuclear and telecom industries and considers asking China to build the new high-speed rail network. Chinese nationals have been banned from boarding Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space flights . But because Virgin’s craft has a rocket engine, it is seen as potentially military technology by the US’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations. These rules, introduced in the Cold War, bar people from countries such as China, Iran and North Korea from having access to weapons technology. The restriction freezes out a huge market in China, where wealthy entrepreneurs are willing to pay the $250,000 (£151,000) ticket price for a space flight. Some 600 people worldwide have already put down deposits. ‘We have had calls from people in China but we have to tell them we can’t accept them if they only have a Chinese passport,’ said a Virgin Galactic salesman based in Hong Kong. ‘We advise them on how they can make themselves eligible for a space tour. For example, they can get another nationality’s passport or they can apply for a [US] Green Card.’ The maiden voyage is set to blast  off from New Mexico this year, with Branson and his children on board . Some have successfully applied for Hong Kong passports, the salesman said, as the former British colony is exempt from the ban. Virgin Galactic has been holding talks with US regulators to ask for an exception to the rules, which also stop it launching flights outside the US. The maiden voyage is set to blast  off from New Mexico in the second half of this year, with Branson and his children Holly and Sam on board.","Nationals banned from boarding Virgin Galactic space flights - in case they steal the rocket technology .

"The Omaha Police Officers Association in Nebraska has come under extreme criticism after it posted a video of an African American toddler uttering profanities to use as an example of ‘the thug cycle’. The diapered child is seen in a phone camera video taken by two purported relatives who are swearing at each other and the child and teaching him to swear back. '... despite the fact that it is sickening, heartbreaking footage, we have an obligation to share it to continue to educate the law abiding public about the terrible cycle of violence and thuggery that some young innocent children find themselves helplessly trapped in,’ said the post on their website. Scroll down for video . 'Thug cycle': A video of a toddler was posted by the Omaha police union as an example of city violence, which has angered some people who say nothing illegal is happening in the video . Facebook comments: People react to the video post from the self-proclaimed uncle of the toddler . Union President John Wells defended their decision to post the video saying 'a lot of these children end up dealing with law enforcement' The website states: ‘Now while we . didn't see anything in this video that is blatantly 'illegal', we sure . did see a lot that is flat out immoral and completely unhealthy for this . little child from a healthy upbringing standpoint.’ The . post tells the public that they are ‘literally watching “the cycle” of . violence continue right in front of your eyes. A powerful cycle that . must be broken if we ever hope to get a handle on violence in Omaha. A . powerful cycle that the police alone cannot stop.’ The . so-called ‘thug’ who posted the video of the toddler has lashed back in . a comment on the police association’s Facebook page, which has not done . him any favours as it's laced with f-word bombs. Union President John Wells, who is a sergeant in the Omaha Police Department, told Gawker that they use the term ‘thug’ as a ‘general term on our Facebook page’, but that it could be substituted by a variety of other terms including ‘abnormal, antisocial, criminal’. However, many people have taken to social media to criticize the move. One user, Joshua David, said on the union's Facebook page: 'As a union employee and member, I'm ashamed that this post exists. Not because of the video, but because of the racism. But hey, at least he'll learn early that he's nothing but an n-word to society.' Defending their action of posting the . video of the toddler and likening it to violence, Wells said that 'a lot of . these children end up dealing with law enforcement'. WARNING: Video contains graphic content . Taught bad things: The child is seen sticking up his middle finger, right, and in the left photo is covering his face as his relatives call him various profanities . ‘[But] I'm not saying that this kid won't grow up to be a productive member of society.’The . post called the video's creator, who is reportedly the toddler's uncle, . a ‘local thug’, but Wells said: ‘I don't know that he's a gangbanger... he mentions 29th Street, which is a local Bloods gang here’. He . told Gawker.com that his association is different to the police . department, which is why they have ‘a lot more latitude to be a little . more edgy’ and that edginess is necessary to force a deeper conversation . on the city's crime problems.

"A new book about business mogul Sir Richard Branson claims his bold plans for a space tourism company are in danger of turning into an expensive 'white elephant'. Branson Behind The Mask, by Tom Bower, claims Virgin Galactic hasn't got a powerful enough rocket to take customers into space and no licence from American aviation chiefs to do so, despite the billionaire's confident claims that flights will begin in Autumn. 'Virgin Galactic is in danger of turning into a white elephant,' he told the Sunday Times. He added that Branson had so far only managed to 'fire a primitive rocket for 20 seconds in the Earth's atmosphere'. Scroll down for video . Failure to launch: Sir Richard Branson's bold plans for space tourism may be floundering, according to a new book . During a test flight in California, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo reached a top speed of Mach 1.4. But the author says more needs to be done to get tourists into orbit . So far Virgin Galactic has accepted more than £42million in deposits from approximately 580 individuals, according to its website. It has also applied for a licence from the US Federal Aviation Administration. The news comes as it emerged that Chinese nationals have been banned from boarding Branson’s space flights – in case they steal the rocket technology. Tycoons from China have been told they cannot be among the space tourists because of anti-espionage regulations in the US, from where the British firm’s first commercial flights are due to take off later this year.

A spokesman for Branson said Virgin Galactic had made good progress, adding: 'Our scheduling has always been predicated on doing it the right way, not the fast way.'

"Drugs death: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, of Croydon, south London, died on Monday afternoon after allegedly taking ecstasy at an illegal rave in Hayes . The grieving mother of a teenage ecstasy victim told yesterday of the heartbreaking final promise he made to her. Daniel Spargo-Mabbs told his devoted Christian parents he was going to a party after school and assured his anxious mother as he left: ‘I love you, Mum. I promise I won’t die.’ They were the last words he ever said to her. The next time his parents saw him he was in intensive care after taking ecstasy for the first time at an illegal rave. The 16-year-old had suffered a massive heart attack and died two days later. Today police said two men, Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, of Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, of Beckenham, have been charged with supplying Class A drugs. The charges came as the schoolboy’s devastated parents spoke of their grief at his death from the class A drug which claims 31 lives a year. His Oxford-educated mother Fiona, 46, who works as a manager in adult education at Croydon Council, said Daniel had never taken drugs before and had been lectured by his parents and school about the scourge of ecstasy. On Friday night the bright student, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England School in Croydon, which is known for its high academic standards, persuaded his mother to let him go to a party in Clapham, south London, saying: ‘Come on, Mum, I hardly ever go to parties and I am sensible and responsible.’ But instead of the party he went to an illegal rave on an industrial estate in Hayes, west London. Final words: The schoolboy, pictured left, told his mother, pictured right, 'I love you, I promise I won't die' as he left home on Friday night - just hours before he was taken to hospital suffering from a drugs overdose . In a warehouse, owned . by a commercial cleaning firm and said to be packed with 3,000 . revellers, his parents believe he experimented with ecstasy for the . first time. Shortly . afterwards the youngster collapsed and was taken to hospital. His . reaction to the drug sent his temperature rocketing to 42C (107.6F), . causing a massive heart attack. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs recalled yesterday how she had kissed her son goodbye for the last time hours before he took the substance. ‘A . few years ago I heard a talk by murder victim Jimmy Mizen’s mum and she . said that something that comforted her was that she had told Jimmy she . loved him and had given him a hug and a kiss before he had left the . house,’ she said. Aid: Daniel was taken to hospital on Saturday believed to be suffering from the effects of a drugs overdose . ‘After that I always did the same . with my boys and it became an in-joke. Danny always used to say “I love . you too, Mum. I promise I won’t die.” ‘And that’s exactly what he said when he went out on Friday. He didn’t keep that promise.’ Speaking . at the family’s home in Croydon, south London, which she shares with . her husband Tim, 50, and son Jacob, 18, she added: ‘I  woke up early on . Saturday morning and when I saw he wasn’t back I started to worry. ‘Then at about 5.30am there was a knock on the door. It was the police. It was completely my worst nightmare coming true.’ The . family rushed to Hillingdon Hospital where Daniel was in intensive . care. He was transferred to a specialist liver unit at King’s College . Hospital for emergency surgery but he died on Monday. Place of education: Daniel was a pupil at Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School in Croydon . Yesterday . Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said her son, who was studying for his AS levels . having achieved a number of A* and A grades in GCSE exams last year, had . ambitions to join the Army or become an English teacher. 'We grieve together': Daniel was praised by his headteacher as a 'bright, articulate and talented' boy . The keen sportsman and musician was described as ‘hugely popular’ with his peers. A . committed Christian, Daniel ran errands for pensioners as part of his . local paper round and helped to run a children’s group at Emmanuel . Church in Croydon, where his father sometimes leads services. The schoolboy, who had a long-term girlfriend, was due to start the Alpha course, an evangelical teaching scheme, this week. Although . he had ‘an adventurous spirit’, Mrs Spargo-Mabbs insisted: ‘Daniel had . never taken drugs before. It is not the kind of thing he did. ‘I want people to know that’s not who he is.

Deaths involving ecstasy have increased almost four-fold in recent years. In 2012 there were 31 deaths linked to the class A drug, up from eight in 2010. There was also a large increase in the number of death certificates mentioning PMA or PMMA, strong psychedelic stimulants usually found in ecstasy pills. The substances, which can cause severe overheating of the body, were linked to only one death in 2011, but in 2012 they were involved in 20 fatalities. Campaigners believe many people may be ingesting PMA or PMMA in the belief they are taking ecstasy tablets. According to government estimates, around 2.8million Britons have tried ecstasy at least once and 179,000 people take it at least once a month. It is usually sold as tablets but the powder form, MDMA, has become more common. ‘This . was the first time he’d taken anything and if it could happen to him it . could happen to anyone.’ Yesterday Daniel’s tearful grandmother, . Sheila, said she hoped the people who gave him the drugs would be . punished. ‘It was the first . time Daniel had ever been to something like this, and I would guess the . first time he’d ever taken anything like that,’ she said. ‘Daniel was with friends but not his usual friends, as I understand it. I suppose he just wanted to be one of the boys. ‘He . was hardworking at school and very sensible, which is why I’m so . shocked at what’s happened. 'He’s the last person I’d expect this to . happen to, he wasn’t in with a bad sort of crowd. ‘I just hope they string up  whoever it is that gave the drugs to him.’ Yesterday, . the youngster’s headmaster, Richard Parrish, wrote a letter to parents, . saying: ‘Our heart goes out to Daniel’s family, to his parents, to his . brother Jacob and to his closest friends. ‘To . them we want to say the same as we are saying to ourselves: that what . has happened to Daniel is not normal.

"With their intricate designs and delicate stitching, you could be forgiven for thinking these elaborate costumes are destined for ballet dancers or musicians. But these outfits are in fact specifically designed for bullfighters to wear in the ring before a charging 1,100-pound bull. Master tailor Fermin Lopez Fuentes founded his bullfighters' bespoke tailor shop in 1963 and it has made outfits for some of the best bullfighters in the business. The shop called Fermin, based in Madrid, Spain, is now run by the founder's brother Antonio with the help of an experienced team of tailors. Costumes, which take a team of tailors weeks to make, can cost anything from a couple of hundred of euros to many thousands. Fermin, as one of only six specialist tailors in Spain to make only bullfighting costumes, also makes many of the outfits for Spain's famous San Fermin festival which sees the country's best matadors show off their skills every July.

"Urine, feces and pools vomit everywhere: that's what a family in Buffalo, New York, found all over their house when they returned home from a vacation in Costa Rica last month - and they can thank teenagers from some of the areas most elite schools. It turns out that the 17-year-old girl the family had hired to watch their cats threw a party at Binder's house and invited teens from all over the Buffalo area to partake in destroying the home the family has spent 20 years fixing up. When Binder asked the teen's parents to pay for the damages, they offered him $90, which wouldn't even begin to cover the thousands of dollars worth of damage done to the house, the jewelry that was stolen, or the $6,000 in cash that was taken from the house. Destroyed: Teens did thousands of dollars of damage to the home of Steven Binder and his wife, Kristen Segebarth . When Binder and his family walked in the door, they found the mother of the cat-sitter standing in their foyer next to a vacuum cleaner. She explained that there was a problem with one of the beds and that she had taken the liberty of taking a comforter and two rugs to a professional cleaner. But Binder - still confused as to why there was thousands of dollars in damage to his home, as well as urine and vomit everywhere - wanted to know what caused all of the damage. 'What the hell happened?' he asked the girl's mother. What had happened was that the 17-year-old cat-sitter, who the family describes as a 'trusted friend' of their daughter, invited roughly 50 teenagers from many of the area's elite private schools - with names like City Honors School, Nardin Academy, St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute - and they destroyed the house. As if the urine feces and vomit wasn't bad enough, Binder tells the Buffalo News that he also found used condoms scattered throughout the house. As if the damage wasn't bad enough, video of the teens destroying the house started popping up on social media websites. Gross: The homeowners found urine, feces and vomit all over their house . In one of the videos, a male was seen urinating on 18-year-old Zoey Binder's bed - as another teen is narrating, saying 'this is for you.' 'The destruction to our house is considerable. There was human feces, urine and vomit in numerous locations. Every floor in the house was rifled. There was broken furniture and there were multiple used condoms,” Binder told the paper, as he and his wife explained that it wasn't until last week that the stench from the December 27 party was finally gone. 'It took an industrial strength cleaning to get rid of the odors of urine and vomit, and we keep discovering more,' Binder said. 'I don’t know that I won’t open a box in my attic at some point and discover more vomit. There was vomit everywhere.' According to Binder, the cats the 17-year-old was supposed to be watching were so traumatized by what went on during the party 'that they did not come out of their hiding places until two days after we had come home.' Authorities have been given a list of the names of at least 46 people who were at the party as they begin to investigate the role the cat-sitter played in throwing the party. Authorities say that twenty-five of the teens involved in destroying the house attended City Honors, seven were from . Nardin Academy, six from Canisius High School, four from St. Joseph’s . Collegiate Institute - which charges fees of $10,000 a year - three from a Williamsville high school and one was . an exchange student. Elite: The majority of teens who destroyed the home went to elite private schools like St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute . The identity of the 17-year-old cat-sitter has not been made public. In addition to the video of a teenager urinating on Zoey Binder's bed, authorities found other social media entries they believe are in reference to the party: . 'If I didn’t die last night, I’m probably living forever.' 'I am DISGUSTED by every aspect of this night.' 'Never realized that I go to school with such horny people.' 'Roll another bowl.' Binder says he and his wife met with the parents of the cat-sitter. He says they asked them to reimburse the $8,500 they spent on their vacation as partial restitution for the damage done to their home. The girls' parents, however, gave them a check for $90 - the amount they'd paid the girl to watch their cats. If no criminal charges are filed, Binder will likely sue the parents of the cat-sitter in civil court.","Steven Binder says the teens also stole thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and $6,000 in cash .

"Fruit in Europe may no longer come with sticky labels, now that the European Union has approved the use of iron oxides and hydroxides, hydroxypropyl, methyl cellulose and polysorbates  on the skins of fruit. Using these chemicals creates contrast to allow the laser markings to stand out more clearly, and prevent the laser from penetrating the skin of the fruit. A Spanish company developed the laser system, which can brand up to 54,000 pieces of fruit in an hour. Fruit gets inked: Spanish company Laser Food has developed a method of branding fruits with a laser to replace the small stickers currently in use . The company, Laser Food, developed the technology in 2009 and has been in talks with the EU to obtain approval ever since. A significant stumbling block has been removed now that the EU has approved the use of iron oxides and hydroxides and other chemicals on fruits. The laser markings will contain information such as logos and place of origin and, according to trade magazine The Grocer, bar codes which could be scanned to access further information about the produce and QR codes that can be scanned with smartphones. Details: The laser system can be used to inscribe brands and other information onto fruit such as melons, citrus and pomegranates . Chemical romance: The EU has approved the use of some chemicals in labeling fruit, but so far only fruits that are usually peeled such as citrus . Producers will know where their produce is being sold, and consumers will know the exact provenance of their fruit. Jaime Sanfelix, managing director of Laser Food told The Grocer, 'Consumers will have absolute certainty the product they are buying is fully guaranteed.' Outdated: On the left, kiwifruit with the commonly-used stickers, and right, kiwi branded with lasers by Spanish company Laser Food . According to the ruling, the technology will be used on fruits which are usually peeled and the skin discarded: . '[The chemicals] are to be used in small quantities and only on the external part of fruit and are not expected to migrate significantly into the internal part. For that reason, the treatment of fruit of which the peels are not commonly consumed is not liable to have an effect on human health. It is therefore appropriate only to allow...for marking of citrus fruit, melons and pomegranates...' says the report. The report also notes that the new technology will save on environmental costs of paper and glue needed for sticky labels. The system will open up marketing opportunities for retailers too, who will be able to brand fruit with various motifs and logos.","The EU has approved the use of certain chemicals, enabling producers to brand fruit with lasers .

"Hwang Kum-ja, a former 'comfort woman' forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II, died at age 90. The total number of living South Korean victims of the practice during Japan's colonial rule of Korea is now 55. Her death comes as the head of Japan's public broadcaster expressed regret on Monday for his comments on the use of military brothels in World War Two. An estimated 200,000 women served as comfort women during Japan's colonial period over Korea, like the women in this photo . Momii gave a press conference over . the weekend where he claimed military brothels occurred at the time in . all countries at war. He acknowledged, however, that the practice was . bad 'by today's morals'. Political parties in South Korea, the country most indignant about the wartime practice, demanded Momii's resignation. Momii, . a former vice president at one of Japan's largest trading houses, . claimed that his weekend comments on the 'comfort women' were his . personal views and he shouldn't have mentioned them. 'Even . as a personal opinion I shouldn't have said it. It was extremely . inappropriate,' he said according to the Mainichi Shimbun daily. 'I had . never been (speaking) in such a place before, it is my fault for not . grasping the rules.' It comes as Hwang's death prompted fresh scrutiny over Japan's failure to offer any compensation to 'comfort women'. Hwang was born in 1924, forced into a glass factory at age 13 and later sent to China for sexual slavery at 16, according to Yonhap. After the war, she returned to Korea and lived alone for the rest of her life. In this photo taken on Saturday, Jan. 25, 2014, Katsuto Momii, new president of public broadcaster NHK, holds a news conference at the start of his three-year term in Tokyo. Japan's top government spokesman Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga defended Momii for his remarks that the use of women as military prostitutes was common worldwide during World War II . Hwang earned money by collecting garbage and receiving various government subsidies, Yonhap reported. However, the news agency notes that she made three donations to a scholarship fund that totaled US$92,635. She received an award for her generosity in 2011. Hwang's dying wish as that her remaining money be left to charity, it said. An estimated 200,000 women, mainly Korean, were forced into sexual slavery during Japan's colonial rule, Yonhap said. Most surviving victims are over 80 years old. Though Japan has apologized on several occasions for the comfort women and helped to establish to the Asian Women's Fund in 1995, it has so far not made direct payments to victims, CNN reported. The channel adds that in 2013, the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, caused controversy for saying use of comfort women was 'necessary' for soldiers who needed a 'rest.' South Korea, Yonhap reports, has urged Japan to offer grievances to victims, since many are elderly and may die before they can receive compensation. Japan has claimed that compensations were resolved in a 1965 package.","Hwang Kum-ja was forced into sexual slavery at 16 .

"A woman who has been on the run for 37 years after escaping a Michigan prison has been arrested in San Diego. Judy Lynn Hayman, 60, is being held without bail after police arrested her at a San Diego apartment on Tuesday. The escaped prisoner had changed her identity several times and even managed to keep her fugitive past a secret from her 32-year-old son, police say. Scroll down for video . Fugitive: Judy Lynn Hayman, seen here in her prison mug shot from 1976, has been on the run for 37 years . After pleading guilty to larceny in June 1976, Hayman was sent to the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Wayne County, Michigan. She was 10 months into that sentence when she managed to escape in April 1977, at the age of 23, according to prison officials. When police finally caught up with her on Tuesday she claimed to be called Jamie Lewis, and had the documents to prove it. Her son, who had been visiting at the time of the arrest, seemed 'quite surprised' by the revelations about his mother, Fox 5 reported. Acting on a tip from the Michigan Department of Corrections, San Diego officers went to her apartment on Monday afternoon. Hide out: Hayman, 60, was arrested at this gated community in San Diego . She identified herself as Jamie Lewis and produced government documents with the name, San Diego police Lt. Kevin Mayer said. But officers remained suspicious because of inconsistencies in her story and her resemblance to the old Michigan mug shot they were holding. 'Her eyes gave her away,' Mayer said. 'The eyes in the picture matched the eyes of this woman.' The officers took her to a police station, where she eventually acknowledged being Hayman. Since her escape, Hayman had gone under several aliases including Brenda Bushmer, Judy Kayman and Judy Singleton, according to the Department of Corrections. The 60-year-old later admitted, during questioning, that she was Judy Lynn Hayman, NBC7 reported. Escape: Hayman was serving a sentence for larceny when she ran away from this Huron Valley prison in 1977 . It is not known how long she had been living at the Balboa Park address, but neighbors claimed she had been in the gated community for several years. Maria Lopez told UT San Diego that Hayman kept to herself but would occasionally make conversation, and Arnecia Benton, whose sister lives in the same complex, said Hayman had told her she was from Detroit. Hayman is being held without bail and is awaiting extradition to Michigan. It was not yet clear what evidence led investigators to the location of Hayman, who was about halfway through her sentence when she walked away from a correctional facility 36 miles from Detroit. Mayer said he was wowed by the investigators' ability to 'put some dots together' and provide San Diego officers with the right address after nearly four decades. 'I commend them for their tenacity,' he said. 'This is a very old case.'","Judy Lynn Hayman has used several aliases since escaping prison in 1977 .

"The three prime suspects in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann had worked at the resort where she vanished, it was claimed yesterday. Details of the men’s alleged links to the Ocean Club resort in the Algarve were revealed in Portuguese newspapers with close contacts with local police. They emerged two days after Portuguese police had a high-level meeting with a visiting Scotland Yard delegation. The revelations come amid growing optimism at New Scotland Yard that detectives are on the brink of a major breakthrough in the case. Scroll down for video . Investigation: British police officers arrive in downtown Faro, Portugal, carrying documents believed to be related to three men who may be connected with the disappearance of toddler Madeline McCann in 2007 . Abducted: Madeleine McCann was three when she vanished from her parents' apartment in Praia da Luz . Breakthrough: British officers met for three hours with Portuguese counterparts about new leads . Investigation: The officers met police in the city of Faro, whose jurisdiction includes the town of Praia de Luz . Wearing sunglasses and carrying suitcases full of documents, the officers arrived in Portugal on Monday . At the meeting, Met detectives . reportedly requested bank details of the men, who are thought to have . carried out a series of break-ins at the resort in the run-up to . Maddie’s disappearance. They are also said to have asked local officers to quiz the unnamed trio and search their homes. Although . local media reported the men had been employed at the Ocean Club . complex in Praia da Luz, it was not clear whether they were working . there at the time Maddie  went missing in May 2007. Nor was it clear whether they were directly employed by the company Mark Warner, which runs the resort, or through a contractor. The . latest twist in the investigation came weeks after the Mail exclusively . revealed Scotland Yard had identified three burglars as prime suspects. One theory is that the burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up. Chat: The four officers, pictured, are pushing closer to being able to arrest three 'prime suspects' Detectives: The officers had a morning meeting in Portugal before heading for lunch . Time for new leads: Analysis of mobile phone data suggests three burglars were 'very close' to the holiday flat when the three-year-old girl vanished. Pictured: The Scotland Yard detectives .

Portuguese . police chiefs confirmed a three-hour meeting between the Policia . Judiciaria, which is investigating the case, and a Met team led by . Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood had taken place on Tuesday – but . refused to say what had been discussed. Local . newspaper Correio da Manha reported: ‘The British want Portuguese . authorities to interrogate and search the homes of three former Ocean . Club employees. They also requested access to the bank accounts of the . three suspects to see if there were any large deposits made after the . child disappeared.’ The . Ocean Club had about 130 Portuguese employees and 30 British when . Madeleine vanished. All the Britons are thought to have left. Anguish: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry with an image of how she may have looked in 2012 .

Yard wanted to question three suspects but described reports that . arrests were imminent as ‘improbable’. Progress . in the probe has been thwarted by the Portuguese authorities’ reluctance to agree to a formal joint investigation. And, as none of the . burglars is British, the Met does not have jurisdiction to arrest them . in Portugal.

"The Environment Agency was accused last night of putting wildlife before people after it emerged that work to flood defences on the main rail line into Cornwall was delayed so a bird survey could be completed.

"Empty: Chris Evans may be forced to sell his historic pub to villagers who are angry it has been 'left to rot' Chris Evans may be forced to sell his historic pub to villagers who are angry it has been ‘left to rot’. The BBC’s One Show host and Radio 2 DJ closed down the 15th century Lickfold Inn gastro pub after it struggled to make a profit in 2010. And after three years without finding a buyer, the Grade II-listed building has now fallen into disrepair – recently being flooded during the heavy rain. But parishioners living in the West Sussex village have now had the building placed on the ‘community right to bid’ register meaning they have six weeks to raise the cash to buy it. People living in Lickfold argued that apart from being an eyesore, they have no other meeting place and it has impacted on their social life as a community. They are now looking for investors and the Mail understands one resident who lives nearby is interested in restoring it to run as a pub. The inn, bought by Evans for £1 million in 2008, hosted his ex-wife Billie Piper’s wedding reception when she married Laurence Fox the previous year. However, it now looks shabby with windows boarded up and a metal fence surrounding it. Local authority historic building inspectors found damage to the roof, grass growing out of the gutters and broken windows. The professional kitchen is believed to have been removed shortly after it was closed down and the property has not been lived in since. The pub has been on the market for as low as £825,000, but currently has a ‘to let’ sign hung on its wall. As the owner, Evans, 47, has a duty to repair the damages and maintain the building because of its listed status. Lodsworth Parish Council chairman Caroline Neville said she was relieved the village now had a chance to re-open their pub. The pub has been on the market for as low as £825,000, but currently has a 'to let' sign hung on its wall. She added: ‘We’re desperately trying to get the money together now and find people who would like to help. It’s not been heated and with all the bad weather it’s been left to rot. ‘This latest ruling allowing us to be on the community right to bid register demonstrates actually how important the pub is to the community. The local people who live here really mean it when they say they want to buy it and this not just a game.’ Resident Maria Dimond said: ‘With all the recent bad weather and power cuts, it highlights that rural communities need a village focal point. ‘If Mr Evans lived in Lickfold, I feel sure he would be fighting with us to get the pub open again. The Lickfold Inn until relatively recently was a beautiful, very popular, historic English country pub, with a character and warmth that made you feel welcome. We and the local community would like it back!’ Evans blamed the effect of the credit crunch when he closed down the pub in 2010, confessing: ‘We have had some great times there but also some less good.’ His company Evans Pubs also owns the Mulberry Inn, Surrey, and the Newbridge Inn at Tredunnock, Monmouthshire. Evans, who is worth £50million, lives in Berkshire, with his third wife Natasha Shishmanian, 34, sons Noah, four, and Eli, one. It was revealed his Radio 2 breakfast show pulled in a record 9.85million listeners during the last three months. A Chichester District Council spokesman said: ‘A team including the council’s historic buildings advisor and an officer from the South Downs National Park recently visited The Lickfold Inn. ‘The council will continue to monitor the building and it will stay on our Heritage at Risk register at it is vacant and in a vulnerable location. Some small repairs to the windows, guttering and roof are to be carried out by the owner.’ A spokesman for Chris Evans declined to comment.","The Grade II-listed Lickfold Inn, in West Sussex, has fallen into disrepair .

The first ‘environmental’ speed limit is set to be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 – for seven days a week, from 7am to 7pm . The limit will be in place for several years, and any driver caught breaking it faces a hefty fine and penalty points on their licence. 'Green' scheme: A 60mph speed limit will be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 (pictured). It will be enforced from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, Yorkshire . The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway, and is ‘not ruled out’ on up to a dozen major routes. A busy stretch of the M3 near London is among those currently being assessed for anti-pollution measures. Motoring groups said it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty. And the restricted route will still be subject to variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing during congested periods, leading to regular caps of 50mph or 40mph. Traffic build-up: The M1 (pictured), which runs from London to Leeds, is one of the country's busiest motorways . The Highways Agency admitted it will be the first time a motorway speed limit has been cut on environmental rather than safety grounds, but insisted the plan was backed by ministers. The limit will be enforced on the M1 from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Motorists will be able to drive at the standard 70mph on the rest of the M1, which runs from London to Leeds. Criticism: AA President Edmund King has slammed the scheme - saying it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty . The restriction will apply from 7am to 7pm seven days a week and be enforced by speed cameras and police patrols. The route is part of a  £400million ‘smart’ motorway scheme, under which technology is used to manage traffic flow and the hard shoulder can be used to ease congestion. It passes Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield – and also includes nine so-called Air Quality Management Areas described as ‘pockets of poor air’. Although the Highways Agency said the lower speed limit will be in place until pollution dropped to acceptable levels, it admitted the 60mph restriction was likely to remain for several years. It said a lower speed limit was needed to ensure new EU guidelines on air quality, which come into force this year, will be met. Whitehall sources said last night that ‘a handful’ of other smart motorway schemes currently in the pipeline could have ‘green’ maximum speed limits imposed to meet air quality targets and avoid Brussels fines. A section of the M3 from J2-4a near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment to see if measures will be needed to cut pollution levels. Motoring groups reacted angrily to the plan, and warned of an alarming precedent and that wider use of the lower limit would have an impact on businesses. AA President Edmund King said: ‘Billions spent on railways to speed up thousands of journeys while hundreds of millions spent on the M1 to slow down hundreds of thousands is an irony that won’t be lost on drivers. Assessment: The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway. A section of the M3 (pictured) near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment . ‘Smart motorways were intended to ease congestion and improve journey time reliability through use of the hard shoulder. ‘And here we have a scheme which costs around £400million to simply slow traffic down to 60mph with associated enforcement. Clearly we cannot have such a speed reduction when the M1 is empty.’ RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘Worryingly, this could pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway. While preserving air quality is obviously a paramount concern there will inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility.’ A Highways Agency consultation on the plan began yesterday and will close on March 3.","Speed limit will be cut from 70mph to 60mph to meet EU pollution targets .

"The National Security Agency has been accused of using Google cookies to pinpoint targets the government wants to hack. In a NSA presentation slide released by Edward Snowden and seen by the Washington Post, the agency appeared to be using internet tracking techniques usually used by advertisers. While the Pref Cookies reportedly being used don't reveal personal information, they can uniquely identify a person's browser. Leak: The NSA slide is the latest agency information allegedly released by Edward Snowden . The NSA and GCHQ in the UK have been using the tracking files to identify potential targets who are using the internet, according to the documents. As well as listing visits to websites, the cookies can identify an individual's communications so that hacking software can be sent out. The slide seen by the Washington Post showed the tracking devices 'enable remote exploitation' though how this has been used against targets was not revealed. While cookies could help the NSA track an individual it cannot be used to help the agency sort through vast amounts of information. It works only if someone has already been identified as a target. Another slide suggested that the NSA was also collecting location data from by mobile apps in program  code-named HAPPYFOOT. Tracking: Cookies created by Google and other browsers identify web users for advertising . The information is said to help the NSA map internet addresses to physical locations more . precisely than with geolocation . services. 'This shows a link between the sort of . tracking that's done by websites for analytics and advertising and NSA . exploitation activities,' Ed Felten, a computer scientist at . Princeton, said. Cookies are small files that identify internet users for ad targeting and other uses. Tools to opt out or block cookies have limited reach. A unique Pref Cookie is created by Google whenever someone connects to one of its services, such as Maps. The Pref Cookie code lets Google send tailored adverts to the user. The NSA slide suggests the agency has been using the unique code to gain access to potential targets. 'By allowing themselves to be tracked for analytic . or advertising at least some users are making themselves more . vulnerable to exploitation,' he added. Since June, newspapers across the world . have revealed the scope of government spying by publishing classified . documents leaked by Snowden, a former NSA contract analyst. While the latest slide suggested the NSA used the devices, it did not explain how the agency got hold of Pref Cookies or whether Google cooperated with sharing the data.

Access: The slide from Snowden suggests cookies could be used to allow spy agencies to use hacking software on a target . Google also declined to comment, buts its chief executive, Larry Page, has called for limits on court-approved surveillance requests. 'The security of users' data is critical, which . is why we've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency . around government requests for information,' Mr Page said.

"With its grandiose architecture, 10ft tall chandeliers and ornate plasterwork this former movie theater was once a symbol of Detroit's growing wealth, without peers within the city for its elegance and grandness. But the once glorious and now decrepit Michigan Building currently stands a shadow of its former self - saved only from the wrecking ball after it was turned into a car park. The theater, with its French Renaissance-style decor, was developed on the site of Henry Ford's first automobile workshop in 1925 at a cost of about $3.5million - roughly $46million today. Grand: The once glorious and now decrepit Michigan Building currently stands a shadow of its former self - it was built as a 4,000-capacity movie theater but is now used as a car park and includes office and retail space . Former glories: The theater, with its French Renaissance-style decor, was developed on the site of Henry Ford's first automobile workshop in 1925 at a cost of about $3.5million - roughly $46million today . Downfall: In a tragic twist of irony, one of the reasons the movie theater eventually closed down in the 1970s was due to its lack of car parking . But in a tragic twist of irony, one of the reasons the movie theater eventually closed down in the 1970s was due to its lack of car parking, according to odditycentral.com. Shortly after the opening of the theater, which could accommodate more than 4,000 people, its owner John H Kunsky said: 'It is not merely a theater for Detroit. It is a theater for the whole world. It is designed to be the greatest showplace of the Middle West.' However, the 1,000 sq ft theater's fortunes mirrored the decline in industry in the once mighty Motor City. It was forced to branch out and started hosting ice hockey games, as well as concerts by the likes of David Bowie and Aerosmith. It was eventually closed and partially demolished in 1976, but plans to completely tear it down had to be stopped due to the structural damage it would have caused adjoining buildings. So a year after it shut it was converted into a car park by the local authorities. Then and now: The interior of the Michigan Building (left), as pictured in 1927, and how it looks now (right), a shadow of its former self after being turned into a car park . Opening: The site was described as 'a theater for the whole world' by its owner John H Kunsky following its opening. He said it was 'designed to be the greatest showplace of the Middle West' Industrial decline: However, the 1,000 sq ft theater's fortunes mirrored the decline in industry in the once mighty Motor City . According to Huffington Post Detroit, the 13-floor site, which also contains an office building and first floor retail space, was up for sale for $3million in December. The bankrupt city has fallen on increasingly hard times recently, but last week it presented its first full road map for recovery, outlining an elaborate plan to restructure $18 billion in debt, demolish thousands of blighted homes and invest in the broken-down infrastructure that has made the city a symbol of urban decay. And the mayor Mike Duggan yesterday said that the 'strategic demolition' of some fire-damaged vacant homes was to begin within 30 days. Diversity: The theater was forced to branch out and started hosting ice hockey games, as well as concerts by the likes of David Bowie and Aerosmith . Demolition: The building was closed and partially demolished in 1976, but plans to completely tear it down had to be stopped due to the structural damage it would have caused adjoining buildings . The announcement came at the start of Duggan's first State of the City address and the first such speech since Detroit was allowed to enter bankruptcy. He said his administration and the City Council are both working to improve the city. 'The change has started and the change in Detroit is real,' he said. Duggan said the demolition will be paid for using $20 million in an unused escrow fund earmarked for burned houses. Detroit is going through the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, and Duggan's address came less than a week after state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr filed his plan to pay creditors while providing money for city services and improvements in the coming years. In Detroit's heyday it was the place where workers in a rising middle class flocked to factories to build the cars that changed America's way of life. Last year however it was forced to file for bankruptcy. There are roughly 700,000 people who now live there - less than half the 1.8million who used to call the city home during the 1950s. For decades, Detroit paid its bills by borrowing money while struggling to provide the most basic of services for its residents. The city is now getting a second chance in a federal bankruptcy court-led restructuring. Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, chose bankruptcy over diverting money from police, fire and other services to make debt payments. The move conserves cash so the city can operate, but it will hurt Detroit's image for years. It will also leave creditors with much less than they are owed and places in jeopardy the pension benefits of thousands of city retirees. While the city's auto industry decline is not the only reason for its troubles, the fall has certainly not helped. The city is littered with abandoned factories built in the postwar boom years, most of which have multiple stories. As the Japanese auto invasion began cutting into Detroit's sales, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford and hundreds of auto parts companies looked outside the city to build one-story plants that could handle modern assembly lines. With every downturn, more companies abandoned the city, leaving the hulking buildings to squatters. Detroit's tax base continued to erode. By the time the auto industry melted down in 2009, only a few factories from GM and Chrysler were left. GM is the only one with headquarters in Detroit, though it has huge research and testing centers with thousands of jobs outside the city.","The Michigan Building, in Detroit, was the city's most grandiose theater when it was built in 1925 .

"They have been known for decades as ‘Chelsea Tractors’ after the upmarket London borough in which their well-heeled 4X4 owners drive them. But now the title of ‘Chelsea Tractor’ capital of Britain has moved decidedly North - to oil-rich and rather royal Aberdeenshire in Scotland, toppling the trendy suburb from its claim to fame as the postcode with the most off-roaders. Chelsea’s SW3 post-code has traditionally topped Britain’s 4x4 league table - despite the fact that the rugged vehicles are more likely to be seen on the school-run or outside a trendy restaurant than ever actually venturing off-road into a muddy field. Her Majesty the Queen drives a Land Rover, a vehicle that has . been given the name 'Chelsea tractor' in recent years because of its . popularity with rich people in urban areas . But now having lost its crown to Scotland, it also has fewer than neighbouring Kensington and Knightsbridge. The relegation coincides with five years of soaring 4x4 sales that has seen annual registrations almost double across the country. Farmers are still the drivers most likely to own one but the list of top ten buyers is now dominated by property developers, landlords, company directors, finance chiefs and bankers. The statistics from car insurer Admiral found that more than one in five drivers in some urban areas own a 4x4. One in four drivers in Banchory near Aberdeen now own and operate a Land Rover, or other type of 4x4 . One of the estates in the affluent area of Banchory near Aberdeen. The 4x4 has become popular for those rich enough to own them who want to drive around Scottish country lanes . The top ten is made up of well-heeled London boroughs, affluent parts of Aberdeenshire and the English Home Counties. Indeed Aberdeenshire takes up four of the top ten places, including first place. One in four drivers has one in the table-topping market town of Banchory, which is just 20 miles from Scotland’s North Sea oil capital Aberdeen and is famed as the gateway to Royal Deeside. It pips the London’s upmarket SW7 post-code of South Kensington and Knightsbridge at 23 per cent - almost on a par with the third place AB53 postcode of Turriff, which is also in Aberdeenshire. Fourth place is London’s fashionable W8 postcode of Kensington and Holland Park (23 per cent) which pips Chelsea’s SW3 into 5th place (22 per cent) and Wadhurst in East Sussex (TN5) into sixth position (22 per cent).

Colourful terraced houses, Bywater Street, Chelsea, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where the stats for those owning 4x4s has dropped significantly . The statistics based on more than three million policyholders revealed that those with children are more than twice as likely to buy one. Some one in seven (14 per cent) of drivers with at least one child have one compared to just six per cent of those without children. Land Rover makes the three most popular models with its Range Rover top followed by the Freelander and Discovery. The current popularity of 4x4s marks an astonishing turnaround since the mid-noughties when sales plunged after vehicle excise duty on the most polluting cars was doubled. The slump followed protests by environmentalists over carbon dioxide emissions from ‘gas guzzlers’ that halted production at Land Rover’s factory in Solihull in May 2005. Manufacturers claim fuel efficiency of new 4x4s has improved by 37 per cent in the past seven years and many cost less than a hatchback. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said sales of ‘dual purpose vehicles’ - a category of mostly 4x4s - have nearly doubled from 132,472 in 2009 to 248,003 last year. Demand has been boosted by adverse weather including two recent severe winters and flooding.","Chelsea has been knocked off the top spot for areas of high 4x4 ownership .

"Abbie Keers, from County Durham, almost lost sight in her right eye and underwent emergency plastic surgery after a thug threw a beer bottle at the car she was travelling in . These are the shocking injuries sustained by a nine-year-old girl after a thug hurled a bottle at her family’s car. Abbie Keers screamed in  terror as the car window shattered, sending shards of  glass into her face and almost blinding her. The schoolgirl – who had been sitting in the front passenger seat – suffered gashes to her forehead, nose and hands. And she almost lost the sight in her left eye as the glass cut just inside the socket. An horrific picture showed the extent of the youngster’s  injuries, with blood streaming down her cheek and nose into her mouth. Abbie underwent emergency plastic surgery and doctors fear her face may be scarred for life. Yesterday police appealed  for information to catch the yob who threw a beer bottle at the vehicle in a random act of mindless violence. Her mother Clare Webb, 29, of Stanley, County Durham, said: ‘It was terrifying, I’m still in shock now. 'It was a huge shock when it happened and I really panicked as Abbie was screaming about her face. It was one of the worst nights of my life – it was so scary. ‘Abbie will be scarred and that is upsetting. 'Every time that she looks in the mirror she will  be reminded of what happened that day. She has not looked at herself yet.’ She added: ‘I’m really angry at what’s happened as it was such a mindless act. People who do this should be named and shamed.’ The incident happened at around 10.30pm on Friday when Miss Webb was in a silver Fiat Punto car with her mother Sandra Webb, and daughters Abbie and three-year-old Lexi. They were driving to a walk-in medical centre as Lexi was feeling unwell. Nine-year-old Abbie Keers, pictured here with her mother Clare Webb (left) and grandmother Sandra (right) has had to have plastic surgery following the incident . Abbie, of Stanley, County Durham, suffered gashes to her forehead, nose, hands and around her right eye when shards of glass became embedded in her face . Before: Abbie (pictured left) with her three-year-old sister Lexi . Miss Webb was on the back seat of the car comforting the three-year-old, who had been sick shortly before the journey. As . they drove along the A693 in Stanley, someone threw the glass bottle . from a subway, hitting the front passenger side window where Abbie was . sitting and playing on her iPad. Grandmother . Sandra, 58, a former police officer who was driving at the time, said: . ‘It was like the biggest explosion and sounded similar to when an air . bag goes off in a car. ‘I . didn’t know where the noise had come from or if a tyre had blown. As I . was driving I turned and saw Abbie’s face was covered in blood and she . was crying and screaming in the front passenger seat.’ She added: ‘There . was blood pouring from her face and, as the car stopped, Clare quickly . got out of the back seat and opened the front passenger door, which is . when we saw the glass bottle in the footwell.’ Abbie is a keen gymnast and has won a number of gold medals in the sport . Miss Webb called an ambulance and Abbie was taken to the  University Hospital of North Durham. Doctors . decided to operate straight away. She has now returned home to recover. The schoolgirl is not expected to require any further surgery, but was . been very upset by the incident, said her mother. Miss . Webb described her daughter as ‘quieter than usual’ but she bravely . went ahead and competed in a gymnastics event yesterday, winning a . silver medal. The girl’s . grandmother added: ‘Abbie is quite a resilient little girl and she has . done well to cope with what she has. She is quiet until she gets to know . people and I’m worried that this will affect her confidence.’ The family were last night due to give statements to police investigating the incident. Acting .

"Leader: This is billionaire financier, Wilbur Ross and his wife Hilary Geary - Ross is the Grand Swipe or chief of Kappa Beta Phi, a secret society for elite Wall Street bankers . A journalist who gate-crashed a secret fraternity of billionaire bankers has laid bare the booze fueled, cross dressing antics of its members as they openly mocked the 99 percent and made light of the enormous government bailouts of 2009. Sneaking into the swanky St Regis Hotel ballroom in January 2012, where he was assumed to be a waiter, Kevin Roose became the first outsider to witness the Monty-Python-esque induction ceremony for Kappa Beta Phi. New members, known as neophytes, traipsed around other masters of the universe dressed in leotards and gold-sequined skirts and wigs - to then perform vaudeville-style acts that included homophobic and sexist jokes and even a parody of ABBA's 'Dancing Queen', called 'Bailout King'. Over 200 multi-millionaire and billionaire bankers and financiers were in attendance at the annual event so chock-full of power and money that Roose felt that 'if you had dropped a bomb on the roof, global finance as we know it might have ceased to exist'. Older hands at the fraternity, which has existed since the end of the Great Depression, walk around the well-lubricated dinner wearing 'purple velvet moccasins embroidered with the fraternity’s Greek letters'. Lavish: This is the ballroom of the St.. Regis Hotel in Manhattan - where Kappa Beta Phi met in January 2012 and were infiltrated by reporter Kevin Roose . Served up a luxury meal of lamb and foie gras, executives from 'nearly every too-big-to-fail bank, private equity megafirm, and major hedge fund' were in attendance at the prestigious and secretive event. Each new member, who has to cross-dress at the start of the evening, is required to perform for the benefit of the other guests in their costume wigs - believing they are safe under the mantra of 'what happens in the Regis, stays in the Regis.' Written up for a piece in New York Magazine, Roose describes how Millionaire, Paul Queally, who works with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe performed a skit with Ted Virtue, who works with MidOcean Partners. Roose heard them reel off a particularly unfunny joke about a former first lady: 'Q: 'What’s the biggest difference between Hillary Clinton and a catfish?' A: 'One has whiskers and stinks, and the other is a fish' The rich pair even threw in a homophobic jibe for good measure: 'Q: 'What’s the biggest difference between Barney Frank and a Fenway Frank?' A: 'Barney Frank comes in different-size buns' Some of the performances seemed to skirt the edge of taste, as Warren Stephens, an investment banking CEO, went on stage in a Confederate flag hat and sang a song referencing the financial crisis, to the tune of 'Dixie'. Club: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is listed as a member of Kappa Beta Phi - although Roose did not witness him at the January 2012 induction of new members . The lyrics included, 'In Wall Street land we’ll take our stand, said Morgan and Goldman. But first we better get some loans, so quick, get to the Fed, man.' Wilbur Ross: Grand Swipe - American Investor estimated by Forbes in 2011 to be worth $1.9 billion . Alexandra Lebenthal: Grand Swipe from 2003 - 2004 -  President and CEO of the municipal bond franchise Lebenthal & Company . Peter Kellogg: Grand Swipe from 1999-200: Businessman and philanthropist with a net worth estimated by Forbes at around $2.3 billion . Michael R. Bloomberg: Former Mayor of New York City and business magnate worth who is the 13th richest man in the world with a fortune of $31 billion . Laurence Fink: chairman and chief executive officer of BlackRock - the largest money-management firm in the world with assets of $3.5 trillion . Paul Tudor Jones: The founder of Tudor Investment Corporation estimated to have a net worth of USD 3.6 billion . Another two financiers, Bill Mulrow, who is an executive at the Blackstone Group and Emil Henry, who is a hedge fund manager with Tiger Infrastructure Partners and former assistant secretary of the Treasury did a two man comedy sketch. In it, Mulrow played the role of a liberal radical while Henry played the part of a wealthy baron. Roose said that it looked like a debate between the 99 percent and the 1 percent. At one point, Henry said, 'Bill, look at you! You're pathetic, you liberal! You need a bath!' To which Henry shouted, 'My God, you callow, insensitive Republican! Don't you know what we need to do? We need to create jobs.' Past and current neophytes include former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the wealthy Rockefeller family. The fraternity was started in 1929 by 'four C+ William and Mary students' and its crest is described as depicting a 'macho right hand in a proper Savile Row suit and a Turnbull and Asser shirtsleeve.' The clandestine groups motto is 'Dum vivamus edimus et biberimus', or Latin for 'While we live, we eat and drink.' The current head of Kappa Beta Phi, or Grand Swipe, is Wilbur Ross, 76, known for restructuring failed companies in hard industries and who is conservatively estimated to be worth $1.9 billion. Other members include AIG CEO Bob Benmosche, Alan 'Ace' Greenberg, the former chairman of Bear Stearns and President Obama donor Marc Lasry. Roose describes that membership is not just for the successful in banking. There are also wildly unsuccessful members such as former Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld and former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne. Exalted company: Alan ""Ace"" Greenberg, former Bear Stearns Chairman and CEO in 2008 - was still attending Kappa Beta Phi, a secret society for elite Wall Street financiers in 2012 as was Marc Lasry - who has donated to President Barack Obama . Describing the consummate ease with which he entered the party, Roose details how he witnessed Ross induct 21 new members in January 2012. 'Good evening, Exalted High Council, former Grand Swipes, Grand Swipes-in-waiting, fellow Wall Street Kappas, Kappas from the Spring Street and Montgomery Street chapters, and worthless neophytes!' Ross exclaimed at the beginning of his introductory remarks. The first outside to infiltrate Kappa Beta Phi in its eight decade life-span, Roose calls the fraternity so exclusive it is akin to a one-percenter's club. Sneaking in as part of his research for his book, 'Young Money', Roose was interested to see why so many eager young men work ridiculously long hours when they start banking - but seem to have a drastic personality changes as they age and become so successful. Staying long enough to record skits and speeches given by new inductees and to take a few pictures, Roose was exposed when he tried to video a parody version of 'I Believe', the big number from musical, The Book of Mormon - for which the neophytes had dressed as missionaries. Indeed, the lyrics were changed to include the line, 'I believe that God has a plan for all of us. I believe my plan involves a seven-figure bonus.' Busted: Michael Novogratz, (left) principal of Fortress Investment Group LLC, and co-chief investment officer of the Fortress Macro Fund caught Kevin Roose in the act while Ted Virtue (right) told some off-color jokes as he was inducted . Billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, a former Army helicopter pilot, rumbled Roose and tried to take his phone off him. Roose described Novogratz as having the impression of having consumed alcohol that evening. The fight attracted the attention of Wilbur Ross and a former Grand Swipe called Alexandra Lebenthal who ran over and escorted Roose outside with his pictures and audio recording intact. Roose alleges that Ross tried to bribe him to keep quiet with the lure of exclusive stories, saying, 'I'll pick up the phone anytime, get you any help you need.' 'Yeah, the people in this group could be very helpful,' Lebenthal chimed in. 'If you could just keep their privacy in mind.' However, Roose was not swayed and printed his story in New York Magazine as part of the promotion for his new book. He drew the conclusion that 'the upper ranks of finance are composed of people who have completely divorced themselves from reality.

"A million-pound holiday home could be under threat after huge cracks and steps appeared up to a quarter of a mile inland on the Jurassic Coast after months of appalling weather. The expensive bungalow west of Lyme Regis in Dorset is surrounded by hundreds of acres of unstable land slumping slowly seawards because billions of tons of rock and mud are on the move. A three-foot step has been cleaved across the road from the property - even though it is some distance from the sea - as seven miles of the beautiful South West Coast Path has been closed around it. In peril: Massive cracks have appeared along the Undercliff between Seaton and Lyme Regis putting this £1million property in danger . Dangerous: The fossil rich Jurassic cliffs at Monmouth Beach in Lyme Regis Dorset has been slipping into the sea for two weeks causing massive land movements for miles around them . Scale: Cracks have been ripping through fields and pathways as the heavy rain has caused miles of coastline to slip dangerously . Lyme Regis residents are used to seeing the Jurassic Coast's sea-cliffs fall spectacularly into the pounding waves - but now cracks and fissures are opening as far as a third of a mile inland of the coast along the famous Undercliff. Subsidence is the movement of the ground and is caused by changing moisture levels, either  when the soil dries out or water levels increase rapidly. This movement is uneven and sudden, causing damage such as cracks in walls, ceilings and floors of buildings. An upward movement of the ground – known as heave – can then occur when dried soil becomes saturated. Trees planted close to properties are often a cause of subsidence as they suck up moisture under the foundations. Signs in homes include diagonal cracks, wider at the top, by windows or doors. In serious cases, underpinning may be required. The clue is in the name - this is a dynamic landscape which used to be part of the seabed during pre-Ice Age times when tidal levels were far higher than they are now. Ancient sea-cliffs along this part of the coast can be seen perched over 350 feet above today's high water mark - the landscape beneath them is merely reacting to gravity now that heavy rains have lubricated subterranean seams. Dorset County council experts are keeping 'a close eye' on the situation but admit there is little that anyone can do to save the seaward acres on the Dorset-Devon county border. 'A lot of rain means a lot of landslide activity,' said Dorset County Council geologist Richard Edmond, an expert on the Jurassic Coast. 'The Ware area is part of the undercliff - and the whole length of that coast is a series of landslides. 'What's happening there now is all linked to what we saw last year when the beach huts on Monmouth Beach were destroyed,' he explained. 'We are keeping a very close eye on it - but this is a landslide not a rockfall,' Mr Edmonds went on. 'People along this coast are used to seeing rockfalls which drop dramatically into the sea - but a landslide like this happens slowly. 'And there is usually a delay between the time when the rains stop and the activity occurs - this could become more active in April, May or even June.' Evasive action: Dorset County Council experts are keeping 'a close eye' on the situation but admit there is little that anyone can do to save the seaward acres on its border with Devon . Retired Lyme Regis harbour-master Mike Poupard lives close to the Ware Field area and said an extensive chalet-style holiday home which was recently bought for just under £1 million was in danger. He said: 'I walk here most days and I can tell you the house has sunk over two feet in the past fortnight.' Evidence: Witnesses to the landslips say that a whole tree slid down the cliff face and stayed perfectly upright on the beach below. Geologists are risking injury to get near the cliffs as ammonite fossils are appearing . A large crack has opened across the gravel drive just feet from the home's front door while just feet away a telegraph pole, dislodged by earth movement, is resting at an alarming angle. Seawards of the home massive cracks in the ground had opened up across paddocks, and areas of paddock and field had dropped to form large steps in the landscape. The most damaging of these divides an access road where an abrupt, vertical, three-foot drop now cleaves the lane in two. Cracks and fissures large and small had been opening up across many acres. 'It's all become a lot, lot worse in the past two weeks,' commented Mr Poupard. Exactly the same scenario could have been witnessed on the altogether busier and more populated eastern side of Lyme Regis if local authorities not decided to spend £24 million on large scale engineering works which are presently underway to bolster the seaward landscape there. The scheme is the fourth stage of a ground stabilisation programme staged in a bid to halt the 'landslide zone' on which Lyme is built. The current phase is aimed at protecting around 240 homes and a substantial section of the main Charmouth Road. Even that massive expenditure, however, is no guarantee when it comes to the long-term future of Lyme Regis: 'It's been designed to protect the town for 60 years,' said Mr Edmond. 'But no one can say what will happen after that. This is a dynamic coastline.' Just east of the present engineering works an area called Black Ven has, for decades, said to have been the 'largest and most studied landslide complex in Europe'. 'The amazing thing is that this is all happening in one human lifetime,' said Mr Edmonds, explaining that in geological terms this was lightning fast. 'For example, there used to be a road leading to Charmouth around Black Ven but in the 1920s it disappeared. In 1959 that area saw the largest coastal landslide ever seen in this country.' It could now be that the western edge of Lyme Regis could also find itself in the geographical record books. If the cracks and fissures continue to open up, it might soon be the largest chunk of the UK to disappear since its neighbouring landscape vanished 55 years ago. Scary: The cracks have started appearing along this stretch of coastline west of Lyme Regis, and are reaching up to a quarter of a mile in and closing the famous South West Coastal Path .","Seven miles of paths along the Dorset coast have been shut as huge cracks have appeared because of landslide .

"Loot Skywalker: A bidder paid a record-breaking £7,000 for a Star Wars collectable - an original 1980 Palitoy Empire Strikes Back medical droid . The force was strong in one bidder when they paid a record-breaking £7,000 for a Star Wars collectable. Lot 1035, an original 1980 Palitoy Empire Strikes Back medical droid, was originally valued at £50 to £70. But as the bids started rolling in at Vectis Auctions, Thornaby, it sold to an unnamed bidder for £7,000 - a world record for the model at 100 times the asking price. Vectis Auctions spokeswoman Louise Harker said: 'When we first received the items we didn't expect them to do as well as they did. 'The Star Wars items made up the the first 50 lots and it just went through the roof. 'The room was pretty full, a couple of people were bidding it out against each other, the same person bought quite a few of the big lots.' Original Star Wars toys have been known to fetch high prices and a number of factors can push the price higher still. Ms Harker said: 'We are seeing that the TV and film related items, such as Star Wars are becoming increasingly popular. 'The condition of the lots is a key factor in gaining prices such as these, the un-punched card, the condition of the card itself, the bubble which the figure is contained within and of course the all-important factory seal. 'This figure is not one I've ever heard of, sometimes all it takes is for two collectors to be missing one figure from their collection to push up the value.' An Empire Strikes Back Imperial Commander figure at the same auction also broke a world record for its model when it fetched £3,000 while a Darth Vader action figure sold for £2,520. Loot Skywalker: A bidder paid a record-breaking £7,000 for a Star Wars collectable - an original 1980 Palitoy Empire Strikes Back medical droid . The droid featured in the Empire Strikes Back at the secret Rebel Echo Base (pictured here) on the planet Hoth. Here is C-3PO with a new friend . The sale of the items left one person in particular with an unlikely windfall. Ms Harker said: 'I have spoken to the vendor who was extremely shocked. These items all came from the same collection, the vendor had no preconceptions about what they would fetch and was delighted with the pre-sale estimates given. 'He was pleasantly surprised by the final price realised for his items.' Currently listed on eBay there is a lot with a buy it now price of £120 titled Star Wars 1980 Vintage MOC ESB FX-7 Medical Droid. Also on eBay, in 2012 a lot that included all 1,950 loose figures was sold for $11,500. In the film, FX-7 was stationed in the Rebels' secret Echo Base on the ice planet of Hoth. He assisted both human and droid medics in the Echo Base medical lab. The droid's ability to use its twenty retractable manipulator arms simultaneously proved useful to an understaffed medical bay. After the loss of Yavin Base, the Alliance used any outmoded equipment they could find. This droid was certainly classed as outmoded but proved invaluable for its sophisticated medical, diagnostic and procedural programming. Although this droid was capable of speech, its speech synthesizer card was missing. FX-7 assisted 2-1B on Hoth after Luke Skywalker was attacked by a wampa. The droids built up a good rapport with one another, and had worked together for more than a year. Despite this, 2-1B would often state his superiority over his medical assistant, due to his egotistical droid personality. FX-7 and 2-1B escaped Hoth aboard the GR-75 medium transport Bright Hope, the last transport to leave the planet. After the bounty hunters 4-LOM and Zuckuss rescued the passengers of the Bright Hope, including the two medical droids, FX-7 was reassigned to the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Redemption.","Toy is an original 1980 Palitoy Empire Strikes Back medical droid .

"North Korea will free 75-year-old Australian John Short after the Christian missionary made a grovelling apology for 'insulting' North Koreans by 'secretly' spreading the gospel, CNN reports. In a written apology read out by Short, he said he realises his distribution of religious material was 'an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law' of the harsh regime of dictator Kim Jong-un. Short, a South Australian missionary with the Global Hall Bretheren, was arrested last month and faced up to 15 years in a harsh North Korean prison. Grovelling apology: Australian missionary, John Short, 75 reads (left) from a written apology in which he has said sorry for 'insulting' the North Korean people by spreading the Christian gospel, an act which his wife Karen (pictured above, right, with her husband) said he was called to by his devout faith in God . Request for forgiveness: Facing 15 years' prison, missionary John Short wrote this apology (above) in which he acknowledged his 'actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law of' North Korea . Previously arrested for evangelising in China, Short, who is a Hong Kong resident, was taken from his Pyongyang hotel the night after he arrived in the North Korean capital. His wife, Karen, said he knew the risks but 'when you know what you must do, you do it'. 'God called and he went — being a Christian we read our Bible and we believe that is our guidance,' Ms Short said following her husband's arrest. The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported today the Democratic Republic of North Korea (DPRK) regime had agreed to free him. 'The relevant organ decided to expel him from the territory of the DPRK, thanks to the tolerance of the law of the DPRK and in full consideration of his age,' the agency reported. The agency said Short 'committed a criminal act by secretly spreading his Bible tracts around a Buddhist temple in Pyongyang' after entering the country as a tourist, and published a written apology. 'I now realise the seriousness of my insult to the Korean people on February 16th because I made the Korean people angry and for this I truly apologize,' Short has allegedly written. 'I realise that my actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law of the DPRK. 'I request the forgiveness of the DPRK for my actions,' 'Hostile act': Australian missionary, John Short, will now be expelled from North Korea after making a grovelling apology for committing the 'hostile' act of spreading the gospel, which his wife Karen (pictured, right, with her husband) said he felt he had to do because 'God called' him . Harsh regime: The North Korean government of dictator Kim Jong-un (above, right) severely punishes people caught practising Christianity and was prepared to jail Australian missionary John Short, 75, for up to 15 years . Short has been arrested multiple times in China 'for speaking out about brutality against Chinese Christians,' according to a biography on a religious website, Gospel Attract. In the 1990s, he became 'persona non grata' for almost two years and was unable to visit mainland China, Gospel Attract said. Last year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through religious activities. Washington has repeatedly called on Pyongyang to release Bae, expressing concerns about his health. But Kim Jong Un's regime has so far refused to budge. Bae, 45, was widely reported to have been conducting missionary work in North Korea. His family says he ran a company specializing in tours of the secretive country. North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities. The regime 'considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, since it challenges ideologically the official personality cult and provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside the realm of the state,' a United Nations panel said in a report released last month. 'People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination,' the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said.","Australian missionary John Short freed by harsh North Korean regime .

"A company set up and operated by Victoria Beckham's brother-in-law (pictured with her sister, Louise) is at the centre of a fraud investigation . A company set up and operated by Victoria Beckham’s brother-in-law is at the centre of a fraud investigation after an elderly woman was duped out of her life savings. It is alleged that staff working for Darren Flood, who is married to Mrs Beckham’s younger sister Louise, even namechecked the former Spice Girl in their sales pitch, claiming ‘if Victoria Beckham’s relative is investing with us, it must be fine’. Specialist officers are looking into allegations that an 83-year-old widow was grossly overcharged for investments. Five people connected to the company have been arrested and questioned about how she handed over £235,000 for precious metals, diamonds and even plots of land in Brazil. Mr Flood, 35, was a director of one of the companies used for the bulk of the alleged fraudulent sales. There is no suggestion he is involved in any wrongdoing or that he was aware of the use of the Beckham name. However, if true, the allegations will be embarrassing to both David and Victoria who have a close relationship with Mr Flood. He married Louise at their Hertfordshire mansion in 2009. Shortly after starting the company in 2012, his staff are alleged to have contacted the pensioner at her home offering her investments in gold bullion. She decided to hand over thousands after being picked up from her home in Woking, Surrey, and taken for a tour of its ‘virtual office’ in Canary Wharf – where the firm had rented a mailbox. The day also allegedly included her being ‘rewarded’ with an expensive lunch. It was only when her bank manager queried the huge sums leaving her account that police were alerted and an investigation opened. It is alleged that staff working for Darren Flood even namechecked the former Spice Girl in their sales pitch, claiming 'if Victoria Beckham's relative is investing with us, it must be fine' The widow, who has no children, told the Mail the Beckham name and use of the Queen’s bank Coutts were used to convince her to invest her life savings. She said: ‘They were very persistent. At first I was only asked to invest small amounts of money, but the sums soon got bigger. They seemed very genuine. ‘One of the men said, “If Victoria Beckham’s relative is investing with us it must be fine”. This all made me think it was bona fide. I was relying on those savings to help me out in my old age and cover any care I may need, but now I have to watch what I spend and shop in charity shops.’ A Surrey police spokesman said: ‘All those arrested are due to return on police bail in April while the investigation continues.’ Mr Flood has not been arrested and when contacted his wife said he would not be commenting.

"Victorious: Lulu singing in the Eurovision contest 1969. She won with song Bomm Bang-a-Bang . He has already been told that an independent Scotland may not be able to stay in the EU or keep the pound. But now Alex Salmond faces perhaps the biggest threat his dream of Scottish statehood. For the country’s first minister has now been warned that, if it opts for secession, Scotland might not be allowed to enter the Eurovision Song Contest. When the Scottish National Party leader unveiled a 670-page ‘blueprint’ setting out the case for independence ahead of next September’s landmark referendum he recommended replacing the BBC with SBS - Scottish Broadcasting Service - using the assets of BBC Scotland. SBS would broadcast Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who and CBeebies in return for giving the BBC access to its existing resources north of the border. A spokesman for the annual festival said an independent Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the European Broadcasting Union, which organises the contest – and accession would not be ‘automatic’. It means that it 2016, the year Mr Salmond wants to see Scotland re-gain its independence, the country may have to sit on the sidelines while the rest of the UK fights it out. Scottish singer Lulu previously won the contest for the UK in 1969, with Boom Bang A Bang; while Scott Fitzgerald came second to Celine Dion in 1988. However, when the UK entered with kilt-wearing Kenneth McKellar in 1966, he only received votes from two countries. The blow over Eurovision comes just days after Chancellor George Osborne said the country would not be able to share the pound with the rest of the UK if it leaves the country. And European Commission president Joe Manuel Barroso warned it would be ‘difficult’ for a post-independence Scotland to re-enter the EU. Decisions: It means that in 2016, the year Mr Salmond wants to see Scotland re-gain its independence, the country may have to sit on the sidelines while the rest of the UK fights it out . The annual song contest is run by the European Broadcasting Union, and a spokesman said it would require the Scottish broadcaster to re-apply for entry once it leaves the Royaume Uni, as our country is known at Eurovision. Application involves a complicated list of criteria they would have to meet – and Scotland would not be guaranteed admittance. Kosovo is not able to enter the song contest, in part because of the opposition of Serbia, the country it seceded from six years ago. And Spain has warned that it will not allow its own potentially breakaway region of Catalonia to join international institutions. It raises the prospect that countries such as Spain, which are against the idea of separatism, could make it difficult for Scotland to join up. The blow over Eurovision comes just days after Chancellor George Osborne said the country would not be able to share the pound with the rest of the UK if it leaves the country . EBU spokesman Jarmo Siim, who represents Eurovision, said: ‘Only active members of the EBU can take part in the Eurovision Song Contest and there is a certain membership process. No automatic memberships are granted.’ Mr Siim also said that the rest of the UK might not get its free pass into the Eurovision final if Scotland secedes. At present, the largest countries in Europe – the UK, France, Germany and Spain – do not have to go through the semi-final process because their broadcasters largely fund the EBU. ‘Concerning the rest of the UK, it is hard to say whether any changes will occur in this,’ he said. ‘However, it would be up to the organisers to take a decision on this when the situation arises.’It seems certain however that an independent Scotland would have to go through the semi-final process, decreasing its chances of winning.","Spokesman for the annual festival said Scotland would have to reapply .

"Claire Turpin: 'Lacking in confidence' A mother of twins who had longed to have children committed suicide because she thought she was an inadequate parent. Claire Turpin, 42, had struggled to conceive, eventually succeeding after lengthy fertility treatment. But she went on to become acutely depressed even though she was caring well for newborns Jack and Eliza. Three months after their birth, the married former hotel manager jumped from the top of a John Lewis multi-storey car park. An inquest heard Mrs Turpin had been referred to a mental health team and became ‘paranoid’ about social services wanting to take her babies away. Her mother Kath Sugden criticised the medical support she was given, telling the hearing: ‘All that happened was that Claire went to the doctor and came home with another batch of tablets. 'I was expecting things to move a little bit faster. She should have had more and quicker help from the agencies. ‘I saw her deteriorate over these few weeks day by day. She never spoke about suicidal thoughts to anyone. She had this horrendous fear if she did that her babies would be taken from her.’ Scene: Mrs Turpin scaled a 7ft wall and fell from the top of Sheffield's John Lewis car park (file picture) Recording a suicide verdict, . Sheffield coroner Julian Fox said it had been a ‘harrowing’ inquest, . adding: ‘It must have been agonising for all Claire’s family to witness . her change from a happy, lively, bubbly personality into a withdrawn . woman with no self-respect.’ It is a common form of depression which affects around one in six women after they have given birth. However, postnatal depression (PND) often remains undiagnosed, with only one in four cases diagnosed and treated. It . starts from two weeks to several months after delivery, but often . develops slowly - making it very difficult for doctors to diagnose and . hard for the mother to recognise her symptoms. It . is not known exactly what causes postnatal depression, but it is . thought that biological, psychological and social factors all play a . role. Experts say that women who have a history of depression are more likely to suffer from the condition than those who have not. Some research has shown that postnatal depression is caused by a sudden drop in oestrogen and progesterone after birth. During pregnancy there is a surge in the levels of these two hormones. However, after giving birth to your baby and having the placenta removed, these hormone levels drop back down to normal. Scientists believe this rapid drop of hormones can trigger a chemical imbalance in the brain causing postnatal depression. Psychologists believe that a variety of psychological issues could also be to blame. Although . it is hard to pinpoint exactly what causes the condition, it is thought . that feelings of isolation and unresolved issues from the past can . trigger the condition. Mrs . Turpin and husband Andy had tried hard to have children before she . finally became pregnant through intrauterine insemination – in which . sperm are placed into the womb when an egg is released. She . was overjoyed to discover she was carrying twins. In October 2012 one . baby was delivered naturally and the other by caesarean section, but . both were healthy. Mrs . Turpin looked after the children to an ‘extremely high standard’ but . developed an irrational belief she was not good enough to care for them, . the inquest heard. She sought help and one of her GPs told the hearing Mrs Turpin had been treated with anti-depressants in the past. In November 2012, the new mother was thought to be only a ‘moderate’ suicide risk. But the following month GP Susan Parker said her mood was . ‘very low and she seemed lacking in confidence’. Mrs Turpin talked about harming herself and was referred to a mental health team. Over . the New Year she appeared to be improving but two days before the . tragedy, on January 13 last year, she was quiet and withdrawn at another . consultation. Dr Parker . said: ‘Claire felt guilty because the people around her expected her to . be in a certain way … but she was feeling anything but happy inside. She found that very difficult to deal with.’ Health visitor Donna Sanderson added: ‘She was struggling to believe in herself as a new mum. 'I told her it is quite a stressful time and having two babies has a massive impact.’ Three-day hearing: The inquest at Sheffield Coroner's Court (pictured) was told that Mrs Turpin and her husband tried hard to have children before she fell pregnant through IUI - intrauterine insemination . Mrs Turpin scaled a 7ft wall at the car park in Sheffield and landed on a car. The coroner said while treatment was ‘ultimately ineffective’, he believed it was offered ‘promptly and appropriately’.","Claire Turpin, 42, became pregnant after lengthy fertility treatment .

"His garden is a 'no-go area' and trips to the bathroom must be as quick as possible, for Ted Grayson lives in constant fear of being smashed into by a passing vehicle whenever he's home. Mr Grayson's 18th Century cottage has been hit more than 40 times in the last 14 years and on four occasions since the New Year.

Other villagers have suffered from numerous accidents on the narrow B6089 road, which has a 30mph limit through Nether Haugh. There have been 14 logged since the start of 2014 and residents have formed a group to campaign for a 20mph limit and safety measures, such as speed cameras, to be installed. Cars have regularly ploughed through hedges into fields, lamp posts demolished, cyclists hit and walls smashed up. Both village bus stops have also been wrecked several times.

"The body of a young mother of four, has been found in St. Tammany, Louisiana, five days after her boyfriend was arrested following an armed standoff with deputies. Melinda Denny, 26, from Mobile, Alabama, was last seen with her boyfriend, Jonathon Nall, 34, around 1:30 a.m. on Saturday morning in a parking lot on Highway 21. The pair were supposed to be traveling from Mobile to Texas, when Nall's mom informed cops that they were stranded in the parking lot without gas or the money to buy any. The body of Melinda Denny, a mother of four, has been found in St. Tammany, Louisiana, five days after her boyfriend was arrested following an armed standoff with deputies . When police searched their red 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee they found a gun, but no ammunition. The pair were allowed to go on their way after a routine check revealed neither had any criminal history. Approximately 10 hours later Nall was arrested after he threatened to commit suicide during a stand-off with deputies outside a gas station along I-12 near Madisonville. Nall was eventually taken into custody after deputies fired a round of bean bags, striking him in the chest. ‘Nall suffered no significant injuries from the bean bag; however, he was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, where he remains today under an order of protective custody,’ said deputies. Jonathan Nall, 34, is bipolar and was arrested on Saturday after he threatened to commit suicide during a stand-off with deputies outside a gas station along I-12 . Video footage of Nall's stand-off with deputies on Saturday morning was taken by Bruce Primes and posted on Facebook . Denny wasn't seen during Nall's confrontation with authorities and she wasn't found later when deputies located Nall's jeep Grand Cherokee. It took until Thursday morning and a sweep of the local area by 150 deputies that Denny’s body was discovered in an open field. Denny died from multiple stab wounds, said the St. Tammany Parish Coroner's Office. Sheriff Jack Strain told WWLTV that he is confident the case will ultimately lead to the arrest of Nall. 'This guy did a big show of his apparent mental problems, but now it’s up to the professionals to decide was that a disguise or truly mental incapacity,' said Strain. Melinda Denny, a mother of four, was supposed to be traveling from Mobile to Texas with Nall when she was killed .

"Britain's Chemmy Alcott, 31, pictured celebrating after coming 19th in the ladies' downhill at the Sochi Olympics . For skier Chemmy Alcott the 19th place in the women’s Olympic downhill on the mountains above Sochi today was as good as a gold medal after the glamour girl dubbed Britain’s ‘bionic woman’ defied medical science to compete in Russia. The 31-year-old is a testament to the skill of surgeons and her own courage having overcome an astonishing 42 fractures and four career threatening breaks - one where her ankle bone ripped through her ski boot - to ski in her fourth Winter Olympics. She only returned to the competitive ski slopes in January after a broken leg and took part in an historic race that saw the first ever tie in the history of the Winter Games when Dominique Gisin, of Switzerland, and Slovenian Tina Maze recorded exactly the same time to share the gold medal in the alpine downhill. Miss Alcott, who credited her friend . Zara Phillips with helping her overcome her horrific injuries and reach . Sochi, finished 1.86 seconds behind the pair but was jubilant as she . finished, breaking into a huge smile, punching the air three times and . shouting : 'Yes, Woo...’ Still . beaming minutes later, she said : ‘I know it sounds crazy to some . people, especially when we have such a strong team here in Sochi, but . 19th is a gold for me. ‘After what I’ve been through, it’s amazing justice. I’m swelling with pride and I’m on a buzz.’ Seven . other skiers fell yesterday in difficult conditions, and Miss Alcott . admitted she had been as ‘loose and a goose’ on the course. She added : ‘When I made the commitment to come here it was about personal goals. I never put any statistics on it, if I had then top 20 would have been massively over super-ceding what I expected. I’ve done this against all odds and I’m very proud.’ Determined: Miss Alcott has been dubbed Britain's 'bionic woman' because of her injuries . Miss Alcott only returned to competing on the slopes in January after breaking her leg . Delighted: Miss Alcott said 19th place was as good as gold after what she has been through . Those odds could not have been more heavily stacked against the former Dancing on Ice star, who finished 11th in both the Turin and Vancouver Olympics, after a life of crippling injuries that began at the age of 12 when she broke her neck and had two vertebrae fused together. In Sochi, she carries around an X-ray of her neck in case she is in an accident and doctors want to prize the vertebrae open. Other injuries sustained since she first put on a pair of skis at the age of 18 months have injured a broken jaw, broken bones in both arms and legs, damage to the head and face - her goggles cut into her left eyebrow - back and pelvis. She needed surgery on bone spurs in her feet, broke an ankle and has other problems with damage to her feet. She has broken her right leg three times and three years ago feared she might die after an 80mph crash on the slopes in Lake Louise, Canada, that saw her airlifted on a stretcher from the slopes. ‘When I was coming down the mountain, on a stretcher beneath the helicopter, I thought I was dying. I have never known pain like it,’ she said. Crippling injuries: Miss Alcott has broken her right leg three times . Action shot: Chemmy Alcott during her run in the Women's Alpine Skiing Downhill at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center . Miss Alcott's first serious injury came when she was just 12-years-old and broke her neck . 'I did it!': Miss Alcott  gives a thumbs up to a photographer after her run . ‘I could feel my leg was hot and . moist...from photographs, I have been shown that my ski boot liner had . become lodged inside my leg with bones and blood everywhere. The doctors . were pretty shocked.’ A 38cm rod holding her bones together was locked . inside her leg. ‘It goes all the way from my ankle to my knee, and I have a few screws in there,’ she said, ‘But I will do anything for the sport.’ That determination was to be again threatened in August when she broke the same leg again, an injury that put her Sochi place in doubt until the last minute. She took the highly unusual move of writing to the ski team’s chief, asking for a Sochi place and promising she would be fit to compete despite medical fears. She pays tribute to the Queen’s daughter Zara Phillips, an Olympic equestrian medallist in London 2012, as playing a key part in her recovery from the worst of her injuries.

Held together: Alcott tweeted a photo of her leg that had stood up to the challenge of the race . Proud: Miss Alcott  says she is 'swelling with pride' at her achievement . Miss Alcott said : ‘After my first big accident, which was back in 2010, I felt like I wanted to escape a little bit. Zara invited me to come and stay with her for a while and watch her train. Well, I have never seen anyone train as hard as her. ‘We would get up at 6.30am most mornings. I would watch her train for an hour and a half on one horse. I’d say: ‘That’s great. Can we can get some breakfast now?’ But she’d reply: “I have got four other horses to do this on”. I couldn’t believe it. ‘As an athlete, you always think you work harder than everyone else. But when I saw Zara and what she does, I just had a massive respect for her as both an athlete and as a person.’ However, it is not only physical injury that Miss Alcott, whose full name is Chimene after Sophia Loren’s character in the 1961 film ‘El Cid’, but also finding the money to chase her Olympic dream. Apart from renting out a room in her Surrey home, she and her fiancé, alpine skier Dougie Crawford, organised a Question of Sport-themed black-tie dinner for more than 170 guests, including fellow stars of Dancing on Ice, that raised £36,000 to pay for training. Miss Alcott’s final race - she has said this is her last Olympics - will be in the Super G slalom on Saturday.

"The average British person has just one ten-thousandth of the net worth of David Beckham, a study revealed today. Using a formula common in probate cases, legal experts calculated the value of the average Briton's property equity, savings, pensions, investments, cars and possessions. They came up with a figure of just £147,134 - less than the asking price currently advertised for a parking space in London's sought-after Portman Square. Ten thousand times richer than you: David Beckham and his wife Victoria. The former England and Manchester United ace has a net worth of £165million - compared to the average Briton's net worth of £147,134 . It's less than 0.01 per cent the value of former Manchester United and England football icon Beckham's estimated fortune, which was calculated last year to be £165million. And it is just over a millionth of the net worth of the UK's richest resident, Russian mining mogul Alisher Usmanov, who has a net worth of £13.3billion according to the Sunday Times Rich List. The calculations include the average person's current pension pot estimated in the region of £30,000, with mortgage equity accounting for an average of £75,000. The study of the assets of 2,000 adults found that 46 per cent had 'no idea', while 11 per cent don't know what the term even means. It found that 42 per cent of adults don't think they are worth very much in monetary terms, and yet have a mortgage equity of at least £75,060.45. In addition, a further £5,603.98 is . stowed away in a savings account, on average, and another £3,712.65 . building interest in an ISA. The . average British adult has around £1,348.16 in their current bank . account at any one time and puts money into a pension which is estimated . to currently stand in the region of £30,000. Finally, . people can take their belongings into account by including the value of . the car they own and the items in their home - which are worth an . average of £6,706.55 and £15,077.90 respectively. Worth a million times more than you: Russian mining mogul Alisher Usmanov is Britain's richest resident, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2013 . That's a grand total net worth of just over £147,000. That's a lot of money for most Britons, and might even be enough for Beckham to think hard about. but it's mere pocket change for the country's richest residents. After Mr Usmanov, the next wealthiest men who choose to live in Britain are Ukrainian-born U.S. businessman Len Blavatnik - worth an estimated 10billion - and the Indian brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja - jointly worth £10.6billion. Gillian Coverley, a wills, trusts and estates expert at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, which carried out the study, said: 'Many British adults feel they have very few assets to their name and consequently is it not worth them making a will. 'But the reality is very different, in that most people will have assets tied up in investments they wouldn't even think would count. 'So while the average British adult doesn't have millions tucked away like David Beckham they should still make sensible provisions and arrangements for their future.' Despite the facts and figures demonstrating the value of the average adult, six in 10 still don't have any sort of will in place, while a third have no plans to make a will because they don't ever think they'll need one. Having no assets, having nothing to leave anyone and being in debt for the rest of their lives are some of the most common reasons why well over 16 million adults have no intention of getting the appropriate paperwork in place in the event of their death. In addition, 47 per cent of people don't know how assets are distributed after death, while 54 per cent are clueless about what accounts and investments their partner or family has. Ms Coverley added: 'Planning for the future is vital. Many people are attempting to save money by not making wills and then when the inevitable happens, they do it themselves in relation to the estate administration. 'What they find is that this is a specialist area of law and there are potentially serious pitfalls. 'While some may feel they can save money by avoiding legal advice, our experience is that such an outlook can create a false economy. 'This is because ultimately, if they do go it alone and subsequently hit problems, then it can be more expensive to sort out the situation in the long run. 'Common issues from failing to take advice include incorrectly distributing the estate and a lack of awareness of the tax issues which surround administering an estate - this can lead to missed tax deadlines and potential penalty charges. 'Also, with specialist advice, they may be able to look at ways to reduce the burden of inheritance tax to the benefit of families and charities. 'Finally, without the relevant experience, people may often be unable to properly and thoroughly assess all of the assets and debts of the deceased - an issue in itself which makes it more likely that distribution of the estate will not be undertaken correctly. 'The consequences of getting such issues wrong can be serious and Personal Representatives are personally and financially liable for any mistakes they make.'","Legal experts used probate formula to calculate average Briton's wealth .

"Car parks and bribes influence the classification of wines in the Bordeaux region of southwest France according to a new book published today which promises to reveal the secrets of the country's wine production. Wines from the region are classified to guide quality and price - the four best are known as premier grands crus classés A, the next 18 as premiers grands crus classés B and the next 64 as grands crus classés. But French journalist, Isabelle Saporta, claims wine critics are regularly bribed by wealthy vineyard owners. French journalist Isabelle Saporta claims wine critics are regularly bribed by wealthy chateau-owners who own some of the most prestigious vineyards in the area . She also says other factors including the size of visitor car parks, comfort of conference rooms and architecture of the storehouse contribute to the criteria. The book, published by Albin Michel, describes a 'cruel, medieval micro-society' which controls the country's wine production. According to Vinobusiness the classification of wines is controlled by the wealthiest and that taste only accounts for 30 per cent of the marks. However, Franck Binard, a director of the council Saint-Emilion wines, slammed the book describing it as 'excessive and hollow'. He told The Times: 'We consider that it is not just a matter of taste. There is a wide range of factors.' An outdoor cafe area in Bordeaux, France, which is known for its fine wines .","Wines from the region are classified to guide quality and price .

"British workers have been 'displaced' from the jobs market by migrant workers – especially during the recession, a controversial Whitehall study claims. A fierce row has broken out inside the Coalition over a Government report on the economic impact of mass migration. Newsnight on BBC2 claimed on Tuesday that the still-unpublished document would undermine the Tory Party's case for imposing stricter controls on workers from overseas. Migrant influx: Polish job-seekers board a coach in Warsaw bound for a new life in Britain . The Corporation said that, as a result, it was being 'suppressed' by Downing Street – with pro-immigration Lib Dem MPs demanding its immediate publication. But the Mail now understands that the study – written by civil servants in the Home Office, Treasury and Department for Business – will clearly state that some Britons have suffered 'displacement' from the jobs market. It says this has been particularly noticeable for 'low-skilled natives', especially during the last recession. Last night, the row led to renewed claims of the BBC having an 'habitual lack of impartiality on the subject of immigration'. Its own executives have repeatedly admitted to the Corporation that they had a pro-immigration, liberal bias in the past – but insist that has now changed. The dispute centres on two studies on the impact of immigration. The first was published in 2012 by the independent Migration Advisory Committee, which was established by the last Labour government and is run by the respected economist Sir David Metcalf. The second, unpublished, report was commissioned by the Government two years ago as part of William Hague's EU 'balance of competences' review. Despite being focused on Brussels, the Whitehall study also deals more broadly with the impact of migration on the jobs market. (File picture) Newsnight on BBC2 claimed on Tuesday that the still-unpublished document would undermine the Tory Party's case for imposing stricter controls on . The row led to renewed claims of the BBC having an 'habitual lack of impartiality on the subject of immigration' The MAC report found that for every 100 extra foreign-born working-age migrants in the UK, there was a reduction of 23 in the number of Britons in employment. The report added that, between 2005 and 2010, 160,000 people in the UK had been 'displaced', or left jobless, by the influx of foreign workers. In a broadcast on Tuesday evening, BBC Newsnight reporter Chris Cook said of this research: 'There's just one problem: it's wrong.' He said the Government's own unpublished report would contradict MAC's findings, and that it was being suppressed as a result. But as the Corporation's own political editor Nick Robinson conceded yesterday, the Government's study deals with a different time period to MAC and the two are 'not directly comparable'. MAC's report covers the period to 2010. Whitehall's report brings the subject up to date. Since 2010, restrictions on non-EU migration introduced by the Government have led to an increase in the number of British workers getting jobs. UK nationals accounted for 92 per cent of the total rise in employment in the year to July-September 2013. Under Labour, the lion's share went to foreign-born workers. Insiders suggest that, far from undermining the case for immigration controls, it suggests the new regime is working. In any event, the Government's report – due to be published 'shortly' – does confirm the 'displacement' of British workers by mass migration, particularly the less well-off. As well as running on Newsnight, the immigration story dominated early BBC news bulletins yesterday. Radio 4's flagship Today programme highlighted the story in a discussion between presenter John Humphrys and the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson. Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: 'The BBC's enthusiasm for anything that might undermine the Government's immigration policy was demonstrated yet again by the excitable tone of Newsnight's report.' He said the programme had claimed the new report 'undermined the Government's case for restricting immigration.' Writing for the Spectator magazine, he added: 'In fact, this is only one aspect of a much wider case concerning the impact of mass immigration on public services, housing and transport – not to speak of the social impact.' The row comes at a time of high Coalition tensions over migration policy. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said figures that show net migration rose by a third to 212,000 in the year to September 2013 was 'good news'. In Whitehall, the finger of blame for the selective leak to Newsnight was being aimed at the Business Department. David Cameron's spokesman said the Whitehall report was not yet  complete but would be published 'shortly' – possibly by May. Asked whether the PM thought it right now to drop his ambition to reduce annual net migration below 100,000, the spokesman said: 'No. It is the objective which we are very much working towards.'","Fierce row has broken out over a Government report .

"What was he thinking?: Pastor's assistant Joseph Pickens wore blackface during a boxing skit Friday at a Baptist conference held in Kentucky . The head of a Kentucky church is pleading ‘ignorance’ over a ‘blackface boxing match’ skit held during a religious conference this week. Pastor Jeff Fugate, 49, of Lexington, oversaw the National Young Fundamentalists Conference at his Clay Mills Road Baptist Church, but swore to MailOnline he was unaware of the Friday skit’s contents while profusely apologizing for offending anyone. Fugate said Pastor’s assistant Joe Pickens donned the blackface to play Mr T, a black teen played the part of a stunt double and that the whole production has been misconstrued. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . ‘If we did something to offend someone, it was out of ignorance and I apologize,’ Fugate said in one of more than a dozen apologies during his roughly 10 minute conversation with this reporter. The pastor said that Pickens plays the villain in skits every year and that the skits have never cleared through him before, this year was no different. ‘I apologize if I offended someone, I don’t even know as a pastor what those skits will be,’ he insisted. The skit, first made public by Christian Nightmares, involved a blackfaced Pickens fighting a man acting as Curly from the ‘Three Stooges,’ Curly won in the end after a crushing uppercut caused the stunt double to backflip unconscious onto the mat. Let's get ready to rumble!: Pickens (right) squared off as Mr T against another church staffer playing the part of Curly, from the 'Three Stooges' Sparring: The fight lasted three rounds during which the two combatants traded jabs until a stunt double tagged in for Pickens . ‘Curly’ was hoisted into the arm raising his arms in triumph as the churchgoers cheered him on, he was then awarded a championship belt and cheered out of the room. When asked how a white man wearing blackface in the South could not raise any red flags, he pleaded ignorance. ‘I am so sorry that I have offended anyone by doing something that would be ignorant,’ Fugate pleaded. ‘It was innocent, I promise you.’ Head of the church for 23 years, Fugate then tried to distance himself a bit from the whole ordeal by trying to explain Pickens’ inexperience. ‘[Pickens] just graduated last year from our bible college,’ said Fugate. ‘That guy is just a young assistant, he is not even a pastor… he’s just an assistant.’ An email message to Pickens was not immediately returned. His pastor claimed the assistant was visiting sick children, but said he would have him return the message as soon as possible. Dragged off: The stunt double, pictured here being pulled out of the ring, was 'knocked unconscious' by 'Curly' to end the fight . The champion: 'Curly' raises his arms in triumph as he accepts the championship belt . The only public comment from Pickens came in the form of a tweet captioning a head shot of him in blackface, boxing gloves and a robe. ‘#NYFC 2014 fool! It’s about to go down! Who thinks they can contend with the champ?' His twitter feed has since been made private, but reaction was swift and harsh. ‘There are no words. Oh wait… there’s one. He actually used it himself, ‘fool.’ Racist also works,’ tweeted @RevDaniel. ‘I just don’t understand a PASTOR of all people not understanding the wrongness of this,’ @Rev Daniel wrote in a second tweet. Where it happened: The conference took place this week at Clays Mills Road Baptist Church, in Lexington, Kentucky . ‘How far under a rock do you have to live under to think this is okay?’ Asked Mark Archibald. Others said they were ‘speechless’ and ‘shocked,’ another tweeted him directly to ask ‘are you insane?’ Fugate insisted a sizeable portion of his church is black, and that he has ‘absolutely zero racism in [his] heart towards black people.’ ‘I don’t know what to say, I didn’t mean to offend anyone… I never had any thought of it until I got a couple of twitter messages,’ he continued. When asked if future skits will be cleared through him before being performed, he replied ‘you bet.’","The boxing match was intended to be a humorous skit during the national Young Fundamentalists Conference held this week in Lexington, Kentucky .

"A killer posted an RIP message about her victim on facebook just days after she and her gang tortured him to death. Georgina Smith, 22, pretended to be in mourning for 30-year-old Scott Blackwood, writing that he had 'always been a good mate' and even vowing to make sure his killers went to jail. In fact she and two others, Allan Nicol, 36, and Thomas Moore, 26, had killed Mr Blackwood just four days before by kicking, punching, biting and stabbing him to death. Jailed: Georgina Smith, 22, posted an RIP message on Scott Blackwood's Facebook page just four days after helping to torture the vulnerable man to death . Fake condolence: In the message she posted on Facebook, Georgina Smith called Mr Blackwood her 'best mate' and even vowed to see his killers jailed . He suffered 72 separate injuries including scalds and chemical burns. He . had 13 stabs wounds, three broken ribs, smashed eye socket and . cheekbones and he was strangled. Pathologist Dr Julie McAdam said the head injuries found on Mr Blackwood were like those suffered by car crash victims. Yesterday Nicol and Moore were found guilty of murdering Mr Blackwood in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, on July 3 or 4 last year. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve at least 20 years each. Victim: Vulnerable Scott Blackwood was found with 72 separate injuries including chemical burns, 13 stab wounds, three broken ribs, a broken eye socket and cheekbone . Judge Lord McEwan said: ‘This was a scandalous, disgraceful and horrific attack on a young man, including what amounted to torture.’ Smith, 22, was convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide following a five-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Mr Blackwood (pictured) was dragged from Nicol's house before being killed on his own property . Witness Sean Sinclair, 21, said he went to Nicol’s home on the night of the horror and discovered a badly beaten Mr Blackwood. He said Moore stood over Scott armed with metal pole covered in blood. In a police interview he added: ‘Tommy hit Scott with the barbell. Alan started laying into Scott on the side of the legs. Georgie was shouting “finish him, finish him”.’ Nicol then began 'panicking' about the amount of blood in his house, so the attackers decided to drag Mr Blackwood two doors down the street to his own home where they continued the attack. Sinclair added in the interview: 'Scott could not stand, so he could have already been dead.' Sinclair recalled Scott falling down stairs and Nicol claiming he 'deserved' it. Scott was then hauled back upstairs before being tied to a bath and his ankles bound together with a dog lead. In the interview, Sinclair told police: 'Georgie then got a bottle of turps [solvent] and when she came back, she poured it all over him. 'She tried to set him on fire using a lighter - but I stopped her because it was not happening.' The jury heard Moore again yelled that Scott 'f****** deserved it' and that Smith 'was agreeing'. Moore claimed he would take the rap as Smith was pregnant - though this turned out to be a lie. In a police interview Smith said the incident was sparked by Moore hitting Scott on the nose with a metal bar. Smith (left) was found guilty of culpable homicide and will be sentenced this month, while Thomas Moore, 26 (right), and accomplice Allan Nicol, 36, were found guilty of murder and given 20 years in jail . She said: 'I could hear the sound of bone crunching and Allan was shouting at Scott: ""Lick your blood..."" 'Scott was shaking and crying. Allan stamped on his face. Part of his ear was bitten off.' After Blackwood was dead, his killers went back to Nicol's house and washed their blood-stained clothes in a bid to escape justice. Nicol and Moore showed no emotion as they was lead away to the cells. Smith will be sentenced next month.","Georgina Smith 22, posted message on Scott Blackwood's Facebook .

The robot's record-breaking time beat the previous non-human record of 5.27 seconds, which was set by the machine's predecessor, the Cubestormer 2, over 18 months ago . Before that, the record stood at 10.69 seconds - achieved by a robot built by final year computing students at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia in 2011. The Cubestormer 3 was built over 18 months by engineer co-designers David Gilday and Mike Dobson who were working with technology company ARM. The machine uses an ARM-powered Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone to analyze the cube and instruct four robotic hands to do move the elements of the cube. Speaking before the challenge, Dominic Vergine from ARM, said: 'We are very confident the robot will break the record. 'The new robot can think three times faster than its older brother. The record-breaking attempt is a bit of fun for us.

Robot: Cubestormer 3 solved a Rubik's Cube in 3.253 seconds - beating the Cubestormer 2's record of 5.27 seconds. About 65,000 schoolchildren attend the event - with organisers hoping a variety of showcases, talks and events will inspire them to pursue a career in science and technology. The Big Bang Fair also hosts the finals of the National Science + Engineering Competition - which rewards schoolchildren who have already excelled in science at school. The event is perhaps inspired - in its title at least - by the hit US comedy show The Big Bang Theory, which follows the lives and careers of a group of young, nerdy scientists. The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Erno Rubik. It was originally called the Magic Cube, but was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980. It is widely regarded as one of the best-selling toys of all time - having sold 350million units in 2010. The fastest human time to solve a cube was set in March last year by Mats Valk of the Netherlands who completed the challenge in an impressive 5.55 seconds. Amazingly, some talented fans can complete the cube with one hand - such as Feliks Zemdegs who holds the single-handed completion record of 9.03 seconds. Another top solver Fakhri Raihaan can complete the toy with his feet in just 27.93 seconds.

"The final words heard by Malaysian air traffic controllers from the cockpit of missing flight MH370 were 'All right, good night', it has been revealed. One of the pilots is reported to have made the comment over radio transmission as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace. The flight is then said to have disappeared from radar screens following the comment. The news comes as the first photograph of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah has emerged. Scroll down for video .

Indonesian Air Force personnel aboard an Indonesian Air Force military surveillance aircraft over the Malacca Strait as they search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Malaysian civil aviation officials revealed the comment made by the pilot while speaking to passengers' relatives and friends at a Beijing hotel, The Straits Times has reported. The search for the jetliner, which vanished on a flight between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing early Saturday morning, was expanded further into the Andaman and South China Seas today, with authorities no closer to explaining what happened to the plane or the 239 people on board. A senior Malaysia Airlines executive also said today that the airline has 'no reason to believe' that any actions by the crew caused the jetliner's disappearance. With no concrete evidence to explain the plane's disappearance, authorities have not ruled out anything. Police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, said the captain in charge of the flight was a very seasoned pilot with an excellent record. Police in Malaysia have said they had nine eyewitness reports of aircraft 'noise and lights' being seen in the north-east of the country, near the border with Thailand, after the plane's last recorded sighting on civilian radar systems .

'There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude,' Dunleavy told Reuters in an interview. 'We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft.' Dunleavy said he was sceptical of a report by a South African woman who said the co-pilot of the missing plane, Farid Ab Hamid, had invited her and a female travelling companion to sit in the cockpit during a flight two years ago, in an apparent breach of security. 'Because just getting into that area requires you to go through the secure doors that we have in the cabin all the time,' he said.

'And not only would that have been unusual, but it also would have meant you'd have to walk by our cabin crew as well, and have the code to get through. So I'm dubious, but I'm going to let the authorities investigate and tell us what happened.' The airline earlier said it was taking seriously the report by the woman, Jonti Roos, who said in an interview with Australia's Channel Nine TV that she and her friend were invited to fly in the cockpit by Fariq and the pilot of a flight between Phuket, Thailand, and Kuala Lumpur in December 2011. The TV channel showed pictures of the four apparently in a plane's cockpit. The airline will give $5,000 per passenger to cover hotel expenses of relatives awaiting news, Dunleavy added. The relatives, who have been staying at hotels near a Beijing airport since the plane went missing on Saturday, have angrily accused the airline of keeping them in the dark. Malaysia Airlines said at least 152 of the 227 passengers on flight MH370 were Chinese.","Pilot said to have made comment as plane passed into Vietnamese airspace .

"It is regarded as one of the world's safest and most popular jets, which comes complete with a range of technologies designed to keep it in touch with air traffic controllers on the ground. Fitted with an ASD-B flight transponder which, unlike the GPS in a car, broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic controllers every second, the Boeing 777 would appear to have the necessary technology to prevent it disappearing completely without a trace. Yet early Saturday morning, this is precisely what happened to Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, as it made its way, 35,000 ft in the air, from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The service is being offered to 11,000 planes already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, stock image of a Boeing 777 cockpit is pictured. The firm claims the service will cover 'virtually 100 per cent of the world's long haul commercial fleet' The plane would also have been fitted with an indestructible black box recorder and a beacon to continue transmitting its location should it land in water . The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER that disappeared from air traffic control screens Saturday (2011 file picture) The transponder on the plane, which is also fitted with an indestructible black box recorder and a beacon to continue transmitting its location should the aircraft land in water, should provide air traffic controllers on the ground with the aircraft's speed, altitude and direction, according to Tom Clarke, of Channel 4 News. But the signal from the transponder appears to have been lost at about 1.20am, without a change in altitude or course, which has suggested to some a sudden event caused the plane to crash. Crews however are also able to speak to their airline through 'discrete radio channels', according to aviation expert John Goglia, writing on the Forbes website. Again, he argues the sudden end to all communication, without a distress signal, suggests a 'catastrophic failure of the aircraft'. He says:  'A complete electrical failure is extremely unlikely because of redundancies in the system, especially the ram air turbine which uses the power of the wind generated by the aircraft’s motion in flight to generate electricity which would power critical navigation and communication systems, as well as flight controls. 'But even if the aircraft had a complete electrical failure, the aircraft could have continued to fly.'

A cabin crew of Division 918 of the Vietnam Air Force is onboard a flying Soviet-made AN-26 during the search operations . He goes on to argue the plane could have eventually flown to an area where it would have been picked up again by radar, concluding it was 'too early to speculate' on what has caused the disappearance. The long-range jumbo jet has helped connect cities at the far ends of the globe, with flights as long as 16 hours. But more impressive is its safety record: The first fatal crash in its 19-year history only came last July when an Asiana Airlines jet landed short of the runway in San Francisco. Three of the 307 people aboard died. Airlines like the plane because it is capable of flying extremely long distances thanks to two giant engines. Each engine is so massive that a row of at least five coach seats could fit inside it. By having just two engines, the plane burns through less fuel than four-engine jets, like the Boeing 747, which it has essentially replaced. 'It has provided a new standard in both efficiency and safety,' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Teal Group. An iPad is used to support orientation by a military official inside a Vietnamese Air Force plane during search and rescue operations for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight . Vietnamese military personnel prepare a helicopter for a search and rescue mission for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight . 'The 777 has enjoyed one of the safest records of any jetliner built.' Besides last year's Asiana crash, the only other serious incident with the 777 came in January 2008 when a British Airways jet landed about 1,000 feet short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport. Malaysia Airlines did have an incident in August 2005 with a 777 flying from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's largest city. While flying 38,000 feet above the Indian Ocean, the plane's software incorrectly measured speed and acceleration, causing the plane to suddenly shoot up 3,000 feet. The pilot disengaged the autopilot and descended and landed safely back in Perth. A software update was quickly made on planes around the world. Malaysia Airlines has 15 Boeing 777-200ER jets in its fleet of about 100 planes. The first was delivered on April 23, 1997, and the most recent on December 13, 2004, according to Boeing. The 200ER is one of four versions of the 777.","Plane's transponder should provide information to air traffic controllers .

Cantona was famously arrested and convicted of . assault in January 1995 for kung-fu kicking a Crystal Palace fan. The incident happened during a match at Selhurst Park, when the fan hurled abuse at him after he was sent off. Cantona . was sentenced to two weeks in jail. When that was reduced on appeal to . 120 hours’ community service, he reacted with a bizarre remark, telling a . Press conference: ‘When the seagulls follow the trawler, it’s because . they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.’ Football legend Eric Cantona is confronted by a police officer in North London yesterday . Witnesses called police, who arrived shortly before 1pm and arrested the controversial ex-player on suspicion of assault .

Amari-Jade Robinson was driving past the scene near Regent's Park and . at first thought the uniformed policeman was a football supporter. He said: 'I thought he might be a fan and wanted to just speak to him.

'I . was stopped in traffic for around three minutes and at first I didn't . think he was getting in trouble, but then he seemed to be a bit . frustrated. 'He attempted to walk away and looked a bit frustrated but the officer went in front of him. He was side stepping to block him. 'He . seemed a bit frustrated at first, moving his arms, but then he seemed . to calm down and talk to the officer - it looked like he was trying to . explain something.' Mr Amari-Jade then drove on and said he did not see what happened with Cantona after that. Other witnesses said they saw police cars outside the Queens pub in Regents Park Road, where Cantona is thought to have had lunch. A builder, who did not want to be named, said: 'I went to move my van at about 12ish and saw Eric outside the pub. Cantona captained United in their successful 1996-97 season and scored the winning goal in the 1996 FA Cup final against Liverpool . 'He was with two people and had a pint in front of him but didn't seem drunk at all.' A . local shop owner said she saw two cops parked up outside the pub around . midday - but didn't see the footballer getting arrested. Workers at the pub refused to comment on the incident yesterday. Cantona has become well known for his philosophical one-liners. Here is a selection of some of his best:- . On . his achievements: 'I am searching for abstract ways of expressing . reality, abstract forms that will enlighten my own mystery.' On life: 'He who has regrets cannot look at himself in the mirror.' On his looks: 'If someone is too perfect they won't look good. Imperfection is important.' On education: 'I didn't study; I live.' On . his career: 'My best moment? I have a lot of good moments but the one I . prefer is when I kicked the hooligan (at Crystal Palace).' The .

Appeal, where judges reduced his two-week jail term reduced to the . community sentence. Cantona, who was worshipped by Manchester United fans as 'King Eric' and 'Le God', became as famous for his bizarre outbursts off the pitch as his performances on it. He has stayed in the public eye since retiring from football and starred as himself in the 2009 film Looking For Eric, directed by Ken Loach. He recently returned to screens in a tongue-in-cheek TV advert for French beer Kronenbourg 1664, which claimed hop farmers in the Alsace region of France are treated as well as footballers. But the ad was engulfed in a row when the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the beer. The watchdog found the adverts misled viewers into thinking that the entire brewing process took place in France.","Police called after the ex-player attacked a man in north London .

The murder of Mrs McConville remains the most famous of the 'disappeared' during the conflict. Mother-of-ten Jean McConville, 37, (left) was abducted from her Belfast home and shot in 1972 . At the age of 37, she was taken from her home in Belfast in December 1972 soon after being seen tending a wounded British soldier. Wrongly accused of being an informer, she was shot dead. Her body was found 31 years later. She was one of 16 people buried secretly across Ireland by a gang called The Unknowns for the same charge. An investigation carried out by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman years later found that she was not an informer.

"Former Cumberland Valley teacher Emily Nesbit, 31, was charged Friday with engaging in a sex act with a student . A high school teacher has been accused of performing a sex act on a student in her classroom. Emily Nesbit is also alleged to have sent photos of herself partially undressed to the 18 year old as well as exchanging text messages where she said she wanted sex. The 31-year-old is facing up to seven years in jail after being charged with institutional sexual assault. While the victim is at the age of consent officials in Pennsylvania said his age was irrelevant where teachers are accused of sexual misconduct with their students. Nesbit, an 11th grade English teacher, came under suspicion after another student noticed the text messages from her on the boy's cell phone. Court documents reveal that Nesbit and the teen were in regular contact for two months. Nesbit, who was the student's English teacher at Cumberland Valley High School in Cumberland County,  sent him text messages that police said implied she had a desire to have sex with him. They also exchanged photographs of each other in various states of undress, police said. Nesbit confirmed to performing the sex act with the student in an interview with police. Her lawyer Brian Perry said she had made ""a series of bad decisions at a low point in her life."" Charges were brought against Nesbit within days of officials being alerted. The student victim was interviewed within hours of the police being tipped off and Nesbit, from South Middleton Township, resigned her position on Wednesday. Scroll down for video .

'There's nothing more important for our youth than how we educate them and put them out into the world.' 'This was not a difficult decision (to bring charges),' Freed added. Fred Withum, superintendent of the Cumberland Valley School District, said Nesbit's arrest had caused concern for parents and other students. 'While we know that public schools are a reflection of society, the Board of School Directors, parents, educators, the community and our students expect that the Cumberland Valley School District is better,?'

"Scotland Yard chiefs yesterday faced damaging claims that junior officers are routinely bullied to meet ‘draconian’ performance targets. The allegation followed a report by the Metropolitan Police Federation, the organisation which represents more than 30,000 officers in the capital. It said there is a ‘culture of fear’ in Britain’s biggest force because of the relentless pressure on officers. Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne said since the force had introduced a 'more accountable way of doing things', crime rates had reduced by nearly 10 per cent . The Federation, which drafted its report after interviews with 250 officers, called some targets ‘meaningless’ and ‘unrealistic’. Insiders believe it is only a matter of time before an aggrieved employee takes commanders to a tribunal over bullying claims. But a senior Scotland Yard officer denied the allegations. Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne told Radio 4’s Today programme that it was the Met’s job to bring down crime and since it had introduced a ‘more accountable way of doing things’, crime rates had reduced by nearly 10 per cent. Scotland Yard chiefs face damaging claims that junior officers are routinely bullied to meet 'draconian' performance targets . The bullying claims place extra scrutiny on Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who is facing criticism over shredding corruption files, as well as allegations his force had manipulated crime figures. John Tully, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said his organisation’s report painted a ‘devastating’ picture of life at Scotland Yard. He told the Today programme that officers who missed targets were put on a ‘hit list’, with some facing potential misconduct action. ‘It’s correct that we are measured on what we do. Whether or not it’s an absolute must that there are performance-driven targets I think is questionable,’ Mr Tully said. One officer, he claimed, said he had to arrest at least four people a month and had to do ten stop-and-searches, one of which had to have a ‘positive outcome’.","Damaging allegation followed report by the Metropolitan Police Federation .

The following year, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner dressed as Batman breached security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. Former Met boss Sir John  Stevens described the security breach at the time as ‘unacceptable’. In 2009, Buckingham Palace suspended a chauffeur after undercover News of the World reporters gained access to highly sensitive areas of the building. Two journalists, who were posing as Middle Eastern businessmen, are said to have been waved inside at a police checkpoint, without security checks, and one of them even sat in the Queen’s state Bentley car. Arguably one of the most  serious incidents occurred last September, however, when a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary inside Buckingham Palace. Two days later, jittery officers were forced to apologise to Prince Andrew when they challenged him at gunpoint as he took a walk in the palace gardens. Despite these fiascos, according to Metropolitan Police insiders, Lord Loughborough is a great favourite of the Queen. As one former very senior Met officer once said: ‘Peter speaks her language’. Security scandal: The police chief oversaw the bungled response to last year's Buckingham Palace break-in . Popular: Despite a series of hiccups, he is a favourite of the Queen (right) and now, seemingly, Charles (left) A Clarence House spokesman said: ‘Commander Peter Loughborough was the successful candidate in a very large field. His credentials spoke for themselves.’ Lord Loughborough, who will be entitled to a full police pension, will earn in excess of £100,000 a year in his new role. Details of his salary, which is paid by the Duchy of Cornwall, are not made public but his opposite number at Buckingham Palace earns £122,000 a year.","Commander Peter Loughborough is to become Master of Clarence House .

"A British-based company have been accused of falsely using an American bikini model to advertise their weight-loss supplement. Photographs of the stunning transformation of Brandi Wisdom from obese to a model figure have been used to promote a weight loss supplement. But the man who trained the 34-year-old mother-of-one has said that she had never used the weight loss supplement. A British-based company after being sued by a Kansas gym owner after photographs of the stunning transformation of Brandi Wisdom (pictured) were wrongly used to promote a weight loss supplement .

Mr Lacerte, who runs the Hitch Fit Gym in Kansas City, said Wisdom had never used the supplement and transformed her body with a dietary plan and exercise. He said he has contacted the company to demand they remove his client's photo. Having waited almost a week in vain for the company to remove the photo he is now taking legal action. Ms Wisdom, 34, looks incredible after her dramatic five-month transformation with the help of a personal trainer . 'We teach how to work hard, how to eat right, how to make the right choices and when a company goes and steals something that was ours and slap their label on that and try to sell product ... it is wrong. It is unethical. It is illegal,' Mr Lacerte said. 'I'm going to continue calling this company until I take it down and take it even steps further through social media,' he said.

"Multi-millionaire Roisin Isaacs has given an inordinate amount of time and energy to two places in recent years. One is the deprived Hilltown quarter of Dundee. The other – her private passion – is Pennlands Kiln. The farmhouse, dating from 1862, was in a dilapidated state when she bought it, but she has devoted the past years to restoring it to its full glory. Northern Ireland-born Roisin, who made her fortune in occupational health after moving to England at 18 to study as a nurse, took part in Channel 4’s Secret Millionaire series in 2009. Roisin Isaacs at her Farnham Common home, Buckinghamshire. Mrs Isaacs spent £750k to bring the Victorian gem back to life . She lived on job-seekers’ allowance in Dundee, using the city’s food bank, while learning about the work of certain charities there. She ended up donating £40,000 to two of them. ‘I was brought up by my grandparents in Bessbrook, near Newry, in very humble circumstances,’ she says, pouring tea in her comfortable drawing room. ‘And being in Dundee brought back memories of those days, when my grandfather, a gorgeous guy, also struggled to get the next meal on the table. It struck me that I should give something back. By the time I returned home to Pennlands Kiln, I was less of a capitalist and more of a philanthropist.’ Roisin, 59, first saw Pennlands Kiln, which stands in glorious isolation outside Farnham Common in leafy Buckinghamshire, in 1998. The dining room and kitchen area at the stunning house . She paid £700,000 for the property and, even though it had a horrible 1970s look and birds were actually nesting in the upstairs rooms, she immediately wanted this to be the house where she would live. So she forked out another £750,000 on a renovation project, hiring top London interior designer Beverley Barnett and reading up on the property’s history to ensure none of the changes damaged the fabric of the house. Now Pennlands Kiln is a more chic version of the Victorian original. The drawing room, which had the appearance of a cheap mock-Tudor saloon bar when she first saw it, is now tastefully decorated in creams and gold, with an impressive open fireplace. Across the hall and down the corridor there is a tiny sitting room on the left which Roisin describes as ‘the smallest cinema in the world’, and opposite is a dark, formal dining room. ‘People used to design rooms for different times of the day,’ she says. ‘And this is a night-time room.’ Straight ahead there is the white-washed farmhouse kitchen with its light oak furnishings and huge range. According to her research, the farm labourers in Victorian times would call by for their food – and be handed it out of the kitchen window. She paid £700,000 for the property and, even though it had a horrible 1970s look and birds were actually nesting in the upstairs rooms, she immediately wanted this to be the house where she would live. Now Pennlands Kiln is a more chic version of the Victorian original . Next to the kitchen the farm animals’ winter quarters have been turned into a high-tech office where Roisin’s partner Andrew Griffiths pores over computer screens, with the family’s pair of Tibetan terriers, Blarney and Willie, at his feet. One recurring feature in the house are the stencilled mottos and quotations which adorn many of the rooms. One of these – ‘Happiness unshared is scarcely happiness’ – seems particularly apt for this Secret Millionaire. What, I wonder, did she learn from making the documentary? ‘I learnt that poverty and hunger are very dangerous,’ she says, leading the way out into the gardens. Roisin Isaacs appeared on the Secret Millionaire in 2009. She lived on job-seekers' allowance in Dundee, using the city's food bank, while learning about the work of certain charities there. She ended up donating £40,000 to two of them . ‘If you can’t eat, you can’t think. If you can’t think, you can’t work and if you can’t work, you can’t help yourself.’ However, Roisin does not believe food banks and financial handouts alone will solve the problems of the country’s poor. ‘It’s a generational thing and we have lost some of our skills base,’ she says. ‘People should be taught in schools how to budget and how to make, say, a broth from inexpensive ingredients. Maybe that’s not the job of the teachers – maybe the charities should do it. But somebody must provide an education at this level.’ Although she was on The Secret Millionaire, there is nothing remotely hair-shirt or holier-than-thou about Roisin. A self-confessed party lover, one of her happiest memories of her time at the house is of the fancy-dress dance she held two years ago, when she packed 75 people, all in Victorian costume, into a giant marquee in the grounds. She also has a penchant for creating ‘refreshment’ areas outside. A self-confessed party lover, one of her happiest memories of her time at the house is of the fancy-dress dance she held two years ago, when she packed 75 people, all in Victorian costume, into a giant marquee in the grounds . There is a special ‘gin and tonic’ table  set above an 18ft waterfall, a champagne-quaffing corner for pre-dinner drinks in a thatched safari hut and an afternoon tea table up on some turrets, next to her hot tub. The property is now on the market for £2.35 million, and sitting in ‘gin and tonic’ corner, looking over this impressive five-bedroom home, it is difficult to resist the question: Why move? ‘I sold my main company last year and although I have a property portfolio and a brand development company to keep me interested, I want to semi-retire,’ she says. ‘I love Billingshurst and West Sussex so I’d like to move there.’ Roisin does charity work – for Alabare, which supports vulnerable women, and the Trussell Trust food banks – which she will continue, but there is also something else that will occupy her: ‘I have one unfulfilled ambition: to write children’s stories.’ hamptons.co.uk, 01494 677744 .","Roisin Isaacs spent £700,000 on house in Buckinghamshire .

"No one could accuse Tinker Bell of being too big for her boots. The week-old Ouessant lamb is thought to be the world’s smallest sheep. Weighing just 2lbs and only 10 inches long, the creature is barely bigger than a pint glass. When it arrived two weeks prematurely at a farm in Durham last week, the lamb could not stand and had to be bottle-fed every three hours by its owners. Tinker bell the lamb, in a wellington boot. Weighing just 2lbs and only 10 inches long, the creature is barely bigger than a pint glass . Tinker Bell is just 0.2lbs lighter than Bobby, a lamb born in April last year that was so tiny it was given the title as the world’s smallest lamb. Tinker Bell arrived last week at the Adventure Valley farm park, where owner Janine Calzini keeps a small flock of Ouessant sheep, the smallest naturally occurring breed in the world. Mrs Calzini said: ‘Our four Ouessant ewes were due to lamb next week but one went into labour early. ‘She was struggling so we had to help pull the lamb out. I thought the lamb was dead, she wasn’t moving. I rubbed her and then she slowly opened her eyes. ‘Usually they try to stand up straight away but she was just lying there. We didn’t think she was going to make it. One week old Tinker Bell with a three week old lamb. The week-old Ouessant lamb is thought to be the world's smallest sheep . ‘We called the vet in straight away and he gave her a booster.’ Henry Sheen, a vet from the Cestria surgery in Chester le Street, near Durham, said: ‘It was the smallest newborn lamb I’ve ever seen, by far. ‘I put a tube in its stomach to give it some colostrum (first milk), which is full of antibodies, to boost its immune system and get its stomach ticking over.’ Mrs Calzini added: ‘As she was two weeks’ premature her mother didn’t have milk for her so we had to bottle feed her every three hours, but with a lot of love and care from my 10-year-old daughter Alessia and the rest of the Adventure Valley team we have been able to nurse her back to health. ‘We decided to call her Tinker Bell because of her size.’ Tinker Bell arrived last week at the Adventure Valley farm park, where owner Janine Calzini keeps a small flock of Ouessant sheep, the smallest naturally occurring breed in the world . Lambs should generally weigh between 3kg (6.6lbs) and 5kg (11lbs) when they are born.Vet Matt Colston, from the Sheep Veterinary Society, said the survival rate for lambs drops dramatically when they are born weighing less than 3kg. ‘When they are this small they’re often not strong enough for the first feed,’ he said. ‘They have a large surface area to volume ratio so they’re prone to getting cold, so they need a good strong first feed, and then to feed often, otherwise they get hypothermia.’ The Ouessant breed comes from the small French island of the same name, which is situated 18 miles off the coast of Brittany. Believed to be the smallest breed of sheep in the world, Ouessants stand just 18 inches high compared to more common breeds, which are between 24 inches and 36 inches tall on average.

Most Oessants are black or brown, but they can be white as well. Mrs Calzini, who has kept the breed on her farm for four years, said: ‘They’ve got a funny look - like a ball of fluff with these spindly legs. 'As soon as I saw one I just fell in love with it and knew I wanted to keep them.’ Tinker Bell is now a week old and strong enough to meet visitors, but is still only 12 inches tall and weighs just 4lbs. She is with her mother and the other ewes in the indoor farmyard where visitors can see them. Bobby, thought to be the previous smallest lamb in the world, weighed 2.2lbs when he was born at Fishers Farm Park in West Sussex in April last year. He died the same month.","The week-old Ouessant lamb is thought to be the world’s smallest sheep .

"The NHS faces a ‘financial crisis’ after next year’s general election, a leading think-tank has warned. The King’s Fund said a budget freeze implemented as a result of the recession risked putting the majority of hospitals into deficit. It warned that whoever won next May’s election will need to find more funding for the NHS or face having to make ‘significant cuts to services’. The health policy think-tank reported that two-thirds of NHS finance directors feared their hospital would go into deficit between 2015 and 2016, with another one in five uncertain about the future. 'At risk': The majority of hospitals are at risk of going into deficit as a result of budget freezes . The warning comes amid criticism from Unison that cuts to the NHS could risk patient safety in overstretched hospitals. Unison surveyed almost 3,000 nurses from across the UK, and found that 65 per cent of staff said they didn’t have enough time with patients – with 55 per cent reporting that care was ‘left undone’ as a result. The union also found that 45 per cent of staff had to look after eight or more patients at once during their shift. That compares to 5.2 in Norway and 6.9 in Ireland. The figure in Britain rose to more than 50 per cent for night duty. It is claimed that looking after more than eight patients is considered unsafe – although there are no legal ratios in force. The report, published at Unison’s health conference in Brighton yesterday, found that half of nurses have to work through their breaks on night shifts or stay late to complete their work. It also found that three out of five nurses said they were concerned that fewer staff had led to poor care. Concerns: Unison warns that NHS cuts could put patient safety at risk in overstretched hospitals . Gail Adams, Unison’s head of nursing, said it was a ‘myth’ that night shifts were quiet – but that many organisations denied that and reduced the number of nurses. She said: ‘Nights are busy and often more stressful as less senior staff are around to call on for support or guidance. ‘Some patients need pain medication, some are distressed in an unfamiliar environment, sometimes patients cannot sleep and need someone to hold their hand. The Government needs to face up to the damage it is inflicting on patients and staff by not introducing legally enforceable nurse to patient ratios, and take urgent action.’ Chancellor George Osborne has consistently protected the Health Service from budget cuts. But because of rising costs due to Britain’s ageing population, the need for new technology, and the rising cost of medicine, the NHS in England has in effect had no real rise in spending since 2010 and there are already 65 trusts in deficit. The Health Service’s budget will rise by only 0.1 per cent in 2014-15. Richard Murray, the King’s Fund’s director of policy and former economic adviser at the Department of Health, said the Tories and Labour faced a ‘big political choice’. He told The Independent: ‘In the past each time the NHS has got very close to the wire, governments have found extra money.’ He added: ‘The Health Service now is a very large proportion of overall spending because it’s been protected while other areas of public spending have been cut back. ‘I don’t think any of the political parties are ready for this . . . it’s a difficult one with  deficit reduction so important and the NHS so important – they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.’","Budget freeze has been implemented as a result of the recession .

"'Can't do everything': Professor Karol Sikora said the young should be favoured when it comes to expensive cancer treatments . Expensive drugs should be rationed for the old and frail in favour of people in their prime, one of Britain’s top cancer doctors has said. Professor Karol Sikora, the former head of cancer at the World Health Organisation, said that oncologists are being ‘bombarded by anti-ageist sentiment’. But his comments triggered an immediate backlash among cancer charities, which said it would be ‘blatant discrimination’ to deny patients treatment based on their age. Many new, expensive cancer drugs only prolong life for a few months. Professor Sikora said that as the NHS is under increasing financial pressure, age should therefore be taken into account when deciding who should be treated. He said: ‘You can’t have a rigid cut-off but one has to be realistic – three months of life extension for someone in their 90s has got to be less useful than for someone in their 30s or 40s. It’s getting a sense  of proportion.’ His comments come amid fears that changes to the way drugs are prioritised will see the elderly written off on the grounds that they are of less value to society. Under the proposals by the Government’s drugs rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a drug’s benefit to wider society will be taken into account as well as its advantages to the individual. There are concerns the policy will discriminate against the elderly, in favour of the young who can contribute to the economy through childcare or going back to work. However Nice has insisted it will not only consider age. Controversial: The NHS rationing body, Nice, fears the Department of Health proposals could see younger people deemed a higher priority for drug treatments (file picture) Professor Sikora, a former director of cancer services at London’s Hammersmith Hospital, said although it might be considered ‘heresy’, the time has come to raise the issue of justifying expense. He said that some cancer treatments – such as radiotherapy – were simply too  gruelling to give to the frail and elderly. Concern: Sir Andrew Dillon, the head of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, said he feared the rules would lead to older patients being penalised . However, some of the more gentle drugs cost up to £90,000 for a year’s treatment and in most cases would prolong life for just three months, he said. ‘Do we really expect that people in their eighties with multiple insoluble health problems should have the same technology brought to bear on their cancer as those in their prime? ‘My view is that age should be taken into account when comparing the potential benefits of expensive treatments.’  Ciaran Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer  Support, said: ‘To deny older cancer patients treatment based on their age alone is unacceptable discrimination. ‘We have a duty to treat people as individuals and assess them based on their fitness for treatment, not date of birth.’ Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: ‘We recognise that NHS budgets are squeezed. But our health service exists to treat everyone equally. 'Decisions about who should be treated should be based purely on clinical need, not age – anything else is blatant age discrimination.’ Breakthrough Breast Cancer also called on the Government and pharmaceutical industry to find a way of making new drugs affordable and available to all who need them. A spokesman for Nice said that while age will ‘inevitably come into consideration’ it will never be the deciding factor. Under . the current system, Nice determines the cost of a new treatment by . working out how much it improves and extends  a person’s life compared . to existing treatments. It uses a formula known as ‘quality adjusted life year’ or QALY. One . QALY equals one  year of perfect health, or two years of 50 per cent . perfect health or four years of 25 per cent perfect health. Generally, if the cost per QALY is below £20,000, the treatment is deemed cost effective and approved. If it falls between £20,000 and £30,000, Nice needs ‘persuasion’ to give it the go-ahead. If the cost is more than £30,000, the drug is not normally approved.","Professor Karol Sikora said age of sufferers 'should be taken into account'

"Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein has said underwater search for missing flight MH370 may have to be revised in 48 hours, revealing dwindling optimism of finding Boeing 777 . The next 48 hours in the search for missing flight MH370 will be crucial, Malaysia's Defence Minister said today - a warning that new plans would then have to be made. Mr Hishammuddin Hussein, who is also the country's Acting Transport Minister, said it was his understanding 'that the search effort is entering a critical stage in the next 48 hours. 'Whatever happens in that period, we will then regroup and discuss our next move.' Mr Hisammuddin was speaking in Kuala Lumpur as the underwater drone Bluefin-21 was sent on its seventh mission 1500 miles north west of Perth, Western Australia, to search for any sign of the wreckage of the Boeing 777 aircraft. The Minister's reference to just 48 hours revealed less optimism than comments by Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who had forecast that the search would continue at least until the end of next week. In addition, officials co-ordinating the search also said today that the underwater search would continue for another five to seven days. Despite the differences in the comments by Mr Hishamuddin and those of Australian officials, it became clear today that hopes of finding the wreckage of the aircraft at the bottom of the Indian Ocean were now fading fast. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre which is overseeing the search from Perth said in a statement today that after almost two months without a sign of wreckage the current underwater search has been narrowed to a circular area with a radius of 6.2 miles. The area is located where one of four pings believed to have come from the plane's black box recorders was detected on April 8. 'Provided the weather is favourable for . launch and recovery of the AUV (austomonmous underwater vessel) and we . have a good run with the serviceability of the AUV, we should complete . the search of the focused underwater area in five to seven days,' officials told Reuters in an email. Underwater drone Bluefin-21 sent on seventh mission into water 1,500 miles north of Perth to look for missing jet. The search area has been limited to just 6.2 nautical miles but hopes of finding the craft are fading . Australian PM Tony Abbott previously said the search could continue until next week, but new comments today show less optimism for operation which has now been going on for two months . But there was no indication whether searchers were confident that the search area would produce any clues about the flight - and there was no suggestion what they might try if nothing is found in coming days. Meanwhile Mr Hishummuddin, pointing out that the search operation had entered day 43, said today that searchers had 'pursued every possible lead presented to us at this stage and with every passing day, the search has become more difficult.' He revealed for the first time that Bluefin-21 had captured clear and sharp images of the seabed, but nothing of interest had been found. And while he stressed that operations would not stop, consideration would have to be given soon to 'other approaches' which might include widening the scope of the search and utilising other assets that could be relevant in the operation. 'The search will always continue,' he said. 'It is just a matter of approach.'","Hishammuddin Hussein has warned that next 48 in search will be crucial .

"Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is being investigated by police for failing to stop after colliding with a parked car . Ed Balls is under police investigation after he pranged a parked car and left the scene without informing the owner. The Shadow Chancellor yesterday admitted that he had caused damage to a vehicle while performing a ‘seven point turn’ near his constituency office in Morley, West Yorkshire. He said he took ‘full responsibility’ for the accident but said he was ‘unaware’ that he had caused any damage until he was spotted on CCTV footage. Pictures of Mr Balls’ ageing Ford Mondeo estate clearly show scratch marks on the bumper, but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle. Nevertheless, the revelation that Mr Balls did not come clean about the incident immediately is embarrassing for the Shadow Chancellor. West Yorkshire Police confirmed officers were making inquiries into a ‘fail to stop collision’ on Saturday, April 5. ‘Damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black Peugeot 306. Enquiries are continuing,’ a spokesman said. In a statement, Mr Balls said: ‘I was aware that at one point the bumpers of the two cars touched. ‘But until I was contacted the following Wednesday, I had no awareness at all that there had been any damage to the other car. ‘As soon as I was made aware, I took full responsibility. I have written to the owner to say I was terribly sorry and to reimburse [him] for the necessary repair.’ The Peugeot’s 32-year-old owner Dan Rowley – who has never voted – said he did not realise there was damage until the following day.

"Three NHS surgeons have been banned from performing operations on cancer patients after at least five deaths, it has emerged. Lawyers are also probing another 17 cases in which patients may have died or suffered complications after botched surgery by the men. Despite the ban, the doctors are still being allowed to carry out other surgical procedures for an NHS Trust in Kent. Investigation: Concentrating surgeons performing operation in operating room (file picture) The three surgeons – all who work for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust – have been prohibited from undertaking keyhole surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancer. Five people who underwent the procedure are known to have died but it is feared there could be many more victims of the operations. Families of patients who died after the surgeons used the technique are set to sue the trust for negligence, according to reports in the Sunday Telegraph. They have accused hospital bosses of a cover-up and failing to tell them why their loved ones died. Rosemary Coleman, whose husband Philip died aged 63 after months of agony following a keyhole operation, said: 'I can't believe these surgeons are being allowed to carry out any work at the hospital when there's still so many questions hanging over the way they carried out this procedure.' As well as still working for the trust, the three surgeons, Professor Amir Nisar, Haythem Ali and Ahmed Hamouda are also working privately. No further disciplinary action has been taken against the doctors by the trust itself, even though they have been referred to the General Medical Council. The GMC is now considering whether to investigate their fitness to practice. Fears have been raised that the doctors may have been too enthusiastic about using the keyhole procedure to enhance their own prestige. A 51-year-old man died within half an hour of a second operation held to correct problems caused by an original GI procedure. His partner told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We still don't know if it was the procedure itself that was wrong or if it was the surgeon's technique that was at fault. 'We need a proper explanation so that this never happens again to anyone else.' The trust referred itself to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) after a number of 'unexpected' and 'potentially avoidable' deaths following GI surgery in 2012 and 2013. Following an investigation by the college, the operations were stopped and it was warned the surgeons had 'not been able to demonstrate sufficient attention to the detail of surgical outcomes or clinical decision-making to provide a safe service to patients' with regards to keyhole procedures. Despite pleas from family members, the trust has still not released the full RCS report. A spokesman for the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said: 'The trust accepted and implemented recommendations from the review that the consultants providing this service should no longer carry out laparoscopic upper GI cancer surgery. 'There is no clinical evidence that this should be extended to general surgery that the consultants undertake.'","Lawyers are also probing another 17 cases, it has emerged .

"A man has described the horrifying moment a 'crazed' woman attacked him with her stiletto shoe, breaking his cheek in four places. Dean Roche needed four metal plates screwed into his face after the violent assault, launched on him as he waited in a taxi queue at the end of a night out with friends in Poole, Dorset. The 21-year-old said the woman also lashed out at other men in a taxi queue and appeared to be on a 'rampage'. Dean Roche needed four metal plates screwed into his face after a woman hit him in the face with her stiletto shoe in an unprovoked attack . Mr Roche said he was looking the other way when the woman came at him with her high-heel shoe. The woman is described as white with dark hair, wearing a leopard print top. His right cheek bone was broken in four places by the impact of the heel against his face, leaving him with severe bruising around his right eye. He underwent a three-hour operation to reconstruct his cheek. Mr Roche, a security guard at Asda in Poole, has now been signed off work for six weeks to allow his wounds to heal. Mr Roche pictured left four days after the attack, and right just after the three and a half hour operation . A 28-year-old woman from Bournemouth has been arrested in connection with the assault and released on bail. Mr Roche, from Poole, said: 'I had been out for the night and was waiting for a taxi when a woman came out of nowhere and hit me on the side of my head with a stiletto. 'It was totally unprovoked. I didn't even see her coming, she came at me from the side. 'I have no idea who the woman was, I've never seen her before. She was on a rampage, hitting other people with her stiletto. His right cheek bone was broken in four places by the impact of the heel against his face, leaving him with severe bruising around his right eye . 'I was in agony - I've never felt pain like it. My mate grabbed hold of me and turned me away because he thought I had been hit in the eye. 'I went home and the next morning I went to hospital. Straight away they told me that my cheek had collapsed. 'They took an X-ray and found my cheekbone was shattered in four places. I had to have four metal plates put in my cheek during a three-and-a-half hour operation. 'I've now been signed off work for six weeks.' Detectives are now appealing for witnesses to the attack, which took place in the early hours of April 26, to come forward. Detective Constable Jonathan Sainsbury, of Dorset Police, said: 'There were a number of people around at the time who may have witnessed the incident. 'I urge them to come forward as soon as possible.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dean Roche needed four metal plates screwed into his face after the assault .

"A shot at market success: Tesco will stock coffee capsules from a rival to Nestle's successful Nespresso pod system. File picture . Struggling supermarket giant Tesco has signed a deal with a rival of Nestle's lucrative Nespresso coffee capsules. CafePod will soon be sold in 650 stores throughout the UK. The Putney, London-based brand was set up three years ago and already has its product on the shelves at Waitrose and is sold through major online retailers. Tesco which has been losing ground to both discount stores like Aldi and upmarket rivals like Waitrose, will be keen to dip into this profitable market. Sales of coffee capsules, or pods, in western Europe almost doubled over the past four years, to £3.3bn, according to Euromonitor. Worldwide, the market is estimated at £8.2bn. A free-for-all was sparked after Nestle, the world's biggest food and drinks company, lost its patent covering the Nespresso coffee system after a lengthy legal battle. Now other manufacturers can produce pods that can be used in Nestle's machines, such as CafePod. Nespresso, known for its slick advertising featuring Hollywood actor George Clooney, is one of Nestle's fastest-growing brands and has an estimated £3.3billion in sales every year. Peter Grainger, the South African entrepreneur behind CafePod, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Tesco recognised that we were the first coffee capsule brand to the UK multiples market. 'At the time we were the only brand listed at Waitrose, and so the leader in our field.' Suave: The Nespresso advertising campaign features actor and director George Clooney . The seeds for the deal were sown when the retailer approached CafePod at the 2013 London Coffee Festival. Nespresso has fought tooth and nail to protect Nespresso. In April last year, a British court ruled that a UK manufacturer of coffee pods compatible with Nespresso machines was not infringing patents. In October the European Patent Office revoked a Nestle patent covering a mechanism in Nespresso machines in another attempt to cut competitors out of the market. Coffee fans get can their fix anywhere thanks to the world’s first disposable coffee machine. The innovative product works like a teabag for coffee and promises to brew a quality cup just by adding hot water to the bag. The water mixes with ground coffee then drips through a special filter into another chamber, from which is can be poured into cups. Designer Ulrik Rasmussen came up with the idea from studying teabags after running out of coffee filters for his home coffee machine. He has spent the last nine years developing the product, called Grower’s Cup, which has just launched in Britain, and said it can be used in a range of situations from at home and in the office to outdoors. Ulrik, 46, from Middelfart in the Netherlands, said: 'It all started one morning when I went to make myself a cup of coffee and realised I had run out of filters for my machine. 'I needed my coffee fix and I was getting annoyed that it was so difficult to make a decent cup of coffee. 'As I slammed the kitchen draw shut I noticed some tea bags and I started thinking about why there wasn’t a similar product for coffee. 'I cut up a few tea bags and put coffee grounds inside them and found there was some potential for a similar product so I started doing research into it.' Yesterday it emerged that Tesco is launching a massive counter-offensive against pound shop stores as it battles to stem the loss of customers to budget outlets. The nation’s biggest retailer has begun opening heavily-promoted 'pound shop' areas within its stores in a bid to take on thriving Poundland and other low-cost chains. The new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 Tesco stores, and the retailer plans to increase this figure to nearly 300 over the next few weeks. Aldi’s . sales growth has accelerated to 34 per cent a year, while takings . through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 17 per cent. The . budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle Britain . shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five . years. They have become known for produce, cheap dairy products and top European food and wine. Current British market share of the major supermarkets shows Tesco is still dominant but cheaper options are on the rise . Aldi . and Lidl are targeting people with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus . fillet steaks at £5 each to award winning wine, coffee and cheese. And . own-label tablets from Lidl and Aldi came second and third respectively . in recent tests for the best dishwasher tablets by consumer watchdog . Which? – and they were among the cheapest at 10p per wash. But . while the German chains open shops at the rate of one a week, Tesco . continues to lose sales despite a £1billion turnaround plan. Its sales in the 12 weeks to April were down by 3 per cent on a year ago. Last month it was revealed that . Tesco's profits had fallen for the second year running as its rivals . continue to eat into its market share, which is at a ten-year low. Britain's . biggest supermarket posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits . to £3.3billion in the past 12 months, down from £3.45billion a year . earlier. Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per cent of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago. Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30. But . all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with . Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the . past 12 months. Waitrose . had 5 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also . experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts . for 3.4 per cent of the market. There . is also a perception that with stores such as Waitrose clearly . high-end, and Lidl and Aldi clearly low-end, Tesco is losing out on . shoppers because it is sitting in the middle ground. Meanwhile in January, Steve Smith, who founded Poundland in 1990, revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £1. The . minimum order value is likely to be £23, and a 'click-and-collect' system is being considered, which would allow customers to pick up their . goods at other stores and shopping centres.","Retailer will sell CafePod at 650 of its stores across the UK .

"A greyhound which may be the 'fastest in the world' after it smashed a Sydney track record to win its first race start has been retired to stud because he can earn more money off the track. Shakey Jakey, still a year off his maximum potential racing speed, took an amazing 22-length lead to win Race 6 at Wentworth Park on April 6. Afterwards, an Australian syndicate offered owner David Pringle $700,000. Then he knocked back $1m - which may have been from Chinese investors - after consulting with his family and deciding to retire Shakey Jakey to stud. Meanwhile, Mr Pringle lives in a humble fibro house while the prized greyhound and his mother live in a comfortable brick kennel. 'It was a thrill because he scored the most prestigious win in the country on one of the hardest tracks in the world and he didn't beat the record, he smashed it,' Pringle, a third generation greyhound trainer, told the MailOnline. Scroll down for video . The 'fastest dog in the world': greyhound Shakey Jakey, pictured (above) with owner David Pringle on his property and greyhound farm in Central western NSW, was retired after just one, stunning win to  become a stud dog because he can earn more money breeding than on the track . Second generation champion: Shakey Jakey was sired by Collision out of champion Kiacatu Pearl, who owner Graham Pringle produced by spending the Federal Government $1800 baby bonus for his first child, Bailey, on stud fees . And they're off: Shakey Jakey (above, second from right in the striped coat) takes off on his first race start at Wentworth Park in Sydney on April 6 . 'But you gotta keep going mate. You can't just sit around hoping that every day you can feed your family. 'He just might earn more at stud, so it's worth taking the risk. If you didn't take risks you wouldn't be in the game and that's in my blood.' Shakey Jakey has champion bloodlines which go back four generations to a dog called Worth Doing, which belonged to Pringle's father. Pringle, 32, lives in an old fibro house at Clergate, near Orange in Central Western NSW with his wife, Danielle, and three young children, Bailey, Harry and Bonny. His 20 dogs live in a heated, double brick kennel on the property. Early lead: it soons becomes obvious that Shakey Jakey, not yet a two-year-old, is blitzing the field in Race 6 . Blitzing it: there's no catching Shakey Jakey as he rounds a corner and his lead stretches even further . Coming into the straight: With only a few metres of the 520m race to go, Shakey Jakey has all but beaten the bunny, winning by a thumping 22 lengths over next place getter Passenger, Emily's Sweet coming a poor third . When their elder son Bailey was born, the Pringles received an $1800 Federal Government baby bonus, which they used to buy semen through a stud service to produce a female dog, Kiacatu Pearl, Shakey Jakey's mother. Kiacatu Pearl won several races at Wentworth Park before being mated with another fast greyhound, Collision. Shakey Jakey was one of their litter of 11. 'As he got older, he got faster and faster,' Pringle said. 'He had his performance trial at Bathurst in March and he broke the trial record there. 'Wentworth Park is a hard track because of its configuration and sharp corners. The Australian track record over 515m is 29:30. Wentworth is 520m and he did 29:07.' Shakey Jakey's maiden performance, which had race callers repeating the result in wonder, made world headlines in greyhound news. 'Some of the fastest dogs in the world come from Australia and every other country wants Australian dogs, particularly the Chinese,' Pringle said. 'The Chinese, they love it. They are massive punters of greyhounds and run dogs two out on private tracks over there, but keeping the family bloodline going here is sentimental to me.' Pringle visits Shakey Jakey at the Rocky Ridge Stud on the NSW Central Coast, where the black dog is allowed to service 216 bitches a year, each with an 'introductory' fee of $1650. The figure may double within 12 months, earning him more than $700,000 annually. If the dog had continued to race, Pringle estimates he might have broken ten track records and scored 20 wins out of as many starts. 'But you've got to think of the future,' he said, 'I've now got to find another dog and do the same thing.'","Greyhound Shakey Jakey won its first and only race with amazing 22-length lead .

"A Canadian hiker has released a video of what he thinks could be Sasquatch in the mountains near Squamish, British Columbia. The video was shot by Myles Lamont two years ago while he was hiking in the Tantalus Range, north of Vancouver. Now that it has been posted on YouTube, more than 260,000 people have viewed the footage. Scroll down for video . Standing out: The video shows a black dot of a figure apparently moving up the slope of a snow covered mountain . Is this the beast? A Canadian man who claims he filmed a possible sasquatch while hiking in the Tantalus Range near Squamish, B.C. two years ago is getting thousands of hits on YouTube after recently uploading the footage . A memorable trip: Mr Lamont was hiking with some friends in the Tantalus Range, British Columbia, north of Vancouver two years ago when he encountered the mysterious creature . Mr Lamont claims he only uploaded the video for the benefit of a couple of friends. 'We had no intention for it to gather the interest it has. We are not claiming this to be anything other than a strange encounter.' The video shows a small black dot of a figure reportedly moving up a mountain. 'Pretty sure this is Sasquatch down there,' said Mr Lamont on the video recording. 'I can't see it very well. It's this little black dot walking in the middle of the snow in the middle of nowhere.' Mr Lamont says he was able to view the . subject far better than what the video portrays as it was just a simple . point and shoot camera. 'The contrast was excellent due to the snow . behind the subject,' he says. The video is intriguing because the shape does appear to be rapidly moving up the mountain. The great outdoors: The Tantalus Range is a favourite with climbers, and also with photographers and filmmakers - and now it sees, Bigfoots . Can you spot bigfoot? Myles Lamont of Vancouver, Canada, shot this footage in the summer of 2011, but is just uploading it now, and it's garnered almost 260,000 views . Rapid ramble: Less than a minute later, the creature still seems to be moving with incredible pace against a snowy mountain-face . 'If that's human why would you walk up that ridge or that snow line?' Mr Lamont asks. 'Why would he not just go straight down?' 'Good thing we brought beers,' he jokes. 'Maybe we can lure him over here. I don't know how high we are, but we're probably close to 7,000 feet and this guy's just scampering up snow lines like it's no big deal.' He states in his posting that 'the . subject was clearly bipedal and was without snowshoes or a backpack and . wearing all one colored clothing'. 'Movement . over this kind of terrain in soft snow without snowshoes would have . been very difficult and the distance travelled over the given time period . would have been very fast for a human without proper snow travel gear.' Fake? Almost all Bigfoot footage is ¿ grainy and shot from an incredible distance, but it does appear to depict a rather large individual moving at considerably-faster-than-human speed up a snowy slope . Speedy: Whoever or whatever it was covered an vast amount of ground in a very short space of time in the most difficult of conditions . Some other interesting factors are noticed about the unusual recording. 'There was a very steep drop off below where the video was shot, easily a 300m sheer face. We were not equipped with climbing gear and a descent around would have been impossible before nightfall,' Mr Lamont says. He does not believe that the footage is that of a bear or any other wild animal. 'Perhaps the most reasonable explanation for this video is a very ill prepared hiker, hiking up a difficult section of snowline as opposed to a much easier route, one who is very physically fit and able to cover ground in unusually quick fashion and must have had very large feet as we were breaking through snow crust in just our boots.' Although some may question the authenticity of Mr Lamonts' video, over the past five years, the Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence and describe it as a 'serious study.' The group says they'll continue to collect evidence and video, which will be used in a documentary at a later date. Famous: A still from the 1972 Patterson-Gimlin film purporting to show Bigfoot . For many, Bigfoot is considered to be a combination of folklore, misidentification and hoax. Along with the Loch Ness Monster, it is commonly described as a modern-day myth - but that has not prevented a raft of sightings throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds. More recently, the Sasquatch Genome Project spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years. In the last 12 months alone there have been several reported sightings, although not all have gone uncontested. In October last year an apparent Bigfoot sighting in Pennsylvania was labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to be a huge tree stump. Hiker John Stoneman claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven-foot-tall ape-like beasts through the trees, just yards from a main road in Kinzua State Park near Bradford. But a tipster told HuffPost Weird News either Stoneman was lying or he didn't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers. In the same month it was reported researchers at the Sasquatch Genome Project screened what they claimed was conclusive evidence that the creature exists. During a news conference in Texas, the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘never before seen HD video’ of the supposed ape-like creature. The footage consisted of very short, grainy and out-of-focus clips of various apparently human-like, hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in Kentucky. The announcement came just one week after a map was released which plotted out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years. A map was released in September last year which plots out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years . PhD candidate Josh Stevens mapped out the 3,313 possible Sasquatch spots since 1921 and found that people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions than others. The map and data collated by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization show, for example, that Bigfoot has supposedly been spotted three times more often in Missouri than neighboring Kansas. Stevens explains on his website: 'Right away you can see that sightings are not evenly distributed. At first glance, it looks a lot like a map of population distribution.' This makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible Sasquatch viewings. Even so, there are some very bright spots around the Ohio River Valley, Mississippi River Valley, the Sierra Nevada mountains, central Florida and the Pacific Northwest. Yet it gets intriguing when Stevens maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density. As he notes: 'There are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common, despite a very sparse population. 'On the other hand, in some of the most densely populated areas Sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare.' Most of these Bigfoot hot spots are in the Western United States. Stevens acknowledges that 'terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports.'","Footage was captured two years ago but has only recently been published on YouTube .

In the video, the teenager appears to start filming while inside the flat, then moves out onto the balcony two storeys above the road where heavily armed emergency response police have the unit surrounded. After lingering for a few seconds on the balcony - in what perhaps was the moment the boy dropped a note to police below - he goes back inside the flat where he remained for several hours until police managed to free him at 8.20pm. Police broke the siege when they accessed the top level of the multi-storey apartment by standing on ladders. SERT officers then made their way down, holding a bag that had been passed through the window, as the boy exited the building through the ground floor about 15 minutes later. The pair were assessed by paramedics who were at the scene. Police charged a 42-year-old man with drug offences and assaulting police. The mother of the man and grandmother of the boy had earlier told the Gold Coast Bulletin the man's mental illness had worsened in recent days. 'He’s become more aggressive, more psychotic, but it’s a case of how do I get him to hospital,' she said. 'It’s up to the patient to take themself to hospital ... unless a terrible incident like this happens and then it may not be resolved in a good way. 'I haven't known whether that would make the situation worse because of course he’s in there terrified,' she said. Brief moment of freedom: the teenage hostage took the opportunity to break out through the screen door and onto the balcony of the Gold Coast home where he was his father's prisoner for ten hours . Note drop: After lingering for a few seconds on the balcony - in what perhaps was the moment the boy dropped a note to police below - he goes back inside the flat where he remained for several hours until police managed to free him at 8.20pm.

Earlier, the boy, who raised the alarm himself by calling police at 7am to say he was in danger, dropped a folded note from the balcony of the second storey unit to police on the street below, the Courier Mail reported. Police have not revealed what the note said. Officers tossed a device into the unit to enable them to speak directly with the armed man.

"Russia yesterday promised to retaliate if its interests are attacked as Ukraine’s leaders relaunched their ‘anti-terror’ offensive and threatened to ‘liquidate’ armed pro-Russian rebels. With tensions rising and the much-heralded Geneva peace deal in tatters, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Vitaly Yarema said security agencies would target Moscow’s supporters in key eastern cities, driving them from buildings they have occupied for several weeks. He said: ‘Security agencies are working to liquidate all the groups operating in Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and the other towns in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.’ WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Menacing: A pro-Russian masked gunman seen during his duty in Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine. Russia yesterday promised to retaliate if what it sees as its interests are attacked and separatists are driven out .

On guard: Pro-Kremlin rebels in Ukraine were braced for a renewed military offensive by Kiev as US troops headed to region in a show of force after Washington again warned Moscow over the escalating crisis . Tensions: In a rapid escalation of the rhetoric, Russia responded by threatening to invade at least one Ukrainian region if Kiev did halt its plan to take out the separatists . His declaration came after two men, including a pro-Kiev politician, Volodymyr Rybak, were said to have been tortured to death by pro-Russian forces near the flashpoint eastern city of Slaviansk. A disturbing video showed Mr Rybak, a member of the Batkivshchyna party led by former premier Yulia Tymoshenko, surrounded by a mob before being manhandled by several men, including a masked man in camouflage, after he tried to remove the flag of the separatist Donetsk Republic. He appears able to walk away following the intervention of a policeman but Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said he was seen later being bundled into a car. His body was found hours later together with that of an unidentified man. They had been tortured and thrown in a river to drown. Interim Ukrainian leader Oleskander Turchinov cited the deaths as a reason to relaunch the previously ineffective ‘anti-terror’ operation, saying: ‘Terrorists who have effectively taken the whole Donetsk region hostage, have crossed a line, starting to torture and murder Ukrainian patriots.’ Flashpoint: Video has emerged showing Ukrainian councillor Vladimir Rybak (centre) being mobbed by a hostile, pro-Russian crowd before he was captured by masked militia and tortured to death .

He said Mr Rybak’s body carried the . marks of ‘brutal torture’, adding: ‘These crimes are being carried out . with the full support and indulgence of the Russian Federation. 'I call on the security agencies to relaunch and carry out effective anti-terrorist measures, with the aim of protecting Ukrainian citizens living in eastern Ukraine from terrorists.’ It brought an immediate rebuke from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who said Moscow will respond if its interests in Ukraine are attacked. Last night Ukraine said it had flushed armed separatists out of a town in eastern Ukraine as part of the ‘anti-terrorism’ operation. It said the operation took place on the outskirts of Sviatogorsk and that no one was injured. ‘Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation,’ Mr Lavrov said. He accused the US of ‘running the show’ in Ukraine and claimed it was ‘quite telling’ that Kiev had relaunched its ‘anti-terrorist’ operation during a visit by US vice-president Joe Biden. Mr Yarema, speaking a day after meeting Mr Biden, said: ‘We have obtained the support of the United States, that they will not leave us alone with an aggressor. We hope that in the event of Russian aggression this help will be more substantive.’ Poland prime minister Donald Tusk warned: ‘The risk that eastern regions of Ukraine will become detached is real. 'I am afraid we will not have to wait long before we see more acts of the Ukrainian drama.’ Russian gas giant Gazprom has said it will turn off supplies to Ukraine next month unless Kiev pays its debts. That would have a knock-on effect on deliveries to Europe, because much of the gas passes through Ukrainian territory.

"Police have taken cadaver dogs to search sand hills on the NSW Central Coast after they received fresh leads on a man who disappeared 18 years ago in mysterious circumstances, . Ronald Penn, a 61-year-old railway worker, vanished from his Bateau Bay house on October 12, 1995, a short time before he was due to give evidence in court on a violence case. Two weeks after his disappearance, Mr Penn's white Mazda van was found burnt-out in nearby bushland. 18 year old mystery: Ronald Penn, 61, disappeared from his Bateau Bay home on the NSW Central Coast in 1995 and although police believed he was murdered his body has never been found . Fresh clues: After receiving a new lead police took a cadaver dog to the sandhills at Tuggerah Lakes to search for the body of railway worker Ronald Penn who vanished shortly before he was due to give evidence in a violence case . Sighting: A witness has come forward and told police that two indigenous men and a a Caucasian man were seen leaving the site of a burning Mazda van in the bushland area where missing Ronald Penn's burnt out vehicle was found 18 years ago . After receiving fresh information last month, police began a search of sand hills in the Tuggerah Lakes area. Detectives from Strike Force Rankmore, which was formed to investigate Mr Penn’s disappearance, have interviewed a witness who said three men may have been in the near vicinity of Mr Penn’s car shortly after it was set alight around 10pm on October 27, 1995. The witness described two of the men as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander appearance, and a third man as Caucasian. All three were seen leaving the scene of the burning Mazda van in a red Ford Laser hatchback. Detectives also received information suggesting Mr Penn’s body may be buried in the sand hills where they commenced their search with a cadaver dog. Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command crime manager, Detective Inspector David Waddell, said his detectives would continue their inquiries in the ensuing days and weeks. 'We are absolutely committed to solving this case and putting those responsible for Mr Penn’s death behind bars,' Inspector Waddell said. 'Mr Penn’s family and friends have suffered for far too long; they need to know what happened to Ron. 'The information and support we have received from members of the community has been invaluable, and we are very grateful for the help they have provided. 'If there is anyone else out there who can assist detectives, please do get in touch. We don’t need to know who you are; all we need is the information you have to hand. You can contact Crime Stoppers anonymously and your call will be treated in the strictest of confidence.' Investigations have revealed Mr Penn had his clothes and personal belongings with him when he vanished. None of his bank accounts have been accessed and his driver’s licence has not been renewed since he went missing. In a separate case, police divers in central Queensland are preparing to search for the remains of a couple who have been missing, believed murdered, for more than a year. Acting on a public tip-off, the divers will search Lake Awoonga near Gladstone for the remains of Chantal Barnett and Robert Martinez. Detective Senior Sergeant Scott Moon says the Rockhampton couple were last seen in late February or early March last year. Police believe they were murdered. Detective Moon called for anyone with information about the whereabouts of Ms Barnett and Mr Martinez to come forward. 'We are very confident that people residing in Rockhampton know what happened to Robert and Chantal,' he said in a statement. 'Regardless of how trivial you think the information might be, please come forward and speak with police.'","Police cadaver dogs have searched for body of missing Ronald Penn .

"Simon Cowell with his dogs Squiddly and Diddly attending a press launch for Britain's Got Talent . He treats them as if they are his children and used them as part of his ‘baby training’ before becoming a father to son Eric. Now Simon Cowell has installed an electric fence in his back garden to protect Yorkshire terriers Squiddly and Diddly from the threat of a fox attack. The TV personality’s decision, after an urban fox was spotted prowling the grounds of his £12million west London home, saw him branded ‘ridiculous’ by neighbours yesterday. Cowell, 54, bought the puppies last year with his girlfriend Lauren Silverman, 36, and named them after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid, called Squiddly Diddly. The animals have travelled across the Atlantic with them as Cowell works on each country’s version of X Factor and the Got Talent franchise. Yesterday, workmen were seen entering his large detached mansion with electrical equipment. It is thought the wire, which is similar to that used to keep cattle in fields, would produce a small non-fatal shock that would deter rather than injure any foxes. Council officials were consulted before the fence was put up to make sure it did not break local government planning laws. But residents living on the road think it amounts to ‘over-kill’ for two little dogs. The actress Rosemary Macvie, 78, who has lived on the road her whole life, said: ‘He should not be on this street. He has so much money, he doesn’t know what he wants to do with it. ‘[The electric fence] is dangerous for cats. The foxes don’t harm pets – I’ve seen cats see them off when they’re in the garden. ‘Foxes only come out at night, so why doesn’t he shut his little dogs in? hey’ve no right to put up this fence – it’s ridiculous. ‘This used to be a proper neighbourhood once where everyone knew each other.’ Another neighbour, Stathes Kulukundis, 72, a shipbroker who has lived on the road for 40 years, said: ‘We have had foxes in the garden and they go for the rubbish. But there are cat owners living on this street and I can see their point of view that they might be harmed by this fence.’ One neighbour, who owns both a dog and cats, added: ‘I’ve lived here for two years and not once seen a fox. It’s overkill. I don’t think he’s put it up for the foxes – that might just be the excuse.’ Before the birth of his son Eric in February, Cowell revealed that the puppies had free run of his homes. The pair slept either at the foot of his king-size bed or on his head. Cowell and girlfriend Lauren Silverman are concerned that foxes might attack their dogs so have put up an electric fence in their garden to deter the vermin . Cowell has previously revealed: ‘I think dogs are good training for babies. They are still puppies and they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house. ‘This is a bit of a road test for the real thing. Squiddly is the girl and Diddly is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun.’ Last year the puppies embarrassed Cowell after Diddly urinated on the floor of a posh boutique in Beverly Hills, California, and Squiddly did its business on their cream carpet while he was being interviewed. A source close to Cowell and Silverman said: ‘They saw a fox or noticed some fox droppings in their garden and were quite concerned. They love the dogs very much and fear that a fox could quite easily kill them. ‘They have put a wire along one wall where they think the foxes would come from. It’s not fatal but would give a deterrent shock – similar to that used in the countryside by farmers to keep cattle in a secure field.’ A council spokesman said no formal planning permission was needed for the fence.","Dogs named Squiddly and Diddly after his favourite 1960s cartoon series .

"The SAS is set to axe its Land Rover fleet after five decades of frontline service in special forces operations across the globe. After an outstanding record of service, the British Army has decided to retire the ageing Land Rovers and replace them with hi-tech vehicles which can offer better protection to soldiers. It comes as Land Rover prepares to end production of the Defender model - on which military vehicles are based - after 67 years. Its planned replacement is yet to be launched. The SAS is to axe its fleet of Land Rovers after using the vehicles on the frontline for five decades . Land Rovers were used and much-loved by Sir Winston Churchill and for many years the Queen - who also drives them - stood in a military Land Rover when she inspected troops at ceremonial events. Adapted military Land Rovers were used by the SAS to help target Scud missiles during the Iraq war and heavily armed versions of the vehicle were used to hunt Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. Now military procurement chiefs at the MoD’s Defence Equipment and Support Agency are to issue a tender for a replacement, which is expected to be based on the current Husky vehicle - used in Afghanistan. Since it was first introduced the military have purchased almost 200,000 variants of the UK built Land Rover with the most famous being those used by the SAS in the desert. They were nicknamed ‘pinkies’ after their painted camouflage colour designed to blend with the dunes. The Queen - who drives a Land Rover - has often stood in them while she inspects troops, as here in 1951 . Winston Churchill was also fond of the vehicles and is seen here with a Series I . The Land Rover has been sold to armies . across the world with the Australian and American special forces buying . ‘unique variants’ for front line operations. Across the British Army, Land Rovers have been used in Malaya, at Suez and Aden while in Northern Ireland they became they spearheaded the internal security operation on the streets. The Royal Marines mounted anti-tank guns on them, the artillery used a tracked version and during the Gulf war they were airlifted by helicopter into the desert. But while the reliability of the Land Rover was never questioned, the reputation of the vehicle was tarnished when military bosses deployed so-called ‘snatch’ versions to southern Iraq. These had been used as riot vehicles in Northern Ireland. But the Snatch provided little protection against improvised roadside bombs and after a series of fatalities was quickly dubbed the ‘coffin’ by soldiers. It is said the so-called 'snatch' version of the vehicles offered little protection against roadside bombs in Iraq . A senior Army source said the Land Rover had served the military well, but after almost 50 years of service it was time for a change and a vehicle that was more relevant for today’s battlefield. He added: ‘The Land Rover has been the work horse of UK armed forces, but I suspect Afghanistan will be its last operational deployment’. The last of the current civilian Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December 2015. The original Defender workhorse off-roader began life in 1948 as a £450 agricultural aid for farmers. Astonishingly, some three-quarters of the 2 million Defenders ever built since then are still in regular use. Military procurement chiefs are to issue a tender for a replacement, which is expected to be based on the Husky vehicle (pictured) Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover also goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover. The Queen used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953, Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell, while another was used for Pope John Paul II’s tour of England in 1982. And shortly after ending his love affair with young Princess Margaret in the 1950s, former battle of Britain pilot Group Captain Peter Townsend set off on a 57,000 mile journey around the world in his short Wheelbase Land Rover Station Wagon which he completed in 1957 and chronicled in his book ‘Earth, My Friend.’ Land Rover said last night: ‘Current Defender production will end, due to legislation, mid-decade. ‘As a business, we are currently reviewing our options based on the clear company brand vision to develop three product pillars of Luxury, Leisure and Dual Purpose. We have stated our intention to replace Defender but have nothing to add at this time.’","Long-serving vehicles are to be retired after half a century of use .

"A man is due to face court charged with the rape of a girl on a train travelling between Sydney and Penrith earlier this month. The Rosehill man, 30, was arrested on May 7 in Harris Park and has since been charged with 'sexual intercourse without consent,' a police spokeswoman confirmed. Penrith crime manager inspector Grant Healey renewed appeals for witnesses pictured in CCTV released by police to come forward and stressed: 'They were probably doing the right thing.' About the investigation, insp Healey could not reveal extensive detail but said 'it was one of those tricky ones.' The suspect will face Penrith local court on 10 July. Police said 'it's worth noting the witnesses did not see the alleged offence but may have seen either the man or the woman in the lead up.' Investigators earlier released images of the men in the hope that they come forward to explain what, if anything, they witnessed during the attack on her way home from a night out in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross on Saturday, May 3. Insp Healey renewed those appeals and still wished to speak with the witnesses. The woman was heading to Penrith after first catching a 4.40am train from Kings Cross to Central station. At some point on the journey she was allegedly attacked and sexually assaulted by a 30-year-old man. The woman reported the alleged assault when she reached her destination at Penrith station. Horrific: Passengers pictured on a train heading from Central to Penrith could have unknowingly witnessed a woman being raped . Police are seeking up to four people, including the men pictured, who could have unwittingly witnessed the attack on the 21-year-old woman . Police believe as many as four people could have witnessed the alleged attack and are appealing for them to come forward. CCTV images show the first possible witnesses to be two young men aged between 20 and 30. The pair are seen in the footage sitting near each other on separate rows before making their way off the train together. One of the men was wearing a patterned maroon long sleeve shirt, black pants and trainers. One of the possible witnesses, pictured standing, is believed to be between 25 and 40 and was seen wearing a black and green jacket, white shirt, blue jeans, black and white trainers . The second man was wearing a large beige jacket over a white shirt, black pants and back and white trainers. A third possible witness is believed to be between 25 and 40 and was seen wearing a black and green jacket, white shirt, blue jeans, black and white trainers and carrying a blue bag. The fourth witness is a woman wearing black clothing. Police stress that none of the witnesses were involved in the incident, and may have unwittingly been present when the attack occurred. The young woman was making her way home from Kings Cross, when she was attacked on a train from Central to Penrith . Penrith Inspector Harry Goeding said the assault was a serious incident, the Daily Telegraph reported. He also highlighted how brazen the attack was, pointing out that even late-night trains are busy as they brought people back to the western suburbs after a night out in the city. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 and information can be given anonymously. Violated: The victim reported the attack at Penrith station.

"Separatists demanded the end of EU sanctions in return for the release of six military observers seized by militia in eastern Ukraine. The mayor of Slaviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he would only discuss plans to free the six if sanctions were lifted against rebel leaders. Ukraine’s security service now believes a serving Russian intelligence officer - pretending to be a local separatist leader - orchestrated the abduction and is now at the centre of an attempted trade-off over sanctions. Scroll down for video . The mayor of Slaviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he would only discuss plans to free the six if sanctions were lifted against rebel leaders . Officials in both Kiev and Moscow say they have plans to free the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who were seized last week but Mr Ponomaryov claimed this would not happen until newly imposed sanctions freezing assets and banning travel on two separatist leaders are lifted. It came as there were increasing signs last night that the Ukraine crisis was having an effect on key parts of the Russian economy. Russian natural gas exporter Gazprom said further sanctions could disrupt gas sales to Europe and hit its business, while a Russian minister said U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports to Russia would be a blow to Russian companies in the sector. Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned the ‘Iron Curtain’ style sanctions from the United States might harm its hi-tech sector and that the EU was ‘under Washington’s thumb.’ He insisted Russia had no intention of invading eastern Ukraine, adding: ‘This is a revival of a system created in 1949 when Western countries essentially lowered an ‘Iron Curtain’, cutting off supplies of hi-tech goods to the USSR and other countries.’ Detained OSCE observers arrive to take part in a press conference of the pro-Russian separatist leader and self-proclaimed 'people's mayor' of the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov (right) in Slavyansk . Detained OSCE observers. It came as there were increasing signs last night that the Ukraine crisis was having an effect on key parts of the Russian economy . And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin warned that the impact of sanctions in the country’s high-tech sector could impact on US astronauts using the joint space station. ‘If their aim is to deliver a blow to Russia’s rocket-building sector, then by default, they would be exposing their astronauts on the ISS,’ he said. ‘Sanctions are always a boomerang which come back and painfully hit those who launched them, he added. The International Space Station is operated jointly by Russia, the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada. Astronauts and cosmonauts depend on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry them between it and Earth, ever since NASA scrapped its space shuttles in 2011. The US imposed sanctions on 17 companies and seven officials linked to Vladimir Putin’s inner circle - including a career spy who was expelled from London in the Cold War. Mr Ryabkov lambasted White House spokesman Jay Carney who said the targeting of Mr Putin’s inner circle was ‘in response to Russia’s continued illegal intervention in Ukraine and provocative acts that undermine Ukraine’s democracy’ and territorial integrity. ‘We are disgusted with the statement issued by the White House press secretary,’ said Mr Ryabkov. The EU’s top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, last night voiced alarm at the ‘downward spiral of violence and intimidation’ in Ukraine. Officials in both Kiev and Moscow say they have plans to free the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who were seized last week but Mr Ponomaryov claimed this would not happen until newly imposed sanctions freezing assets and banning travel on two separatist leaders are lifted . Hundreds of masked pro-Russian separatists armed with baseball bats yesterday stormed the regional government headquarters, unopposed by police, in the eastern city of Luhansk, 15 miles west of the border with Russia. It was the third government building seized in the past 24 hours as the occupations by Moscow’s supporters showed no sign of ending. Ukrainian forces claim to have unearthed evidence that Igor Strelkov, nicknamed Strelok, who commands pro-Russian forces now in control of Slaviansk, is in fact a serving Russian GRU military intelligence officer. Media reports citing the SBU secret service in Kiev say his real identity is Igor Girkin and that he is a colonel in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed forces. His Russian passport number and address in Moscow were published in Ukraine where intelligence officers say Girkin legally crossed the Ukrainian border in Simferopol on 26 February, when the Crimean parliament was seized.","Mayor of Slaviansk Vyacheslav .

"Relaxing on a beach with an ice lolly on a hot day is a summertime treat people of all ages enjoy. But now two entrepreneurs have started selling lollies strictly for grown-ups – because they’re laced with alcohol. University graduates Harry Stimpson and Noah Greeves, both 23, showcased their cocktail-flavoured lollies – available in Pina Colada or Mojito varieties – in Brighton yesterday. Beach booze: Love Iced Cocktails launched yesterday in Brighton, offering Pina Colada and Mojito flavours . The pair, who have been best friends since their schooldays, launched their business Love Iced Cocktails last year. After scooping a £25,000 prize in an enterprise competition and winning grants from organisations including the Prince’s Trust, they are launching their cocktail-flavoured ice lollies, called Mahiki LIC, this summer. The idea for the business came from Harry’s mother, Maureen, who fancied a frozen Pina Colada as she sunbathed on the beach in Miami. Each lolly, created by a university graduate duo, contains the equivalent alcohol content to a glass of wine . Their formula, developed with professors at Nottingham University, allows the freezing of alcohol at 15 per cent ABV (alcohol by volume), with each lolly the equivalent of drinking one glass of wine. But last night the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, Andrew Langford, warned: ‘They must be very clearly labelled. ‘What we don’t want is for children to have yet another opportunity to consume alcohol.’","Pina Colada and Mojito varietes launched by university graduate duo .

"Charity Stevens seemed like a normal sophomore walking the halls of New Life Christian School in Longview, Texas - except for the fact that she was 34 years old. The woman, whose real name is Charity Ann Johnson, was arrested Monday night- more than six months after she enrolled in the high school pretending to be a 15-year-old orphan. According to school officials, Ms Johnson came to New Life Christian School last October accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth-grader. Scroll down for video . Jarring contrast: Charity Johnson, 34, seen on the left while pretending to be 15-year-old high school sophomore Charity Stevens and right in a booking photo after her arrest . Scam: Johnson enrolled in New Life Christian School in Longview, Texas, last October, claiming she was a home-school student without any prior transcripts . During the enrollment process, Johnson gave the name Charity Stevens and indicated that she was 15 years old. Tamica Lincoln, 30, who took on the role of Johnson's guardian last March, told the station KLTV the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father, who has since died along with her mother. The two women met while working at a McDonald's together. Johnson told Lincoln that she had no place to stay after losing her parents. Lincoln brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home 'as a child,' bought her clothes and did her hair. She even attended parent-teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore’s impressive academic performance. 'She acted like a kid. She did her homework. She got good report cards,' the 30-year-old Longview resident told ABC News. Johnson’s web of lies began unraveling when Lincoln got a call from the head of a group that helps children in need, which the 34-year-old had allegedly tried to join. Playing the victim: Johnson was taken in by a Good Samaritan after allegedly lying to her that she had been abused as a child and that her parents have died . Growing doubts: Tamica Lincoln (left), Johnson's guardian, and her mentor, Ray Ward (right), became suspicious about her identity and went to police . Ugly truth: Her work file indicted that Johnson was born in 1979 and that her last name was not Stevens . The woman told Lincoln that she ran a background check on 'Charity Stevens,' which provided more questions than answers. Lincoln . then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the . McDonald's where both she and Johnson worked. The staffer pulled up the . high schooler's file, which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and . her real name Charity Johnson. Last . Tuesday, Lincoln and the phony orphan’s mentor, Ray Ward, alerted . police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school. ‘Teachers were crying and students were crying, and her best friend just couldn't believe it,’ Lincoln said. School officials said Johnson came in last October as a home-schooled student without any prior transcripts. Officers who responded to Lincoln’s Longview home Monday night asked Johnson to identify herself, and in response she gave them the name Charity Stevens – the same moniker used on her school application. Sticking to her ruse: Hours before her arrest Monday night, Johnson posted this photo of her posing with a horse stature under the Instagram user name Charite Love . Sob story: Ms Johnson told Lincoln, her co-worker at a McDonald's who is four years her senior, that she had lost both her parents and had no place to live . Online persona: On Facebook and Twitter, Johnson called herself 'Charite' and shared photos of herself looking like a teenager . The woman has been charged with failure to identify/giving false, fictitious information. She remains in the Gregg County Jail on $500 bond. Looking at Johnson’s fake Facebook,Twitter and Instagram account created under the nickname Charite, it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes. In the photos posted online, Johnson looks like a shy, fresh-faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure. However, in her booking photo, Johnson dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years, with a lined, puffy face and a tangle of hair.","Charity Johnson, 34, charged with giving police false information by pretending to be 15-year-old Charity Stevens .

"He can go days without using his mobile phone and admits that he isn’t much of a talker. So imagine Robert Shadwick’s shock when he received a mobile bill for £1,046 – as his operator insisted he had been chatting on a single call for 43 hours straight. Mobile phone company EE blocked the 65-year-old from using his phone and even tried to take the money from his bank account by direct debit. Shock: Robert Shadwick received a mobile bill for £1,046, with his operator claiming he made a single phone call lasting nearly two days. EE then tried to take the money from his bank account . Mr Shadwick, a grandfather and retired job centre adviser, said: ‘I was absolutely shocked. When I called EE they said I had made a 43-hour phone call. ‘To do that I would have had to go without sleep for two days, which is obviously ridiculous. ‘I asked for the service to be restored but the firm refused.’ The problem was caused by a call he made with his EE phone to mobile operator 3 on May 10. Mr Shadwick, from Rotherham in South Yorkshire, was checking when the contract on his second phone expired and the call lasted about ten minutes. Ironically, if he had used his 3 phone to make the call it would have been free. Bill: Mobile phone company EE blocked the 65-year-old's phone and even tried to take £1,046.26 by direct debit . He believes that either he or 3 failed to hang up properly at the end of the brief chat. He didn’t use his mobile for another two days, and when he eventually tried there was a message telling him he could not continue. Mr Shadwick, who has a £10 monthly contract which usually covers his needs, said: ‘I’m not very good with mobile phones but I couldn’t understand how there could possibly be a problem because I never get anywhere near the monthly limit on calls that I am allowed. Robert Shadwick says he can go days without using his phone and admits that he isn't much of a talker . ‘I told my son, who used to be a manager with a mobile phone company, and he called EE on my behalf. When he said I owed more than £1,000 I was shocked. ' 'He disputed the amount and the company said it would be investigated. Over the next ten days or so I made several calls to ask how this could be but each time they insisted I owed the money. They said it had to be paid.’ Mr Shadwick checked his bank account online and saw that rather than pausing his direct debit payment while the bill was being investigated, EE was due to take the full amount out. He got the payment stopped. ‘I pay all my bills on time and I have never been in debt,’ he said. ‘I have asked so many times, “Why would I make such a long call?” Whenever I spoke to anyone I got sympathy but no action.’ His phone log did show a call lasting 43 hours, but he believes there should have been an automatic disconnection. As the dispute continued he even got a text stating ‘We’re glad we’ve solved your problem’ – although his phone was still blocked. It took ten days and the intervention of his local newspaper before EE waived the four-figure bill and reconnected his phone. He said in the end EE ‘seemed to accept the logic that I couldn’t possibly have been on the phone for that long’. A spokesman for EE described the case as ‘highly unusual’ and added: ‘Due to exceptional circumstances we have waived all charges for the call and reconnected the phone. The customer is happy with this resolution.’","Robert Shadwick, 65, received a mobile bill demanding he pay £1,046 .

"Former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes, pictured in 2013, was sentenced to a maximum 10 years nine months in jail in Sydney on Friday . Former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes will spend at least the next six years in prison after a Sydney judge sentenced him to a maximum 10 years nine months with a non parole period of six years. The 65-year-old actor was sentenced on Friday after being convicted of 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991. Before a packed gallery at the Sydney District Court, Judge Peter Zahra said Hughes had not expressed remorse. 'His conduct continued over 20 years. [Even] after he was questioned by police in 1986 it continued,' he said. 'The offender took advantage of when he was with victims in social settings in his home or at victims' homes. 'He lacks insight into his offending and he is unlikely to access treatment programs.' Child star Sarah Monahan has reacted to the news by saying she is 'happy' and that she hopes Hughes now 'realises he;s a bad man' Judge Zahra said he had considered the 'substantial effect' of Hughes conduct on his victims who now suffered from constant fear, eating disorders and who lacked the ability to lead normal lives. He added that Hughes took advantage of his daughter Jessica's relationship with female children. 'The offender's conduct was persistent and he exploited the naivety and youth of the children involved,' he said. Judge Zahra said he was required to sentence Hughes according to 'sentencing patterns' at his time of offending in the 1980s and 1990s, when sentences were much lighter. He added that Hughes must have grown more confident as the years went by of his victims never coming forward. The van carrying Robert Hughes leaves the Downing Centre Court in Sydney on Friday . 'He's a very, very bad man': Sarah Monahan (centre, front, pictured with Robert Hughes and the Hey Dad! cast) said people thought [the victims]were doing it for money, publicity or some unknown reason. Now everybody understands we weren't making it up' Robert Hughes' lawyer Greg Walsh said the former actor was in danger in prison from other inmates who had threatened him. Prison authorities have refused Mr Walsh's request Hughes be separated completely from other criminals. Judge Zahra said in the hearing Hughes' partner Robyn Gardiner said he had been abused by fellow prisoners in jail and feared for his safety. Ms Gardiner said Hughes was 'very frightened by the threats he had received' in prison and was at 'significant risk'. Judge Zahra asked Hughes to stand as he was sentenced. The former actor stood up, buttoned his coat and remained impassive as the judge read out the sentence. In court Judge Zahra dealt with each offence, relating to girls aged between seven and 15, one by one. He said the first victim, JP, was the daughter of family friends of Robert Hughes, his wife Robyn Gardiner and their daughter Jessica. Hughes had rubbed her breast several times, rubbed around her vagina and swam naked in her family swimming pool. Judge Zahra said children were entitled to grow up free from predatory conduct. Sarah Monahan told Radio 2GB she was 'happy that all the girls have been believed'. One of Hughes' victims (left) and her father (right) leave court hand-in-hand on Friday . Predator on the set: Judge Peter Zahra told today's sentencing that Robert Hughes wandered naked among Hey Dad cast members (above) and that he placed his hand on the bottom of child star Sarah Monahan (right), exposed his penis to her and after one episode grabbed and touched her intimately while pretending to tickle her . 'It’s a good day,' she said. 'I’m not a vengeful person, but I do hope he realises he’s a very, very bad man. Hughes' lawyer, Greg Walsh, said outside the court hearing the former actor was 'devastated' by his sentence. Mr Walsh said he had visited Hughes in the cells below the Downing Centre Court immediately after the sentence was passed and the former actor was 'very upset and in a state of shock' at the 'very severe sentence'. Status: Robert Hughes has just become one of the most reviled and unsafe people in the State’s prison system: a sentenced child sex offender with an extremely high profile. Home: Hughes will be moved to another prison, but for the moment he will spend 17 hours a day in a six by four metre cell in a protection pod of NSW’s largest prison, the 1000 inmate Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre in Sydney’s west. Welcome: After leaving court in handcuffs and ferried by prison van back to jail, Hughes will be strip searched, and escorted to his cell probably to the sound of inmates yelling out and taunting him about TV coverage of his case. Safety: Being one of the 'lowest of the low' in jail, Hughes will likely be housed among other paedophiles to minimise the risk of assault or murder by an inmate armed with a jail made knife or 'shiv' Food: Dinner will be served to Hughes at 3.30pm in his cell and can be a low fat, low salt and mostly tasteless dish 'chicken casserole',a curry or lasagne. Work: For $60 a week in his prison account, Hughes may get the chance to work with other sex offenders making sheets, curtains or funeral shrouds. Hughes' celebrity agent wife Robyn Gardiner was not present in court. Mr Walsh said Ms Gardiner was back the UK and he had called her to tell her the news and she and daughter Jessica were both 'devastated'. He said Ms Gardiner 'loves' Hughes and the reason she had not attended his sentencing was 'she needed a break'. He said Ms Gardiner 'has been under an immense amount of pressure' and that not being here 'doesn't mean an iota she doesn't love Robert'. 'They have been under virtual house arrest' since Hughes was charged, Mr Walsh said. He said it was a 'crushing sentence'. 'For someone like Mr Hughes who’s 65 years of age, this is devastating.' He said Ms Gardiner would come to Australia to visit Hughes in jail. Two of Hughes' victims left the court house with family members but declined to comment on the sentence. Before the sentencing hearing began Robert Hughes entered the dock wearing a dark grey suit, white shirt and maroon tie . He looked pale and his hair was slicked down. He mouthed 'Hello' at his legal team and sat with his arms folded. In sentencing submissions two weeks ago, a victim's statement read out by the woman's father said, 'I was sexually abused by Robert Hughes in his home, while in his care, multiple times before I was eight-years-old.' Client devastated: Robert Hughes' lawyer Greg Walsh  leaves Downing Centre Court in Sydney on Friday . Family devastated: Hughes' wife Robyn Gardiner (left) and daughter Jessica Hughes (right), seen leaving a Sydney court in March with Hughes, are in the UK and 'devastated' at his sentence . Hughes, pictured arriving at Downing Centre Local Court in March, was convicted of 10 child sex offences  committed between 1983 and 1991 . 'I will never know what my life would be like, how I would view the world, or who I would become as a person. 'I have never truly felt safe ever again. As a child I never wanted Santa to come into my room at night to leave me presents.' The victim statement of Sarah Monahan, a child star of Hey Dad! who now lives in America, revealed the she may never be able to return to Australia as a result of the abuse she suffered at Hughes' hands decades ago. 'I have come to hate the word dad,' her statement read. Hey Dad! cast members (clockwise from left) Christopher Truswell, Julie McGregor, Paul Smith, Sarah Monahan, Robert Hughes and Simone Buchanan . Hughes, 65, was found guilty on April 5 of 10 child sex offences. He was convicted on ten of 11 child sex charges, with the jury being discharged after not being able to reach a majority verdict on the 11th charge. The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault. The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial. Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed. Robert Hughes in Hey Dad!: During his trial for child sex offences against the children of family friends and a Hey Dad! cast member, the court heard from a number of Hughes' former colleagues who accused the former star of repeatedly exposing himself . Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her to swim between his legs and trapping her there. Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself. Hughes denied all the allegations. The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations. Sarah Monahan previously said she 'got away light' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict. The principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! appeared on A Current Affair in early April, following Hughes being convicted of child sex offences. Monahan, who was six years old when she joined the show in 1987, first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010. She went on to repeat allegations on A Current Affair, that she was abused while on the set of Hey Dad! by Hughes. The actress said Hughes' guilty verdict of 10 offences relating to the sexual and indecent assault of young girls in the '80s and '90s 'vindicated' her.","Actor Robert Hughes will spend at least the next six years in prison .

"A 20-year-old man was arrested in Darwin after his naked dancing, singing and rock throwing caused 13 vehicles, including a police car, to crash. He was arrested early on Sunday morning after a number of traffic incidents on Wednesday and Thursday in the Hidden Valley area, just outside of Northern Territory capital's CBD. Reports first surfaced on Wednesday night of a naked blond man throwing rocks at cars on Tiger Brennan Drive, one of Darwin's major arteries. Damage: Police said that 13 cars had been damaged by a naked man who had been dancing and hurling rocks in Darwin . Attack: The man has struck a number of times on the Tiger Brennan Drive in Darwin . During peak-hour traffic on Thursday morning, a two-car crash was followed by an accident involving six vehicles, which police said was due to motorists trying to get a glimpse of their dog squad's search operation for the man, who was not found at the time, the ABC reported. A police car on its way to help with the six-car smash hit another car, and then three cars bumped into one another on the Stuart Highway, where traffic had been diverted. The man was arrested on Sunday morning after a resident called police to report he had trespassed on property. 'He was found asleep in someone's yard,' Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen told AAP. She said it was still a mystery how long the man had been in the Northern Territory or what he had been doing. He was taken into custody for a mental health assessment because police were concerned about his mental and physical state. 'Apparently he did have a pair of shorts on, we don't know where he got them,' Supt Jorgensen said. Police search for clues after a car was damaged in one of the incidents .

"An engineer has discovered a 3,500-year-old tribal gold necklace worth £20,000 in a field full of grazing cows. Part-time treasure hunter David Spohr had given up on his search in the Tarrant Valley, Dorset, and was on his way for lunch after a fruitless morning when his metal detector suddenly sounded. At first glance, he said the dull metal object he unearthed looked to be nothing more precious than a rusty old sardine tin. Engineer David Spohr has discovered a 3,500-year-old tribal gold necklace worth £20,000 in a field full of grazing cows . At first glance he said the dull metal object he unearthed looked to be nothing more precious than a rusty old sardine tin. Little did he know that it was a solid gold Lunula dating back to the Bronze Age . But after wiping off the mud he was shocked to find the object was a solid gold amulet. The unremarkable lump was revealed to be a gold lunula, a crescent-shaped necklace dating back to the Bronze Age and engraved with an ancient pattern. Lunulas - meaning 'little moon' in Latin due to their shape - were rigid necklaces worn by ancient tribal leaders as a symbol of power and authority. The lunula unearthed by Mr Spohr weighs 71.5 grams, and is one of only a handful found in mainland Britain  - and the first to be discovered using a metal detector. Only three others have ever been found in Britain, the last of which was dug up in Wales in 1869. Mr Spohr, 55, a precision engineer,  has now discovered the necklace could be worth as much as £20,000. The find would have been worth even more but it is thought to have been damaged by a farmer's plough. Mr Spohr, from Poole, Dorset, said: 'I headed across the field to get my sandwiches and kept the detector on as I walked. Lunulas - meaning 'little moon' in Latin due to their shape - were rigid necklaces worn by ancient tribal leaders as a symbol of power and authority . The lunula unearthed by Mr Spohr weighs 71.5 grams, and is one of only a handful found in mainland Britain - and the first to be discovered using a metal detector . Mr Spohr, 55, a precision engineer,  has now discovered the necklace could be worth as much as £20,000. The find would have been worth even more but it is thought to have been damaged by a farmer's plough . 'Halfway across I got the signal. I dug very carefully and was quite amazed when I got it out. 'I could see it was yellow and so shiny. I also saw some engraved edges and I realised it was something special. 'We do find a lot of rubbish and you never think you're going to find a lump of gold. 'I have found some good things in the past but this was the find of a lifetime. You dream of finding something as significant as this. It was unbelievable.' A treasure inquest will now be held and the value will be split between Mr Spohr and the owner of the field near Blandford. It is then expected to go on show in a museum. Mr Spohr, who has been treasure hunting for six years, added: 'It is being examined at the moment and will then go to the coroner who will declare it treasure. 'Its value is decided by a team of experts and typically you split it 50/50 with the landowner. 'I've heard everything from £2,000 to £20,000 but I'm not getting too excited until I get the letter. 'I'll probably use the money to go on holiday.' A treasure inquest will now be held and the value will be split between Mr Spohr - who has been treasure hunting for six years - and the owner of the field near Blandford . Part time treasure hunter David Spohr had given up on his search in the Tarrant Valley, Dorset, and was on his way for lunch after a fruitless morning when his metal detector suddenly sounded . It is thought the lunula is between 2,500 and 4,500 years old but it is hoped the British Museum, who are currently examining it, will be able to narrow down the date. Members of the Stour Valley Search and Recovery Club, of which Mr Spohr is a member, say the lunula is the most exciting find in their 30-year history. Research by club members suggests that more than 80 of the 100 lunulas found in the past were in Ireland and several others on the coast of mainland Europe. In mainland Britain, one was found in Wales in 1869 and three on the coast of Cornwall. David Eagles, the club chairman, said: 'It is a very exciting find - a once in a lifetime discovery. 'Our club has been going 30 years and I can't think of a more significant find. 'We have been searching those fields for 25 years and they still continue to surprise us. 'David called me over when he made his discovery and it was very exciting to see the necklace come out of the ground. 'It is a wonder that it was still in tact after all these years.' If you find any ancient objects whether they are made of precious metal or other metals or clay it is called ‘treasure trove’ and is the property of the Crown. Anyone who finds objects which might be treasure trove must report it to the local police or museum, the local authority archaeologist. Goods found in the sea or on the seashore could be from a ship and are known technically as ‘wreck’. All wreck must be reported to The Receiver of Wreck, The Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Treasure discovered on land is governed by The Treasure Act. If you find treasure, under the law you are obliged to report it to your local police station within 14 days. They will pass it on to the coroner who will decide whether it is defined as treasure. If a museum wants to acquire the find, it is likely you will receive the market value price. However, if no one wishes to purchase it, the finder may be entitled to keep it.","Treasure hunter David Spohr had given up search in Tarrant Valley, Dorset .

"Oregon State Police say a 19-year-old man has caused a three-car crash when he fainted while holding his breath as he drove through a tunnel northwest of Portland. According to a news release, Daniel J. Calhon, of Snohomish, Washington, told investigators he fainted Sunday afternoon while holding his breath in the Highway 26 tunnel near the community of Manning. His car, a 1990 Toyota Camry, drifted across the centerline and crashed head-on with a Ford Explorer. Some people hold their breaths in tunnels as part of a game or superstition. The driver was holding his breath in keeping with a popular superstition about not breathing in tunnels . Fallout: The driver who crashed into the other cars and his passenger are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries . Both vehicles struck the tunnel walls before a pickup hit the Camry. Four people, including Calhon and his passenger, 19-year-old Bradley Meyring, of Edmonds, Washington, suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

"An apartment block which collapsed in North Korea earlier this week may have killed more than 400 people, it was claimed today. The reported death toll was far higher than the scores or 'more than one hundred' who were said earlier to have died when the high rise building crashed down as a result of poor workmanship. A satellite photograph released today shows the building in the capital, Pyongyang, which is thought to have housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party. Scroll down for video . Remorse: A construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of the tower block in Pyongyang . North Korean officials offered a rare public apology for the collapse of the apartment building under construction in Pyongyang . Location: A satellite photograph shows the building in the capital, Pyongyang, which is thought to have housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party . Following the collapse, officials linked to the construction offered a humiliating public apology which was then reported - unusually - by North Korea's official news agency. The building had not been finished, but residents had already started moving in around late November because it is understood only some interior work remained to be completed. At least 92 households - who as well as Workers Party officials included members of the State Security Department - were believed to be living in the apartment complex when it came down. South Korean sources told Seoul's Chosun Ilbo newspaper that authorities clearing debris from the site placed a camouflage net over the ruin in order to prevent exposure to satellite photos - but it was too late to stop some pictures emerging. The state-run Rodong Shinmun daily carried a photo of a high-ranking official bowing to residents near the site of the collapse. But the photo was carefully shot so as not to include the rubble - instead it showed another apartment building close by. Families of victims of an accident at an apartment construction site in Pyongyang grieve during a gathering in the capital . It is thought that the building housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party . 'Authorities staged the shot by having resident gather in front of a pink building nearby that was standing perfectly tall,' a source, who revealed the true death toll, told the South Korean newspaper . A Unification Ministry official in Seoul said the photo revealed how keen the regime was not to show the actual accident. Blame was placed on officials who were said to have not shown proper control while the construction was going ahead. Last month, satellite photos showed that the roof of a luxury villa belonging to leader Kim Jong-Un had collapsed, also due to faulty construction. Kim Jong-Un tours a construction site in the North Korea's capital.

An American satellite image expert said the building appeared to be an aquarium that was built in 2011. Kim Jong-Un had used material imported from Italy and Germany and had then filled it with £2 million worth of marine life including dolphins brought in from China. North Korean defectors said that military engineers were responsible for building Kim's person villas. A source told the South Korean newspaper: 'Once Kim Jong-un sets a completion date, there is no arguing.

"Everyone's heard of the crocodile hunter, well meet the crocodile huntress - a school girl from Australia's Top End. This Northern Territory 17-year-old has been posted on possibly the most dangerous internship any school student has ever faced, catching crocodiles with some of Australia's most experienced reptile handlers in Darwin. It's a job not for the faint-hearted and probably one most adults wouldn't do if they were paid. But Rebekah Gesch, channeling the late Steve Irwin, is getting up close and personal with the river monsters while working on a school-based internship. A 3.4 metre crocodile is one of the trophy crocs that Rebekah Gresch helped pull in during the croc expedition . No fear: Rebeka Gesch is a natural at working with one of Australia's most dangerous animals . Gotcha: A 3.4 metre croc was caged during an internship expedition Rebekah Gesch was on in Darwin . And although she might seem young, those with an enthusiasm for taming wild animals seem to start at an early age. By the time Steve Irwin was nine years old, he was helping his dad catch small crocodiles in muddy creek beds and wrestling them back to his dinghy. It was a skill he carried on into in his adult years spawning the television series The Crocodile Hunter. And it appears his legend is living on through Rebekah who might have inherited the similar thrill seeking genes made famous by Irwin. In one of the teenager's pictures the crocodile management team, from the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission, tempt a large crocodile with a long piece of rope with some bait attached to a pulley. Steve Irwin was catching crocodiles from the tender age of nine . The reptile takes hold of the bait and wrestles its way towards the boat before being captured and caged. Once boxed inside the security of the steel structure, it's counted alongside hundreds more caught by the handlers to get an idea of the number swimming in Australia's far northern rivers. It is one of two crocs the handlers captured that day, the other being a two-metre crocodile pulled from a nearby creek. It brought the number of crocodiles caught in the Top End this this year to 151. From Darwin's Good Shepherd Lutheran College, Rebekah has been volunteering on a school-based internship and venturing out on tours like this for the past two months. She told the NT News being on 'croc patrol' was part of the daily tasks of the internship which also saw her working inside Charles Darwin National Park. The crocodile management team are capturing and surveying the reptiles to get a better idea of its habitat, how many and to warn humans of the locations where they should never go.","Rebekah Gesch is on a school internship catching crocodiles in Darwin .

"A motorist has been caught speeding at 149mph – more than twice the legal motorway limit and a record for the past year . Others have been caught doing three times the legal limit in 30mph zones – one near a rural primary school. The motorway offence, on the M25 near Swanley in Kent, was captured by a speed camera and was the highest recorded speed during the period April 2013 to May 2014. Scroll down for video . One motorist was caught traveling at 149mph along the M25 by a newly installed digital speed camera (file picture) The figures revealed that  another driver caught  by the same speed camera clocked up 146mph at Swanley on the M25, with two more hitting 127mph. New digital cameras have recently been installed on the M25 and older ones re-activated. The  offences were revealed in data received from police under a Freedom of Information Act request from the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM). The highest speed recorded on a 30mph road was 96mph in Leam Lane in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear – more than three times the legal limit. That just pipped the 94mph clocked up in the 30mph zone near New York Primary School on the B1192 Langrick Road in Lincolnshire. In other 30mph zones, drivers were  filmed doing  92mph on the B1522 in Gateshead; 86mph in  Court farm Road, Longwell Green, Avon and Somerset;  86mph in Luton’s Sundon Park Road, Bedfordshire; and 84mph on the A4103 at Leigh Sinton in West Mercia police’s area. The highest speed captured on a 50mph road was on the A414 Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, where a motorist clocked 119mph. The highest on a 60mph road was 127mph on the A413 Wendover bypass in Buckinghamshire. And one driver  hit 113mph in a 40mph A17 Station Road at Swineshead Bridge in Lincolnshire – some 73mph above the limit. The fastest speed recorded last year in a 30mph zone was 96mph, however, one motorist passed New York Primary school in Lincolnshire at 94 mph . The IAM report noted: ‘A motorist in on the M25 at Swanley holds the record for the highest speed clocked by a speed camera in England and Wales between April 2013 and May 2014.  The 149 mph figure was revealed following freedom of information requests to 39 police authorities.’ But the IAM says the penalties which ‘excessive speeders’ face are ‘out of sync’ with the danger they pose to other road users and to themselves. IAM head of road safety  Kevin Delaney said: ’Let’s be clear – we’re not talking here of otherwise law-abiding motorists who are trying their best but may make a careless mistake and slip a few miles per hour above the posted speed limited. ‘These are dangerous drivers who are  speeding at two or three times the legal speed limit, sometimes near schools. They are selfish individuals putting people’s lives in danger.’ Guidelines to magistrates on sentencing for speeding include a fine plus six penalty points  or disqualified  for between 7 and 56 days for motorists who drive  at 101mph  and 110mph on a 70mph road; at between 76mph  and 85 mph on a 50mph road; or at between 51mph and 60mph in a 30mph zone. IAM chief executive Simon Best said: ‘Speed limits are a limit. They are not a target to beat. Unfortunately this message has not got through to many motorists and it’s clear that efforts to make speeding as socially unacceptable as drink-driving continue to fail.’","The Institute of Advanced Motorists sent a Freedom of Information request seeking speeding details .

"David Cameron has dropped his pledge to enshrine the Government's commitment to aid spending in law - after failing to convince Tory MPs. The Prime Minister wanted to make it legally binding for Britain to spend 0.7% of the country's income - around £1 in every £142 - on foreign aid. But Nick Clegg revealed this morning that Mr Cameron had failed to win round his own MPs and will not include the bill in the Queen's Speech next Wednesday. David Cameron has consistently backed increased spending on foreign aid - insisting that the Government would not 'balance the books on the backs of the world's poor' - but has backed down in the face of growing Tory resistance . Nick Clegg shrugged off last week's disastrous council and European election results to come out fighting for a legally-binding commitment to foreign aid spending this morning . The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'The commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our nation’s wealth on aid, and also to enshrine this in law, will be in the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto. 'As of last year, we are spending 0.7 per cent, and that is a huge achievement. 'It’s an open secret that the Liberal Democrats wanted to take the additional step of legislating – which is why it’s in the Coalition Agreement. 'As you know we have not been able to convince our Coalition partners to do that, but the Liberal Democrats have not given up – we are going to keep pushing to get 0.7 per cent into law.' A senior Lib Dem source blamed the decision to drop the aid pledge on Tory MPs. He said: ‘It is no secret that this was not a popular policy on the backbenches of the Conservative party and we were very keen on it. ‘It was in our manifesto and in the coalition agreement. Some at the top of the Conservative party still remain convinced it’s the right thing to do, but it won’t be in the Queen’s Speech.’ Tory MP Peter Bone welcomed the decision to drop the planned legislation, but said the aid budget should also be cut. Mr Bone said: ‘I am delighted that we are dropping the idea of fixing this ridiculous target in law but we are still spending far too much. ‘At a time when virtually every other government department is having to drastically cut back their budgets we are spending billions more on aid in order to meet an arbitrary target that is nothing more than a sticking plaster. We shouldn’t be shovelling money out of the door at the end of the year in order to meet a target – it should be based on need. ‘And if we really want to help the world’s poor the single biggest thing we could do is open up trade, but the EU blocks that to protect French farmers. Mr Clegg reveled that the Government would be dropping the aid target in a speech this morning on International Development. The Deputy Prime Minister lashed out at the 'myths' that had developed around aid spending. Mr Clegg said: 'The British public believe that around 20 per cent of all the money the UK Government spends in a year goes on foreign aid. 'In reality, we spend 0.7 per cent of our nation’s income. That in itself is an historic achievement - we are now the first of the world’s wealthiest countries to meet this long-held promise.' 'It is still a lot of money. But, to put it into some kind of perspective, it’s less than what we spend on takeaways every year.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems will make it a manifesto commitment to make aid spending legally binding . He said it was not true the cash was used to 'line the pockets of corrupt officials overseas'. Mr Clegg said: 'It’s simply not the case that people’s taxes are frittered away, wasted on irrelevant projects or problems we cannot solve.' The Deputy PM added: 'The things we do with this money are also clearly in Britain’s own interests too: making our people safer and more prosperous. 'When Pakistan can’t prevent young men getting radicalised and trained by militants within its borders, that can lead to terrorist attacks on our streets. 'When Somalia can’t tackle the problem of piracy, it disrupts the trade routes of UK businesses.' He said: 'So let the aid sceptics – UKIP and others on the right - continue to campaign against these efforts. Their cynicism is, I believe, out of step with our national interest and with the compassion we feel as a country towards those who are suffering elsewhere. 'They might want to sneer at the generosity of the British people. I lead a party that believes we should celebrate it.' Mr Clegg said there were 'millions that still have to live on less than £1 a day'. He said he disagreed with those who say we should leave Nigeria - Africa’s richest country to 'sort out its own problems'. Mr Clegg said: 'One in ten of the world’s poor now live in Nigeria. One in six of the world’s children not in school are in Nigeria. 'The situation is particularly bleak in the North, where living conditions are as tough as in any warzone. Targeted attacks by Boko Haram on vaccination centres threaten a polio epidemic across the region. And just last week, the country was hit by a wave of bombing attacks. 'What Nigeria shows us is that you can’t judge a country’s progress by its economic statistics alone.' He said he did not back a rule to 'arbitrarily cut off our help when a country hits a certain GDP target'.","The Prime Minister wanted to make aid pledge legally binding .
Proposals would see £1 in every £142 earned in Britain spent on foreign aid .
Lib Dems and Labour back the pledge and it is in the Coalition agreement .
But Cameron has been forced to remove it from Queen's speech .
Government insists it is still hitting target even if it is not legally binding ."
"The man abducted by murdered student Jamie Gao in January has revealed for the first time his terrifying ordeal after being kidnapped, taken to a park and bashed in the head and chest. Gao had been called in as an enforcer to 'get revenge' on 18-year-old Alex Li on behalf of a female friend, who had been dumped by the victim's flatmate, the intended target of the assault. But when Gao, who was accompanied two teenage associates, arrived at the flat at Carlton in Sydney's south on January 9, Mr Li was not at home – so he abducted Jaiwei Yu, 19, instead. Watched: Federal police were reportedly monitoring Jamie Gao for three years before his death . Abducted:  The flat (left) at Carlton in Sydney's south that Jaiwei Yu (right) was kidnapped from by Jamie Gao . 'It was because Alex and [his girlfriend' broke up,' Mr Yu told MailOnline at his home in Sydney's southern suburbs. '[She] wanted revenge on Alex. She used Jamie to do it ... to come around and kidnap me.' Mr Gao, 20, was killed on Tuesday May 20 and former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson are charged with his murder. The University of Technology, Sydney business student's body was found floating off Sydney's Shelly Beach, near Cronulla, wrapped in a blue tarp on Monday morning. Friends of the murdered 20-year-old say 'his intention was not to be bad' and he was swayed by peer pressure . Detained after dark: It was to this park, Tindale Reserve, in southern Sydney where Jamie Gao and two teenage accomplices took 19-year-old Jiawei Yu after kidnapping and beating him and driving him around in his car on the night of Thursday January 9 as part of a revenge attempt gone wrong . The discovery triggered a nation-wide manhunt for Rogerson, which ended in his arrest in a blaze of publicity at his Sydney home. McNamara, a former police colleague of Rogerson's, was charged with Mr Gao's murder on Sunday night. Police allege that on the day of his murder Mr Gao got inside a car with McNamara and Rogerson while carrying what they say was $3million worth of methamphetamine. The car was driven to a storage unit nearby, where police will allege Mr Gao was killed for the bag's contents just before 2.30pm. CCTV footage showed Mr Gao last getting out of his car holding a large bag in Padstow. Shocked police officers have said they can't understand why they would commit such a crime in a place covered with CCTV cameras. 'It was so dumb,' a detective told the Sydney Morning Herald. Five months earlier, the night Mr Gao abducted Mr Yu, the 19-year-old victim endured a terrifying 90-minute ordeal where he was driven around nearby suburbs, taken to Tindale Reserve, a local park, and bashed around the head and chest by Mr Gao, who he had never previously met. 'They drove around, through the park and they beat him up with fists in the head,' Mr Li told MailOnline. Meanwhile Mr Li, the intended target, was staying at a house just one street away when Mr Gao arrived sometime after 10pm. 'They think I am with Jaiwei. We are friends,' Mr Li said today. Jamie Gao's girlfriend (pictured right kissing him) is in shock over his death . 'They thought I would be at his house. I'm not at home and they thought he might be here.' When Mr Gao and his two friends arrived at the apartment they lured Mr Yu, who came to Australia from Guandong Province, China five years ago, onto the street before forcing him into the car and taking off. Mr Yu, who said he was not a student and did not currently have a job, refused to say whether Mr Gao was armed. Police interviewed Mr Yu at his home in February and on March 22 charged Mr Gao with taking and detaining Mr Yu in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm. Gao was also charged with conspiring with the two teenagers to assault Alex Li and cause him actual bodily harm. The girl and the third friend, who were minors at the time, will face Sutherland Children's Court on July 1 on charges relating to the kidnap and assault. Mr Gao (left) and his girlfriend (right) started dating at the beginning of the year . Meanwhile, a 19-year-old friend of Mr Gao's, who had lunch with him the day before he was murdered, told MailOnline his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure. 'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said. 'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.' Mr Gao's friend said she was shocked the student - who had an active social life, a happy family life in a $1.5-million Hurstville home and was enjoying a budding romance with his new girlfriend - was allegedly involved in drug dealing. 'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said. 'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.' Mr Gao's girlfriend told the MailOnline it was a 'very hard time' for her . The day before his murder was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend. At no stage, his friend told MailOnline, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'. Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing. Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her. On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD. His female friend, who did not want to be named, said Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day. 'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.' Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'. 'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said. Mr Gao lived with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. A woman at the home on Monday declined to comment. The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart. 'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said. A body found floating off Shelly Beach near Cronulla was formally identified as Mr Gao on Tuesday afternoon .

"One Direction’s Harry Styles has hit out at bandmates Louis . Tomlinson and Zayn Malik for their ‘reckless and stupid’ behaviour after MailOnline's exclusive footage of them smoking a ‘joint’. Harry is said to be annoyed with them for potentially . jeopardising the band’s upcoming 39-date United States tour after the film showed them sharing a suspicious roll-up in Peru last month. Louis, 22, and Zayn, 21, who did not mention the indiscretion during a sell-out concert in Sunderland last night, could be banned from the . United States by immigration authorities. It has also emerged Harry has chosen to fly in a different private jet to Zayn because he does not like his smoking, a source said. An insider told The Sun: ‘Harry is annoyed about the whole . debacle,' and revealed how the singer thought it was ‘stupid and . reckless’ of the pair to film their actions on camera. Scroll down for video . Harry Styles, pictured performing at One Direction's sold out concert in Sunderland last night, is said to be annoyed with bandmates Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik for potentially jeopardising the band's upcoming 39-date US tour . Harry Styles hit out at bandmates Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik (pictured) for their 'reckless and stupid' behaviour after video footage emerged of them smoking a 'joint' Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band . Bandmembers Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson last night as they joined the rest of the group for a gig in Sunderland, but parents outside admitted their clean-cut image was now tarnished . Flying solo: Separate jets for Harry and his increasingly estranged bandmates this month. Does it mean that some members of the boy band can't stand each other? The source also revealed how, despite . his reputation, Harry, 20, is in fact ‘professional and mature’ and does not approve of . such antics which he fears could now overshadow the band's success. ‘This should be one of the biggest weeks of the band’s . career with the launch of their UK stadium tour. Instead it has been taken over . by this controversy,' the insider added. It comes as Louis’ father said he was ‘worried’ for his son . after watching the footage - which was filmed on April 27 as the pair were escorted . by car to a show at the Estadio Nacional in Lima, Peru, where they performed to . a 40,000-strong crowd. Troy Austin, 45, said his son – who is a keen footballer who . once made an appearance for Doncaster Rovers – had previously vowed to never . touch drugs or get a tattoo. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘It seems the fame . and money have changed him. He’s a different person to that person three years . ago. ‘I do believe that being that famous will be taking its toll . on them. They need a serious talking to.’ 'Joint . lit. Happy days!'  Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson smoked a 'roll up . cigarette' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in Lima, Peru, last . month . Hit . maker: Zayn takes a draw on the roll up. Before they began their . journey someone can be heard asking: 'Are we allowed to talk contraband . in this?' Warm up: Louis can be heard joking that 'Mary J' is 'one . very very important factor of Zayn’s warm up' Happy daze: At one point during the video, Louis asks: 'How is it Zayn?' Pausing a beat before he exhales Zayn replies: 'Nice'. Zayn blows smoke at the camera and says: 'I know you like dat, bro' Controversial: In . MailOnline’s exclusive video, Louis Tomlinson, 22, can be heard putting . on an accent while speaking about doing drugs. He then says: ‘It’s . green only, Nig.’ He also questioned One Direction’s management – which . includes their ultimate boss Simon Cowell – by saying they ‘should be . protecting’ the boys from ‘things like this’. Cowell has been dragged into the row by fans who have bombarded him with messages urging him to take action. As well as apparently smoking a ‘joint’ in the video, Louis has also been lambasted by fans and critics for using the word 'nig' - which fans say is a shortened version of the N-word. In the video, Louis puts on an accent while speaking about drugs, then says: ‘It’s green only, nig.’ One . Direction fans - as well as MPs and racism campaigners – have demanded . apologies from the band in light of the video. They suggested the boy . band had abused their position as role models and risked encouraging . their young fans to copy them. Harry Styles arrived at Newcastle International Airport on a separate private jet to Louis and Zayn ahead of One Direction's performance in Sunderland yesterday . Liam Payne (left) and Niall Horan (right) arrived into Newcastle on the same £18million private jet as bandmate Harry Styles but the other members of the group, scandal-hit Louis and Zayn, boarded a different jet . But as the band played to a sell-out 52,000-strong crowd at Sunderland football club’s Stadium of Light ground last night, there was no mention of the recent controversy - let alone an apology. The only reference made to the scandal was by Liam Payne, who joked about his skinny jeans then, in response to something shouted by a member of the crowd, added: ‘No more media attention, please.’ It is not known how the other bandmates - Liam and Niall Horan, both 20 - feel about Louis and Zayn’s video but it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band. It is understood Harry and Niall already . take separate ‘non-smoking’ private jets to the other members and last . night the pair, joined by Liam, flew into Newcastle on a £18million . private jet separate from their scandal-hit bandmates. Upset: Some One Direction fans have said they have destroyed or sold tickets because they are angry about the video . Despite the controversy, thousands of fans turned out in Sunderland tonight to watch the band perform at the Stadium of Light . Parents Julie and Alan Huntington, from Peterlee, County Durham, whose daughter, Jessica, 14, was going to the gig with a friend, said they were concerned by the footage. Mrs Huntington, 45, a customer service adviser, said: 'They look up to the band so when they see the boys doing this it is worrying.' Mr Huntington, 41, an electrician, said: 'As parents we are always trying to tell our children that taking drugs is wrong and then you have the band they look up to taking drugs themselves. You're constantly fighting a losing battle.' Lisa Loftus, 31, a teaching assistant from Seaham, Country Durham, who was taking daughter Aimee, 13, and her friend Sarah Harrison, 13, to the show, said: 'Our children look up to the band and by doing what they have done they are telling them it is ok to behave like that. When they have such young fans it is worrying. They should be showing their fans how to act as children are very influential.' Michelle Anderson, 46, and her daughter Chloe, 12, from Newcastle, were also attending the gig. Mrs Anderson said: 'My daughter is 12 and she has her own mind so I know she wouldn't be influenced, but other younger children easily could be. If you are that way inclined and don't have parents telling you what is right and wrong then they think it is cool and could do it themselves.' Laura Baker, 16, from South Shields, who was going to the gig with her friends, said: 'It is a bad example on younger fans but we are older so we know what is right and wrong.' Harry was also spotted getting on a different plane at the weekend as One Direction travelled from Ireland following a gig. News of a potential rift in the band will upset fans who have been divided since the footage emerged. Some fans and their parents turned on the band in light of the controversy which several 'Directioners' ripping up, burning or selling their tickets for the upcoming gigs in the UK, Europe and America. But others have said they 'still love' the band and accused critics of not being 'true fans'.

"Awkwardness: Author Kate Fox has suggested that the English are unsure how to greet each other . England is the only country where people are unsure of how to greet each other, according to an expert - and the only remedy is to revive an old-fashioned phrase. Social anthropologist Kate Fox claims that the demise of the greeting 'How do you do?' has created awkwardness as English people no longer know how to say hello to each other. However, she points out that conversations about the weather often fulfil the function of forming social bonds - in the same way as apes groom each other. And she also suggests that the rise of social media has enabled the English to overcome their habitual reticence and open up to strangers. Ms Fox's best-selling book, Watching the English, which chronicles the habits and foibles of her fellow countrymen, was reissued this year to take account of how the country has changed in the decade since it was first published. Speaking at the Hay Festival on Friday, she said that one of the biggest obstacles to more openness among the English was the difficulty of knowing what to say when you first meet someone, according to the Telegraph. 'I know people think that ""How do you do?"" is an archaic, stuffy, sort of upper classy-type thing to say,' she said. 'But we really should be mounting a campaign for its revival because since ""How do you do?"" declined as a standard greeting we haven't known what to say. 'We don't know what to do with our hands, we don't know whether to kiss once or twice. Every single other nation on the planet has a straightforward ritual for greeting someone. We seem to be the only ones who can't reach a consensus on what's appropriate.' At the talk, Ms Fox also compared the English habit of talking about the weather to chimpanzees picking fleas off each other - because both are largely meaningless rituals which contribute to 'social bonding'. She added: 'When you say, ""Oh gosh isn't it cold"", you're not asking for a meteorological report. It's a way of saying hello, or ""I'd like to talk to you"", without having to say anything quite so direct.' Astute: Ms Fox, a social anthropologist, is a seasoned observer of English habits and foibles . The updated edition of Watching the English chronicles the changes in the English national character since the book originally came out in 2004. And the biggest change of all, according to Ms Fox, is the way the internet and social media allow people to connect without the awkwardness of face-to-face interaction. She told the Hay audience that social networking facilitated the exchange of even the most intimate information - but the ubiquitous smartphone allows people to avoid others' glances in public. Ms Fox's analysis of English culture has previously highlighted how minute class distinctions can be determined by how we speak - for example, the upper-middle-class habit of saying 'sofa' instead of 'settee'.","Social anthropologist Kate Fox says the English are the only nation who are unsure how to greet each other .

"This amazing series of pictures captures the famous Red Arrows display team while they fly above RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. The selfie-style shots show the squadron forming up just feet from the wings of their fellow pilot as they practice their performance. The pilots’ routines see them fly at speeds of up to 600 miles an hour, swooping as low as 100 feet and pulling up to 8Gs during the Vixen Break manoeuvre. In 8G everything weighs 8 times more, and so it can be difficult for photographers to capture images as it is almost impossible to hold the camera up to eye level. The force will also drain blood away from the eyes and brain and into the legs, which can cause black out. These pictures were captured by expert Katsuhiko Tokunaga who is one of just ten air-to-air photographers in the world, and who has worked with the Red Arrows on several occasions. These stunning pictures, captured by air-to-air photographer Katsuhiko Tokunaga show the Red Arrows flying in formation above RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus . The 'selfie' style shots were captured from the cockpit of one of the Arrows as his co-pilots form up just feet from the tips of his wings . The Red Arrows began training in 1964 and had their first display season in 1965. The red in their name comes from the fact that RAF training aircraft of the day were red, and the arrow references another famous display team, the Black Arrows . Katsuhiko Tokunaga is just one of ten licensed air-to-air photographers in the world and has worked with the Red Arrows on several different occasions . As the team perform their aerial acrobatics they will fly as low as 100 feet, pull up to 8Gs of force and travel at up to 600 miles an hour, all while coming within feet of each other's aircraft . At 8G, everything weighs eight times as much, making photography very difficult as it is almost impossible to keep hold a camera level with your eye . The team's new tail design, to mark 50 year since it began flying, can be seen in the pictures. The Union Jack-style design is the most significant change to the livery of the aircraft in the group's history . The Red Arrows have always flown whichever aircraft is in service as the Royal Air Force's advanced fast jet trainer; currently the BAE SYSTEMS Hawk T1 . Each of the nine Red Arrows display pilots is chosen by a selection board and flies with the team for a three-year tour of duty . The pilots wear special anti-G suits in order to keep blood evenly distributed around the body. Under that amount of pressure blood can drain away from a pilot's head and brain, causing loss of vision and blackouts . The vapour trails are created by pumping diesel fuel into the jet exhaust which heats to over 500 degrees Celsius. The diesel immediately vaporises creating a white cloud, with dye added to make it blue or red .","Stunning set of photographs captures Red Arrows flying in formation above RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus .

"Eddy Sukkar, 21, allegedly picked up a kitten from a drain in Cartwright, south-west of Sydney, on January 27 and kicked it until it was dead . A man who allegedly kicked to death a kitten so violently its intestines burst through its skin has avoided a conviction because a court could not determine whether the cat was already dead. Eddy Sukkar, 21, was seen laughing as he violently kicked the black and white weeks old kitten 'like a football' in a suburban backyard in the south-western Sydney suburb of Cartwright on January 27 this year. Neighbour Zandra Stanford, 67, saw told MailOnline she'd seen Sukkar kick the kitten 'which was meowing' eight to 10 times with both his feet, lift the animal by its tail and throw it into a car park. Police found the animal with its intestines spilled out onto its abdomen and charged Sukkar with torturing, beating and causing the death of an animal. But confusion over whether there were ants on the animal soon after the assault, if the kitten had really made a noise and an absence of blood at the crime scene led Magistrate Garry Still to dismiss the case in Liverpool Local Court because he couldn't decide whether the animal was alive or dead when Sukkar began kicking it. A lawyer for Sukkar, whose Facebook photos include one of a kitten being held up with a finger gun, argued the kitten was already dead because Ms Stanford admitted she had seen ants on the corpse. But she told Mailonline that it was hours after the horrifying incident that police had photographed the dead kitten which by then was crawling with insects. Neighbour Zandra Stanford, 67, saw Sukkar kick the kitten eight to 10 times with both his feet, lift the animal by its tail and throw it into a car park . A mother cat and three kittens were living in this drain just 50 metres from Ms Stanford's unit . Ms Stanford said she witnessed the beating only because she had gone out on to balcony 'for a breath of fresh air' at 7.30pm on a warm summer's night. 'It was daylight saving so it was still light and I had my cataracts done last year so I could easily see,' she said. At the time around 15 to 20 stray cats were living in the grounds of three public housing units along Hoxton Park Road at Cartwright. A mother cat and three kittens were living in a drain 50 metres from Ms Stanford's unit. 'I saw this young man, skinny, wearing shorts and a singlet bend down and pick something up,’ she said. 'I didn't know it was a kitten at first but he dropped it on the ground and I saw it move a couple of steps. Police found the animal with its intestines spilled out onto its abdomen and charged Sukkar with torturing, beating and causing the death of an animal . Ms Stanford said she witnessed the beating only because she had gone out on to balcony 'for a breath of fresh air' at 7.30pm on a warm summer's night . 'It was black and white and then I realised it was a kitten. Then he began kicking it over and over really hard with both shoes. He was kicking it towards the back of the units. 'After eight or 10 kicks, the kitten had stopped moving.' Ms Stanford said she was both angry and upset and decided 'to go over and tell him off'. 'I walked over to him and he was still laughing. He thought it was a joke. 'I said ""what do you think you are doing, how dare you. I'm going to tell your father"" and he said the cat was already dead. 'I told him to piss off.' At the time around 15 to 20 stray cats were living in the grounds of three public housing units along Hoxton Park Road at Cartwright . The area is known for its high number of stray cats . Ms Stanford called the police, who photographed the scene and the cat, by then covered in ants. 'There were lots of strays around then and we feed them and you get attached to them, so it was very upsetting,' she said. 'I can't stand cruelty to any animal.' But when she gave evidence at Liverpool court on Thursday, Ms Stanford said her account 'wasn't believed'. She said Sukkar's lawyer had tried to claim trees obscured her view of his client kicking the kitten, disputed the time when ants appeared on the dead cat and claimed she hadn't heard the animal meowing. 'It was a still night and peak hour was over so there was no traffic noise,' she said. Neighbour Brett Parker said he also witnessed some of the incident, but police had never interviewed him. 'The kitten was definitely alive when I first seen it,' he said, 'then after he kicked it, you could see its guts hanging out.' Sukkar, who pleaded not guilty, walked free from court despite the Magistrate saying he couldn't believe someone would even kick a dead cat . Sukkar, who pleaded not guilty, walked free from court despite Magistrate Still saying the accused actions 'were distressing on a number of levels' and he couldn't believe someone would even kick a dead cat. 'This one of the most distressing cases I have ever been involved in and I have seen a lot,' he said. But he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cat was alive during the beating. Ms Stanford said she thought Sukkar, who had been staying with an uncle at the apartment complex, 'was a few bob short of quid' to have done what he did. A lawyer for Sukkar, whose Facebook photos include a viral picture of a kitten being held up with a finger gun, argued the kitten was already dead because Ms Stanford admitted she had seen ants on the corpse .

"Created: . 08:22 EST, 6 June 2014 . The sun shone on travellers of every generation on the second day of Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria today. Gypsies from around Europe descended on the Eden Valley for the annual event, where traditionally travellers parade their horses before potential buyers, racing them at high speed along the 'mad mile' before cooling them down with a dip in the River Eden. The fair, which runs until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the oldest of its kind anywhere in Europe, attracting 10,000 gipsies and 30,000 visitors each year. Scroll down for video . Steeped in tradition: The horse fair in the Westmorland beauty spot is Europe's largest gathering of gipsies, with people coming from all over the world to take part . Camp: While many arrive at the Cumbrian beauty spot in traditional horse-drawn caravans, other travellers arrive in more modern motorhomes, vans, and cars . The historic fair, which became even more popular after featuring in the Channel 4 show, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, has been running since 1685, when King James II granted a Royal Charter allowing a horse fair to be held 'near the River Eden'. Gipsies come from around the world to meet friends, conduct business, and trade horses, while visitors come to admire the animals and visit the market stalls, palm readers, and fortune tellers. There was controversy earlier this week when some travellers set up camp on a private golf course at Appleby but organisers said they had worked to minimise antisocial behaviour-related problems. Robin Hooper, Eden District Council’s chief executive, said: 'A great deal of preparation has gone into the planning of this year’s fair to help people enjoy the event safely. 'This work includes pubs and off-licences signing up to a voluntary charter and having the street cleansing operation in place throughout the fair, so that the impact of this event on the local community is minimised as much as possible.' He added: ‘There have been some issues at the start of the week, with some displacement of caravans in unforeseen circumstances.' Traditional sight: Skewbald horses graze on the Cumbrian hills as children enjoyed the warm weather on the second day of the Appleby Horse Fair . Travellers harness their carefully groomed horses and race up and down the 'mad mile' to show off their animals, before bathing them in the River Eden . Last year’s . event prompted a number of complaints after rubbish was left strewn . across the town. There were also 20 people arrested on their way to the . event on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. In 1965 Westmorland Borough Council attempted to shut down the event but were forced to back down after a huge outcry.

"Police in northern Virginia have arrested a man accused of stealing memorial signs for victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Authorities say 28-year-old Andrew Truelove was motivated by a belief that the Sandy Hook shootings were a hoax. Herndon police say one sign was stolen from Mystic, Connecticut, and the other was stolen from a playground in Mantoloking, New Jersey. They were both dedicated to Chase Kowalski and Grace McDonnell, two of the 20 first-graders killed in the 2012 massacre. Two missing Sandy Hook memorial signs have been recovered in Herndon, Virginia -- far from the states from which they were stolen -- after allegedly being stolen by Andrew David Truelove, 28, who believes the school massacre never happened . These signs, stolen about a month ago from two different states, were found in the North Virginia home of Andrew Truelove . Police said Friday that Truelove was arrested at a home in Herndon where he was renting a room, and charged with possession of stolen property, with charges pending in the other states. An attorney representing Truelove in a separate case did not immediately return a message. The 50lb vinyl peace sign stolen from Mystic was built in memory of the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012, celebrating the life of one of the victims, Grace McDonnell, who had a park named after her. More horrific than the theft were reports that Truelove ccalled Grace McDonnell's mother and taunted her over the death of her daughter. Cruel: The space where a peace sign designed by Sandy Hook victim Grace McDonnell hung before it was stolen . Community outrage: The vinyl sign designed by Grace McDonnell before it was stolen . William Lavin, who has been leading the effort to build playgrounds to honor all 26 Newtown victims, told The Day of New London that a man called Grace's mother and told her he took the sign because he believes the December 2012 school shooting was a hoax. 'There's still a lot of ignorance and evil out there that someone could do something like that,' Lavin said Wednesday. 'It's sad there are ignorant people who have to show their hatred in a place that was built by a community that shared and expressed their love for the families in Newtown that witnessed evil.' Lynn McDonnell was upset after the phone call and worried about how the theft might affect those who helped build the playground, Lavin said. Truelove belongs to a group who call themselves 'truthers', who not believe the massacre, took place, according to NBC. 'It's hard to explain the why, because from our perspective it doesn't appear rational, that type of thought process,' Herndon Police Chief Maggie DeBoard said during a news conference Friday. 'We know Sandy Hook occurred, obviously there are a lot of victims in that case. So I can't explain the why, but we do know that this suspect has a troubled past, he has an extensive criminal history, he has criminal history tied to kids.' School shooting victim: Grace McDonnell died in the Newtown school massacre . Double blow: The theft comes just after a sign in a different playground, one dedicated to Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, was graffitied . Truelove was charged after he contacted a reporter, saying that he had the signs, DeBoard said. The reporter contacted authorities in Stonington, Connecticut, who reached out to Herndon Police. After an investigation, authorities obtained a search warrant for Truelove's house in the 400 block of Fillmore Street, and recovered the stolen signs Friday. 'Our main goal here was to get those signs back so they could be placed back on the playgrounds where they belong,' DeBoard said. Each playground is unique and inspired by the victims it is dedicated to.","Andrew David Truelove, 28, was arrested in Herndon, Virginia, on Friday .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has hit back at Clive Palmer after the MP attacked Mr Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin and suggested that she has 'undue influence' over the PM. Mr Abbott addressed Mr Palmer's offensive comment, in which he said the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'. Mr Abbott on Wednesday said: 'Well I think that blokes around this place have learned to underestimate women at their peril. I'll just make that general observation.' Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott weighed in on the controversy over Clive Palmer's comments about the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin on Wednesday . He added: 'The other observation that I'll make is that the gentlemen in question does not understand the Coalition's policy ... that all Australian women have access to the paid parental leave scheme. 'Before he goes out and attacks people he really ought to understand the policy.' It comes after Deputy Leader of the National Party, Barnaby Joyce, on Tuesday made a sexist joke at Ms Credlin's expense while addressing the controversy over Mr Palmer's comments. On Channel Ten's The Project Mr Joyce claimed that it is rare to see women in a powerful position as these roles are often held by men. Glamorous and influential: Peta Credlin, who posed for this shot in the January edition of Marie Claire last year, is the best known woman in Canberra and has a powerful political rapport with Prime minister Tony Abbott . Deputy Leader of the National Party Barnaby Joyce makes a sexist joke at the expense of Prime Minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin on Channel Ten's The Project on Tuesday night . 'Peta's got a strong role,' Mr Joyce. 'The Prime Minister is definitely the boss but if you step on Peta's toes she'll put her boot up your backside.' But when he was asked whether he thought the public found it unusual to see a woman holding such a position of power, he said: 'I'm on good information from her husband that she is a woman.' Once he realised his error, Mr Joyce quickly apologised and said: 'it was an attempt at humour'. Mr Joyce also somewhat defended Palmer by claiming earlier in the interview that he too had 'a whole litany of dopey things I've done in my time in politics'. Won't back down: MP and mining magnate Clive Palmer has refused to apologise to Tony Abbott staffer Peta Credlin following comments he made during a parliamentary debate that she had 'undue influence' over government policy and was behind the paid parental leave scheme . Palmer, the MP for Fairfax in Queensland, made headlines after he attacked Ms Credlin in parliamentary debate on Monday, saying the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'. Government MPs were quick to condemn Mr Palmer's comment, however Ms Credlin has previously been credited with being the 'power' and the 'brains' behind the prime minister and the person he is 'closest to politically'. Mr Palmer's comments prompted a rebuke from senior members of the Coalition, with Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop pulling out of a scheduled dinner with the Queensland mining magnate after labelling his comments 'offensive and inappropriate', the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Politically close: Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured with Peta Credlin) is politically closest to his powerful chief of staff, who even members of his own party say he relies on heavily and respects her judgment . Thr right stuff: The tall, glamorous and highly intelligent Ms Credlin is the most discussed woman in Canberra. Clive Palmer's comments echo previous assessments from within Tony Abbott's own party that she is 'widely believed to have more influence over the way the country is run than most' MPs, who she describes as 'the front men' Canberra correspondents, a member of Mr Abbott's own party and a senior official told Good Weekend last year Ms Credlin had more influence than many MPs and her role was more like the chief of staff of a US president, 'with cabinet-level status'. Dubbed 'Ms Fix-it', Credlin was 'the most discussed woman in Canberra, and probably the most powerful'. Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, has been on an IVF programme. She told marie claire magazine in January last year the prime minister was deeply supportive of her efforts to have a child through IVF with her husband and said Mr Abbott’s views on abortion, contraception and IVF were far more balanced than many people believe. Time to question: MP Clive Palmer's criticism of Peta Credlin (pictured with Tony Abbott during question time in the House of Representatives) was that the influence she wields should not supersede that of MPs.  'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do' Power behind the throne: Billionaire MP Clive Palmer's claims the government's paid parental leave scheme was designed 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff (Peta Credlin, pictured) can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant' have been widely condemned as insensitive to Ms Credlin who has struggled to conceive on an IVF programme. But the 43-year-old is widely regarded as the 'power' and the 'brains' behind Tony Abbott . The normally private Ms Credlin came under fire then from the Labor Party, which claimed a member of Mr Abbott's personal staff should not use a public forum to overcome Mr Abbott's perceived popularity problem at the time with women voters. Mr Palmer said he was not aware of Ms Credlin's personal struggles. The 60-year-old mining magnate denied he was being sexist, telling reporters in Canberra, 'I believe as chief of staff, regardless of whether she is a woman or man, she exercises undue influence on government policy to the detriment of many of the elected members of parliament'. He said he had made the comments because they concerned government policy. Calling the shots: Peta Credlin's influence on Prime Minister Tony Abbott is such that journalists say when Mr Abbott made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school' she 'gave him a swift kick in the shin. . . it was done with good humour, but for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.' 'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do.' A senior Liberal told Good Weekend last year that Mr Abbott, 'relies on her heavily and respects her judgment' and that 'she is the person in politics he's closest to, no doubt about that.' Seven network political correspondent Mark Riley gave an account of Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin on the way back from an overseas trip in 2013 when the prime minister made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school'. 'She gave him a swift kick in the shin,' Riley said, 'It was done with good humour. But for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.' But the government's frontbencher Christopher Pyne has described Mr Palmer's comments as 'cowardly' and 'ignorant', saying the paid parental leave scheme was proposed before Ms Credlin worked for Mr Abbott. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped Mr Palmer reflected on his 'hurtful' comments about Ms Credlin. 'For him to single her out is a particularly hurtful thing for him to do,' she told Sky News. Nationals MP Darren Chester said he was disgusted with Mr Palmer's comments, and worried about the tone of parliamentary debate when unelected staffers were drawn in and 'personally vilified'. Struggle to conceive: Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, last year revealed their battle to have children . 'It was unnecessary for Mr Palmer to be so personally vindictive in the comments he made,' he told reporters, 'he should apologise.' Liberal MP Dennis Jensen said staffers were not 'fair game' in parliament. 'The people who to a certain extent are fair game are us as politicians, but once again it shouldn't get down to personal invective,' Dr Jensen said. 'You should deal with issues, not with personalities.' Nationals MP Andrew Broad, who tweeted his disapproval of the 'gutter politics' after Mr Palmer made the statement, added the comments were hurtful for couples like he and his wife who had also struggled with fertility. 'People expect better of members of parliament,' he said.","Prime Minister hits back at Clive Palmer after his attack on Peta Credlin .

"A 'corrupt’ detective who worked on the initial Stephen  Lawrence murder probe is to be investigated over claims that he sabotaged the inquiry. John Davidson will be the focus of a major new independent investigation into alleged corruption in the case. In a separate move yesterday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced it was to investigate a Scotland Yard commander and two former  senior officers over claims they were involved in a plot to spy on Stephen’s  family around the time of the Macpherson public inquiry into his death. Former Detective Sergeant John Davison, right, who is now living in Minorca is accused of stalling the investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder, left . The 18-year-old aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a racist white gang in April 1993. Not until 2012 were two of his killers convicted, and then only after a long campaign led by this newspaper to bring them to justice. The probe into Davidson, to be announced in the next fortnight, will examine claims he had a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of Stephen’s killers and deliberately stalled the inquiry. In police intelligence reports the former detective sergeant was described as having ‘no integrity as a police officer’ and being ‘open to offers from any source if financially viable’. The Metropolitan Police referred a file on Davidson to the IPCC two months ago after a damning official report raised questions about his conduct in the days following Stephen’s murder. Since the report was published, a series of Daily Mail investigations has exposed a web of suspected corruption in the Scotland Yard inquiries into the stabbing of Stephen and axe killing of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987. Scotland Yard chiefs believe it would be ‘inappropriate’ for the force to head the Davidson corruption probe. Instead, it will be carried out by a team of investigators from the IPCC or detectives from a provincial force, supervised by the watchdog. Barrister Mark Ellison’s review of the Lawrence case in March found that Davidson may have acted corruptly. It was claimed he had admitted having a ‘corrupt connection’ with gangland boss Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, who was finally convicted of Stephen’s murder in 2012 along with Gary Dobson. Since March, the Mail has published a series of investigations that showed how links between ‘bent coppers’ and serious organised criminals in South London might have hampered or sabotaged the Stephen Lawrence and Daniel Morgan murder inquiries. Mr Morgan, 37, a father of two, was killed with an axe in March 1987, allegedly while trying to blow the whistle on police corruption. Nobody has yet been convicted in spite of five police investigations and admissions by the Met that corruption played a part in those failings. The original investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder in 1993 was hugely discredited. The teenager's family had to wait almost two decades for justice . It is believed that as well as working on the original Lawrence investigation, Davidson also worked on the ‘periphery’ of the Morgan murder inquiry six years earlier. He now runs a bar in Minorca and denies any wrongdoing. Should he choose to stay on the Spanish holiday island, it is not clear how police would interview him about the Lawrence corruption allegations. He could only be extradited if there is already sufficient evidence to charge him. An IPCC spokesman said last night: ‘The IPCC received a referral from the Metropolitan Police on April 9 relating to the conduct of former detective sergeant John Davidson and specifically whether he acted corruptly during the investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.’ Stephen’s family have long been convinced police corruption hindered the initial murder probe. One of those to be investigated over the disputed spying claims and alleged ‘discreditable conduct’ is  Commander Richard Walton, who was temporarily moved from his post as head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command in March. The review by Mr Ellison alleged he and the two other police officers, Bob Lambert and Colin Black, were involved in a plot to gather ‘fascinating and valuable’ intelligence from an undercover officer who was spying on the Lawrence family and their supporters. Stephen’s father Neville Lawrence welcomed the IPCC investigation last night. Speaking from his home in Jamaica, he said: ‘I hope the investigation is thorough and gets to the truth.’","A new independent investigation into the case will focus on John Davidson .

"Two Royal Navy veterans are thought to be the oldest surviving brothers who fought together on D-Day. Ernie Dale, 90, and his brother Johnny, 94, were just 20 and 24-years-old on June 6, 1944, but can recall the Allied invasion of occupied northern France during the Second World War in vivid detail. The pair were able seamen on board HMS Frobisher - just one of thousands of vessels that made up the largest seaborne invasion in history, helping to path the way for an Allied victory over Nazi Germany the following year. Heroes: Ernie Dale, 90 (left), and his brother Johnny, 94 (right), were just 20 and 24-years-old on June 6, 1944 - but they can recall the Allied invasion of occupied northern France during the Second World War in vivid detail . Middle of the action: Johnny Dale, aged 24, is pictured on the far right of the image - his head just poking in to shot. The photograph was taken on on D-Day, the 6 June 1944 . Remembering D-Day, Ernie, who lives in Kent, said: 'We were expendable. We were there to take the fire while the landing craft headed for the beaches.' During the chaos of the invasion, Ernie remembers firing upon his Nazi targets while Johnny relayed shells from the ammunition locker to his younger brother. Despite coming close to death several times over a . three-month campaign, the brave brothers admit they ‘didn’t really know . what fear was’ because they were so young. Although they came under heavy shelling from the Nazis in their fortresses lining the Normandy beaches, Ernie said he did not fear death. 'I went out with the feeling that it wasn’t going to happen to me - and it didn’t. We were just lucky.' 'I . was quite comfortable really, I felt sorry for the troops heading for . the beaches because they probably only had corned beef and biscuits to . eat.' Royal Navy veterans: Ernie Dale (left) and his brother Johnny (right) are thought to be the oldest surviving brothers who fought together on D-Day during the Second World War . Ernie . joined Johnny in Mombasa, Kenya on HMS Resolution in 1942, after being . called up for military service at the age of 18. The elder brother had . been in the Royal Navy since war broke out in 1939. They . were placed on the Frobisher, then part of the Eastern Fleet, and . served for a year off the coast of Africa before being called back to . fight for D-Day. Plans for the original invasion on June 5 were scuppered by bad weather keeping allied air, sea and land troops at bay. But by dawn the next day after the RAF had bombed from the air and the young brothers sailed into history. Youth: Ernie Dale, pictured shortly after being called up for military service at the age of 18 . During the invasion, Ernie directed anti-aircraft guns on board the warship while Johnny supplied shells from the bowels of the vessel. A . total of five rounds per minute were fired from HMS Frobisher, which . had five seven-inch guns and five four-inch guns, for two hours. Describing how close the men came to death, Ernie said: 'There were coloured buoys in the water which the Germans put there for range... So if you were near one of them you could expect to be fired upon or hit.' It took a full five minutes to turn the ship around once the sailors realised they were sitting targets, Ernie said. The vessel was fired upon by around 60 shells but none scored a direct hit. Two off-duty crew members standing together watching the action lost arms during the attack after being hit by shrapnel. After the war was over in 1945, widower Ernie returned to his profession as a carpenter and started a family. He has three children, Karen, 60, Dennis, 59, and John, 62, six grandchildren and three great grandchildren. His . brother Johnny, who has two sons, Colin, 56, and Martin, 52, was . diagnosed with TB and spent years after the war in hospital. But despite being unwell, Johnny met his wife in a sanatorium. 'I was demobbed and sent to hospital with £25 as a reward but I had TB and I was upset,'  he said. 'It was the early 50s before I was fit enough for work, but when I was in the sanatorium I met Brenda.' 'Every . morning you had to go on the scales so the doctors could check your . weight. I always said Brenda was weighing me up when she was looking at . me.' After recovering from his illness Johnny went on to become an executive at BT, finally retiring in 1984. The brothers will both attend a special ceremony for veterans at Caen in Normandy tomorrow, where they are due to be presented with commemorative medals. The brothers and their children will be with them on a poignant day at the Abbaye aux Dames. 'We are aware of our ages and it’s probably the last chance we will have to go back,' Ernie said. Memories: Pictured far right is Johnny Dale, aged 22, with fellow sailors on board the HMS Resolution, off the coast of Africa in 1942. Johnny joined the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 . The . landings on June 6, 1944 involved a combination of British, Canadian, . American and French forces, including hundreds of units from the Royal . Navy. About . 132,000 Royal Marines and Allied soldiers were transported by ships and . injected onto the beaches of Normandy by landing craft and sea boat.

"Brazilian authorities are investigating claims that organs have been illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research. The organs were allegedly removed from bodies which had not been reclaimed by family members at the Coroner's Service (SVO) in Sao Paulo. They were then reportedly sold for research purposes, while the bodies were illegally buried as paupers in a cemetery in Perus. Brazilian prosecutors are investigating claims that organs were illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research. The bodies were then reportedly buried as paupers in a Perus Cemetery, Sao Paulo . This is despite no 'proper' efforts having been made to locate relatives and obtain their consent, prosecutors told the BBC. Prosecutors launched an investigation last November after family members complained they had not been contacted before their loved ones were buried in Perus Cemetery. They discovered 3,000 people possessing documents clearly identifying them could have been illegally buried in mass graves, marked only with numbers, as paupers over the past 15 years. In these cases, the deceased had died in the street or a public hospital - and their bodies had not been reclaimed by relatives within 72 hours. The organs were allegedly sold for research purposes despite no 'proper' efforts having been made to locate relatives (file picture) Shockingly, some of these bodies may have been buried with few - if any - organs, say prosecutors. The SVO, run by pathology teachers from one of Brazil's most prestigious universities, says it has since improved its procedures, but denies any illegal activity. However, during their inquiry, prosecutors were told by two witnesses that organs had been illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research. They currently have no material proof to back up the allegations. Dr Luiz Gernando Ferraz da Silva, the SVO's director, told BBC Brasil that the service operates 'within the law' and has no legal obligation to locate relatives of bodies taken to its premises. He said the deceased are 'generally... buried intact', adding: 'There are specific situations in which organs are used, but always with the purpose of being used for research. 'But where patients' bodies are not claimed, that does not happen.' Dr Ferraz da Silva said the service now collects detailed information about bodies - including photos of the deceased and their fingerprints and tissue fragments - before passing it on to the police. In 2010, hundreds of thousands of Britons were caught up in an NHS blunder that saw organs being taken from dead patients and used without their consent. Donors . who expressly stated they did not want certain body parts taken after . their death had their details changed so their records showed any of . their organs could be removed. More than 21 bereaved families were contacted by health officials to be told the disturbing news . that tissue was mistakenly taken from their loved ones. The . error, which affected 800,000 people, happened when details concerning . the body parts that donors do not want to be removed was deleted from . the NHS Organ Donor Register.","Organs allegedly removed from dead bodies not reclaimed by relatives .

"Rodney Clavell's girlfriend has appeared in court accused of knocking down and killing a midwife, less than a day after her partner shot himself dead at the culmination of a 13-hour siege. Samantha Farrer, 37, entered a plea of not guilty when she attended Adelaide Magistrates Court, which is located just over a block away from where Australia's most wanted man ended his life. Prosecutors allege Ms Farrer was driving the car that struck and killed Kathleen Heraghty, a local midwife, as she cycled along a road last December. Ms Farrer also denies an aggravated count of driving without due care and to failing to stop at the scene of a fatal accident. Wearing a black baseball cap, a black dress over black jeans, and long black boots, she hid her face behind sunglasses as she left the building. When she last appeared at court in March, Clavell had accompanied her. All counts are unrelated to Clavell's time on the run, the brothel siege or his suicide. Scroll down for video . In court: Rodney Clavell's girlfriend Samantha Farrer appears at Adelaide Magistrates Court just 24 hours after her boyfriend committed suicide . Ms Farrer wore a white panama hat on the way into court (left) and then swapped for a black baseball cap on the way out . As Ms Farrer was attending court, more details emerged about the siege, which ended with the death of her 46-year-old boyfriend. Clavell knew at least one of the women he took hostage - and may have been at the brothel for up to four days before he killed himself with a gun while watching the siege on television. The women were barricaded into a room and the gunman blocked the entry and exit to prevent police fron storming in. This afternoon, South Australian police revealed scenes from inside the siege,  which they said were terrifying for the four women. Trapped in a room and threatened by Clavell brandishing a firearm, the women desperately plotted their escape over the phone with police. SA Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson said when one woman tried to escape she was threatened by Clavell and prevented from leaving. 'A barricade was put up internally and there was Mr Clavell with a firearm,' Mr Dickson said. He said Clavell sought refuge at Marilyn's Studio after a fortnight on the run because he knew 'one or two' women. 'I think It's quite obvious he believed because of the history of the last two weeks he was virtually safe there,' Mr Dickson said. Charge: She pleaded no guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and then left court without making any comment . Killed: Midwife Kathleen Heraghty died after she was hit by a car in December last year . He confirmed Clavell died by firearm in a room and his body was found with the weapon next to a switched on television. While he wouldn't confirm the firearm was a shotgun,  he said 'it definitely wasn't a .22'. Mr Dickson said he expected police would be arresting people over the next few weeks for helping Clavell. While he was on the run, police believe the fugitive assaulted a woman while armed with a shotgun and stole her car on May 25, and made threats to other people. 'Some of those threats were committed with a firearm to receive money to obtain mobile phones and be able to live in these different locations,' Mr Dickson said. 'In some degree he was extorting other people in that criminal fringe.' Clavell's death will now be investigated by major crime detectives, who will prepare a report for the coroner. On May 20, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Clavell, who had a long criminal history, over firearm matters. Since the warrant was issued, police raided more than 80 premises. Thursday's siege, which began at 1am, led to the lockdown of parts of the Adelaide CBD near the brothel. Clavell, who was once seen wearing a Ned Kelly T-shirt in a picture posted on his girlfriend's Facebook page, was not always a fugitive. The gunman was once a devout Christian and father to 11 children, who worked in various welding jobs. He did not have his first run-in with the law until he was aged 35. Former associates of Clavell believe he was steered onto a dangerous, criminal path when he started working as a prison guard, sometime before 2002. David Sly, who worked with Clavell at the Yatala and Mobilong prisons, said Clavell's turn from prison guard to criminal was not the first he had seen. Fugitive Rodney Clavell (pictured left wearing a Ned Kelly T-shirt) was found dead after going on the run from police for 14 days. His son Daniel Clavell (pictured right in a police mugshot) says his father got him hooked on steroids when he was a teenager . 'A lot of his former colleagues will be thinking about this and we've seen so many of our mates, you know, go off the rails and here's another one,' Mr Sly told ABC. 'He was involved with his church, he was involved with his family, he was a promising correctional officer, he was fit, he was talented, he was articulate. 'I think exposure to the prison environment and family breakdown, I suppose a number of things could have led to this.' Around this time Clavell was a boxing enthusiast and gym junkie who started using steroids and eventually illegal drugs. 'He became this right-wing Christian guy but he was always pumping iron. As he was doing it he had this look, like he was angry underneath,' one former associate told The Advertiser. Clavell even got his 26-year-old son Daniel Clavell hooked on steroids when he was a teenager. Daniel Clavell appeared in Adelaide Magistrates Court last month where he plead guilty to four random assaults on strangers. His lawyer Nikki Conley said the 26-year-old had been on a steroid bender and blamed his former-prison guard father for introducing him to steroids at age 16. Ms Conley said in recent months Clavell had become a Muslim. 'His new-found faith has changed his life,' she said. 'He is a man who wants to implement changes in his life in the future.'

Back in 2002 Rodney Clavell was charged with four counts of assaulting a family member and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He faced court charged with allegedly assaulting his wife and some of their children. He denied all allegations. The charges were dismissed because they could not be proved 'beyond reasonable doubt'. In 2003 he was dismissed by the Department for Correctional Services. But it was in 2004 that Clavell became infamous in South Australia. He was involved in a shootout with police after he led them on a 46km chase, at one point driving behind the wheel of a 12-tonne bulldozer. With a shotgun pointed at his own heart, Clavell led police on a slow-speed chase during which he was shot in the thigh by an officer who he had attempted to run down. A police sniper eventually stopped Clavell after shooting him in the shoulder. Rodney Clavell on a gurney after the 46km police chase in the Adelaide Hills 2004. He was shot in the thigh and shoulder . Clavell was initially charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of shooting at a person with intent to resist lawful apprehension but the charges were later dropped. He was sentenced to four years and four months in jail over offences relating to theft, driving in a dangerous manner and carrying a loaded firearm. In prison in 2008 he was involved in a three-day riot with 35 other inmates. In 2011 Clavell was in trouble with the law again, found guilty of driving dangerously to escape a police pursuit. In February this year he was found not guilty of over an attack on a woman who was punched in the face with a studded leather glove. In March, Clavell attended court to support his girlfriend Samantha Farrer, 37, who was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and leaving the scene of an accident. She has yet to enter a plea. On Thursday afternoon Clavell was found dead inside the brothel where he had been hiding out in Adelaide's CBD. Clavell's half-brother Wayne Clavell said more should have been done to prevent the death. 'They should have got hold of his mother or his sister, got the mother here or the sister to try and negotiate,' he said. Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson said police located Mr Clavell deceased at about 1.40pm, after deploying a robot to search the premises at about 12.55pm. 'That robot took some time to search the premises but was able to locate Mr Clavell in a position which we believed he was deceased,' he said. The matter has been determined to be a death in custody and an investigation and file will now be prepared for the coroner.

"British man Robert Fairchild was found by police and rescue teams after spending nearly two days lost in West Australian bush after attending a festival. The 21-year-old man was found by police on Tuesday at 11am, two kilometres from where he was seen last seen in scrub between Yarra Road and the Brookton Highway in Flynn, about 75 kilometres south east of Perth. 'We found him walking towards a camp site,' Inspector Tony Colfer of Wheatbelt District Office in Northam confirmed. British man Robert Fairchild, pictured, was found by police and rescue teams after spending two days lost in bush outside Perth after attending a festival . 'He was very disorientated and dehydrated and had to be conveyed by helicopter to the Royal Perth Hospital. He will be there overnight for observation,' he told MailOnline. 'He was able to speak but hasn't spoken about what happened - our concern was his safety and that was our main priority.' Insp Colfer said the man was exposed to rain and harsh climate during the time he was missing. Having lived in Perth for the 'last few years' Insp Colfer said the man's family in the UK had been notified of the disappearance and subsequently him being found. A Western Australia police media spokeswoman confirmed the man had been living in Bayswater, north east of Perth CBD. Insp Colfer said Mirrabooka police station was contacted late on Sunday night by a friend who reported Mr Fairchild's disappearance. 'As a result of that a missing person was filed,' he said. Police conducted a search of the area where the man was last seen that night but were unable to locate him, Insp Colfer said. On Monday morning an extended land search resumed, which continued on Tuesday, when the man was found. Insp Colfer said the joint venture to find Mr Fairchild involved police, SES personnel, the Department of Park and Wildlife rangers as well as air support, mounted police and a dog squad. 'All up there were about 30 police officers and 80 SES personnel,' he said. 'Middle of nowhere': The 22-year-old went missing in bush about 75 kilometres south east of Perth and close to the Mundering State Forest . 'It was a large-scale search so it was very important to work together to achieve a positive outcome,' he said. During the search, Insp Colfer said vacant bushland of a scruby, rocky and hilly nature was scoured. 'There's not a lot of properties out there, so it's pretty well isolated - it's out in the middle of nowhere,' he said. Insp Colfer pinpointed the specific area Mr Fairchild was found in as seven kilometres north along Yarra Road and three kilometres east, near a campsite close to where the bush festival took place and in the area of the Mundaring State Forest.

"Older people with lung cancer are much less likely to be given life-saving surgery than the young, it has been revealed. Those aged 75 or over were five times less likely to have an operation even if they were in good health and their cancer had not spread. The research by Macmillan Cancer Support, with Monitor Deloitte and Public Health England, adds to mounting evidence of age discrimination in NHS treatment. Missing out: Those aged 75 or over were five times less likely to have an operation even if they were in good health and their cancer had not spread (file picture) Experts say there are complex reasons why older patients may not receive surgery, including other serious health conditions or if the cancer has spread. But Ciaran Devane, chief executive at Macmillan, said that isn’t the whole picture. Assessment methods are often inadequate, he said, meaning that many older cancer patients’ treatment is chosen based on their age alone, not their fitness. The charity also found older patients are more likely to have difficulties getting to hospital, or to decide not to have surgery. Mr Devane said: ‘I just cannot comprehend why healthy older lung cancer patients are given less life-saving surgery than younger patients, despite the fact that many could survive for years afterwards.’ Older patients are far more likely to survive if they have surgery, studies show. Among the ‘healthiest’ over-65s, two-thirds of those who have surgery are alive seven years later. Just one in 70 of those who do not have surgery will live that long. A report this year found five-year survival rates for patients 75 and over in England and Wales are among the worst in Europe – 44 per cent worse for lung cancer patients. Inequality: Caroline Abrahams, director of charity Age UK, said the figures suggest there is still age discrimination in the NHS . Campaigners said older patients were ‘written off as too old’ by the NHS. Mr Devane said: ‘It is deeply sad that our survival rates in this age group continue to lag behind Europe. We should not send a message to older patients that it is okay to discriminate. ‘If we don’t take heed of these figures now, things will get worse. ‘The UK should match the best in Europe, not the worst. The NHS must ensure every older patient is treated based on their overall fitness, not their chronological age.’ Sue O’Lone, from London, said her grandmother had experienced discrimination. The 32-year-old said: ‘My grandmother was 80 when  she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007. It wasn’t advanced as far as we were aware but all she was offered was a bit of radiotherapy. ‘She was given no support, and no effort was put into her care. I really do feel they saw her as an old woman and they weren’t going to bother much. She was shunted between health authorities who seemed reluctant to take responsibility for her, and died a year later in hospital after an emergency admission.’ Caroline Abrahams, director of charity Age UK, said: ‘This research once again demonstrates that older people can experience discrimination within the NHS and that the chances of receiving high-quality care are all too often stacked against them.’ She added: ‘Where a patient and their doctor agree that treatment for lung cancer, or any condition, would be safe and of benefit, they should be able to have it regardless of their age. Decisions about who should and should not be given surgery should be based purely on clinical need – anything else is blatant age discrimination.’ Around 38,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year. In England, only 29 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women with the disease survive for one year. A large study found most women  did not meet national guidelines for physical activity after their diagnosis . Exercise can help breast cancer survivors live longer – but two out of three are doing too little, researchers say. A large study found most women  did not meet national guidelines for physical activity after their diagnosis. Only 35 per cent of breast cancer  survivors were doing at least half an hour a day of moderate activity, says research published online in Cancer, an American Cancer Society journal. Although the study was carried out in the US, British experts said survivors here need more support to increase and maintain exercise levels. The study assessed physical activity in 1,735 women aged 20 to 74 before and after they were diagnosed with breast cancer. The team led by Brionna Hair, of the University of North Carolina, found almost two-thirds of women were less active six months after diagnosis than they had been before. Miss Hair said ways of getting women active should be ‘comprehensively evaluated and implemented’. In the UK, 50,000 women and 400 men develop breast cancer each year. They are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity, such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, including running or aerobics, every week.French research this year found exercising for an hour a day cut women’s risk of breast cancer by 11 per cent.","Research adds to evidence of increasing age discrimination in the NHS .

On Friday afternoon, a White House official released a readout of the 15-minute conversation, saying Obama warned Putin that 'de-escalation' of sanctions against Russia 'depends upon Russia recognizing President-elect Poroshenko as the legitimate leader of Ukraine, ceasing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and stopping the provision of arms and materiel across the border'. Obama, the readout continued, 'noted President-elect Poroshenko's commitment to pursue reforms to ensure that the rights and interests of all Ukrainians are respected, and urged Russia to work immediately with the government in Kiev to reduce tensions.' 'President Obama made clear that a failure to take these steps would only deepen Russia's isolation.'

"Also on trial: Kelly Rayner (pictured) is accused of allowing her partner Ross Conlin to murder their baby daughter Kiera by failing to care for her . A drug user father shook to death his own baby daughter after flying into a rage because he 'failed to bond with her', a court has heard. Ross Conlin, 29, who regularly used cocaine and cannabis, reportedly attacked four-month-old Kiera 'in anger' while left alone with her in Farnborough, Hampshire. He allegedly 'vigorously shook' the baby - causing her to stop breathing, suffer a bleed to the brain and finally have a heart attack. Kiera, who also suffered bleeding to the . eyes, was taken to hospital with 'terrible injuries' and placed on a life . support machine, but died the next day. Now, Conlin has denied murder and three charges of causing grievous bodily harm to his daughter on three previous occasions at Winchester Crown Court. He had allegedly caused Kiera to suffer from three skull fractures, rib fractures and bleeding in her eye sockets in the months leading up to her death last May. Meanwhile, his partner, Kelly Rayner, has denied a charge of allowing Kiera's death by failing to care for and protect her daughter. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, . told the court the pair had been staying with . Rayner’s parents at the time of the alleged murder on May 6. He said Conlin, who worked as a debt collector, had been left alone with Kiera while Rayner went to have her nails painted and her parents were out. However, shortly after 10am, Conlin had suddenly attacked his daughter, 'probably in anger'. 'Such was the nature of that violent shaking, she suffered three recognised injuries, and others, that form what the doctors call a triad of injuries in such cases: bleeding to the surface of the brain; brain injury caused by the loss of oxygen and blood to the brain, and retinal haemorrhaging - bleeding to the eyes,' he said. 'Her injuries were so severe, having become unconscious and stopped breathing - she was in her father’s hands at the time - she suffered a heart attack. 'She never recovered and was allowed to die the following day, the doctors unable to save her. Case: Conlin, 29, reportedly attacked four-month-old Kiera 'in anger' while left alone with her, Winchester Crown Court (pictured) heard. He allegedly 'vigorously shook' the baby, causing her to suffer a heart attack . 'The prosecution say that her father... murdered her at a . time when he was alone with his daughter. He . did so probably in anger. 'The trial will also consider the role her mother, Rayner, played in her death. We . do not say that Rayner caused her death, but allege that she failed to . protect her daughter from her father, Ross Conlin, knowing that her . daughter had suffered repeated injuries at the hands of Ross Conlin.' Mr Lickley said there had been 'stress and strain' in the household in the weeks leading up to Kiera's death - with Rayner fearing that Conlin might leave her. He . explained that a major cause had been the lack of a 'bond' between Conlin . and his daughter, saying: 'Ross Conlin had had a good relationship . with her but that relationship changed and he became unhappy and . stressed by the lack of bond between he, father, and Kiera, daughter.' Conlin had also suffered from money worries, used dating websites and faced disciplinary procedures at work after his performance had 'dipped', he said. Meanwhile, the defendant's drug use had impacted on the household, the court heard. 'He is a drug user, he smoked cannabis, he smoked cannabis on . May 5th, the day before events on May 6th, and historically at least had . taken cocaine,' said Mr Lickley. 'Such habits indicate a lack of responsibility on behalf of both parents when looking after children.' Court appearance: Rayner is pictured arriving at Winchester Crown Court today with a female companion . Mr . Lickley said that Conlin had dialled 999 at 10.47am after attacking Kiera, telling operators that she had choked on her bottle . before she suddenly stopped breathing and went limp. But he added: 'She . hadn’t suffered those injuries as a result of choking or vomiting on . her bottle, as her father said, but as a result of violent shaking by . the adult holding her, her own father.' Paramedics . arrived at the scene and managed to restart Kiera’s heart, before . taking her to Frimley Park Hospital and later, a specialist unit at . Southampton General Hospital. 'But . despite that, her injuries were so severe a decision was taken to . withdraw support, her life support, because she was brain dead,' said Mr . Lickley. 'Life support was withdrawn at 6.20pm [on May 7] and Kiera died in her mother’s arms at 7pm.' He added that post-mortem examinations . had shown that Kiera had suffered a rib fracture between four and eight . weeks prior to her death, with the same rib and another being fractured . again about 14 days prior to her death, along with three skull . fractures. The baby had then suffered further rib . fractures between three and five days prior to her death and showed . signs of previously having suffered bleeding to the eyes. These injuries accounted for the three charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, he said. Later in the trial, Mr Lickley read the jury a series of text messages between Conlin and Rayner. He said the messages showed the strain that their relationship was under - and also read another message from Conlin to a friend which showed the difficulties he was having with Kiera. The message read: 'LOL alright fella. Little missy is a pain in the arse, she’s always crying so it’s a bit difficult.' Mr Lickley said that Rayner had also told a doctor during an eight-week check-up for Keira that Conlin 'was not forming much of an attachment' to his daughter. He said that the doctor advised her to give it time and encourage her partner and daughter to spend as much time together as possible. But by March 25, six weeks before Kiera died, Rayner had a meeting with a member of nursery staff whom she told that Kiera kept hurting herself. Mr Lickley said that she told the staff member that: 'She was quite worried as Kiera kept on hurting herself and had scratches and bruises that were mostly on her arms, legs and face. 'She went on to say that she couldn’t get Kiera weighed because she was quite embarrassed about what people might think about the injuries.' He added that the nursery staff worker had 'never heard anything like that before and advised her to see her GP.' The trial has been adjourned until Monday.

"In what researchers are calling a breakthrough in cancer treatment, scientists in Adelaide have produced a new treatment strategy that sees cancer cells killing themselves. Results of the study, published this week, found that after a short exposure to targeted therapy cancer cells decide to die, promising a new approach to fighting cancer. 'This discovery is paradigm shifting,' said Professor Deborah White, Director, Cancer Research with the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), who conducted the study with the University of Adelaide's Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine. Professor Deborah White has described the discovery of a new way to kill cancer cells as 'paradigm-shifting' 'In our research, we're looking for methods that will result in the cancer cell killing itself. This would provide an improved treatment and reduce the risk of cancer relapse,' she said. Lisa Schafranek, a PhD student at the University of Adelaide who is part of the research team, explains that unlike normal cells, which run their course and then die, cancer cells are not set up to die. 'The only way to get them to do that is by cutting off their survival messaging,' she told MailOnline. There are methods of treatment that cut off survival messaging, however they have side effects, such as chemotherapy, which 'carpet-bombs all your cells'. This new development allows treatments to target particular cells. 'If we can find what’s specific about that cancer, we can spare the normal cells,' said Ms Schafranek. Professor White says this treatment strategy might be effective in treating leukemia as well as reducing the side effects from chemotherapy and the need for ongoing treatment. The study examined how blocking certain proteins might affect the death of cancerous cells, a subject that researchers said was 'poorly understood'. The researchers found that blocking a protein named STAT5 proved lethal for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, and Professor White said the findings extend beyond CML to all targeted cancer treatments. 'The activity of STAT5 appears to be a critical determinant of the decision for cancer cells to live or die,' said Ms Schafranek. 'Our research has found that by blocking STAT5 in conjunction with exposure to a regular anti-cancer treatment, we were able to more effectively target the leukaemia cells. We now also better understand the timing required for the combined treatment to be effective.' The results were published in the Leukemia journal. The study was conducted at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute .","Researchers in Adelaide have been researching a new treatment strategy .

"Under fire: Nick Gargan, suspended chief constable of Avon & Somerset police, has been hit with fresh claims of sexual impropriety . A chief constable suspended over sex harassment claims left a previous post at the British embassy in Paris under a cloud after it emerged he had been in a close relationship with a senior colleague’s daughter. Nick Gargan, head of Avon and Somerset Police, was last night facing difficult questions about his conduct when he worked on the investigation into the death of Princess Diana. High-ranking diplomats are said to have been disappointed with the judgment of the then-married detective, who had a key role in the probe into the car crash which killed the Princess and Dodi Fayed. His posting as police liaison officer at the embassy in 1998 came while he was on secondment to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. The job meant he acted as intermediary between Scotland Yard and French detectives. According to a number of sources, his close relationship with a senior colleague’s daughter was hushed up, and after returning home Mr Gargan, now 47, continued his rise through the ranks. Sue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said that she was unaware of Mr Gargan’s unhappy spell in Paris when she appointed him chief constable last year. Until a month ago, when he was suspended over claims he sexually harassed at least four female officers and staff in Avon and Somerset, Mr Gargan was being tipped as a potential future Scotland Yard commissioner. He vehemently denies the allegations. It was unclear last night whether the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating the alleged sexual harassment, will also probe the Paris claims. Mr Gargan, then in his early 30s, formed a close relationship with the daughter of a senior British embassy colleague. It is believed the woman, who was younger than Mr Gargan, was working at the embassy at the time. She could not be reached for comment last night. It is understood that the British ambassador to France at the time, Sir Michael Jay, and other senior embassy officials were alerted to the relationship. The British embassy in Paris: According to sources, his close relationship with a senior embassy colleague's daughter was hushed up, and after returning home Mr Gargan, now 47, continued his rise through the ranks . A source said: ‘Mr Gargan’s conduct while he was working at the British embassy in 1998 was wholly inappropriate. ‘It was certainly poor judgment, especially when you consider he was working on the Princess Diana investigation at the time.’ In a statement issued on behalf of Mr Gargan, the Chief Police Officers’ Staff Association said: ‘This is a historic, private and irrelevant matter. When Mr Gargan ended his secondment with the National Criminal Intelligence Service in 1998, it was entirely his own decision.’ A former colleague of Mr Gargan’s at the National Criminal Intelligence Service confirmed that he had left the embassy posting ‘under a cloud’ but would not elaborate.","Nick Gargan is already facing allegations of sexual harassment .

"A nurse has been found guilty of killing a mother of two after carrying her on the bonnet of her car and deliberately swerving to fling her off. Ophelia Okai-Koi, 51, sped off with 33-year-old Christie McHugh on her bonnet after they started arguing over parking outside the Lord Kitchener pub in New Barnet, north London. She drove down the street with the victim 'spread out like a starfish', before turning sharply in a bid to throw her off. Victim: Ophelia Okai-Koi, 51, has been found guilty of killing Christie McHugh, 33, after carrying her on her car and deliberately swerving to fling her off. Above, Ms McHugh is pictured with her husband, John, and her son . Mrs McHugh died in front of her husband, John, five-year-old son and five-month-old daughter after falling off the bonnet and smashing her skull on a metal post outside the pub. Now, Okai-Koi, who works as a mental health nurse, has been convicted of causing death by careless driving at Harrow Crown Court. She was cleared by a jury of the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving. The court heard that Mrs McHugh, who weighed 20 stone, had confronted Okai-Koi after she parked in the pub's car park while shopping at a nearby Sainsbury's store in March last year. Scene: Okai-Koi sped off with Mrs McHugh on her bonnet after they started arguing over parking outside the Lord Kitchener pub (pictured) in New Barnet, north London. The mother of two was 'spread out like a starfish' Family: Mrs McHugh died in front of her family after Okai-Koi deliberately swerved and she fell off the bonnet . The mother, who had been drinking, claimed the nurse's vehicle had blocked the rear door of her own car, preventing her from putting her son's baby seat into the back of it. Mrs McHugh and her husband then started repeatedly kicking Okai-Koi's car - prompting her to block them in and call the police. Witnesses told the court they had heard the infuriated couple shouting that it was a private car park and Okai-Koi should not have parked there. Amrita Choudra, who was at the scene, said Mr McHugh had screamed 'f*** you' while kicking Okai-Koi's car '20 times in total'. Row: The court heard Mrs McHugh had confronted the nurse after she parked in the Lord Kitchener pub's car park while shopping at a supermarket . Mrs McHugh then sat on the bonnet of the vehicle and started to 'bounce' around, before the nurse suddenly drove off, the court heard. 'The person driving the car didn’t seem to care,' said Ms Choudra. 'The car sped off at great, great speed. I couldn’t believe the person would drive away.' Nina Steel, who worked at the Sainsbury’s store, said Mrs McHugh had been spread out on the bonnet 'like a starfish'. She added: 'The car reversed a bit, before going full steam ahead. It turned suddenly and she was flung off the car.' Alison Hunter, QC prosecuting, said Okai-Koi had not been 'panicking', but rather acting with 'self righteousness'. 'This is a two way fight,' she said. 'Ms Okai-Koi is involving herself with at every step of the way, fuelling it.' She added that the nurse had 'lost the plot' and 'decided to teach Christie a lesson' by 'put[ting] her foot down... to throw her off'. Summarising the case, Judge Freya Newbery said: 'The only live issue in this case is the question of whether a car should ever be driven blindly out of a car park at speed on to a busy road with an unsecured, 20-stone drunken person flailing about on the bonnet. 'She undoubtedly intended to throw this annoying aggressive drunken woman who was bouncing around on her bonnet off it. 'She undoubtedly heard the bang, she undoubtedly saw her on the floor out of the rear view mirror, and at that point she undoubtedly realised what she had done. And still she drove on. 'I have no doubt that she was in a total panic by that time. But at no point before that moment did she panic.' Incident: Okai-Koi, who works as a mental health nurse, has been convicted of causing death by careless driving at Harrow Crown Court. Above, the road next to the Lord Kitchener pub, where Mrs McHugh died . Okai-Koi, from New Barnet, told the court she had 'feared for her life' when the couple confronted her in the pub's car park. Daniel O’Malley, defending, added: 'Maybe she shouldn’t have used the car park, but it had nothing to do with them. 'It was a matter for the pub, not the customers.' Mr O'Malley claimed the defendant had not realised that Mrs McHugh was on her bonnet, but had simply seen a 'huge image' and 'bolted'. Okai-Koi has been released on bail and is due to be sentenced next month.","Ophelia Okai-Koi, 51, sped off with Christie McHugh, 33, on bonnet of car .

"Gaudy palaces suspected of being built by Romany criminal masterminds on the back of criminal gang activities in the UK and other European countries are facing demolition. Authorities in Hunedoara, a city in central-western Romania, are threatening to tear down the so-called 'gypsy palaces' which have appeared across the region because all were built illegally, and many of them are safety hazards. Police believe most were constructed on the back of illicit criminal enterprises abroad. Scroll down for video . Gaudy palaces suspected of being built by Romany criminal masterminds on the back of criminal gang activities in the UK and other European countries are facing demolition . Authorities in Hunedoara, a city in central-western Romania, are threatening to tear down the so-called 'gypsy palaces' dotting the region because all were built illegally, and many of them are safety hazards . The Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty are among the kitschy ornaments on the roofs of some . Many of the sports cars parked outside the homes have a UK number plate. Checks carried out this month by employees of Hunedoara City Hall revealed that more than 50 buildings in and around the city did not receive planning permission. The investigation also revealed that some of those who had the houses built around Chizid and Hadat were not even the rightful owners of the land on which they stand. 'The Court of Auditors recommended us to find a solution so that the owners of these properties comply to the law and pay taxes for them,' said the mayor of Hunedoara, Viorel Arion. The cars all have UK number plates which suggest the owners have links to the UK . Just one of the many homes which were built without permission and are structurally unsafe . But he warned that the legal process of demolition could take a while. The . palatial neighbourhood of Hunedoara's gypsy palaces began to expand a . decade ago and now includes a few dozen villas on both sides of the road . on the way to the village of Calan. The Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty are among the kitschy ornaments on the roofs of some. 'Drivers . stop their cars next to the palaces and are always surprised by the . fancy ideas that the owners dreamed up,' said a man named Vasile, a . neighbour of the Roma families. A senior Romanian police officer working in Bucharest told the Mail Online: 'It is an open secret that many of these properties were financed by crime, but as it was not crime in Romania there is little that can or is done about it, our resources are concentrated on tackling crime here. 'We have had some raids on the gypsy clans engaging in child trafficking and prostitution as these are after all Romanian citizens that were often the victims, but the begging gangs, the pickpockets and the scrap metal thieves that are all operating abroad, its hard to tackle these groups as at the end of the day cross border crime is very problematic to take action over. 'If anything, the  palaces should come under scrutiny from the Romanian taxman which does periodically stages raids, these properties are after all conspicuous proof of possible undeclared income. 'And they are also often built with very little regard to either planning permission or indeed the basic building safety requirements, which is the responsibility of the local councils. 'Both these bodies can and do take action, although so far it seems with little impact, given the way the properties are multiplying and spreading.' Across Romania after the borders were opened, the gypsies who faced prejudice and abuse back home left to go abroad and not all were looking to earn money honestly. Police believe most were constructed on the back of illicit criminal enterprises abroad . Checks carried out this month by employees of Hunedoara City Hall revealed that more than 50 buildings in and around the city never had planning permission . One of the car owners with is UK registered car which he uses in Romania . Across Romania after the borders were opened, the gypsies who faced prejudice and abuse back home left to go abroad and not all were looking to earn money honestly. When some of them made vast amounts . earned from everything from begging and pickpocketing, child trafficking . and prostitution through to scrap metal theft, the slums were . dismantled to make way for yet more palatial homes. With . the lifting of restrictions to working in the UK, more of these . criminal gangs could be set to make their way to England under the . pretence of 'looking for work'. The . garish looking palatial type homes exude wealth via the . brightly-coloured buildings with flamboyant decor, top of the range cars . often with UK number plates parked outside and gaudy statues filling . the gardens. Here there are no signs of the economic crisis which it is all too plain to see in many towns throughout the UK. Looking . around many of the streets are empty, there are not many people around, . despite there being thousands registered as living in the area, not to . mention the thousands more known to be living unregistered in the . community - as is normal in Romania's Roma communities. People . are reluctant to talk. The Roma community like to keep their business, . and particularly their money making activities, a closely guarded . secret. One of the few that . spoke out told MailOnline: 'Many of the people who live here are away on business. The men are often away for months on end. They go abroad in search of . work I was told. I don't know exactly what they do. We are not told . much. Some of those who raised their palaces around Chizid and Hadat were not even the rightful owners of the land on which they stand . The palatial neighbourhood of Hunedoara's gypsy palaces began to expand a decade ago and now includes a few dozen villas on both sides of the road on the way to the village of Calan . 'I know they work in England, Germany and France. For months they are gone and they send money back to their families here in the village. As you can see, a lot of money, that is what keeps the wealth growing here. 'The village used to be small, when my family moved here, it used to be just scattered with caravans and not a lot else, but over the last decade the area has become more wealthy and huge houses have been built one after the other. 'People are very proud of their houses, everyone wants their house to look bigger and better than their neighbours. 'Pride is a very important thing in the community. Of course they are worthless, no Romanian would live in them, they are always built to look good, but the quality is rumoured to be bad.' A local gypsy, whose house is made of dried mud bricks on the outskirts of town, said. 'There are honest people here, if you want to know who they are, look at the houses.'","Hunedoara authorities threatening to tear down so-called 'gypsy palaces'

"Beach huts are proving more popular than ever as holidaymakers across Britain desperately snap up their own little piece of home beside the sea. While many luxury beach huts on the market cost more than a brand new, fully-functioning home, not all seaside investments need to break the bank.

Despite appearing to be very basic inside, this beach hut in Felixstowe, Suffolk, is on sale for just under £20,000 - despite nearby flats costing only £25,000. It does, however, open up onto the picturesque sandy beach . In recent weeks, some beach huts across Britain have sold for more than £115,000, while others have been marketed for in excess of a staggering £300,000. It is an indication of how the housing market has changed over the years, with beach huts now the sought-after property for wealthy holidaymakers who are willing to pay above and beyond for their slice of the seaside. However, it’s not just wealthy holidaymakers with cash to spare who are splashing out on seaside huts. While the price of beach huts might be high in some parts of the country, there are also decent investments to be had in other areas. In Felixstowe, Suffolk, some of the cheapest beach huts are on the market for £7,000  and many are situated right on the beach, with a ladder from the front door down to the sand. In Hove, Brighton, one hut is currently on the market for £14,000 - which could prove a good investment if used well over the years. The average price for a seafront beach hut in Whitstable, Kent (pictured), is £25,000 while huts are being offered for up to £70,000 in Wells-next-the-Sea, on the North Norfolk coast . Rising beach hut prices mean wealthy holidaymakers are regularly paying more than the cost of a house for their seafront property . Another, in a prime position on the . seafront at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, is on the market for £18,000 and . comes newly decorated in pastel colours with 1950s floral interior.

Whitstable, Kent, is £25,000 while huts are being offered for up to . £70,000 in Wells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast. For . those with a bit more cash to splash, one of the most expensive beach . huts - measuring just 19ft by 16ft - was put up for sale in Shaldon, . Devon in April for £200,000 – costing five times more than a . three-bedroom house currently on the market in Hartlepool. Despite . coming with a kitchenette area, bed, heating, television and skylights . which automatically close when it rains, the property is no bigger than a . room in a fully-functioning family home. Other . 'one-bedroom' beach huts in the area also go for exceptional amounts of . money - with another on the same stretch of seafront currently up for . sale for £245,000. Beach huts in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, vary in price but this pale blue property is on the market for £18,000 . This beach hut is in a prime position on the seafront at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, and is on the market for £18,000. It is full of 1950s charm with pastel colours, polkadots and floral interior . Despite many of the beach huts featuring a bed, kitchenette and storage space, they are no bigger than a single room in a fully-functioning family home . Marketed as a 'one-bed bungalow', it comes with a modern kitchen, a new bathroom with an electric shower, and sleeps two in the upstairs ‘maisonette’ bedroom - but it is smaller than most 'basic' studio flats in London. In Christchurch, Dorset, there are beach huts up for sale for £225,000, with some estate agents marketing them as one-bedroom terraced properties. One situated on nearby Chesil beach, in Mudeford, was recently on the market for £300,000. And in Southwold, Suffolk, one hut - called The Happy Days - was put on the market last month for £100,000. Due to it being located in one of the most sought-after stretches in the area, estate agents believe it will fetch more than its already steep asking price. That’s despite the fact it has no water supply, no electricity, no heating and comes with limited furniture. Beach huts are popular in sought-after Whitstable, Kent, where many cost from around £25,000 . The Whitstable beach hut comes with a modern interior, single bed and plenty of storage space - but its seafront location means it comes at a price of £25,000 . Beach huts are being offered for up to £70,000 in Wells-next-the-Sea (pictured), on the North Norfolk coast. In the same area, a fully-functioning quay-side office can be purchased for just £89,000 .

They sell for around £150,000 on average because of the stunning views of the Solent. One of Mudeford Spit's huts was put on the market for £180,000 last summer and sold within days. Meanwhile, Chalet number 4, on Beach Road, in West Bexington, Dorset, became one of the world's most expensive beach huts when it sold for £235,000 in 2006. The felt-roof hut had a sitting room measuring 2.85m by 2.59m, a kitchen which was 1.3m by 4.11m, a toilet and one bedroom measuring 2.87m x 2.62m.

"Police ignored a mother's repeated plea for protection from her rapist boyfriend who attacked her with a claw hammer while her young children looked on, an independent watchdog has found. Mother-of-two Charmaine, who has withheld her surname, pleaded for protection from officers after 'fearing for her life' following a previous assault from her partner Christopher Veal. However, her desperate pleas went unanswered and she was horrifically assaulted by Veal at her home in Cardiff, Wales in August 2011. Mother-of-two Charmaine (left), who has chosen to withhold her surname, pleaded for repeated protection from officers from partner Christopher Veal (right) before she was brutally attacked at her home in Cardiff . The Independent Police Complaints Commission is now set to issue a damning report on how she was ‘let down’ by police, who dropped her home minutes before she was subjected to the attack. She had gone to her local police station to report Veal for a previous assault, saying she feared for her life and ‘did not want to get beaten any more’ - but officers failed to carry out proper background checks and drove her home. Minutes later the rapist broke in and attacked Charmaine in front of her 10-year-old daughter and 16-month-old son. Veal was recalled to prison after the attack, but committed suicide in jail two months later - ahead of his trial. Charmaine said her children had been exposed to a ‘horror film’ during the assault, which left her with serious facial and head injuries and broken ribs. She told Channel 4 News: ‘There was my partner with a claw hammer. He said “come here you b***h” and he smashed me with the hammer. ‘He kept hitting me. I tried to run out onto the veranda to scream. And while he told my daughter to stop her brother from screaming, he carried on hitting me. ‘I remember him standing behind me and the hammer coming in the front of my face and knocking my teeth out.’ She lost consciousness before Veal dialled 999 and shouted ""get the police now. There’s been a murder"". Records showed Veal was a registered sex offender with dangerous tendencies, and had convictions for rape, false imprisonment, weapon possession and wounding. The IPCC’s report said there had been ‘limited efforts’ to apprehend Veal. Charmaine said: 'They knew he was a rapist... and they sent me home. I trusted them to look after me and my children. I’ve been let down. My children have been let down. They’ve seen some horror film which no children should have ever seen.’ The Independent Police Complaints Commission is now set to issue a damning report on how Charmaine was 'let down' by South Wales Police, after officers dropped her home minutes before she was attacked . The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now published a damning report into the matter - saying South Wales Police did not give the case any urgency or priority. Commissioner Jan Williams said: ‘No-one took overall supervision and this failure to join the dots effectively put this woman and her children at serious risk. ‘South Wales Police had the systems and intelligence in place to flag up the danger that this offender presented, but at various stages officers failed to access that information and to assess that risk properly.’ Veal was released on licence from prison for previous offences in 2007 - and later began a relationship with Charmaine who said she had ‘no idea’ of the extent of her partner's criminal past. However, she began to feel vulnerable as the months went on and in August 26, 2011, made a statement to police saying Veal had assaulted her. The IPCC said South Wales Police could not immediately find Veal at the time. Three days later, while away from her home, the woman contacted officers again saying Veal had been at her address insisting she drop the charges against him. An IPCC report said: ‘She asked for police to meet her (because)... she felt unable to return home. ‘With her two young children, she waited for over two hours for the police to arrive. ‘She was taken to a police station, where she made a further statement. An officer later drove the woman and her children home. Within minutes of the officer leaving, the partner forced entry into the locked flat and attacked the woman with a hammer.’ The IPCC said there had been a ‘continuing thread of low level performance’ by police officers and 999 operators in the lead up to the attack and said one officer had a case to answer for misconduct. ‘South Wales Police had the systems and . intelligence in place to flag up the danger that this offender . presented, but at various stages officers failed to access that . information and to assess that risk properly.’ - IPCC report . Another officer and three control room staff should also be subject to management over poor performance, its investigation concluded. It also said the force - which is the biggest in Wales - should have referred the matter to the IPCC at the time it happened. The IPCC said it was only made aware of the issue when local MP Susan Elan Jones complained on the woman's behalf. ‘The police only made limited efforts to apprehend a potentially violent sex offender,’ the IPCC said. ‘Police had correctly documented and recorded all their intelligence, but did not use that information well in dealing with the escalating situation. ‘A notice to the Probation Service may not have prevented the serious assault, but it could have resulted in the offender's licence being revoked and his swift return to custody.’ The watchdog has recommended South Wales Police reviews its training for domestic violence situations - especially where children are involved. South Wales Police deputy chief constable Matt Jukes said: ‘It is clear we did not provide the victim in this case and her children with the care and protection that she needed at a critical time and we are sincerely sorry for that. ‘Over recent years we have worked incredibly hard to improve our response to incidents of domestic abuse. ‘While this has come too late to support the victim in this case, we have good evidence it is providing a much improved response to victims of domestic abuse now, helping to keep them safe.’ South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said: ‘The events should not have happened as they did. The deputy chief constable made that absolutely clear. ‘The thing is there have been failures in the past, which is why the chief constable made tackling violence against women and girls such a high priority in the police and crime plan.’","Mother-of-two Charmaine was assaulted by Christopher Veal in August 2011 .

"Australian children are getting fatter, are more likely to survive infancy, more likely to suffer from abuse or neglect and are doing better at school, according to data released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare today. The report found that childhood obesity has increased across the country, with 26 percent of all children aged five to 14 now classed as overweight or obese, compared to 23 percent in 2007. Girls are more likely to have weight-related health problems than boys, with 27 percent of girls classed as overweight, compared to 25 percent of boys. Rates of obesity have increased among Australian children, with with 26 percent of all children aged five to 14 now classed as overweight or obese, compared to 23 percent in 2007 . Obesity rates were much higher among children in single parent families (35 percent) compared to those raised by a couple (24 percent). Dr Al-Yaman said this result might relate to the socio-economic status of single parents. 'Not all single parents are poor but a significant proportion are low socio-economic. They're possibly also time-poor, with less time to spend on cooking, and junk food is cheaper than healthy food,' she said. Dr Al-Yaman added that many sporting for children activities are expensive and single parents might not be able to afford them. The Northern Territory had the highest rates of childhood obesity of all states (28.5 percent) and children born in Australia are significantly more likely to be overweight (27 percent) than children born overseas (20 percent). Socio-economic status was the most significant determinant of a child's weight, with 33 percent of children living in the lowest SES area overweight or obese, compared to only 19 percent in the highest SES areas. Rates of abuse and neglect were also higher among Australian children than they were six years ago, with 8.3 per 1,000 children suffering from abuse or neglect in 2012 compared to 7.4 children per 1,000 in 2008. Dr Fadwa Al-Yaman from the AIHW cautions that abuse and neglect statistics are hard to interpret, and the increase may reflect higher rates of abuse in the community, but it may also reflect a higher community awareness of abuse and lower tolerance for it. 'Some of it is an increase in people reporting, which is a good thing,' she told MailOnline. Literacy and numeracy rates have improved across the children, though still remain considerably lower among Indigenous children than non-Indigenous children . Children are more likely to be immunised than five years ago, and rates of immunisation are lowest among children who live in cities and in areas with high socio-economic staturs . Good news for parents included the fact that fewer children died from injuries in 2012 compared to 2004-2006. In 2012 there were 5.2 deaths per 100,000 children aged 0-14 compared to six deaths from injury per 100,000 children in 2004-2006. Infant mortality among Indigenous children was 6.2 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births among non-Indigenous children. Dr Al-Yaman said these results are an improvement on previous years. 'Infant mortality among Indigenous children has really come down a lot. If you look at earlier rates you find that the gap is closing,' she said. Indigenous children were more than three times more likely to die by injury before the age of 14, with 17 deaths per 100,000 children compared to 5 deaths per 100,000 in the non-Indigenous population. Rates of child abuse and neglect were six times higher among Indigenous children than non-Indigenous children. With 49 in every 1,000 Indigenous children abused or neglected compared to 8 in every 1,000 non-Indigenous children. This was up from a rate of 42.5 in every 1,000 Indigenous children in 2007-2008. Indigenous children also fared much worse when it came to meeting national minimum standards of numeracy and literacy – 69 percent and 65 percent respectively – compared to 93 percent and 92 percent of non-Indigenous children. Australian children also have a better chance of surviving infancy, with infant mortality rates dropping from five deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006, to four deaths in 2012. Boys are more likely to die at birth than girls, with 4.1 deaths per live 1,000 births, compared to 3.4 deaths among female babies. Indigenous babies are almost twice as likely to die at birth as non-Indigenous babies, with seven deaths per 1,000 live births among Indigenous children compared to 3.9 deaths among non-Indigenous children.

"Jailed: Peter Metcalf has been jailed after turning his guesthouse into a 'death trap' with caved-in ceilings, disabled smoke alarms and chained-up fire exits . A hotel owner has been jailed after turning his guest house into a 'death trap' with caved-in ceilings, disabled smoke alarms and chained-up fire exits. Peter Metcalf, 51, spent seven years running the 90-room New Kimberley Hotel in Blackpool, Lancashire. The venue was once described as a 'thriving, grand estate hotel' with its own ballroom. But under his ownership, it was transformed into a 'squalid' hovel - with faulty electrics, no water supply in half the building and just a single pole holding up the roof. It also had mouldy walls, smashed windows and rooms filled with debris, while chairs and microwaves littered the hostel's narrow hallways. One guest, who did not wish to be named, said: 'People have joked it was like Fawlty Towers, but it was much worse than that.' Now, Metcalf has been jailed for 18 months after being found guilty of 15 breaches of fire and safety regulations under the . Regulation Reform Fire Safety Order 2005 at Preston Crown Court. Sentencing Metcalf, Judge Anthony Russell QC told him he had shown a 'callous disregard for the safety of people living in this premises . for which you were responsible'. He added: 'They were appalling conditions. This is . an exceptionally bad example of breaches of this regard.' Metcalf, who transformed the hotel into a 'multi-occupancy' hostel, where he rented out rooms by the week, first sparked outrage when he hosted three BNP conferences at the premises in 2006. Two years later, he was fined for 20 . food hygiene offences, and the following year, Blackpool Council revoked his alcohol and entertainment licence due to ‘significant and . long standing fire and health and safety concerns’. Damaged: The 51-year-old spent seven years running the New Kimberley Hotel in Blackpool, Lancashire. The venue was once described as a 'thriving, grand estate hotel' with its own ballroom. Above, a caved-in ceiling . Chained up: But under Metcalf's ownership,the hotel was transformed into a 'squalid' hovel - with faulty electrics, no water supply in half the building, disabled smoke alarms and chained-up fire exits (pictured) Squalid: It also had mouldy walls and smashed windows, while its rooms were filled with debris and plastering . Arrest: Metcalf (pictured with police) has been jailed for 18 months after being found guilty of 15 breaches of fire and safety regulations under the Regulation Reform Fire Safety Order 2005 at Preston Crown Court . But each time council officials or health inspectors called, Metcalf was aggressive and threatened legal action against them, the court heard. Judge Russell told Metcalf: 'Attempts to speak to you . had been made but you had been obstructive and threatened legal action. 'It . appears your attitude was that people were living there for free and . they were grown adults and if they did not know the situation that was . their problem.' In . March last year, Metcalf's tenure at the hotel-turned-hostel ended when firefighters raided the . premises after water board officials discovered there . were people still staying at the propery. Hotel: One guest, who did not wish to be named, branded the hostel 'like Fawlty Towers, but much worse' Contrast: Kimberley Hotel is pictured in the 1960s, when it was a 'thriving, grand estate hotel' with a ballroom . Bleak: The hotel-turned-hostel has now been boarded up following Metcalf's arrest and subsequent jail term . Four tenants and a dog were found inside the building, including one man who had been living in the property for three years. They were each paying £50 a week in rent, the court heard. Firefighters also uncovered a string of safety hazards, including an electrical supply . illegally fitted with homemade fuses, 20 smoke alarms disabled and evidence that squatters had used one of the rooms. Shockingly, fire exits had also been chained-up or blocked off at the property- despite at least one having cooking gas and a large cylinders of petrol next to it. Disabled: This is one of the 20 smoke alarms that Metcalf disabled and left dangling from the ceiling . Subsequent inquiries revealed Metcalf had no evacuation plan for the 90-room hostel. Joseph Hart, prosecuting, said: . 'There was not one fire exit that had not been nailed shut, chained shut . or blocked with broken beds. 'The . front door, the only solitary exit had by it half empty can of cooking . gas. This near a wood lattice framework. The only way out had a . potential explosive by it.' Mr Hart said the four residents, who rented rooms on the first floor, would have . encountered a series of 'death traps' should they have needed to escape. 'Coming out of room 128, if they turned to their right to . escape they would see a door nailed shut. Turning left is the way to the . broken beds,' he said. 'The only way . to get out is to run along the corridor to the insecure stairs, passed . the electrical insulation, passed the gas canisters at the front door. The other fire escape on the ground floor was, in fact, chained shut. 'The . electricity circuit had been bypassed in an illegal and dangerous way. Not only was it unprotected from fire but a fire risk in itself.' He added: 'Mr Metcalf was asked to voluntarily cooperate with the fire service to discuss the situation. 'But he threatened legal action against the fire officers delivering to them what looked like homemade writs. 'In . the course of his communication with them, he did indicate that the . people who lived there were grown adults and should know if they are . safe or not and if not they should leave. Dangerous: Shockingly, the premises had just one single pole holding up the roof, Preston Crown Court heard . Faulty electrics: Sentencing Metcalf, Judge Anthony Russell QC told him he had shown a 'callous disregard for the safety of people living in this premises for which you were responsible'. Above, the hotel's electrical supply . Homemade: Metcalf, who ran the hotel as a 'multi-occupancy' hostel, where he rented out rooms by the week, first sparked outrage when he hosted three BNP conferences at the hotel in 2006. Above, homemade fuses . 'He . took rent from people to live effectively in squalor, systematically . failing to consider fire safety and essentially making a virtue out of . the fact that they were adults and it was nothing to do with him. 'It was a place where some of the public rooms were just filled with rubbish.' Metcalf was handed a suspended jail term in 2010 after being convicted of 13 food hygiene charges relating to his kitchen. Health inspectors had found the work surfaces and equipment caked with mould and grime, while food had been stored dangerously. Fined: Metcalf, pictured with police and council officers at the Blackpool hotel, has also been fined £5,243 .

Action: Council officers inspect the hostel (left), where mattress frames were found blocking fire doors (right) The latest raid was carried out by enforcement officers from Blackpool Council and Lancashire Fire Service. Speaking outside court,  Assistant Chief Fire officer Dave Russel said: 'We are . pleased with the outcome of the case and it sends a message to landlords . across the country to taking safety seriously. 'I . am of the understanding that this is the longest custodial sentence . handed out by a court since this offence was introduced seven years ago. 'There is no doubt that in the case the breaches in fire safety could have amounted to injury or loss of life. 'Fire officers found the case involving the New Kimberley was the most serious they have ever found. It was shocking.'

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered an aircraft carrier — the USS George H.W. Bush — to move from the northern Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf as President Barack Obama considers possible military options for Iraq. Hagel's press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said in a statement the order will give the president added flexibility if military action is required to protect American lives, citizens and interests in Iraq. Prepared: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the USS George H.W. Bush to move from the northern Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf . 'American naval presence in the Arabian Gulf continues to support our longstanding commitments to the security and stability of the region', Kirby said. Accompanying the carrier will be the guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun. The ships are expected to complete their move into the Gulf later Saturday. The ships carry Tomahawk missiles, which could reach Iraq. The Bush is carrying fighter jets that could also easily get to Iraq, where a fast-moving Islamic insurgency called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is gaining territory. Obama delivered televised remarks on Iraq on Friday. 'We . will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq,' Obama said. 'But I have asked my national security team to prepare a range of other . options that could help support Iraq's security forces and I'll be . reviewing those options in the days ahead.' Missile: A Tomahawk missile, like the one seen in this file photo, are carried on the USS George H.W. Bush . Sources told the Guardian on Friday that air strikes are one choice. '[ISIL] is now across the border,' a Pentagon source told the paper. 'It is possible to take out the head, you've got to take out the heart...everything is being looked at.' 'This is not solely or even primarily a military challenge,' Obama also said in his address. 'Over the past decade, American troops have made extraordinary sacrifices to give Iraqis an opportunity to claim their own future. Unfortunately, Iraqi leaders have been unable to overcometoo often the mistrust and sectarian differences that have long been simmering there - and that's created vulnerabilities within the Iraqi government, as well as their security forces.' Obama also said that the Iraqi government will 'have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.' Elsewhere in his speech, Obama said that the US will 'be monitoring the situation in Iraq very carefully over the next several days.'","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the USS George H.W.

"New York has knocked London from its position as the world's leading global financial center after seven years, according to the Global Financial Centres Index. The rankings, compiled by London-based consultancy Z/Yen, gave London 784 points versus 786 awarded to New York. The report noted that New York's ascendance is due in large part to London's fall in the biannual rankings. Clash of the Titans: New York City has overtaken London as the top world financial center, according to the biannual Global Financial Centres Index, for the first time in seven years . The GFCI asks over 3,000 financial professionals twice a year to give their take on the world's commerce centers. On a 1,000 point scale, they anointed the following cities with the precious top 10 spots. 'This seems to be based on a number of factors including ... uncertainty over Europe, the perception that London might be becoming less welcoming to foreigners and perceived levels of market manipulation,' wrote the report's author Mark Yeandle on Z/Yen's website. 'London sees the largest fall in the top 50 centres,' said Yeandle. Yeandle also pointed to London's regulatory environment as a reason for its slip. 'Because London is less of a swashbuckling place,' he told the Financial Times, 'there’s less opportunity to make money.' According to the report, New York's two-point lead is 'statistically insignificant' on the survey's 1,000 point scale. And, besides, the lead could be a shaky one for both finance capitals as Asian centers continue to flourish. Hong Kong and Singapore took third and fourth spots respectively, the same as a year ago, the survey showed. But the gap between the 'Big Four' and the chasing pack, led by Zurich, Tokyo and Seoul, was narrowing, it said. Middle East centres, such as Qatar, . Dubai and Riyadh, which took places 26, 29 and 31 respectively, . continued to rise in the index, while 23 of the 27 European centres . declined in rank. TheCityUK, . a lobby group for British financial and professional services, said . London slipping from the top spot should be a wake-up call for Europe's . policymakers. 'London . is Europe's financial center and is hugely important to the continent's . ability to finance growth and create jobs by attracting global . investors,' said Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK. The Global Financial Centres Index is compiled from assessments completed by 3,246 financial services professionals, Z/Yen said. Hong Kong snagged the number three spot, as it did in the previous survey. The Asian financial centers as a whole have been quickly gaining on Western cities . Singapore fell just behind Hong Kong and also has benefited from fears over Europe and a generally burgeoning Asian economic climate .","The Global Financial Centres Index surveys global business leaders in order to rank the world's commerce centers .

"A distressed mother is believed to have thrown her three young children to their deaths from a high rise apartment block in Japan - before jumping herself. Shocked passers by found the four bodies lying on the footpath in a pool of blood, sparking a police investigation into what was behind the tragedy. Police in the city of Yachiyo, 20 miles east of Tokyo, named the mother as 35-year-old Kyoko Kozu and said her children were her eldest son, aged, seven, youngest son, two, and her six-year-old daughter. Kyoko Kozu jumped off a high rise apartment block in Japan after she threw her two boys, ages 7 and 2, and her six-year-old daughter from a balcony . Although all four were rushed to hospital, doctors said they were already dead on arrival. Police said that the tragedy occurred shortly before 6pm on Saturday. The mother and her children did not live in the building but resided about a mile and a half away. It is unknown what she was doing in the apartment block but police said they assumed that the mother had thrown the children from a balcony on the 14th floor before jumping herself. Their bodies were found lying on a footpath in a pool of blood in Yachiyo, 20 miles east of Tokyo, before 6pm on Saturday . They found a bag containing the mother's belongings on the 14th floor stairwell. Ms Kyoko's 32-year-old husband was at work at the time, the Japan Today website reported. Police were today questioning the husband to try to find out what might have motivated his wife to kill herself and their children. Yachiyo has a population of about 190,000. The Shin River, which runs near the city is said to have a major pollution problem, with chemicals such as phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen draining from vegetable farms along the length of the waterway.","Kyoko Kozu jumped from apartment block after she threw her two boys, ages seven and two, and her six-year-old daughter from a balcony .

"A relieved Australian couple are on the way to the World Cupil in Brazil after a travel agent blunder first sent them to El Salvador's crime ridden capital by accident. Newlyweds Orin and Melissa van Lingen ended up in San Salvador, in El Salavador, instead of Salvador in Brazil, where they planned to watch Spain and Holland play at the Arena Fonte Nova stadium on Friday June 13. 'We are just through transit now to get on another flight,' Melissa told MailOnline on Monday, three days after arriving in the wrong country. San Salvador is 6332km from Salvador and it will take the couple over 15 hours to fly between the two cities. Scroll down for video . Disaster: Newlyweds Orin and Melissa van Lingen ended up in San Salvador, in El Salavador, instead of Salvador in Brazil, this week . Long journey: The couple arrived in San Salvador, in El Salvador, 9,736 miles from home. They were meant to be in Salvador, Brazil, which is 10,527 miles from Darwin . The van Lingen's holiday of a lifetime was organised by travel agent Escape Travel, which is a secondary company of Australia's leading travel agent, Flight Centre. The pair didn't realise the wrong flights had been booked until they were on a flight to Los Angeles airport in the US. The couple, from Darwin, ended up missing Holland thrash Spain - thanks to Dutch players Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben - 5-1, on Friday. Speaking from a hotel room in San Salvador, Ms van Lingen told the Sunday Terrotorian: 'We assumed there must be connecting flights but it was not until we got into the airport and there were no other flights.' San Salvador is known for its high murder rates and gang crime. It is 9,736 miles from their home in Darwin, whereas their final destination was meant to be 10,527 miles from home. Missed game: The pair lost out on the opportunity to see Robin van Persie (in blue) score a goal for the Netherlands during the 2014 FIFA World Cup match against Spain in Salvador, Brazil . Friendly local: A member of the 18 street gang poses in the jail in Izalco, 60 km west of San Salvador, El Salvador on May 20, 2013 . Wrong destination: The couple were meant to go to Salvador in Brazil (left) and ended up in San Salvador in El Salvador (right) They originally had a hotel booked in Brazil and the couple have been promised by Escape Travel that they will be reimbursed for any money lost. The couple are hopeful they will catch the next World Cup soccer games to be played in Salvador. On Monday, Germany will play Portugal at 13:00 and Switzerland will take on France on Friday at 16:00, Brazil time. Flight Centre Travel Group spokesman Haydn Long told MailOnline: 'This was a misunderstanding on Escape Travel's part and our people are working with the customers to resolve the issue, to ensure they are as happy as possible and to ensure they can enjoy the rest of their holiday. 'In this instance, Escape Travel has provided alternative accommodation and arranged flights to Brazil to ensure their plans are back on track ahead of the next game.' He added: 'Although Escape Travel didn't book the customers' match tickets, we have also worked today to help resolve an unrelated issue that the customers were experiencing. 'In addition, we will continue to work with the customers to see if we can make amends in other ways for the initial error. 'We have apologised and hope the arrangements we are making now will lead to a positive outcome.' Salvador is the largest city on the northeast coast of Brazil. It is the capital of the Northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia. It will play host to six matches at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. A new 51,900-capacity stadium was built especially for the occasion . Salvador is known as Brazil's capital of happiness due to its countless outdoor parties.It also boasts the largest carnival in the world and almost two and a half million people call the city home.It is a much loved Brazilian destination, notable for its cuisine, music and architecture.In 2007, it was voted as having the third best beach of the World, Porto da Barra Beach, in Barra neighborhood. San Salvador is the capital city of El Salvador.Gang 'mara' violence became a problem in San Salvador after the civil war in the late 1980s.Two rival gangs, the 18th Street gang and The Mara Salvatrucha, rule the streets.In 2002 crime rates skyrocketed and the municipal government was unable to combat the rise. In 2011 the murder rate reduced to a level lower than that of Haiti, Venezuela, Mexico, Guatemala, or Honduras. There here are still over 90 murders per 100,000 residents. Murder rate is more than 10 times higher than major cities such as New York or London.","Orin and Melissa van Lingen saved up to go on the holiday of a lifetime for their honeymoon .

"A couple who killed their severely disabled son in an 'act of love' have been found dead at their home in western Sydney. Margaret and Raymond Sutton, who were placed on good behaviour bonds over the death of their 28-year-old son Matthew in 2001, were discovered at their Leonay home, near Penrith, on Saturday about 11am after concerns were raised. Aged 67 and 70 respectively, police are not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths and detectives are investigating whether the couple took their own lives at their Pleasant Place home. Margaret and Raymond Sutton, who were placed on good behaviour bonds over the death of their 28-year-old son Matthew in 2001, were discovered at their Leonay home, near Penrith, on Saturday morning . A NSW Police spokeswoman said the bodies were yet to be formally identified, and a post mortem was expected to be conducted next week. Mr and Mrs Sutton's son Matthew had been born with no eyes, mostly deaf and had severe mental disabilities with the mental age of a child aged three or four. They killed Matthew in April 2001 on the eve of an operation for an ear infection that would have likely robbed him of any remaining ability to hear, sense of taste and limited powers of speech. Matthew lived in a nearby home for the disabled at Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains and was killed while visiting his parents at their Leonay home. During the couple's 2007 hearing, Mrs Sutton told the NSW Supreme Court that Matthew loved music and the prospect of him not being able to listen to it had troubled her deeply. Mr and Mrs Sutton admitted the killing in 2005 and in 2007 a judge said the couple's decision to end Matthew's life was 'born of love for him' At a previous inquest, Mrs Sutton said hearing was Matthew's only link to the outside world and the operation would have left him with no quality of life. Matthew's tragic death and the ensuing court case divided public opinion at the time. Mr and Mrs Sutton faced up to 25 years in jail after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Matthew. The couple admitted the killing in 2005 and in 2007 they were placed on five-year good behaviour bonds, with a judge saying no further sentence could add to their suffering. Supreme Court Justice Graham Barr said at the time that the couple devoted their lives to their son's care and that their decision to end his life was 'born of love for him'. The court heard Mrs Sutton gave Matthew a sedative before her husband 'released him from this world'. Mr Sutton never revealed how he killed Matthew and an autopsy failed to establish a cause of death although toxicology reports found traces of the sedatives. Penrith Police and forensic investigators established a crime scene at the couple's Leonay home and are continuing their investigations . After the sentence was handed down, Mr and Mrs Sutton's lawyer Tony Bellanto said the couple would suffer for the rest of their lives. 'I don't think I've ever come across a case that touched the emotions as this one did,' Mr Bellanto said in 2007. 'They (the Suttons) will never be able to completely move away from what's happened. 'They are coping of course but they will be suffering for the rest of their lives.' It remains unclear how Mr and Mrs Sutton died but police confirmed no one else was involved. 'Whatever has happened we think it has happened inside the home between the two of them - but we don't know yet,' a police spokeswoman said. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths and detectives are investigating whether the couple, aged in their late 60s, took their own lives at their Pleasant Place home in Leonay . Matthew was the Sutton's second son, born after Mrs Sutton experienced five miscarriages . Out of desperation for another child, Mrs Sutton revealled during the the couple's hearing that she had a stitch in her womb to prevent miscarrying Matthew. She also told the court about her concerns after a series of violent assaults on Matthew by another disabled resident at the home in Katoomba. Despite speaking to the Department of Community Services (now Family and Community Services) about the violence. '(The department said) They would teach him self-defence over the phone,' she said, adding that Matthew did not know what a phone was. Mrs Sutton said it troubled her to think she was taking Matthew back into a 'hostile environment'. At the time Mr Bellanto told the court the public 'would understand the need for compassion and the need for mercy in a case such as this'. During the sentencing, Mrs Sutton wept as Justice Barr read from a court statement in which she asked: 'How could we subject our precious son to what was ahead? 'With all the love we had for Matti we ... we released him from any more pain and suffering.' Before the couple confessed to police in 2005, listening devices in their home recorded Mr Sutton saying: ""It's because there is no euthanasia"" Penrith Police and forensic investigators established a crime scene and are continuing their investigations.

"Jordi Akhurst, 30, has been left with more than 50 tumours around his body after doctors dismissed his concerns about a mole on his back . A teacher has been left with terminal cancer after doctors refused to remove a suspicious mole from his back for nine months. Jordi Akhurst, 30, sought medical help after spotting the worrying blemish on his skin - but was repeatedly told there was nothing wrong. Over the next six months, the spot started to bleed and crack but a dermatologist insisted it was benign. His GP finally agreed to remove the mole because of Mr Akhurst's worries and sent off samples for routine analysis. Within days the father-of-one's worst fears were confirmed when hospital staff broke the news that he had skin cancer. The cancer has since spread to his . brain, heart, adrenal glands and lymph nodes, leaving him with more than . 50 tumours around his body. Experts . say spotting the disease as early as possible is key to surviving cancer but Mr . Akhurst, dad to a five-year-old son, Luca, says experts repeatedly botched . his diagnosis. The maths teacher, from Plymouth, Devon, said: 'I started going to the doctor about a mole on my back in 2007. 'My . GP said they don't remove them anymore and I was referred to a . dermatologist at Derriford Hospital [in Plymouth] who said there was nothing wrong . with it and he would leave it and see how it went. 'Three months later all the original problems were still there. It kept bleeding and it was bleeding so often it wouldn't be long before . there was a blood mark on my shirt and I would have to change. 'This was happening every day. I wasn't too worried - it was more annoying than anything else. 'Six months later the dermatologist said it seemed unchanged and it was all fine.' Mr Akhurst wasn't happy with the diagnosis and went back to his doctor, who once more referred him to a dermatologist. Mr Akhurst shows the scar left from the removal of the original mole which doctors dismissed . He said: 'I went back to my GP after nine months because I wasn't happy and I wanted it taking off. 'She referred me to the dermatologist again and he was quite insistent he wasn't going to remove it. 'It was black, raised, cracked and bleeding - you don't have to be an expert in skin cancer to know something wasn't right. 'I wasn't panicked at all. I just thought it was a case of getting rid of it. 'My . GP ended up removing it as a favour. They're obliged to send it away . for tests and a week later I had a phone call from the hospital in a . complete state of panic. 'I went in and was put in a room with a few people who were extremely apologetic, including a specialist cancer nurse and the dermatologist, who I haven't seen since. 'At the time my son was being born so I just wanted anything that needed to happen to happen so I could get on with my life.' Nine months after his original visit to the GP, Mr Akhurst was finally admitted for surgery on his back. He . said: 'They did the first operation and they weren't happy with the . lesions and felt there was more they could have chopped out. 'I had a second and then third operation. They kept having to open up the scar and search for more and more. 'I went from being told there was nothing wrong to having this giant scar. In the following months I went for check ups but I felt they were quite brief and a bit useless.' A dermatologist at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital said there was nothing wrong with the original mole . After the three operations in 2007 to remove the infected tissue, Mr Akhurst hoped he had beaten the disease, but in January last year he noticed some new lumps. By . the time the results came back on April 15 last year it had reached his . adrenal glands, which are at the top of the kidneys and his lymph . nodes. Figures . show there are around 10,000 new cases of skin cancer every year and . it's the fastest growing cancer for 18 to 30-year-olds. One in four diagnosed with melanoma, the most serious form of the disease, do not survive beyond five years. Mr Akhurst's plight emerged after shock figures revealed that the number . of new cases in Devon and Cornwall is double . the UK average. According to a . new campaign from Public Health England (PHE) you are twice as likely . to fall prey to the disease if you live in the two counties. But the heath group is urging anyone who spots anything strange on their skin to see their GP. PHE . centre director, Professor Debra Lapthorne, said: 'The campaign message is clear, if you notice any unusual or persistent changes to your skin, you should visit your doctor.' He was diagnosed as being Stage 4 - which is terminal. Mr Akhurst was given pneumotherapy, which he said was hailed as a 'wonder drug', but didn't well respond to the treatment. The Bristol University classics graduate added: 'I was going up to the hospital every three weeks for four months and being put on a drip. 'Even though it didn't work I felt well enough to carry on with my job and my day to day life. 'They left me for two to three months to see how I was and after a scan they found the cancer had spread to my heart. 'Doctors told me it was untreatable and any treatment would leave a hole in my heart. They said the tumour was new and it had grown quickly. 'I had a specialist heart scan and it found the tumour wasn't new - it had been missed on previous scans and was actually treatable. 'Despite all this I was still well, but I became ill in February this year. I was behaving quite strangely and couldn't do simple things like use my phone. 'I found out I had 10 new brain tumours so the disease had progressed quite severely.' Mr Akhurst is now taking Zelboraf - the last of the licensed drugs he is able to take. If he doesn't respond after six months he will try to take part in clinical trials to be able to use unlicensed treatments. He said: 'It is very toxic and doesn't make you feel great. After this six months there is no more treatment. The best case scenario is that by the time I stop responding I would be put on a drug trial.' Mr Akhurst is now urging anyone who sees something unusual on their skin to see their doctor. File photo . He added: 'I would be very happy to take part in trials. They said I have between one and five years when I was diagnosed in April last year. 'I'm 30 and have a terminal illness - it's all very well if you're 70 but I was hoping for another 40 years of life ahead of me. 'I didn't realise it would spread to where it has or so aggressively and quickly. 'I was quite resentful to be honest - there's a slight injustice in it. I know people are dying of cancer all over the world but when you're 30 you think you have lots of time left. 'There's nothing I did to contribute to it. I didn't sun worship or get burnt. 'I want people to know that skin cancer exists. I had a mole and I had it removed and I really thought that was as far as it would go. 'I don't want to be an anti-sun bed person and they're not part of my story but if people could think twice about using them and use sun cream - whether it's factor five or 50 - just think about it and use some protection.'","Series of failures by medics leaves father-of-one with terminal cancer .

"A shooting victim blasted in the face by an unknown gunman walked home and woke up his wife to take him to hospital rather than dialling 911. The 44-year-old victim was standing at a bus stop on a street corner in Detroit, Michigan, when the gunman approached him and opened fire. Despite being hit in the face, he was able to walk two city blocks to his house where he got his wife to drive him to nearby St John Hospital, where he was in a critical condition. Random? Detroit police investigate a shooting at a bus stop on Harper and Morang in the city's East Side . Police have said they are 'not sure' whether the man's decision to walk home rather than call for help was prompted by slow 911 response times in the city. The victim, whose name has not been released, told police he did not know his attacker, who exchanged no words with him before opening fire. The shooting happened at 4.58am on Monday morning while the victim was waiting at a bus stop on the corner of Morang Drive and Harper Avenue in the city's East Side, said police. 'The victim was standing at the bus stop when an individual walked up and just shot him in the face,' police spokesman Adam Madera told The Detroit News.

'He wasn’t assaulted; no pockets were gone through. As of right now it appears he was just shot.' Asked by WWJ reporter Zahra Huber whether slow 911 response times might have prompted the victim to walk home rather than calling for help, Officer Madera said he 'wasn't sure.' 'I don’t know if anyone had called 911 from the scene or if he just initially took it upon himself to walk home,' he said. Officer Madera told the Detroit Free Press that investigations were at an early stage. 'Unfortunately, we don’t have a description. There’s not a whole lot that we have to go on right now,' he said.","Victim, 44, had been waiting at a bus stop when gunman opened fire .

"In an emotional confession to some of his fellow wrestlers, WWE legend Pat Patterson came out and revealed that he was gay. Patterson, 73, came out during a scene in the WWE reality series Legends' House, while seated at a table with wrestling royalty like 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan, 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper, 'Mean' Gene Okerlund and Jimmy 'Mouth of the South Hart.' The Canadian-born wrestling star said he'd kept his sexuality a secret for the last 50 years, but now says 'for the rest of my life, I want to be happy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

'From where I come from, when I had nothing, no family, no money, and I . ended up with Vince [McMahon], working in the office, to me that was the . biggest achievement of my life,' Patterson told his fellow former . wrestlers. Patterson then that his life outside of wrestling was more complicated than any of them ever knew - and it included a 'friend' of 40 years, who recently died from a heart attack. 'Sitting here tonight I'm going to say something and I would never want . to say publicly, but being here with you guys, for once in my life, I'm . going to be me now,' he continued.

"With a swimming pool, football pitch, and helipad sprawling across 16,000 square feet of land, it is hard to imagine this was once a tiny family home. The enormous estate, carved into a cliffside, started life as a two-storey cottage. But property developer Steve O'Connor and his wife Clare saw potential for a great deal more. Scroll down for video . Transformed: This sprawling estate carved into a cliff in Cheshire was once a tiny cottage. It now has a swimming pool, football pitch and a helipad . Helipad: The helipad, overlooking 10 miles of countryside, allows the couple and their two sons Stevie, nine, and Ryan, four, to get to London in an hour . Light: The family made sure to put windows wherever possible so that the underground property is filled with light and does not have damp . Despite heavy planning restrictions, the couple worked closely with an architect to transform their home into something 10 times the size - and a good deal more expensive. Now on the market for £4.75 million, it is unrecognisable. The Cheshire property, which they have called home for five years, is equipped with a huge 100-foot . open plan living space, an indoor sports hall, swimming pool, and a . football pitch in the huge garden. There are five bedrooms and ten bathrooms and the house is surrounded by a network of caves which help control the temperature. Before: This is the two-storey cottage perched on a sloping hill that Mr O'Connor transformed into a modern estate that delves underground . Work site: The couple spent years working on the land to create a home that fits their exact interests and activities . Modern: Would-be buyers will no doubt be enticed by this unusual, long swimming pool and adjacent sauna with French windows that open onto grass . Living space: Underneath the sprawling garden there is a 100ft hallway that leads onto a kitchen, dining area, and access to five bedrooms . Dining room: The family of four dine in this minimal, purple-and-white-themed room which is separated from the living room with a free-standing wall . Activity: The property will suit buyers with many interests as there is space for a grand piano alongside the football pitch and swimming pool . And thanks to the addition of a helipad, the couple and their two sons Stevie, nine, and Ryan, four, can get to London in an hour. Mr O'Connor, who owns Widnes Viking Rugby League team in Wigan, said: 'It is essentially a . modern day country house in size, but if you took out our indulgence, . the swimming pool, it would have the same energy costs as a three bed . semi.' Temperature in the . home is controlled using a unique air tower which releases hot air in . the top and lets in cold air at the bottom. Innovative: The underground home is heated by a network of caves, which has helped Steve O'Connor and his wife Clare get round planning restrictions . Open space: This living space and kitchen area, complete with a breakfast bar, is set in the space above the 100ft hall way . Cutting edge: Property developer Mr O'Connor said he has worked for years with an architect to develop the home from a shabby cottage into a modern complex . Despite the vast amount of open space, the home has the same energy costs as a three-bedroom semi-detached cottage, Mr O'Connor claims . The amount of air released can be regulated depending on the time of year to maintain a constant internal temperature. Despite the size, Mr O'Connor insists the house maintains a family feel. He added: 'People assume an underground home would be dark and damp, but this house is flooded with light.'","16,000sq ft property started life as a tiny cottage, now has a helipad, football pitch, sports hall and swimming pool .

"Marc Wroe urinated into a female colleague's water bottle during a seven-year campaign of harassment after she rejected his advances . A spurned worker urinated into a female colleague's water bottle during a seven-year campaign of harassment after she rejected his advances. Marc Wroe, 44, sent his victim soiled underwear and turned up uninvited at her home late at night during the campaign, a court heard. He is now facing jail after admitting a charge of harassment without violence at a hearing at Preston Magistrates’ Court, Lancashire. The court heard he told police it was 'in revenge' for his affections being rejected. Martine Connah, prosecuting, said: 'She thought he was trying to play a twisted, perverted game.' The victim, a mother-of-one who works at hydraulics distribution company Tom Parker Ltd, in Preston, started receiving emails from Wroe in 2007. During a catalogue of disturbing incidents, the victim received solied ladies underwear in the post, had lingerie catalogues and samples addressed to her, received Valentine's cards addressed to her partner posted to her home and was disturbed late at night while alone with her daughter when Wroe turned up unannounced. The court heard she also received 'apology' flowers and was stared at as she got into her car when leaving work. Ms Connah said: 'The emails became more and more frequent. She asked him to stop. At some point he gave her his home email address. 'She emailed him at home asking him not to send her so many messages at work. She was not interested in him, not attracted to him. 'He continued to email her at home and work. They got more and more explicit and on one occasion, he commented on an item of underwear he had seen in her bag, which was actually her little girl’s. It was unnerving.' The court heard after an incident in which Wroe turned up at her home, a colleague warned him off. But the victim felt like he was watching her every move. She eventually told her partner everything after catching him staring at her as she got into her car. Wroe is now facing jail after admitting a charge of harassment without violence at a hearing at Preston Magistrates' Court . She reported him to her boss after she received stockings at her home - labelled with his name. A boss at Tom Parker Ltd spoke to Wroe, but he said he too had been receiving things and tried to blame an ex-girlfriend. In February this year, the victim noticed a foul smell coming from her drinking water. Ms Connah said: 'She went to the director, and was shaking. She felt awful she could work with someone who hated her so much.' When it happened again, tests showed her water was contaminated and the firm set up cameras on April 26. On April 29, Wroe, of Preston, was caught contaminating the water sat on her desk. He was sacked. Greg Earnshaw, defending, said: 'It is a shameful act. He is highly embarrassed and owned up to it straight away.' The case was adjourned to July 11 to allow for a medical report after District Judge Jane Goodwin said she had 'great concern'. The victim did not wish to comment after the case.","Marc Wroe sent victim soiled underwear and turned up at her home uninvited .

"Voters should not be allowed to see MPs eating or drinking, John Bercow declared today in a row over a film crew roaming the corridors of power. The Commons Speaker said the makers of a documentary on the workings of Parliament would be barred from filming politicians ‘relaxing’ or ‘enjoying themselves’ while wining and dining in the subsidised bars, tea rooms and restaurants . The extraordinary ruling comes after complaints from MPs who fear being caught out like Labour leader Ed Miliband who was ridiculed after being photographed struggling with eating a bacon sandwich. Labour leader Ed Miliband was mocked after a PR opportunity eating a bacon sandwich backfired last month . Legendary filmmaker Michael Cockerell was granted rare permission to film inside Parliament, after previously taking cameras inside Downing Street and the great offices of state. The team have been given unprecedented access, including camera crews being allowed on to the floor of the House of Commons during PMQs. However, after today’s clashes between David Cameron and Mr Miliband, Mr Bercow was bombarded with complaints about the extent of the filming. He rejected the idea of filming politicians eating or drinking in Parliament. Last month Mr Miliband was mocked after a PR visit to New Covent Garden Market culminated in unflattering photos of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. Tory MP Heather Wheeler said: ‘There is a feeling in the chamber that where the TV cameras are going is perhaps getting too far, too fast.’ She warned of rumours that cameras would be allowed into the voting lobbies and urged Mr Bercow to block it. Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would veto any attempt to film MPs eating or drinking in Parliament . Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth also warned against allowing sensitive and ‘extremely private’ conversations being filmed. ‘In my own humble opinion it would be quite improper for those conversations to be recorded,’ he said. Mr Bercow insisted he ‘wholeheartedly’ backed the documentary, and would not intervene on every request made to film in different parts of Parliament. But he made clear he would veto an imminent request to film MPs eating or drinking inside the Palace of Westminster as ‘wholly intrusive, unfair to MPs, and unacceptable’. He told MPs: ‘If such a request to interfere with the private space of members when they are relaxing, enjoying themselves and consuming food or drink in the tea room is made, those making the request will be disappointed. ‘I do not think an Honourable Member consuming a cup of tea and beans on toast should be subject to a film crew.’ Some MPs back the idea of filming the whole of Parliament at work, to change the perception created by Prime Minister's Questions . Despite the complaints about the documentary, some MPs backed opening up the workings of Parliament to a wider audience. Tory MP James Gray said: ‘The public out there get the wrong impression from things like PMQs, and people like me strongly support the fact Michael Cockerell is getting into the voting lobby and elsewhere. He will be demonstrating to the world we do a good job here and let's see them in the voting lobbies and elsewhere.’ Mr Cockerell's documentary is the first of its kind in more than three decades. The four-part BBC series on life at Westminster called Inside The Commons is to be broadcast next year.","John Bercow vetoes request to take cameras into bars and restaurants .

"Julia Gillard has hit out at the sexism encountered by female leaders and revealed she has discussed the issue with other female heads of state, including Hilary Clinton. 'I have had the opportunity to talk to Hillary about [the challenges that women face] and I was grateful for it,' she said in a radio interview yesterday in Washington DC. The comments come just after the release of Hillary Clinton's new book, Hard Choices, in which she singled out Ms Gillard, whom Ms Clinton says suffered 'outrageous sexism which shouldn't be tolerated in any country' during her time in office. Ms Gillard is currently in the U.S. in her role as chair of the Global Partnership for Education. Scroll down for video . Julia Gillard has revealed that she discussed the struggles faced by women in office with Hillary Clinton while they were both in office . While Ms Gillard acknowledged there were some female leaders, such as Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany and Christine La Garde, head of the IMF, it was important that women share their experiences because they were still greatly outnumbered in public positions. 'One of the things about being a leader in today's world as a woman is that there aren't many others… and I think because of that, when we do get the opportunity to say: ""What's it like for you?"", even across party lines… there are some common and shared experiences,' she told the Diane Rehm radio show. Among the struggles often encountered by female leaders, said Ms Gillard, was the fact they are often judged on appearance, the struggle of often being the only woman in the room, and not being treated 'instinctively with the same sense of seriousness or the view that you will have the same gravitas as a male leader'. Female leaders at CHOGM in 2011 (from left) Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Queen Elizabeth II, Julia Gillard, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar . Julia Gillard says female leaders are still very much the minority. She is seated next to the Prime Minister of Thailand Yingluck Shinawatra and Prime Minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt (right) during the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit . She also said that there was a different approach to female and male leaders. 'I think for men, that conversation starts with: ""What kind of leader will he be? Strong? Weak? Compassionate? Strident?"" And for women it starts with: ""Can she lead?"" and it's a subtle but significant difference.' 'Yes we have talked about those things, Hillary and I, and I've had the opportunity to talk to some other leading women around the world about them.' The former Prime Minister also addressed the famous 'misogyny speech' she delivered to parliament in October 2012, saying that her initial approach to sexism she encountered as the country's first female prime minister was to brush it off, but it got to a point she saw that she needed to shine a light on the issue. 'I think for me, the sense that after everything that I as the first woman prime minster had seen happen around me about gender and to me in that position, I was not going to stand there and get lectured about sexism.' The former prime minster said female leaders suffer 'common and shared experiences' of sexism, such as being judged for their appearance and not being treated with the same respect as male leaders .","Julia Gillard reveals she discussed sexism with other female leaders .

"Since moving to England it’s fair to say Luis Suarez has experienced both the highs and the lows. While he’s adored by Liverpool fans for his impressive strike-rate, he’s become a villain to others after being suspended for racially abusing a player and biting an opponent. Yet there’s one person who has stood by him through thick and thin – his wife Sofia Balbi.

Scroll down for video . While still dressed in his national kit after breaking the hearts of England fans with his two goals in Brazil, Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, 25, gave an emotional thank you to his partner and mother of his two children . While his career has been littered with controversy, Suarez's wife Sofia Balbi has stood by him throughout thick and thin. The pair, who are childhood sweethearts, have two children together - Delfina and Benjamin . Amidst the celebrations of Uruguay’s 2-1 win, Suarez took a moment in the changing rooms to record the personal video message. He told the camera: ‘Hello everyone. I’m very happy because it’s incredible that we have won this match. ‘I want to thank my wife, my two kids – who are the most beautiful things I have in this world - and Walter Ferreira as without him I wouldn’t be here. ‘Sorry about the emotion but I dreamed of this unique moment and giving happiness to all Uruguay. ‘Go Uruguay, and let's prepare for the next match which is Italy.’ As well as thanking his family, he also gave a nod to physio Walter Ferreira who helped him recover for the World Cup following knee surgery last month. The video message came after an emotional Suarez celebrated scoring both goals for his country as Uruguay took on Roy Hodgson's men in Sao Paulo, Brazil last night . The video message came after an emotional Suarez celebrated scoring both goals for his country as Uruguay took on Roy Hodgson’s men in Sao Paulo, Brazil last night. His goals drove a dagger further into the hearts of England supporters – some of whom are still reeling from the controversial incidents Suarez has been embroiled in since moving to England. He was banned for eight games and fined £40,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in a game in October 2011. And, he was banned for a further ten games after biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanović during a Premier League match in April 2013. Luis Suarez met Sofia Balbi when he was just 15 and the pair married in 2009. They have since had two children together (above) and she has fiercely supported him throughout his career despite the controversy . He was charged with violent conduct by the FA and fined an undisclosed sum by his club before being handed the ban. However, it’s his wife Sofia who has stood by him throughout the controversy – his childhood sweetheart who he met when he was just 15. The pair married in 2009 and she gave birth to their first child Delfina - an anagram of Anfield – a year later. Last September, she gave birth to their second child, a baby boy called Benjamin.","Luis Suarez thanked wife Sofia Balbi and two children Delfina and Benjamin .

"First she was told she had breast cancer. Then doctors explained that the treatment she needed to save her life might rob her of the chance of having children. For Natasha Eaton, 32 at the time of the diagnosis and desperate to be a mother, the news was devastating. 'I basically went outside into the street and I just screamed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was just like all of a sudden, having children wasn't an option for me. It was a very traumatic day.' Natasha Eaton, 38, was told she might not ever be able to have children when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 . Ms Eaton, from Newcastle, New South Wales, had been prescribed weeks of chemotherapy. While the treatment destroys cancer cells it can also lead to infertility and early menopause in young women. But she was determined to do anything she could to increase her chances of having children and resorted to an egg retrieval procedure at an clinic in Sydney. IVF treatment, however, was not necessary. Only six months after finishing chemotherapy, Ms Eaton was ecstatic to find she was naturally pregnant with a healthy baby boy. Now mother to four-year-old Jack, she was one of the 256 young women with breast cancer around the world who participated in the Prevention of Early Menopause Study. The study saw half the participants receive a dose of the drug goserelin alongside their standard chemotherapy treatment, while the other half received their cancer treatment without. 'I had to have my chemotherapy every three weeks for six rounds. I got to the fourth week and I'd already had enough,' Ms Eaton explained. Now a mother to four-year-old Jack (pictured), Ms Eaton has the Prevention of Early Menopause Study to thank for her sons miracle birth . Ms Eaton required chemotherapy after removing the lump on her breast through surgery. Chemotherapy not only destroys cancer cells in the body, but also often leads to early menopause in women . 'And then once a month I had the [goserelin] injections. It was just a like a pellet that went into my tummy and put my ovaries to sleep.' The goserelin injections were administered in an attempt to stop the women's ovaries from producing eggs while they received chemotherapy, according to Professor Fran Boyle, chair of the Breast Cancer Trails Group. 'What started the study was the idea that if you can switch your ovaries off and put them into resting stage, in theory that should make them less susceptible to chemotherapy,' professor Boyle said. 'There are drugs that already do that, but they are used for other purposes. So this study just re-purposed a drug used for another reason to see if that ovary resting would help preserve fertility and prevent early menopause.' Astonishingly, the study proved successful, with only 8 per cent of the women who received the goserelin injections experiencing menopause two years after their cancer treatment. This was compared to the 22 per cent of women who went through early menopause after receiving standard cancer treatment with no injections. The goserelin recipients were also twice as likely to have normal pregnancies after their cancer treatment, a reality that still astonishes Ms Eaton. Newborn Jack: The drug trial involved 256 women around the world receiving a monthly injection of goserelin alongside their chemotherapy, which reduced estrogen production, and 'switching off' their ovaries . Success: Only 8 per cent of the women who received the goserelin injections experiencing menopause two years after their cancer treatment, compared to the 22 per cent of women who didn't receive the injections . 'There was never any trying at all,' she said of her natural conception. 'I finished in June with the chemo part, but I still had to have radiation therapy. When I had an ultrasound in September, we saw that my ovaries were still shriveled up and asleep and I was panicking. 'Fran said it was alright and we'll just see how we go, but I jokingly asked her ""can I have a baby now?"" and she just said ""no, no, not yet."" 'The next time I saw her, I was pregnant.' Ms Eaton fell pregnant in December, only six months after finishing her treatment. In February, she found herself experiencing morning sickness, but thought nothing of it until daring to take a home pregnancy test. 'It was a scary time. The thought went through my mind: ""am I going to have to terminate him?""  I wasn't even sure if I was allowed to have him or if there would be something wrong with him – it was a scary lot of mixed emotions,' she said. After the initial shock and perfect amniocentesis results, she was over the moon –  now Ms Eaton can't imagine her life without four-year-old Jack. 'He’s an old soul – he's definitely been here before,' she said. 'He's way above his years and he's quite a character.' Professor Fran Boyle, who ran the trial, said the results showed that goserelin injections could also lead to similar positive results in women with other cancers . Ms Eaton has since had her ovaries removed as a preventative measure and will likely have a double mastectomy, but the proud mother can't imagine her life without her new son . Ms Eaton's battle with cancer is not over, however. After removing her ovaries in a bid to avoid her high risk of developing ovarian cancer, the proud mother is now looking towards a double mastectomy for similar reasons. But with her chemotherapy days behind her, and her happy little boy helping her get through it, Ms Eaton said she finally has room to breathe. Despite the study only being administered in breast cancer patients, Professor Boyle said the results showed that goserelin injections could also lead to similar positive results with other cancers. 'This is a drug that can be accessed in Australia today, so it can be done,' she said. 'It's not covered by the PBS for this purpose though, so people need to buy it, but what we hope is that the company that makes it will now apply to have it funded for this purpose. 'The benefit of this study is that it will also be able to be used in other kinds of cancer for similar benefits as well, including lymphoma.' 'One of the other important things, is that although it was run in a large number of countries in the world, it was actually an idea initiated in Australia. By collaborating with researchers in other countries we were able to have found enough young women in this situation – we couldn't have done it just in Australia.'","The drug goserelin was found to successfully reverse early menopause in women receiving chemotherapy .

"Labour has committed to £850million in new free schools after the next election, despite opposing Michael Gove’s flagship policy. Ed Miliband’s party has promised that any free schools which are open or ‘in the pipeline’ after May 2015 will still go ahead. It left the party open to charges of hypocrisy after repeatedly warning the policy of allowing parents and other groups to open new schools would end in ‘chaos’. Education Secretary Michael Gove today announced another 38 new free schools, as it emerged Labour would not cancel planned schools if they win in 2015 . Senior Labour figures have repeatedly criticised the free schools programme, calling for it to be halted. Mr Miliband has claimed they are the ‘opposite of the thing we need’ while Ed Balls said it was part of ‘the most socially divisive education experiment for 60 years’. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said they ‘a vanity project for yummy mummies’ and ‘a dangerous ideological experiment’. However, according to a report in Building magazine, Labour will not cancel free schools planned to open after the next election. It amounts to a commitment worth more than £850m in construction work, it was reported. A Labour spokesman said: ‘Free schools that are open - or in the pipeline - will remain.’ Labour's shadow education Tristram Hunt has dismissed the free schools programme as ‘a dangerous ideological experiment’ The admission has been welcomed by building firms who feared work would be lost if the plug was pulled by an incoming government. Mr Gove today approved 38 new free schools, providing 22,000 extra places, taking the total number of open and approved free schools to 331. However, all but three of the 38 schools intend to open their doors in September next year, after the general election. A Tory source said: 'Labour’s hypocrisy on free schools knows no bounds. They denigrate free schools at every opportunity – until they want the votes of parents hoping for a free school in their area. 'Only Labour could commit almost a billion pounds to a policy they say will cause ‘chaos’. It makes you wonder how much they’d spend on policies they actually support. 'We know whose side we’re on – parents desperate for a better education for their children. That’s what free schools are all about. ‘Labour should hold their hands up, admit they got it wrong and wholeheartedly back free schools.' The government insists that the vast majority of the new schools are in areas most in need of more school places,. Mr Gove said: ‘Free schools are giving thousands of children from ordinary backgrounds the kind of education previously reserved for the rich and the lucky. ‘Thanks to our free school programme, many more parents now have a new school in their neighbourhood offering high standards and tough discipline. Free schools put teachers – not bureaucrats and politicians – in the driving seat, as they are the ones who know their pupils best.’ A Labour party spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We set out in June last year that we would not continue with the free school programme if we win the next general election. ‘We said then that existing free schools would remain, as would those in the pipeline. We are undertaking a zero-based spending review of the DfE.’","Michael Gove's flagship policy has been repeatedly condemned by Labour .

Bob Toppin, defending, urged the court to impose a suspended . sentence for the ‘very unsophisticated burglary’. He said the knife was in Pyke’s pocket because he had been . cutting cooked chicken to eat earlier in the evening. He said: ‘He made no attempt to brandish the knife, nobody . was threatened and he had no intention of using it.’ Pyke was sentenced to a total of 18 weeks in a young . offenders’ institution for the burglary, possessing the knife and non-payment . of previous court fines.

"Two drunk teenagers have been filmed attacking staff in a McDonalds with foam tubes. A 90-second clip, which has clocked up more than 12,000 views on Facebook, shows Ben Hall and Joel Melia hitting two female employees before being chased out of the fast food restaurant. The video, which was recorded by one of their friends has gone viral, being shared by 8,000 people, and prompting over 3,000 comments. But the unrepentant teens from Burnley in Lancashire have refused to apologise for their behaviour despite police confirming they were investigating reports of an assault. Scroll down for video .

The prankster then approaches one female employee - jabbing her with one of the foam tubes . Immediately after the video was posted . the pair were the first to comment both adding several laughing smiley . faces and the words 'Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha'. Ben . Hall, an apprentice electrician, said the trio had visited the Burnley . branch of McDonalds last weekend at 7am after spending all night on a . drinking binge. He admitted to being drunk in the video but claimed the member of staff ‘over-reacted’ when she was hit. The . 18-year-old said: 'We had more than a few. On the way up to McDonald’s . we found some scaffolding safety foam and thought it'd be funny to have a . fight with them and it just carried on in McDonald’s. 'We thought we'd involve the staff but I don't think they were too impressed.' The . video shows Mr Hall and Mr Melia, a promising young footballer, enter . the store brandishing the foam, first accosting a customer who is . leaving the restaurant. He is heard to tell them to: 'Turn round and go and get yourselves some McMuffins.' The . lads then wrestle with each other on the floor and a voice off camera . can be heard saying: 'These McDonald’s staff are mugging you off.' They . then turn their attention to the staff and attempt to go behind the . counter but are stopped by two female employees. One woman is hit on the . head by Mr Melia, and is then struck again between her legs. She tells them: 'Don’t be hitting me with that again. Get out,' before ordering them to stop filming without permission. The two continue to brandish their foam tubes while the employee shouts at them . Eventually, the woman manages to chase the pranksters out of the restaurant - with them running away . She then chases them out onto the street and is clearly heard shouting: 'Leave the fu**ing store now.' The . unnamed staff member continues to remonstrate with the teenagers . outside while they carry on hitting her with the foam.  Another . employee  is heard calling the police before the clip ends . Asked . if he wished to apologise, Mr Hall said: 'Not even a tiny bit. It was . harmless fun and nobody got hurt so I don't think I should feel bad.' He added: 'She threatened us back so we’re equal.' Mr . Melia, who is a footballer with North West Counties Football League . Premier Division side Barnoldswick Town, and an apprentice bricklayer . described the episode as ‘a piece of fun’. The . 19 year old said: 'I won’t apologise. We were just messing about. I . think she over-reacted if anything. There was no need for her to get on . like she did. 'The police spoke to us outside and just sent us on our way.' The . reaction to the pair’s antics have had a mixed reaction online.  Sheri . Gorman posted: 'Talk about immature, you want to grow up!' The woman even chases the pair - still holding on to the cylinders - out of the restaurant and down the street . And . Peter Thomas added: 'If our police force is any good these two idiots . will be arrested for threatening behaviour. Assault. And public order. Ellisa . Marshall said: 'So immature the girl is only trying to earn some money . don't deserve that abuse. Then again she could have just laughed it off' Other Facebook users found the incident harmless and said the language used by the staff member wasn’t acceptable . Brian Berg wrote: 'Calm down, they are just having fun, not hurting anyone.' Simmone . Youngson posted:  'Language from the staff is terrible,' and Christine . Brown  said: 'Really badly handled by the staff. They weren't doing . that much harm why the over reaction ??' Burnley business leader Brian Hobbs said the prank, which targeted staff as they worked, was ‘abhorrent’. Mr . Hobbs, president of Burnley Chamber of Trade, said: 'It’s ludicrous. I . find it absolutely abhorrent that people think this is ok. 'Unfortunately, what seems like a bit of a laugh with alcohol on board isn’t nice for those on the receiving end. Ben Hall, left, and Joel Melia, right, admitted being drunk in the video - but said the member of staff 'over-reacted' when they hit her. Police confirmed they were investigating the assault . 'Clearly . it’s the alcohol that is the problem in this case. Even if it was . intended as a bit of fun, it can be extremely intimidating for the . staff. 'I absolutely condemn this behaviour. I would question why these drunken idiots even need to be out at 7am.' Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle said: 'It might be fun for them but it certainly isn’t for the people on the receiving end. 'You . expect people to treat the staff with the respect they deserve. If the . staff had reacted, they would have got the sack so why do these lads . think this is acceptable? 'They are purely doing their job. Nobody goes to work to be attacked.' Coun . Shah Hussain, for the Daneshouse with Stoneyholme ward where the . incident happened, said: 'I wouldn’t tolerate that either if I was a . member of staff and it happened to me. I would feel aggrieved and people . shouldn’t have to put up with it at work. 'Filming . this sort of thing and putting it on Facebook seems to be some sort of . craze at the moment and it isn’t good.

"Leopards are considered one of the deadliest predators in India thanks to their amazing ability to blend into the background before launching a surprise attack on its victims. These images show the true extent of their camouflage, almost disappearing into the surrounding nature in a leopard camp in India. Big cat conservationist Adam Bannister spent several months documenting the lives of 21 leopards for a a research project at the Sujan Jawai Leopard Camp in Rajasthan, and found that they often move very close to human settlements due to their ability to hide in plain sight. Can you see it:  A leopard spotted in the Sujan Jawai Leopard Camp, Rajasthan, India managed to nearly completely disappear into its surroundings . Found it!: The leopard from the top picture has been circled - hiding at the foot of a rock among the dry grass . He said: ‘Leopards are responsible for . numerous deaths in India, so when I heard about a village where people . and leopards lived such in close quarters without incident, I had to see . it for myself. ‘I have . worked with the big cats in three continents, and experienced . human-wildlife conflict first-hand and this area is truly unique in . terms of how humans and leopards co-exist. ‘They see them more in a spiritual context. And there are still many more leopards out there - I'm sure of it.’ An easier one: The white markings on the tail of this leopard makes it less of a hassle to spot . Another tough one: The big cats are ambush hunters and rely on their patterns to be able to blend into the background and surprise their prey . Tiny cat: The leopard in this picture is easier to locate as it is silhouetted against the grey sky . Double trouble: Not one, but two leopards can bee seen roaming on the rocks in this photograph from Rajasthan, India .

"They say elephants never forget but it seems to have slipped this one’s mind what species she is. She prefers to hang out with the buffalo. Nzou, 46, has lived on the Imire Black Rhino and Wildlife Conservation area in Zimbabwe since her parents were killed in the 1970s. Norman Travers, Imire’s founder, originally put Nzou with a bull elephant within the only large herd animal which Imire had at the time – the buffalo. Buffalo solider: Nzou towers over the buffalo but she is their matraicrh . When the bull died, Nzou had become acclimatised to living with the buffalo and had even taken on some of the characteristics of the buffalo and lost some of her elephantine qualities. Imire owner Judy Travers said: ‘Nzou is the matriarch of the entire farm but she chooses to spend her time with the buffalo. ‘We have tried to reintroduce her to the elephant herd on the farm but she's really happy where she is.’ I'm in charge - Nzou and her buffalo herd. She protects them, looks after them but woebetide any young make who steps out of line . Nzou and her buffalo herd have their own way of communicating - they understand her rumbles and she, in turn, can understand their sounds . Nzou is happy with her unusual herd and, as long as they accept she is their leader, she is content to be their matriarch . After several attempts to encourage her to become part of the elephant herd, Norman decided that her rightful place should be back with the buffalo. And there she has remained ever since. ‘When newborns drop she is part of the herd that moves back to the mum and calf after they've had a chance to build a relationship,’ says Judy. Nzou has never lost her elephant’s instinct for loyalty. Matthew, her handler for many years, was one day charged by one of the young male buffalo and badly gored. Nzou has been with the buffalo so long she has forgotten how to speak to other elephants . Terribly hurt and losing blood, he crawled to the fence, accompanied every step of the way by Nzou, guarding him against further attacks by the buffalo. Once at the fence line, she stood in front of him, a massive protective shield, until help arrived from another part of Imire. Nzou and her buffalo herd have their own way of communicating - they understand her rumbles and she in turn can understand their sounds. Nzou does not respond to the other elephants on Imire - perhaps she no longer understands what they are saying. She is happy with her unusual herd and, as long as they accept she is their leader, she is content to be their matriarch.

"A Sydney man told of how he heard an 'almighty bang' and saw a Range Rover 'still moving and sliding' across the road and passersby scrambling to help Jodhi Meares on Saturday night after she overturned her car. Craig Russell, who lives on O'Sullivan Road, said James Packer's ex-wife and fashion designer Jodhi Meares, 43, ended up trapped in her car which had flipped onto the driver's side after an accident at 9.45pm on Saturday night. At about 5.20pm on Monday, Rose Bay police arrived at Ms Meares' Point Piper apartment to make 'further enquiries' regarding last Saturday night's crash. The police buzzed Ms Meares' apartment twice before being allowed into the building after one police officer said: 'I have got some paperwork to drop off.' Scroll down for video . The huge collision at 9.30pm on Saturday left the beautiful brunette trapped in her bronze Range Rover on O'Sullivan Road, Bondi, in eastern Sydney . Police arrive at Ms Meares' premises at Wolseley Road Point Piper on Monday night .

Ms Mears' mother, Denise Macpherson, leaving her daughter's place in Potts Point on Monday night . The two officers emerged after spending around five minutes inside the apartment and then emerged. Meanwhile, another witness, David Berger, has come forward saying the car Ms Meares wrote off belongs to a staffer on duty at the Jimmy Brings and Suppertine alcohol and food delivery business, outside where the crash occurred. He said Ms Meares was a client of the food delivery but not the alcohol service. Mr Russell told MailOnline he heard an 'almighty bang' at and looked out his window to see a Range Rover 'still moving and sliding across the road with the driver in it, its lights on and flipped two feet off the ground onto the right hand driver's side'. He said he watched the car slide across the road with Ms Meares still behind the wheel until it was pointing back in the direction from which it came. The impact of the crash was so great it took off one of the Range Rover's wheels, he said. Denise Macpherson leaving her daughter Jodhi Mears' place on Monday night, who said was to be 'very badly shaken' after the accident on Saturday night . Another witness,  David Berger said the car Ms Meares wrote off belongs to a staffer on duty at the Jimmy Brings and Suppertine alcohol and food delivery business, outside where the crash occurred . While Mr Berger added that the female car owner would be making an insurance claim. 'It was written off,' Mr Berger told MailOnline,'It was a Ford Focus. It was parked out the front.' When a passersby realised she was still trapped in the car, they tried to help Ms Meares out through the boot, and then when that did not work, tried to free her through the passenger door. Ms Meares emerged 'very badly shaken', Mr Russell said, and she sat on the side of the road as police and then an ambulance arrived. He said he believed the driver had been coming up Old South Head road and had turned right into O'Sullivan Road when it hit the first parked car, pushing it up onto the footpath, then hit the second car which jack knifed and shunted into the third car. Mr Russell told MailOnline the driver was wearing a sweater, black tights and sandals and did not look as if she was dressed up for going out. 'I didn't recognise her,' he said. 'I didn't have a clue who she was, just a very badly shaken driver. Lucky she wasn't hurt.' Mr Russell said the impact of the crash was so great it took off one of the Range Rover's wheels from Ms Meares' car in the accident . There were no other passengers in Ms Meare's car at the time of the accident, she is still in the car at the time this picture was taken . Neighbours, Michael and Jane, told MailOnline they saw Ms Meares lying on the grass verge of the footpath after the accident . A witness said he believed Ms Meares was travelling south on Old South Head Rd when she turned into O'Sullivan Rd and crashed into three parked cars . Suspended: The 43-year-old smashed into three cars while drink driving four times over the limit on Saturday night . Neighbours Michael and Jane told MailOnline they saw Ms Meares lying on the grass verge of the footpath after the accident. 'Then she got up.. and the police [allegedly] said, ""No you can't go, you're under arrest"",' Michael said. When police arrived at the scene they found a car overturned on its side and three other parked cars damaged. Police would not confirm the woman's identity but released a statement confirming that a 43-year-old female was arrested at the scene of the accident and recorded a high-range blood-alcohol level - more than three times the legal limit. There were no passengers in her car or in the three parked cars that she hit before her car rolled. The woman was not injured but her car, along with two others, needed to be towed from the scene. Ms Meares' Range Rover has been impounded at a police towing yard in inner-western Sydney. Police said a roadside breath test returned a reading of 0.181, which is three times over the limit. The woman was charged with drink-driving and driving with a suspended licence. She will face Waverley Local Court on August 5. The maximum penalty for high-range drink driving is a $3,300 fine and an 18-month jail sentence. An aide for Jon Stevens, Ms Meare's fiance, told Channel Nine this morning: 'She made a mistake, she made an error of judgment. There's no more comment.' Jon Stevens arrives at fiancee Jodhi Meares's apartment this afternoon in Point Piper . Craig Russell who witnessed the car accident posed next to a bin that is believed to contain the wreckage of Ms Meare's car .

High profile: Jodhi's A-list status made her a regular on the social scene, often attending exclusive events . Ms Meares has been laying low since the incident on Saturday, but on Monday she took the time to share a cryptic message with her Twitter followers. 'His very first Instagram: Baby makes his appearance early, because he couldn't wait to meet...' she wrote. The tweet ends with a link to an Instagram photo, but the image has since been removed leaving what was on the other side as a mystery. This cryptic message shared on Twitter which doesn't link to any image, is Ms Meares' first post on social media since the alleged accident . In 1999 Jodhi married James Packer, the son of Australian media mogul Kerry Packer. The marriage lasted three years, until 2002, before ending in divorce. Now splitting her time between New York, Hawaii and Sydney, the former model is a yoga devotee. She is engaged to the former Noiseworks frontman Jon Stevens after he proposed to her in Hawaii in July 2013. He now performs with new band Dead Daisies while Jodhi, who sold her Tigerlily swimwear label to Billabong in 2007, now runs a yoga workout wear business. Born and raised on NSW'S Sapphire Coast before moving to Sydney and becoming interested in a  modelling career at age 14, the brunette found fame as a Moove milk model at 16. She went on to host Australia's Next Top Model but famously failed to show at the season finale in 2008 after being paralysed by severe stage fright.

"Police are draining three fishing lakes in their search for the weapon which was used to brutally murder a Saudi student. Detectives are still on the hunt for Nahid Almanea's killer five days after the 31-year-old was stabbed 16 times and left to die as she walked along a quiet footpath in Colchester, Essex. The crime bore similarities to another fatal stabbing in a Colchester park, leading to fears police could be up against a serial killer. Today officers said they want to speak to a man who was wearing a distinctive beige Italian-style designer jacket near the crime scene on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Hunt: Police are draining three fishing lakes near where Saudi student Nahid Almanea was stabbed 16 times and left for dead in Colchester, Essex. It is the second brutal knife attack in public in the town in three months . Painstaking: The first lake was drained yesterday and the other two will be drained in days to come . Intensive search: Police are urging residents to look for any discarded knives or bloodstained clothing . DCI Steve Worron (pictured) said he wants to speak to a man wearing a designer jacket similar to this one . They released a photo of a similar jacket as officers led an 'intensive' fingertip search around three fishing lakes near the footpath where the student was killed. Essex Police DCI Steve Worron said: 'We have received information from . witnesses about a man who was seen on the Salary Brook Trail between . 10.20am and 10.40am, shortly before Nahid was found. 'He . was walking from the direction of the university towards the Greenstead . estate. He has not yet come forward and we urgently need to speak with . him. 'He is described as . being aged in his late teens to 30. He had very black, thick hair which . was quite short and a two to three inch mop style on top. He was clean . shaven, of average build, tanned appearance and was not wearing glasses. 'He was wearing baggy trousers, which may have been lightweight cotton. 'He . was also wearing a very distinctive jacket which is described as being . an Italian designer item, it was slightly longer than waist-length, had . brown buttons up the front and two pockets also with buttons. Police released footage believed to be Ms Almanea walking past shops in Hunwicke not long before her death . Police previously released descriptions of other men they wished to speak to over the 31-year-old's murder . 'It was beige in colour, and had a belt which may or may not have had a buckle. 'We . have issued a picture of a very similar jacket which we would ask . people to look at – although the material could either be suede as in . the picture or leather.' Earlier this week police released the haunting last known CCTV images of the victim, who was studying English language at . Essex University. She was wearing a full-length Muslim robe called an abaya and a . hijab headscarf when she was attacked. Police said they were looking into possibility she was targeted because of her headscarf, though later were keen to stress that there was no firm evidence to suggest she was. Today officers drained the first of three fishing lakes near the murder scene. DCI Worron said: 'One of the three fishing lakes close . to the scene has been drained and specialist officers are now searching . at that location for any items of significance to the police enquiry. Forensics: Police near the murder scene today. Officers have told Colchester residents to be vigilant . Quiet: The footpath is on the outskirts of Colchester near the University of Essex . Police have used sniffer dogs in their search for the killer and have received several calls from the public . 'The other two lakes will also be drained and searched. 'We . are continuing to urge residents in Colchester to check their gardens, . hedges, rubbish bins, and communal areas around flats for any trace of . any discarded weapons or blood stained clothing or footwear.' Similarities: James Attfield was killed in March . He said police, who are yet to find the murder weapon, are 'open-minded' about links between the student's death and that of James Attfield. Mr Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in Colchester in March. 'Our advice to people is that we have . now had two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months where . the motive for the attacks remains unknown,' said DCI Worron. 'Against that background we . would advise everyone in the town to remain vigilant. 'Both of these attacks were on lone people who were in locations where it appears no one else was nearby at the time. 'For . that reason we would remind people to take sensible precautions to stay . safe. This includes avoiding any situations in which you could find . yourself isolated and alone in a public area.' DCI Worron said police had received a large number of calls about yesterday's appeals, especially about a man who was seen running away from the footpath at 10.56am on Tuesday. 'Those calls are being followed up and we are conducting further house to house enquiries around that individual today,' he said. However, he added there were still more people using the footpath on the morning of the murder who had not got in touch. Police arrested and questioned two people this week over the murder - a 52-year-old man followed by a 19-year-old man - but eliminated both from their enquiries. Witnesses should call Essex Police on 01245 282103. 'Our advice to people is that we have now had two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months where the motive for the attacks remains unknown,' said DCI Worron.

"A Hollywood skin specialist to the stars accused of plotting to kill her main competitor in a 'murder-for-hire' scheme is now accused of trying to hire neo-nazis to take the man out. A Los Angeles Police detective testified Monday in court that Dawn DaLuise, 55, tried to hire a white supremacist group to kill rival esthetician Gabriel Suarez because he is a 'double minority.' Suarez, a gay Latino, told KTLA outside the courtroom that 'it's just really scary... the hate this person could have. Scroll down for video . Smile for the camera!: Dawn DaLuise cracks a grin while sitting during a Monday court hearing . The victim: Gabriel Suarez told reporters outside court the though of someone wanting him dead is 'really scary' DaLuise smiled as she walked into the courtroom wearing a blue jail jumpsuit. The hearing was to determine if she would face a trial on one count of solicitation of murder. The half-day hearing featured testimony from a number of people, including an LAPD detective who caught on to her scheme and averted possible tragedy. 'In one instance … she asked him if he could get her in contact with a white supremacist group, and the phrase from that point was, in essence, to find somebody to take out a ‘double minority Mexican gay,’ said the officer. The troubled woman also tried to make it appear as if Suarez was stalking her online, jurors were told. The problems started . when Suarez opened an office in the same Santa Monica building as . her salon, Skin Refinery. Previous reports suggested DaLuise, who has counted Jennifer Aniston, Sarah . Michelle Gellar and Christian Slater among clients, made Craigslist postings inviting men to turn up unannounced at the home of Gabriel Suarez for 'trysts', according to a series of text messages seen by RadarOnline. Dawn DaLuise, (left in her mugshot) a skincare specialist to the stars, . allegedly posted fake gay sex ads about her competitor GabrielSuarez (right), it was previously revealed . It was previously reported that DaLuise hired a former Detroit Lions player Chris Geile as a hit man to kill the competitor. He has not been arrested or charged and denies involvement. The explosive allegations revealed that DaLuise texted a friend: 'I’m putting a posting up abt (sic) him . wanting sex on CL [Craigslist] this week (only well hung black men need . apply!).' Edward Feinsteini, 28, has been arrested for alleged cyber-stalking . In another she allegedly wrote: 'I am putting together a CL (Craigslist) ad to run soon directing guys to Gabriel’s front door. No need to call . first! Just show up; I’ll be waiting in bed with an (sic) blindfold on!' DeLuise allegedly told the friend that in the ad, she encouraged men to barge into Suarez's home and claimed that he would be waiting in bed wearing a blindfold. DaLuise also reportedly told her friend that she intended to go to Starbucks to set up the Craigslist ads so that her IP address could not be traced. According to the Radar report, she also suggested stalking Suarez's sister. In a bizarre twist, the friend to whom DaLuise sent the text messages, Edward Feinstein, 28, has been arrested for stalking her. Feinstein allegedly made flyers with a sexually explicit photo of DaLuise's face, home address, phone number and distributed them publicly. He is also accused of making his own fake Craigslist ads pretending that DaLuise wanted men to help her act out a 'rape fantasy', according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff. Feinstein was released on bond and is due to appear in court on May 14. DaLuise believed that the person who made the ads about her was Suarez - and the threat to her and her daughters' safety was her motivation for the murder-for-hire plot, she has claimed. Well-connected: DaLuise is pictured with actor Gary Busey in Beverly Hills in November 2010 . Fans: DaLuis counts Kyra Sedgwick, left, and Bridget Moynahan, right, among her skin-care clients . A representative for DaLuise previously told MailOnline they did not have a comment. According to her website, DaLuise moved to California to become a model in the 1980s. Driven . by her own sun-damaged skin, she enrolled in beauty school in the 1990s . and treats clients with electrical muscule stimulation, rather than . 'steams and creams'. Her . Electrical Muscle Stimulation facials cost $125 a session and claim to . help dru skin, wrinkles or damage from chemical peels. A 40-minute . facial costs $80, while wax treatments cost up to $90. DaLuise also includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Alicia Silverstone, Alyson Hannigan, Christina Ricci, Kyra Sedwick and Bridget Moynahan among her clients.

"The past nineteen years have been difficult for Karta the Sumatran orang-utan - she's had a stillbirth and seen four of her infants die. But Adelaide Zoo staff are hoping this time her baby joy will not be marred with tragedy. On Tuesday, the zoo's senior primate keeper Jodie Ellen announced Karta was expecting, with the baby due in late November. Karta the Sumatran orang-utan is expecting her sixth child in late November . After the death of her fourth baby in 2011, zookeepers found out Karta had trouble breastfeeding because of an anatomical issue. 'The little one passed away four days (after its birth) and when we performed a post-mortem, we found it had passed away from an infection, but we also discovered there was no milk in its stomach,' zoo spokeswoman Alison Hassel said. 'That led to the eventual discovery that she had issues breastfeeding and why infants have not survived because they were not getting food.' Steps have now been taken to ensure supplementary milk is deliver to new babies, and staff are hopeful her latest bub will have a better chance of surviving. 'We're extremely pleased Karta is pregnant and has the opportunity to become a mum again, something we believe she greatly deserves,' Ms Ellen said. 'Nothing is being taken for granted and we are hoping this time around Mother Nature will give us a chance to put our supplementary feeding program into practice and give her every chance of a successful outcome. She has had one stillborn baby and seen four of her infants die in the past nineteen years . Karta is 31 years old and has been living at Adelaide Zoo since 1992 after coming from San Diego Zoo . 'At this point we believe Karta is physically, mentally and emotionally ready to try again and we ask the community for support and understanding as we head into the next part of this journey.' An infant was stillborn in January last year, while four other babies died soon after birth since 1995. Ms Ellen said Karta's difficulty with breastfeeding her infants may have contributed to her inability to raise them in the past. 'Since then we've put the same training into place in the hopes that we will also be able to supplement feed future offspring and give Karta the opportunity to become a successful mother,' she said. It was found in 2011 that Karta had an anatomical issue that prevented her from breastfeeding properly and now zookeepers are introducing her to a new program to supplement her breastfeeding (left) The technique used at Adelaide Zoo is modelled on another at Denver Zoo, where a Sumatran orangutan was having similar issues. Later it was discovered the orangutan at Denver Zoo was Karta's sister, with staff hypothesising the breast feeding difficulty was genetic. Ms Hassel said the technique involved a fake nipple being attached to a garden hose with a syringe on the other end where supplementary milk can be passed through so the baby is able to be held in its mother's arms while eating. Karta, 31, has been at the zoo since 1992, while Kluet - the expected baby's father - turns 19 next month and arrived at the zoo in 2007. The most recent estimates indicate there are as few as 6,300 wild Sumatran Orangutans left. It's estimated 50 are lost a week, due to the destruction of their natural habitat primarily because of the clearing of land for logging and palm oil plantations.","Adelaide Zoo staff announced the new arrival is expected in late November .

"The body of a high school teacher who disappeared during a cyclone more than three years ago has been found in scrubland in Western Australia. Tracy Margaret Marshall, 35, vanished in the town of Karratha, in the Pilbara region 1500km north of Perth during severe tropical cyclone Carlos on February 21, 2011. Ms Marshall's car, which had overheated and broken down  east of Karratha was found unoccupied on the same day as the local community was bracing for the cyclone to hit. At the time Ms Marshall had been treated for depression and hallucinations, and her husband had been desperate to fly her to Perth because there was no psychiatrist in the remote Pilbara town. Body in bushland: the discovery of remains in the Western Australian scrub being identified as those of high school teacher Tracy Margaret Marshall (pictured) brings to a close a sad ordeal for her family. Ms Marshall's husband had been desperate to get her help after she began hallucinating but no psychiatrist was available in the remote Pilbara town of Karratha . Immediate search efforts were hampered at the time by the arrival of Carlos, which brought gale force winds of up to 140km/h and caused significant damage. Last month in the same area as Ms Marshall's car had been found, a member of the public discovered human remains. Police say forensic test have now proven they are those of Ms Marshall, but it was unclear how she died. The discovery brings to a close a sad ordeal for the family of Ms Marshall, who disappeared after she walked out of the mental health unit of the local Nickol Bay Hospital. Sad saga for family: After high school teacher Tracy Marshall (pictured) descended into depression and hallucinations her husband had decided 'things were just spinning out of control' and had planned to fly her 1500km south to Perth to receive proper psychiatric care, but she walked out of a mental health unit and drove her car 50km before it broke down during severe tropical cyclone Carlos . Ms Marshall had been undergoing treatment after she became stressed and depressed working as a high school teacher. She had quit her job and started exhibiting odd behaviour, including having hallucinations in the week leading up to her disappearance. On the day she disappeared, her car was found abandoned on a road 50km out of Karratha. Her father issued an appeal, acknowledging his daughter had personal problems but saying she had never previously given them cause for concern. 'It's been a very worrying and stressful time for us as you can well imagine, we'd just like to try and get Tracey back', Quinton Bricknell said at the time. A coronial inquest held last year heard Ms Marshall had attended the Pilbara Health and Drug Service four times in the week before she vanished, but was told there was no a psychiatrist available in Karratha for two weeks. Her husband Iain Marshall claimed she had woken him up wanting him to perform an exorcism, claiming she had a cleft foot and saw the devil. When they went camping, Ms Marshall had displayed more bizarre behaviour and the next day she told her husband about several suicide attempts. Ms Marshall had also been tap dancing and waving a tube around calling it 'Excalibur' before reciting the Lord's Prayer. Mr Marshall  had planned to fly his wife to Perth for psychiatric treatment on the day she disappeared as 'things were just spinning out of control' and he did not want her to have to wait to see a psychiatrist.Ms Marshall was taken back to hospital, where she was put under overnight observation but disappeared the next morning.","Tracey Margaret Marshall, 35, disappeared three years ago during Cyclone Carlos in Western Australia .

"Sacked: Scott Mcmillan, 39, lost his job after his staff in the clubhouse kitchen made a penis-shaped shortbread . A chef at a prestigious golf resort owned by U.S. billionaire Donald Trump was fired after his staff baked a penis-shaped shortbread - even though he   was on a day off when it happened. Scott Mcmillan, 39, lost his job at Trump International Golf Links at Menie Park Lodge in Balmedie, near Aberdeen in Scotland, after his colleagues in the   clubhouse kitchen made the suggestive biscuit and posted it on his Facebook page with the message 'For Scott'. After noticing he had been taken off the rota, Scott had a meeting with HR staff and was told the behaviour is not the 'Trump way'. Another two chefs also lost their jobs as a result of the phallic shortbread. Mr Mcmillan, of Aberdeen, told The Sun: 'I wasn't there and had absolutely nothing to do with it. 'It was the guys having a laugh - something that's happened in every kitchen I've ever worked in. 'Sacking people who have worked hard for the company over something as petty as this is pretty rough.' He added that bosses confronted him with nine pages of pictures from his Facebook account, even though he claims his private account has nothing to do   with his employers. A spokesperson for Trump said: 'We make no apology for terminating the contracts of a number of individuals for gross misconduct on our property. 'We offer a world class service and customers in our hotel, restaurant and golf complex are our number one priority. 'We will not tolerate unprofessionalism of any kind and so we took immediate action to protect the interests of our business and guests.'

Trump claimed the wind farm would have a negative impact on the views from his luxury £750million links course in Menie. As a result Trump announced his Trump Organisation would be focusing 'all of our investment and energy' on the Irish Doonbeg Golf Club in County Clare, with views over the Atlantic coast and renamed the Trump International Golf Links Ireland.

"A 13-year-old girl miraculously survived a chain-reaction crash in Indiana that killed both her grandparents and severely mangled the white Toyota SUV in which she was riding. Katrina Tucker of Minneapolis waited trapped inside the car for almost an hour before emergency personnel managed to pull her from the wreckage and airlift her to a hospital in Indianapolis, where she was in critical but stable condition with a broken hip, arm and leg. 'You could . see just a little spot of bluejeans; that’s how I knew someone was in . the back,' said . Sheriff’s Deputy Landon Dean, who was the first responder to approach the vehicle. 'I could hear her crying.' The remains of the SUV in which Katrina Tucker survived for almost an hour after a crash killed her grandparents .

The teenager was recovering at the intensive care unit at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Her parents arrived on Sunday morning, according to the AP. The crash occurred during stop-and-go traffic at around noon on Saturday 35 miles east of Indianapolis. Sylvia K. Shaw, 66, and John L. Shaw, 66, . both of New Brighton, Minnesota, were returning from a trip to Washington, DC, with their granddaughter Katrina, and on their way to Indianapolis to visit relatives. A semitrailer truck struck the Shaws' SUV from behind, pushing the smaller vehicle into the back of another big rig and then into another car, authorities said. Traffic had been slowing ahead of construction that limited that section of Interstate 70 to one lane, according to the Courier Times. The Shaws were deemed dead at the scene of the accident near New Castle, Indiana. Their vehicle was 'absolutely unrecognizable', the deputy said. The Shaws' Toyota SUV was totaled in the crash, demonstrating how miraculous it was that Kristina Tucker survived . Everyone in the SUV had on . seat belts, he added. All . passengers in the other vehicles escaped without injury in the crash, . which blocked westbound traffic for three hours. The driver . of the semi that hit the SUV, Richard Engstrom, 59, of Indianapolis, 'didn’t know traffic was stopped for some reason', Dean said. 'There’s a . question about how long he had been driving [without a break].' He said the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing. Time on the road is suspected of playing a role in another crash that occurred recently in New Jersey that injured actor and comedian Tracy Morgan. A National .

"Suspect: Vinh Van Nguyen, 41 (pictured), was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of killing his girlfriend, 45-year-old Tuyet Huynh, her 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21 . A quiet family of three was found shot to death in their Wichita, Kansas home early Tuesday, and the matriarch's boyfriend is suspected of carrying out the grisly crime. Vinh Van Nguyen, 41, was arrested after police found him in the master bedroom with his dead girlfriend, 45-year-old homeowner Tuyet Huynh. Huynh's 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21, were also found gunned down in the suburban residence. The only person in the house unharmed besides the suspect, was the Pham's 5-month-old son Carsen. Police are still investigating what sparked the triple homicide, and say there were no previous cases of domestic violence or criminal activity at the residence. Trinh Pham is believed to be the family member who called 911 just after midnight, while the shooting was still raging. Officers responded within minutes of Mrs Pham's call, but were too late. By the time they circled the home on the 2200 block of South Beech Street, they could already see the bodies of Ms Huynh and Mr Pham lying dead on the ground floor. Ms Huynh was found in the master bedroom along with her boyfriend, while Mr Pham was found in the hallway. Scroll down for video . Orphaned: Besides Nguyen, the only person to survive the rampage was the Pham's 5-month-old son Carsen (face blurred in image above with his parents) A call for help: Mrs Pham is believed to be the person who called 911 shortly after midnight, before she was found gunned down in the home's basement . Mrs Pham was found in the home's basement, next to her unharmed infant son. Officers arrested Nguyen at the scene and say he did not resist them. They also recovered a weapon at the scene. Nguyen is being held on $2million bond at the Sedgewick County Jail on multiple counts of capital murder. Formal charges against Nguyen are expected later this week. According to police, the suspect and victims lived in the house together, and have been described by neighbors as a quiet family.

They just kind of stick to themselves.' The 5-month-old baby is now in the care of family members, as is a younger daughter of Ms Huynh's who was out of town at the time of the shooting . A close friend of Sean Pham has set up a Go Fund Me page to help cover funeral expenses. As of Tuesday evening, the fund had rasied more than $4,000 of its $15,000 goal.

"The Bank of England has stepped in to prevent the housing market from overheating – but indicated it is not worried if prices surge by a fifth over the next three years. In an historic intervention, the central bank announced plans to ration risky loans by banning lenders from issuing any more than 15 per cent of their new mortgages at 4.5 times an applicant’s salary or higher. Governor Mark Carney said the curbs should not make it any harder to get a mortgage – as the proportion is already below 15 per cent – and will have a ‘minimal impact’ on the housing market as long as prices rise in line with its expectations. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has moved to cool the housing market with new rules limiting large mortgages . Shares in the UK’s biggest housebuilders soared yesterday on hearing of the new regime, which will be enforced on October 1. The value of Taylor Wimpey rose by more than 5 per cent or £175million. The . Bank is expecting house prices to rise by 20 per cent by early 2017, . pushing the price of an average home from £186,512 to £223,814. It also . expects household debt levels to rise by 15 per cent in that time. Mr . Carney said both scenarios were at ‘the limit of our tolerance’, . suggesting he is prepared to take further action if the market . accelerates any faster than that. The . Canadian described yesterday’s move as an ‘insurance policy’ to prevent . the housing market from spinning out of control and ensure households . do not take on too much debt. At the same time the Treasury announced a ban on loans above 4.5 times salary on its Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme . Chancellor George Osborne said the new rules will 'help protect our hard-won economic security by better insuring us against any risks that might emerge in our housing market'. House prices in London rose by 18.7 per cent in the year to April,almost twice the national average of 9.9 per cent . He added: 'In the years before the Great Recession the failure to do this cost families dear and took our economy to the brink. 'I gave the Bank of England these new powers because I’m determined that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. 'I want to protect those who own homes, protect those who aspire to own a home, and protect the millions who suffer when boom turns to bust. 'Today’s announcement is a welcome sign that the new system we have created is working.' Prices rose by 9.9 per cent in the year to April, surging by 18.7 per cent in London. In 33 areas of England and Wales, property prices increased in value by more than annual local wages. First-time buyers have been hardest hit by the boom, with prices for them rising by more than 10 per cent in a year. People getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record £199,000 in April, almost 10 times the average salary of people in their twenties. The new Bank of England rules could make it even harder to buy a house, with lenders forced to limit the number of large loans available. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee has recommended that 'mortgage lenders do not extend more than 15 per cent of their total number of new residential mortgages at loan to income ratios at or greater than 4.5'. Prices paid by first-time buyers are up 10.7 per cent year-on-year, but only 9.5 per cent for those already on the property ladder . The rule will apply to all lenders who lend more than £100million each year and should be 'implemented as soon as is practicable'. It is already getting harder for buyers to get a loan, with banks limiting mortgage approvals despite rising demand. The Bank of England reports that lenders forecast a 'lower appetite for risk' over the next three months . High street banks and lenders expect the number of new mortgage agreements to fall significantly from July to September. It follows changes to the Mortgage Market Review which forces lenders to more closely scrutinise borrowers' income and outgoings to check if they can afford repayments if interest rates rise. The Bank of England base rate of interest has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 . In the past, people applying for a mortgage were asked for three months’ pay slips and recent bank statements to show their major outgoings. But since April they have faced invasive questions about their finances and lifestyle, from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership. The new rules limiting the amount that can be loaned in relation to incomes will also push down mortgage approval rates. The Bank is putting more pressure on lenders to ensure their customers are prepared for, and able to cope with, a likely rise in interest rates. On Tuesday Governor Mark Carney appeared to row back on a warning last week that rates could rise before the end of the year, leading to claims he was blowing hot and cold on when families could expect mortgage costs to increase. Giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, he told MPs that low wage growth and spare capacity in the economy meant a rate rise this year was less likely. Labour MP Pat McFadden said: 'The Bank is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend. 'One day hot, one day cold and the people on the other side of the message don't know where they stand.' Last year the Bank said interest rates would not rise until the unemployment rate fell to 7 per cent, but when that target was met earlier than expected, it set broader criteria for a rise. Having signalled an early rise last week, Mr Carney today appeared more doveish and played down the idea. Mr McFadden added: 'The purpose of guidance is to achieve clarity of expectations among households and consumers.' But Mr Carney insisted the message from Bank guidance had been 'very clearly received'. 'As the economy progresses, the time to normalise interest rates is edging closer. It is coming closer. But what is most relevant is those adjustments will be through a gradual process that is likely to be lower that historical averages.'","First time buyers likely to be hardest hit by new curbs on mortgages .

"Arrested: Medics at Franklin Medical Centre in Winnsboro, Louisiana, called police when Lasasha Allen brought her toddler to them with severe injuries . A mother has been charged with the attempted murder of her own child for allegedly throwing the 20-month-old out of a moving car as sped down a rural road at 45mph. Medics at Franklin Medical Centre in Winnsboro, Louisiana, called police when Lasasha Allen brought the toddler to them suffering severe injuries. The 23-year-old mother of six was arrested and, after investigations, police said they believe she inflicted the injuries on the child in a bid to get its father's attention. Franklin Parish Sheriff Kevin Cobb told myarklamiss.com: 'It was finally determined that this was more than an accident. This was an intentional act.' Police said Allen on Sunday sat her child in the front passenger seat of her car, with no seatbelt, and drove to a remote spot close to her home with a curve in the road. With another of her children, a seven-year-old, watching from the back, she is said to have then sped along the curved road before reaching over, opening the door, and allowing the toddler to fall out. She then waited several hours before taking the toddler to hospital. Police said she told them she only intended to inflict a few cuts and bruises. Doctors found the toddler had a fractured skull and several broken bones. They arranged for an airlift to Louisiana State University Hospital in Shreveport where surgeons were waiting to operate. The toddler was 'doing okay', Sheriff Cobb told KFOR.com yesterday. Sheriff Cobb told KATC.com that on Saturday, the day before the incident, Allen had tried get the attention of the toddler's father by sending him a text message claiming his child had fallen from a car window. After that text failed to provoke a response, she 'staged' the accident in an out-of-the-way spot on LA 865 to avoid being 'caught in a lie' with the child's father, the sheriff said. He told KFOR: 'She decided that she would take the child for a ride, placed the child in the passenger seat on the very edge of the vehicle, unrestrained. 'She reached over and opened the vehicle door, in which the child was basically slung out of the vehicle.' Sick ruse: Allen had told the child's father that the toddler had fallen from a car window and, when that failed to provoke a response, she 'staged' the accident on LA 865 to avoid being 'caught in a lie', the sheriff said . Allen is in custody at Franklin Parish Detention Centre, held on a $750,000 bond. Her other five children have been taken into care. Sheriff Cobb called the allegations a 'horrendous act' that is 'beyond explanation.' 'I hope that everyone will pray for that child and its siblings through this ordeal,' he told KATC. 'One thing is certain, the child is in a safer place today than in the hands of the mother. Justice can't move quickly enough in this.'","Doctors called police when Lasasha Allen, 23, brought the badly hurt child in .

"Being woken up early by excited children is a feeling that every parent will know all too well. So spare a thought for this male lion in South Africa who was given a very early wake-up call by his two eager cubs. Mburri may be the king of the beasts, but that didn't stop his children Impi and Dela from treating him like just another plaything. This is the moment two lion cubs called Impi and Dela gave their sleepy father Mburri an early-wake up call . Aspiring wildlife photographer Zoe Cole, 24, captured dad's very unimpressed look as he was woken up . Ms Cole captured the images while working in South Africa as a volunteer on the Selati game reserve . Zoe Cole, 24, captured the stunning pictures as the tiny cubs pounced on to the male lion and bashed him with their paws. Aspiring wildlife photographer Zoe spotted the cubs at the Selati game reserve in South Africa as they played around on the savannah. She said: 'I was volunteering at a private game reserve called Selati in the Limpopo Region of South Africa. 'I'd been assisting the team in monitoring, observing and collecting data on all the endangered species, one of which is a pride of lions. 'Mburri, who is the handsome male lion, was the only fully-grown male at the reserve, so he was king, never having a rival. The adult lions were trying to sleep after a night out prowling but the playful cubs had other ideas . I'm awake: Seemingly oblivious to his father's bad mood, the cub continues batting at his mane . Cubs Impi and Dela are part of a pride of endangered lions that are carefully monitored at the nature reserve . 'There are four lionesses in this pride, so Mburri had plenty to choose from. 'This is the second time I've visited but the first time I've seen the cubs - they were very cheeky, playful and curious. 'I was surprised because we didn't have to wait long as the whole family emerged out of the bush into the clearing enjoying the morning sunshine. 'The two adults sat down tired after a long night on the prowl, however Impi and Dela were rolling and tumbling full of energy.' The photographer, originally from Italy, said the lion looked less than impressed with the early wake up call. Back to sleep: One of Mburri's cubs hides his eyes from the morning sun having just woken him up . There are four lionesses in the pride, but there has never been another lion, meaning Mburri has never had a rival... that is until he had children .

"Amidst a bitter and ongoing family feud within one of Australia's most wealthy families, Ginia Rinehart has spoken out for the first time since her older brother John Hancock branded her an 'oxygen thief' in court this week. The only one of Gina's four children to have stood by her side during the spat, Ms Rinehart told The Daily Telegraph she feels betrayed her sister Bianca agreed with their brother's comments. 'It has been hurtful that Bianca, while in a public proceeding, chose to effectively side with John's comments about me,' she said. Scroll down for video . The youngest Rinehart, Ginia (left), who sided with her mother, Gina (right), against her siblings has now spoken out against her brothers 'hurtful' comments made in court . 'Nasty and mean comments shouldn't be made about anyone, let alone a family member, and certainly not to be then supported publicly by another family member. Mrs Rinehart also hit out at her two warring children, Bianca and John, following this week's court proceedings, calling them selfish as they try to gain control of the $5 billion Hancock family trust. 'I have always worked in the best interests of our family company and my record shows I have turned Hancock Prospecting into one of the most successful private companies in the country, which is of benefit to all my children given their interest via the trust I requested be set up for them,' she told AAP. 'Hard work, sacrifice and immense dedication, not short-term gambles in hope of quick easy money has got us here with the help of a dedicated but very small executive team. 'This has become a company this family should be genuinely very proud of, as my daughter Ginia is, not attacked or distracted for selfish reasons in public litigation.' Earlier this week a Sydney court heard the son of Australia's richest woman call his youngest sister an 'oxygen thief', in the latest battle over control of the family's $5billion trust. Bianca Rinehart, the eldest daughter of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, appeared at Sydney's Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue why she should be allowed to take control of a $5 billion family trust . Mr Hancock made the comments about Ginia, who has sided with her mother against her siblings, the NSW Supreme Court heard on Tuesday. Appearing as the first witness in the case, lodged three years ago, Bianca Rinehart defended her brother's comments, despite having told her mother in 2004 she was 'deeply concerned about (his) reckless bite the hand that feeds you approach'. Bianca, who had temporarily fallen out with Mr Hancock, told the court: '(It's) not a personal attack.' She added that her brother's drinking and gambling problems had been 'damaging in the past'. 'He doesn't want to see the family business left in the hands of someone... he feels isn't up to the job,' she said. John Hancock called his youngest sister, Ginia, an 'oxygen thief'. Bianca Rinehart told the court this contempt was born out of worry over who would assume 'real and great responsibility' for the family company . The contempt Mr Hancock had for Ginia . was born of worry about who would be 'assuming real and great . responsibility of taking over the family company', according to Bianca. She and Mr Hancock have since reconciled, with Mr Hancock backing her bid to take charge of the family's $5 billion trust. The . court heard their mother Gina reportedly sent Olympic swimmer Grant . Hackett an email encouraging him to convince  Bianca to withdraw her bid . to control the trust rather 'than be found a liar in the witness box', . the Sydney Morning Herald reported. He later forwarded the email to his friend Bianca. The youngest Rinehart, Ginia, was not the only one who angered her older brother. Bianca, . Ms Rinehart's eldest daughter, also said her younger sister Hope Welker 'was . pretty much at her wit's end' and felt 'kicked in the stomach' after . the way she was treated by Mr Hancock. The court heard their mother Gina reportedly sent Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett an email encouraging him to convince Bianca to withdraw her bid to control the trust rather 'than be found a liar in the witness box' Bianca told the court that Hope had emailed her brother in February 2013 saying: 'All . I feel is pain and anxiety. You are kicking me in the stomach.' Ms . Welker has withdrawn from the protracted legal debate for control of . the family trust, distressed at the way it was proceeding, and dealing . with her own divorce. Mr Hancock and Bianca allege their . mother acted 'deceitfully' and with 'gross dishonesty' in her dealings . with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her . children as the beneficiaries. So . far, every proposal for a replacement trustee - including Bianca, Mr . Hancock and independent trustees - has been knocked out of contention . during lengthy court proceedings.

"For Yorkshire, the honour of hosting the start of the Tour de France presents a unique opportunity to showcase its beautiful countryside and historic towns. With hundreds of thousands of visitors expected to be in ‘God’s Own County’ next weekend for the Tour’s first two stages, what  better chance for the local tourist industry to show off that famous Northern welcome. But not everyone is so thrilled with the imminent arrival of the world’s biggest cycle race and the huge influx of visitors that entails. Uphill struggle: Riders tackle Buttertubs Pass on Yorkshire's Tour route . Stunned locals have been warned that the Tour could bring with it a crime wave at the hands gangs of thieves. Residents are being urged, among other measures, ‘to consider digging a trench’ across their driveway to stop criminals with vehicles gaining access to their land. The warning, circulated on the internet and by email, also claims the area’s low crime rates could be ‘decimated over a couple of days’ unless action is taken. The first two stages of the Tour de France – dubbed the Grand Départ – are being held in Yorkshire on Saturday and Sunday before the race moves on to London, bringing in millions of pounds of extra revenue for local businesses. However, the controversial email – attributed to Harrogate neighbourhood watch chairman Keith Roberts and Sergeant Bob Chambers of North Yorkshire Police – warns that ‘with the significant increase in numbers of visitors and enthusiasts there is evidence that there will be many criminals amongst them’. It continues: ‘Our enviable record of the lowest level of criminality could be decimated over a couple of days unless we can support our police. ‘The amateur thief can gain access to your property if doors or windows are left unlocked or open – keep them locked even if you are at home.’ Bradley Wiggins won the Tour de France in 2012, bringing a new wave of cycling interest to the UK . And ‘rural members’ have been told thieves with vehicles could steal quad bikes and other valuables. ‘If it is feasible do consider digging a trench across points of entry or creating other obstructions,’ the email advises. North Yorkshire Police last night insisted the warning was written solely by Mr Roberts, 74, a retired company director, who said yesterday that he stood by the advice. But John Blackie, the leader of Richmondshire District Council, which covers an area of the Yorkshire Dales on the race route, slammed the email as ‘bonkers’. He said: ‘It’s one of the most unfortunate emails I’ve heard about in 20 years as a councillor. ‘I hope that everybody simply disregards it because all we want to do is welcome the very large number of visitors who are coming here not to steal, not to vandalise, they are coming here to have a really good time. ‘We could do without this kind of bilge and scaremongering, it is absolutely bonkers.’ A spokesman for Yorkshire Grand Départ said: ‘We are not expecting marauding gangs of thieves.’","Two stages of the tour being held in Yorkshire - but not everyone is thrilled .

"Five men who broke an American student's eye socket with a bottle he was drinking from 'because he was obviously not local' were told today that they will be put behind bars. Francesco Hounye, 23, had been in Britain just three days when he was set upon by the mob who kicked him in the head as he lay seriously wounded on the ground, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Mr Hounye was attacked in an area where a 'Muslim patrol' attempting to enforce Sharia law in east London had previously been caught on camera, however police have stressed that this was not the motive in this case. Scroll down for video . Violent attack: Francesco Hounye has been scarred by life for the savage attack, with his assailants today told that they will face jail . The trial of Mr Hounye: Masoon Rahman, pictured at Snaresbrook Crown Court, where he has admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent . The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'There is no evidence to suggest that this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way. Speculation to the contrary is wrong and potentially damaging to community relations.' They said Mr Hounye was assaulted simply because he was 'obviously not local.' He left too terrified to go out in London after the incident and has since returned to Florida. Samad Uddin, 24, Shaleem Uddin, 20, Shadhat Hussain, 19, Kamrul Hussain, 22, and Massom Rahman, 22, targeted Mr Hounye when they saw him swigging from a bottle of Jagermeister. The student had been out for the night and was walking with a friend to his home in Shadwell, east London. He was confronted by the group, who wrestled the bottle from him. The thugs chased him, continued to beat him, and smashed the bottle over his head. CCTV footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road. He was left needing 23 stitches and was scarred for life after the brutal assault. Terrifying: CCTV footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly . Violence: The attack on Mr Hounye only ended when a passer-by intervened . Six months after the attack a demonstration was staged in nearby Brick Lane where around 60 protestors targeted Muslim-owned businesses for selling 'evil' alcohol. Samad Uddin was on trial for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent after the four others admitted their roles in the attack. Uddin changed his plea and admitted the charge. Judge Tudor Owen said custodial sentences were 'inevitable' for all the gang and told Samad Uddin: 'You pleaded guilty and you'll receive some credit for that. 'It will be a custodial sentence and by that I do not mean a suspended sentence.' Shaleem Uddin and Kamrul Hussain both hold previous convictions for assaults in 2010, but they escaped with suspended sentences. Shadhat Hussain has been before the courts for possession of cannabis and cocaine while Rahman was of previous good character. Mr Hounye, from Florida, was walking with a friend to his home in Shadwell when he was attacked . The gang were identified after CCTV surveillance captured the apparently spontaneous group attack. 'All of them were willingly involved in that attack, all of them played a part,' said prosecutor Paul Casey. 'Two in particular played the most serious role, Shaleem Uddin and Samad Uddin. 'Shaleem Uddin used the bottle to strike Mr Hounye over the head, causing him severe cuts to the side of his head. 'Immediately prior to that, Samad Uddin and a number of others were involved trying to wrestle the bottle from Mr Hounye.' 'During the course of the attack Samad Uddin aimed a number of kicks to Mr Hounye whilst he was prone on the ground, including one which CCTV shows his right foot connecting with some force with Mr Hounye's head.' Mr Hounye was walking down the New Road, Shadwell, with the friend he was visiting on June 17 last year. 'Both of them had been drinking alcohol and Mr Hounye had a bottle of liquor with him - the brand was Jagermeister,' explained Mr Casey. They were pursued down the road and to the junction with Commercial Road where the gang 'confronted and surrounded' Mr Hounye. In the CCTV footage Samad Uddin can be seen taking hold of Mr Hounye's shoulder. The victim was then grabbed from behind by a second male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches. 'The first punches are thrown at Mr Hounye, the bottle is wrestled from him, Shelim Hussain smashes him over the head with the bottle,' said Mr Casey. Samad Uddin is seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to escape. But he was pounced on by the mob, the student was punched against the wall. The gang ran off when a passer-by intervened. Samad Uddin was arrested in April this year after he was recognised by a police officer who had seen the CCTV footage. He initially claimed the allegations were as a result of mistaken identity. Samad Uddin, of Shadwell, and Shaleem Uddin, of Romford Street, Whitechapel, have admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Kamrul Hussain, of Whitechapel and Shadhat Hussain, of Canning Town, and Masoom Rahman, of Whitechapel, east London, have admitted the same charge. The gang are due to be sentenced on July 25.","Francesco Hounye had been in Britain just three days when he was attacked .

"A heartless thief has stolen a four-wheel-drive from a terminally ill cancer sufferer who was on the eve of kicking off the first leg of his bucket list trip - driving along the coastline of Australia. Steve Hughes and his partner, Lynne Woodcock, woke on Wednesday morning to find their 1997 Toyota Landcruiser - his most prized possession - had been pinched. In December, the Darwin father was diagnosed with small-cell cancer and has as little as six months to live. Small-cell cancer means it can appear anywhere in the body. Scroll down for video . Steve Hughes was diagnosed with terminal cancer in December, and he and his partner were about set off on a bucket list trip before their 4WD was taken by thieves . The couple started planning the trip the day after Mr Hughes was diagnosed. 'What I have is terminal so it's just a matter of time,' he said. 'So the plan is to live life to the fullest while I've got it.' The car was taken from the house of Mr Hughes' mother in Morphett Vale in Adelaide - where the couple was staying while he was undergoing radiotherapy treatment to prevent the cancer travelling to his brain. Mr Hughes thinks the thieves got in through the back passenger window because the only evidence left of the car was pieces of glass on the ground. He believes they were professionals because they made minimal noise when they took the car. 'I just think they're mongrels and I'd like my knuckles to do the talking to be honest,' Mr Hughes told A Current Affair. Mr Hughes spent six months researching the purchase of his 1997 Toyota Landcruiser . Steve Hughes (left) and his partner, Lynne Woodcock (right), woke up on Wednesday morning to find the Toyota Landcruiser gone . Mr Hughes said he had spent six months searching for the perfect Landcruiser. 'We finally found the one in Victoria that was perfect so I flew down and bought it the next morning and drove it back up to Darwin with it,' he said. 'During [cancer] treatment process, we put all the bells and whistles and winches and all the rest of it on.' Ms Woodcock told MailOnline they were gutted by the incident that saw thousands of dollars worth of equipment and personal items lost. 'We had our whole life in there. We just had every day things in there like I went to put on my coat today but it was taken as well as my shoes, our camera gear and camping gear. They are all gone,' she said. '[The thieves] are just the scum of the earth – just the scum of society.' The 4WD was the father-of-one's most prized possession . The couple have received a call from Australian 4WD Action magazine who say they will donate a new one to replace the Landcruiser (pictured) But restoring their faith in humanity, the couple received a phone call from Australian 4WD Action magazine on Thursday who said they would donate a new vehicle to them. 'We’re just overwhelmed - that’s just amazing,' Ms Woodcock said. 'If we had to wait for insurance to come through that’s more time off the road and we don’t have that much time.' The couple will soon make their way toward Eyre Peninsula in South Australia and then to down to the southern regions of Western Australia, near the Margaret River.

"Governors have been told to defy a 70-year-old law which says state schools must hold daily Christian assemblies because it is 'meaningless' in today's society. In a landmark move, the National Governors' Association said many non-faith schools are already ignoring the law because teachers are 'unable or unwilling' to lead group worship. The organisation, which represents more than 300,000 school governors in England, added: 'Schools are not places of worship, but places of education.' Archaic law: Christian worship has been compulsory in state schools since 1944 (pictured: assembly in 1962) The move was welcomed by the British Humanist Association, whose leaders include the atheist scientist Professor Richard Dawkins and the philosopher AC Grayling. The National Governors' Association had already moved towards banning Christian assemblies in non-faith schools four years ago, when it said they should no longer be compulsory. Now its policy committee says they should be abolished completely. It announced in a newsletter to members: 'Few schools can or do meet the current legislative requirement for a . daily act of collective worship, partly because there isn’t space in . most schools to gather students together, and often staff are unable or . unwilling to lead a collective worship session. 'There is also the added . issue that worship implies belief in a particular faith – if the 'act of . worship' is not in your faith then it is meaningless as an act of . worship. Support: The move was welcomed by the British Humanist Association, whose leaders include Richard Dawkins . 'The view was taken that schools are not places of worship, but . places of education, and expecting the worship of a religion or . religions in all schools should not be a compulsory part of education in . England today. 'This is different in schools with a religious character – . as faith schools are termed in the legislation – where parents have . chosen to send their child in the knowledge that the particular faith . and its worship is at the core of the ethos of the school. 'Removing the collective worship from . the remit of schools that are not faith schools would not prevent them . from holding assemblies that address a whole range of topics, including . faith and belief. 'In addition, it does not alter our position on . religious education; it is important that students should continue to be . taught a broad and balanced curriculum that encourages a knowledge and . understanding of all faiths.' Faith schools, private schools and schools in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be affected. The 1944 . Education Act made it a legal requirement for all English state schools . to 'provide a daily act of collective worship' for all pupils, unless . their parents object. The . only significant change to the law has been the 1988 Education Act - but . that only removed a requirement for worship to take place 'at the start . of the school day'. Assemblies must still be 'wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character', and head teachers must apply to their local council to allow non-Christian pupils to skip them. The National Governors' Association said it is consulting with the Department of Education to change the law, which still remains in force. Historic move: Governors have been told to ignore a 70-year-old law which says English state schools must hold daily Christian assemblies because it is 'meaningless' in today's modern, multicultural society (file photo) The change was welcomed by the British Humanist Association, which campaigns to keep church and state separate. Chief Executive Andrew Copson said: 'The continued operation of this 70-year-old law requiring daily Christian worship in schools is widely opposed. 'Teachers . don’t want it, parents don’t want it, pupils don’t want it, and . according to opinion polls, 60 per cent of the public don’t want it. 'Children . as young as four are coming home and telling their non-religious . parents they believe in God, or being distressed at age-inappropriate . tales about hell. 'Worship may be the only place in our over . regulated schools where the tyranny of SATs and constant assessment can . for 15 minutes be forgotten' - Church of England . 'In . a plural and fair-minded society that cares about children and their . development, schools should be holding inclusive assemblies that forward . the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of all pupils and . staff, regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs.' The announcement comes in the wake of comments by Education Secretary Michael Gove that all schools should adhere to 'British values'. And it was criticised today by the Church of England, which said Christian assemblies were about community and shared experience, not just praising God. The Rev Jan Ainsworth, the Church of England’s chief education officer, said: 'The unique contribution of worship in church schools is to involve pupils in a shared experience of reflection and silence, singing and story framed with reference to Christianity and other religious traditions. 'It takes its place as part of the religious and spiritual education of the pupils, but with a far greater range of possibilities than a lesson leading to well-scripted outcomes. 'Worship may be the only place in our over regulated schools where the tyranny of SATs and constant assessment can for 15 minutes be forgotten and real engagement take place.'","National Governors' Association told members to defy a 70-year-old law .

Crutchley denies eight counts of indecent assault, two of sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, three of assault by penetration, one of buggery and two of rape at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) David Gordon, prosecuting at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday, said Crutchley, of Dinnington, South Yorkshire, took advantage of his victims' innocence and naivety. He said Crutchley targeted his first victim when she was 13 and he was in his mid twenties. Another of his victims was 12 or 13 when the alleged offences took place and she later fell pregnant but suffered a miscarriage, the court heard. Mr Gordon told the court: 'He told her not to tell anyone what was going on. He had sex with her over a four-year period several times a week.' Mr Gordon claimed Crutchley did not force himself on the girl but she was unable to consent because of her young age.

"A multi-million-dollar penthouse that overlooks one of Australia's most iconic beaches is on the market after its Russian owners, who bought it eight years ago, have decided to sell up. The Circle on Cavill penthouse on Queensland's Gold Coast overlooks the crystal waters of Surfers Paradise and offers up an almost 360-degree view of the popular tourist destination. There are no estimates of what the property will go for when it comes up for auction on July 17, but the Gold Coast Bulletin reports Russian businessman ­Sergey Katsiev and his partner, ­Liudmila, bought the apartment in 2006 for $5.45 million. The Surfers Paradise apartment sold back in 2006 for $5.45 million and was bought by a Russian businessman and his wife . The Circle on Cavill penthouse - on the corner of Cavill Avenue and the Gold Coast Highway - is on the 48th floor . Mr Katsiev is listed as on Forbes' billionaires list and he has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion. The business magazine said the 56-year-old got his start in tobacco after the Soviet Union disbanded. In 2006, tobacco products importer Mercury Tobacco Corporation - then owned by his partner Igor Kesaev -  was incorporated into Katsiev's Megapolis, leading to the creation of the nation's largest player in the tobacco products industry. The Katsievs have two children - but it is believed the businessman and his family rarely visited the property. The penthouse towers over Surfers Paradise and takes up the entire 48th floor - which spans 669 sq m - with high ceilings and large windows to take in the unrivalled views. Sergey Katsiev and his partner, Liudmila, are selling up the apartment that has a modern fitted kitchen . It boasts almost 360-degree views of the coastal city in Queensland . One of the four ensuite bathrooms (left) fitted out with ceiling-to-floor windows (right) will give future owners unrivalled views of the Gold Coast waters . Its lavish surroundings match the apartment's luxurious interior. The house is decked out with Italian Carrara marble floors and benchtops in the kitchen, which is fitted with Miele appliances and an open floor plan. The lucky new buyer or buyers will have the privilege of enjoying a bath with a view in one of penthouse's four ensuite bathrooms that boasts stunning ocean views. But the show-stopping feature of the home is the private 15-metre swimming pool - complete with a spa and 10-person sauna - which acts the centrepiece of the outdoor entertainment deck, and offers night views of the bright lights of the coastal city. The website of exclusive real estate agent Ray White Prestige Gold Coast said this was the first time it had been listed on the market, with the Gold Coast Bulletin reporting it had previously been bought off plan. High ceilings and Carrara-marbled floors are some of the features of the penthouse that make it so lavish . A private 15-metre pool, a 10-person sauna and spa are some of its stunning features . Ray White's apartments specialist Tolemy Stevens told the Queensland-based newspaper that the penthouse had already attracted interest from people in Australia and outside of it.

"The ice bucket challenge has caused a run on freezer cabinets with supermarkets running out of ice as the online trend sweeps Britain. Freezer shelves at many stores are lying empty after shoppers rushed to buy ice in order to take part in the fundraising dare in aid of a Motor Neurone Disease charity. Supermarkets in Portsmouth, Fareham, and Bursledon, Hampshire, are among the many that have been drained of ice reserves following a flood of sales. Lying empty: This Tesco store in Burlesdon, Southampton, is one of the many to have run out of ice as shoppers rush to take part in the ice bucket challenge . Out of stock: Supermarkets in Portsmouth, Fareham, and Bursledon, Hampshire, are among the many that have been drained of ice reserves following a flood of sales . Tina McDonough, 58, a customer sales assistant at the Co-operative said staff had to turn people 'of all ages' away because they ran out of ice. 'We ran out at the weekend and had to turn a few people away of all ages,' said Ms McDonough, from Portsmouth. 'It was the rainy so nobody was having Pimm's o'clock - it was definitely to do with the Ice Bucket Challenge.' Supermarkets have been ordering in extra supplies of ice to meet the demand, sparked by the campaign going viral on social media. Soaked: Katie Price tries to shield her face from the deluge of water as she takes part . Popular: The challenge has soared in popularity as more celebrities, such as Reese Witherspoon . Splash of the day: Gary Lineker is doused in water for the charity challenge . A spokesman for Tesco in Portsmouth said: 'There has been a massive drive in sales of ice for the store. 'Normally in summer we sell two or three cases a day and in each case there are about six bags. 'But at the moment we're moving 20 cases in a few days. 'A lot of the time it has been young customers buying them to do the ice bucket challenge.' A Tesco branch in South Shields, Tyneside, has also admitted running out of ice. Fun for all ages: Jack Reynolds, 102, from Chesterfield, completes the challenge, dressed in his Union flag boxer shorts . Lady Mary accepts the challenge: Downton's Michelle Dockery has water poured over her head . 'We sold out on Saturday and we nearly did on Sunday as well,' said Daniel Smith, duty manager of the Simonside Tesco. 'We don't usually sell so much ice at this time of year - it's usually only this popular when big events like the World Cup are on. 'It seems like everyone is taking part in the challenge and getting behind the charity to raise money and quite a few of our staff have taken part too. 'It's great to see so many people taking part, but before the next big craze, we'd love a bit of warning so we can stock up on whatever it is people need.' Tesco has donated the profits from its ice cube sales to charity, and challenged other supermarkets to do the same after selling more than 36 million individual ice cubes over the last week. Far and wide: The ice bucket challenge has even made it to The Simpsons, with Homer taking part . Going global, and beyond: R2D2 gets doused with water on the set of the new Star Wars films . So far the retailer has donated £20,000 to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and nominated competitors Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to follow suit. Tesco community director Greg Sage said: 'The ice bucket challenge has done an amazing job of raising awareness of motor neurone disease. An incredible number of people all over the world have taken part, including a huge number of Tesco colleagues. 'We've seen a big increase in sales of bags of ice as a direct result of this phenomenon, and we want the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association to be the ones to benefit. That's why today we've pledged to donate the extra profits we make to them, and we nominate Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to do the same.' A spokesman from a Sainsbury's branch in Fareham, Hampshire, said sales had doubled from usual hot summer figures as shoppers dashed to buy 'excessive' quantities of ice. Challenge: Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, accepts the Ice Bucket Challenge from Ryanair's Michael O   Leary . Everyone's at it: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is among those who have undertaken the dare . Linda Langdon, the branch's public relations ambassador, said: 'We have been selling excessive amounts of ice and sold 60 bags in one shop in the space of about five hours. 'Compared to normal, it's double the amount we would have sold over the hot summer period.' A spokesman for Morrisons said customers struggling to find ice for their challenges can get a helping hand from the chain's fishmongers. 'Hundreds of our colleagues have also been doing the Ice Bucket Challenge in support of our charity partner, Sue Ryder,' she said. 'They care for people with long term conditions including MND at the end of their lives. So far this year we have raised almost £1m to support their fabulous work across the UK. 'If customers would also like to help by doing their own Ice Bucket Challenge, they don’t need to pay for ice – they can get it for free from our fishmongers, just ask.' Announcement: Actor Chris O'Dowd (left) and his wife Dawn O'Porter (right) used their challenge video to announce they were expecting a baby . The ice bucket challenge involves dumping iced water on someone's head before the participant nominates another person to have a go. More than £2.7million has been raised for the Motor Neurone Disease Association so far and the figure is rising daily as more people are nominated. Sally Light, chief executive of the MND Association, said: 'The ice bucket challenge is an amazing and unprecedented opportunity to raise awareness of what is a devastating terminal disease.' The charity does not have figures on how many people are undertaking the challenge and donating per day, but since August 10 when the charity's ice bucket JustGiving page was set up 546,553 people have donated through the site, an average of more than 30,000 a day, with thousands more using the text number. In the last two weeks, MND Association has also received more than 17,000 new likes on Facebook and 6,000 new followers on Twitter. Cool customer: Singer Kylie Minogue takes part in the ice bucket challenge . On Tuesday the charity website was visited by 153,000 people, compared with the 1,400 who visit on an average day. However, a poll of 1,528 British adults has found that more than half of those who undertook the challenge did not donate to charity. Around half of those quizzed by VoucherCodesPro said they had done the challenge, but 53per cent admitted they had not donated. According to The Independent, more than one in three people said they had taken part solely to get attention on social media, and one in ten said they had only done the challenge as they felt pressure to do so having been nominated. Just 16 per cent said they had given between £1 and £3 to charity, and 3 per cent gave more than £10. 'Maybe not everyone who has done the Ice Bucket Challenge has donated, but a huge number have,' said Douglas Graham, Director of Fundraising for the MND Association. 'Last year in total we received 161,000 donations and in the last week alone we have had more than half a million donations adding up to around £3 million and that’s still rising. 'And while some people will just throw the water over their head we know thousands have come on our website or social media channels and found out about ALS or MND. As a relatively rare disease raising awareness is almost as important as raising funds, so we couldn’t be more pleased.' In the U.S., where the challenge originated, challengers have been urged to support the ALS Association, which supports those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease - a type of motor neurone disease. ALS is used as the umbrella term for the disease in the U.S., whereas in Britain it is MND. Since the end of July, the ALS Association, a sister charity to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, has received $94.3million (around £56.8million) in donations compared to $2.7million (£1.6million) during the same time period last year. A spokesman said: 'These donations have come from existing donors and 2.1 million new donors. 'The ALS Association is tremendously thankful for all of the generous support and awareness that this summer phenomenon has generated for the cause.'","Freezer shelves lie empty as shoppers rush to buy ice for fundraising dare .

"A heroic Bourbon Street bartender who locked down his bar in the midst of Sunday's shocking shootout and came to the aid of a wounded woman is speaking out about his ordeal. James Burgin, who was taking a break from his job at the Tropical Isle when shots rang out, is seen in surveillance footage rushing to help the Arkansas woman who was shot in the abdomen as two men imperiled countless innocent revelers during their early morning gunfight. Police have released what they believe is separate surveillance footage that shows one of those shooters rushing down a New Orleans street around the time of the shooting and hope citizens might help identify him.

She ended up okay: Only Burgis came to the unidentified Arkansas woman's aid after she fell to the ground in pain . Police on Monday also added a 10th victim, a man who had gone to a station in a neighboring district about 12 hours after the shootings to report that he had been shot. When shots rang out around 2:45 Sunday, Burgin was as shocked as anyone. 'I was in the back of the bar taking a cigarette break when all of a sudden I heard a lot of gunshots, it had to be like more than 8 of them,' he told WWLT.

"A driver from Minnesota has been hailed a hero after using 'superhuman strength' to rip open the door of car that was on fire, saving the man inside. Bob Renning had been driving along the interstate in New Brighton on Sunday when he saw a SUV behind him burst into flames. When the 52-year-old rushed over to the vehicle, which was filling with smoke, he saw its driver Michael Johannes trapped inside. Dramatic: The door frame that Bob Renning bent to let the driver escape can be seen, circled, on the burnt out vehicle . Hero: When Bob Renning saw a car behind him on fire, he quickly rushed to the aid of the driver trapped inside . The fire had knocked out the SUV's electrics system, causing the windows and doors to lock. Renning said when he tried the door and looked inside the vehicle he could see Johannes frantically pounding on the window. Despite not being fit, Renning somehow managed to prise the door open by gripping the top of the frame and bracing his foot against it. The door bent in half and the window shattered, leaving enough space for Johannes to crawl to safety. State trooper Zachary Hill said Renning, who is in the Air National Guard, had used 'superhuman strength' in the rescue. 'I don't think I could take a crowbar and fold the door like he did,' Hill said.

He added: 'I’m just a slightly overweight Air Force First Sergeant, for crying out loud.' Johannes has also praised his rescuer, saying that just moments before he had been certain he was facing death. 'Thirty seconds later and I would have been done,' Johannes, who was treated for a cut to his head and smoke inhalation, said.","Bob Renning prised open door after spotting a SUV burst into flames .

"After hearing the news of Rolf Harris's guilt on sexual abuse charges, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted he was 'gutted and dismayed' and described Harris's actions as 'abhorrent'. The 84-year-old entertainer was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault against four girls, one of whom was as young as seven or eight. 'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people,' Mr Abbott told ABC radio. Tony Abbott has described Rolf Harris's crimes as 'utterly abhorrent' and said he was 'gutted' to hear of his guilty sentence . 'Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime,' Mr Abbott said. 'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.' The assaults took place in the UK between 1968 and 1986, with the main complainant a childhood friend of Harris's daughter Bindi. Harris was also found guilty of assaulting Australian woman Tonya Lee at a London pub in 1986 when she was 15. Rolf Harris is set to be sentenced on Friday, after he was found guilty of all 12 sex abuse charges . Now, Rolf Harris faces being stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Queen and will lose his BAFTA fellowship following his convictions for indecent assault. In an astonishing fall from grace for the man who painted the Queen’s portrait and sang at her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Buckingham Palace is now likely to revoke his Order of the British Empire and Officer of the Order of Australia. On Monday Harris, 84, was told he faced an 'inevitable' jail term after he was found guilty of 12 indecent assaults on four victims between 1968 and 1986, often in 'plain sight'. A plaque laid by Rolf Harris in his hometown of Bassendean in Perth, Western Australia has been defaced in the wake of his guilt . 'Jekyll and Hyde' Harris had used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before abusing them with impunity and believed his celebrity status made him believe 'he was above the law', Scotland Yard said. The Australian star spent 16 years abusing his daughter Bindi's best friend and got a 'thrill' from attacking her when his own child was feet away. He is likely to be jailed at his sentencing on Friday, and could face up to a 24 year sentence. Despite now having been found guilty of assaulting daughter Bindi's (right) childhood friend, Harris turned up to court each day with his daughter and wife (left) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke out about the Rolf Harris guilty verdict on Tuesday .

"Hugely costly: An estimated 600,000 children and adults in the UK are affected by ASD and genetic factors play a role in its development (file picture) Autism is the most costly medical condition in Britain, say researchers. It costs the UK £32 billion a year - more than heart disease, cancer and stroke combined. Researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) have produced the most comprehensive estimate yet of treatment, lost earnings, care and support costs for children and adults with autism. Autism, or autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), including Asperger’s syndrome, is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone’s ability to interact socially and communicate. An estimated 600,000 children and adults in the UK are affected by ASD and genetic factors play a role in its development. A quarter of people with autism are unable to talk, and 85 per cent do not work full time. New research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, concluded the financial costs of autism in the UK were much higher than previously estimated. The overall cost of autism to the UK economy is £32.1bn per year, compared to cancer (£12bn) heart disease (£8bn) and stroke (£5bn). The study found the cost of supporting someone with autism who did not have intellectual disabilities was £0.92 million. The cost rose to £1.5 million for an individual with autism who is also intellectually impaired. The largest costs during childhood are special education and lost earnings by parents. Among adults with autism, the highest costs were for residential or special living facilities and lifetime loss of earnings by the affected individual. The figures also show Britain spends just £4m per year on autism research, compared to cancer (£590m) heart disease (£169m) or stroke (£32m). Professor Martin Knapp from LSE, who led researchers from the UK and US, said between 40 and 60 per cent of people with autism spectrum disorders also have intellectual disabilities. He said ‘What these figures show is a clear need for more effective interventions to treat autism, ideally in early life, making the best use of scarce resources,. ‘New government policies are also needed to address the enormous impact on families.’ Comprehensive: Researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) have produced the most thorough estimate yet of treatment, lost earnings, care and support costs for autisim sufferers . Christine Swabey, CEO of Autistica, the UK’s leading autism research charity, said ‘We care about the human stories behind these numbers. Autism is life long and can make independent living and employment hugely challenging. This is part of why it has a greater economic impact than other conditions. ‘There is an unacceptable imbalance between the high cost of autism and the amount we spend each year on researching how to fundamentally change the outlook for people. ‘We know that progress is possible. The right research would provide early interventions, better mental health, and more independence. But right now we spend just £180 on research for every £1million we spend on care.’ Autism researcher Professor Declan Murphy, from the Institute of Psychiatry, said ‘The cost figures show that autism affects all of us in society, every day, regardless of whether or not we have a family member or friend with autism. ‘So we all need to play a part in making things better. More research funding would mean that we could conduct studies to transform lives.’ In a recent survey by Autistica, 90 per cent of parents and 89 per cent of adults with autism said that there was a need for greater scientific understanding of autism. One father said ‘We should be making science work harder to make life more bearable.’ A woman, who was diagnosed with autism aged 50, said ‘I look for interventions, but there do not seem to be interventions for people my age.’","London School of Economics and Political Science revealed high costs .

"For 13 years, squatters occupied six Victorian mansion blocks in a prime . London location rent-free, letting them go to wrack and ruin.

Squatters and protesters supporting their cause set bins on fire and . hurled yellow paint at policemen brought in to oversee the operation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Up and coming area: Three of the properties in the terrace will be sold off to property developers . Homeless: Around 75 residents, including some children, were led out of the squats today following the raid . The protesters, who had gathered along Rushcroft Road in Brixton, . south-west London, in anticipation of the raid, yelled ‘scum’ as . bailiffs moved in, while a group of ten tried to resist police. Around 75 squatters – including children – were led out of the buildings. Police said two people had been arrested – one for criminal damage and another for affray. Peter Piotrkowski, an evictee, claimed he was pushed to the ground by police officers as he left the building on crutches. He added: ‘I’m going to be homeless now. I’m on benefits, £72 a week. I . can’t find any place for that money and I need to keep some money for . food.’ Rushcroft Road, near the centre of up-and-coming Brixton, was covered in rubbish and bins were torched as the authorities evicted around 70 occupants from six mansion blocks, many of whom have lived there rent-free for 32 years .

"Wireless company T-Mobile billed customers for bogus charges for years, making hundreds of millions, the Federal Trade Commission alleged Tuesday. In a federal complaint filed in Seattle, the FTC claimed T-Mobile billed consumers for subscriptions to premium text services such as $9.99 horoscopes and celebrity gossip that were never authorized by account holders. In trouble: T-Mobile knowingly made hundreds of millions off its customers in bogus third-party charges and billed them for premium services that customers never authorized . The practice is often referred to as . 'cramming':  businesses stuff a customer's bill with bogus charges . associated with a third party. 'T-Mobile’s practices have caused consumers millions of dollars of injury,' the FTC said in in the complaint. In this case, the FTC says T-Mobile . should have realized that many of these premium text services were scams . because of the high rate of customer complaints. The FTC also claimed T-Mobile collected 35 to 40 percent of the charges - even after customers said they were being scammed. 'It's wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,' FTC Chair Edith Ramirez said in an agency release. 'The FTC's goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.' Protection: The FTC said one way for consumers to try to prevent fraudulent charges is to ask their providers to block all third-party businesses from providing services on their phones . In addition to billing customers for third-party services, T-Mobile allegedly lists them 'in the middle or towards the end of the bill, . which in some cases may exceed 50 pages in length,' the agency alleged. The FTC said one way for consumers to try to prevent fraudulent charges is to ask their providers to block all third-party businesses from providing services on their phones. T-Mobile's CEO John Legere responded to the FTC's complaint in a statement Tuesday, calling it 'unfounded and without merit' and a 'sensationalized legal action.' 'T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want,' Legere said. 'T-Mobile is fighting harder than any of the carriers to change the way the wireless industry operates and we are disappointed that the FTC has chosen to file this action against the most pro-consumer company in the industry rather than the real bad actors.' Legere also said '[third-party providers] should be held accountable, and the FTC’s lawsuit seeking to hold T-Mobile responsible for their acts is not only factually and legally unfounded, but also misdirected.' Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc., is a publicly traded company. According to its website, Deutsche Telekom AG maintains a 67 percent ownership in the company's common stock.","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) claimed T-Mobile billed consumers for subscriptions to premium text services that were never authorized .

"A British teenager has told how she was seduced by the same Turkish waiter who ran away with a 16-year-old schoolgirl. Alanah Longshaw, from Stirling in Scotland, told how Murat Can Ertani groomed her via Facebook, told her he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him in Turkey. But after she fell pregnant with his child when she was just 16, the 22-year-old told her 'I hope you and the baby die in labour'. British schoolgirl Faye Jones, 16, from Cramlington, Northumberland who has the same dark hair and green eyes as Alanah disappeared four days ago with Can. But today police contacted her mother Rhonda, 39, to say that she had been found with Can about an hour away from the resort of Marmaris. Pattern: Alanah Longshaw with her son.

On the run: Schoolgirl Faye Jones (right) is believed to have ran off with Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani (left) who she met on holiday last year . Alanah, who is now 19, fell for him because he told her that she was beautiful and 'not like all the other girls'. Alanah . was 16 when she decided to give up her life in Scotland to go and live . with him and his family in the village of Adana just outside Marmaris in . January 2011.

They . were unable to find a job and were living in squalor in a flat without . electricity or any amenities she was used to at home. Distraught: Faye's mother Rhonda has been frantically searching for her. But today police contacted her to say that she had been found . She told the Scottish Daily Record: . 'Things were great at first but when we moved in together he was a . different person. He became violent and aggressive and he was drinking . all the time. 'He would lock me in the apartment . for hours on end while he went out to get drunk and then he’d come home . and attack me. He would slap me and called me names like slut.' She said that after a while she persuaded Can to return to live with his mother bur she fled and booked a flight home. Back in Britain she went to college to study travel and tourism in a bid to realise her dream of becoming a travel rep. But she was forced to quit college after she found out she was five months pregnant with Can's child. When . Alanah told him she was carrying his baby, she says he was happy . initially but then he turned, sending her sickening Facebook messages. She told the newspaper: 'I was . horrified when I received a message from him saying, ""I hope that you . both die in labour"". What kind of person would say something like that?' Turkish police say Murat Can Ertani is a criminal and has spent time in jail . Search: More than 30 Turkish police officers were said to have been on the case and the family put missing person posters up around the resort . Fall out: Faye's mother said she had to go home after an incident in which Can allegedly slapped one of her friends in a bar .

The teenager had met Can last year and had . secretly kept in touch via Facebook and on Skype. Faye’s . mother banned her from seeing the barman last week after he erupted . into a jealous rage during a night out. She said that Can had ordered . Faye to stop dancing. Police . spotted the runaways in the town’s bazaar, but they . escaped, dumping the suitcase which contained her money and passport. Today police contacted Faye's mother Rhonda, 39, . to say that she had been found with Can about an hour away from the . resort - the pair had been on holiday in the resort when she . disappeared.

"A central London council has demanded the Romanian government sends its own police to Britain to deal with rough-sleepers from their country who are setting up camp in the capital. Westminster Council says the problem is costing the taxpayer £500,000 a year with around 60 immigrants currently bedding down in Hyde Park and next to Marble Arch on Park Lane. These gangs are being blamed for crime and anti-social behaviour including pickpocketing, cashpoint fraud and street scams. Trouble: Westminster Council wants Romanian police to come to the UK to deal with camps like this one currently on Park Lane . Claims: The local authority says that two out of three beggars on its streets were found to be Romanian . Life: One member of the camp sits under a tree and washes his feet in a plastic tub earlier this week before the it was broken up today . People living near them say their streets are becoming 'open sewers' and claim they are having to bleach pavements outside their homes and shops because of the dirt. During the London 2012 Olympics a team of Romanian police came to the UK to tackle the issue and Westminster Council wants them to come back. Councillor Nickie Allen has written to the Romanian ambassador about the issue and said: 'We, and the local police, are diverting resources every day . into dealing with this. My concern is the situation is going to get . worse with the hot weather. 'Until we stop these . people coming into the country this is not going to go away. It’s like . mole holes, you can clear them from one place and they pop up in . another.' Occupy Park Lane: A group of women are seen smoking and chatting away among the plastic bags and suitcases, wearing thick jackets despite the summer temperature . Plush stay: As guests of the five-star hotels of Park Lane emerged, they were shocked to find the large group camping out on the doorstep . Playing games: Two men play with a dice and some cards as two other women sit and chat behind them . Scrappy: The camps have been described as 'shanty towns' and local residents say they are making their lives a misery . Costly: Westminster says the Romanian police must come to the UK and get to grips with the issue, as well as cover the costs . Belongings: These clothes were left to dry on a tree trunk while other suitcases and cardboard boxes were dumped against a fence . Traffic passes by the group on Park Lane as some sleep, chat or play games with their friends today . Councillor Allen has also said she would expect the Romanian government to cover the costs of sending ten officers to London, because 200 of 292 beggars caught in Westminster last year were from that country. She also plans to push the Government to ensure Romanians committing anti-social behaviour are deported and not allowed to return to the UK. A recent poll found that almost one in ten Romanians planned to head to the UK and from January Britain will open its labour market to its citizens under EU laws. They can come to the UK for three months but must leave if they are not working, and are not 'self sufficient'. Morning ritual: A young man rests on a large plastic bag which appears to contains duvets and blankets, packed up after the group's overnight stay . Home: Around 60 Romanian travellers have spent the past two nights sleeping around Park Lane, Marble Arch and Hyde Park . One man decided to get some sun on his back as temperatures in central London soared today . One camper was seen doing his laundry while a suited passer buy looked at a Bugatti Veyron in a car showroom behind . This man sat on the grass beside his open suitcase as he enjoyed a bite to eat and a Starbucks drink . Across the Channel, France is currently considering whether to use laws to remove thousands of Romanian travellers, which could see them end up in the UK. Last month police and immigration officials moved in to clear a ‘shanty town’ built by migrants in a leafy London suburb. A . total of 68 mainly Romanian squatters were found living in huts built . from waste wood and plastic amid the filth of a tip at a former football . ground in Hendon. Just five of those . at the camp . were found to have the right to work in the UK. Last month dozens of Romanian immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of Hendon Football Club in North London . Only five were found to have the right to work in the UK and the rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer . The rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer, but only 19 took up the offer. They were told they would have to . leave the country within 30 days, but were released on to the street to . live rough or in shelters, meaning it could cost up to £15,000 for . police to find each of them, monitor them and eventually remove them. Migrants have been living at the . vermin-infested former Hendon FC ground for more than two years despite . it having no running water, electricity or sanitation. They scavenged in . the rubbish for clothes to wear or things they could sell. Barnet Council sold the site to . developers for housing last year but legal challenges over the freehold . had held up the clearance of the site.","The issue is costing the local authority £500,000 a year and is set to increase .

"A duo of writers have ignited an uproar with their foretelling of an insurrection that will plunge America into a new civil war, courtesy of a 'Tea Party militia.' Written in disturbing detail by a retired colonel and the academic, the article describes events leading up to a full-blown civil war on American soil, like the one that is currently gripping Syria. The article also describes the plan of the American military to quash the rebellion orchestrated by its own citizens. Tempests in the tea pot: A pair of writers have ignited an uproar with their foretelling of an insurrection that will plunge America into a new civil war, courtesy of a 'Tea Party militia' The Small Wars Journal article, entitled . 'Full Spectrum Operations in the Homeland: A ""Vision"" of the Future,' was written by retired U.S. Army Col Kevin Benson and Jennifer Weber. So when does such a civil war begin? According to Benson and Weber, the seeds of their vision have already been planted. They write that the Great Recession will have lasted longer than anyone could know, sparking massive unemployment and political unrest. Benson and Weber write that despite a ‘change in control of the White House and Congress in 2012,’ the economy’s downward smile will continue, with the percentage of jobless Americans near double digits. Raising eyebrows: Retired U.S. Army Col Kevin Benson and Jennifer Weber wrote the story, which appeared in the Small Wars Journal on July 25 . War: Benson and Weber describe in shocking detail the insurrection that would leave the U.S. plummeting into a civil war, like the one currently gripping Syria . But the authors say it won’t be until 2016 when things start to take a bad turn. The write: 'In May 2016 an extremist militia motivated by the goals of the ""tea party"" movement takes over the government of Darlington, South Carolina, occupying City Hall, disbanding the city council, and placing the mayor under house arrest.' According to their story, the movement will spread from Darlington and into various checkpoints on travel routes like I-95 and the commercial and passenger rail lines. Benson and Weber prophesize that the Tea Partiers will join forces with groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the Minutemen, bringing a racist and anti-immigrant element into the controversy. On the Small Wars site, were quick to blast the authors for the piece. Anger: They write that Tea Party militias will take over the town of Darlington, South Carolina, and force its mayor into house arrest . One called Benson a 'traitor in waiting.' Another said that their story was 'quite disturbing and not well thought out.' In an editorial published last week, the Washington Times called the story 'a choppy patchwork of doctrinal jargon and liberal nightmare.' Benson is now a seminar leader at the University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Weber is currently an associate professor of history at the University of Kansas, but has also toured the country speaking about President Lincoln and the Civil War.","Writers detail shocking civil war resulting from 'Tea Party militia' taking over South Carolina town - and the U.S. military's response .

PwC will continue to trade the businesses as normal whilst discussions take place with interested parties over a sale. The North American operations of La Senza and others worldwide are unaffected by the administration. Mr Moran added: 'There are no immediate plans to close any stores and the administrators shall continue to assess the trading strategy over the coming days and weeks.'

"A NYU student will be regretting getting quite so carried away at a recent unlimited mimosa brunch after his embarrassing alcohol-fueled exploits have left him the talk of the internet. Gerry Shalam, 20, provides plenty of laughs in this short video clip in which he attempts to intimidate the person filming him with some rather grandiose - and seriously ill-judged – boasts. ‘This your property? My dad is in f**kin’ real estate, you’re gonna tell me this your property? My dad owns half of f**king Manhattan,’ the student from Allenhurst, New Jersey screams at the cameraman. Scroll down for more . NYU student Gerry Shalam, 20, will be regretting getting quite so carried away at a recent unlimited mimosa brunch after his embarrassing alcohol-fueled exploits have left him the talk of the internet . The footage starts with Shalam and his equally well-oiled friends causing a nuisance outside a dry cleaners on 28th Street in Manhattan. A blonde girl attempts to help a man in a blue shirt stand up straight, while Shalam takes issues with the man filming them. The man with the camera explains that his is unhappy about them loitering on his property and so Shalam attempts to one up him by claiming that his father is in real estate and 'owns half of f**king Manhattan.' When asked his name, Shalam responds 'Gerry Adjmi,' adding later that 'I’m a f**king lawyer.' The footage starts with Shalam and his equally well-oiled friends causing a nuance outside a dry cleaners on 28th Street in Manhattan . Shalam apparently used the phony surname because his drunken friend - who by this point is on the pavement - is himself an Adjmi, a wealthy New York real estate family who don’t own half of Manhattan either. Eventually the drunken students depart the scene, but not before Shalam utters another classic lines: 'You think I don't own the cops?' and ‘Do you want me to call [New York City Mayor] Bill de Blasio on you right now?’ Since waking up with a hangover and realizing his embarrassing exploits are all other the internet, Shalam has done his best to disappear by deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts. Unfortunately for Gerry, he wasn’t able to delete everything about him online and The Smoking Gun has reported that surprise, surprise, Gary wasn’t being totally honest with his idle boasts. His father isn’t a property magnate, but rather Lou Shalam is a garment industry executive, while his mother Frieda is an event coordinator and member of the Allenhurst Borough zoning and planning board. Eventually the drunken students depart the scene, but not before Shalam utters another classic line: 'Do you want me to call Bill de Blasio on you right now?' Perhaps deservedly Shalam is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ‘over-privileged’ and ‘an insufferable rich-kid.’ But it appears this member of NYU’s Class of 2017 isn’t all bad and his accomplishments include co-founding a charitable organization called Brothers Helping Others that helps low-income immigrant families in Asbury Park, New Jersey. If this latest incident wasn’t embarrassing enough for Salam, it has also helped to shine a spotlight on his past as a former thespian. At age 13, he played the Scarecrow in a community center production of Hip Hop Wiz, a Wizard of Oz adaptation produced by his mother. The musical included 'unbelievable hip hop dance routines' and a script that 'was recreated with a Syrian twist,' according to a YouTube clip.

"A homeless man has appeared in court charged with the pre-dawn rape and murder of a hospitality worker in a central Melbourne park. Scott Allen Miller, 42, remained alert in the dock during a brief hearing at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Wednesday where he stands accused of killing Chinese national Yuk Ling Lau while she was on her way to work. Miller, who had been living on the streets for two months, looked bewildered and yawned several times during the short hearing, the Herald Sun reports. Scroll down for video . Yuk Ling Lau (left) has been remembered as a 'wonderful person' by her friends . Legal Aid solicitor Sarah Pratt told the court that Miller had suffered a previous drug-induced psychosis and required a prison health assessment. 'It’s his first time in custody,' Ms Pratt said. Scott Allen Miller has appeared in court in Melbourne charged over the rape and murder of Yuk Ling Lau . A police application to retain forensic samples taken from Miller was granted and he was remanded to reappear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on October 24. Ms Lau, a 32-year-old pastry chef from Hong Kong, was found dead by joggers in Kings Domain on Sunday morning at 5.30am. Miller was arrested near Eden on the NSW far south coast on Monday following a three-day manhunt. He was extradited to Victoria on Tuesday and was charged in Melbourne that night. Ms Lau's friends, who knew her as Renea, remembered her as a 'beautiful friend and colleague' and a large group of them attended the hearing on Wednesday. A colleague who worked with Ms Lau at the dessert bar in Melbourne's inner-east, Steven Kearney, said she was a 'wonderful person'. 'I would just like to state with deep sadness that Renea was an employee,' Mr Kearney told The Age. 'She will be terribly missed here. She was... a beautiful friend and colleague. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.' Mr Kearney asked the media to respect his and his other colleagues' privacy as they were 'grieving and working through this difficult time'. Yuk LIng Lau (pink top) was on her way to work in Melbourne when she was raped and murdered . Ms Lau had moved to Australia in 2012. Her family will arrive in Australia later this week to formally identify her body. Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that Ms Lau had been sexually assaulted before she died. 'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said. Miller was arrested by an off-duty police officer near Eden, while camping in a small cove area and was later taken to a police station. Yuk Ling Lau's parents are due to arrive from Hong Kong this week to take their daughter's body home . He was born in the US and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb. In the 1990s, he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported. Homicide Squad detectives had appealed for help on Monday to identify a second man who was seen out drinking with Miller on the night of the crime and may be able to assist with the investigation. Police confirmed that the man seen on CCTV footage walking along Swanston Street with Miller about 1.50am on Saturday had contacted police. He attended a city police station and made a statement on Monday evening. Scott Allen Miller is led into court in Melbourne on Wednesday charged over the rape and murder of Yuk Ling Lau .

"A teenager from Cardiff and a man from London have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences today. The 18-year-old is from the Grangetown area of Cardiff - close to inner city areas of the Welsh capital where a trio of young jihadists now fighting for ISIS lived before they fled to Syria. He was seized under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 for assisting in the preparation of an act of terrorism. Scroll down for video . Cardiff link: Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana appeared in this Isis recruitment video this month encouraging others to fight jihad as two men were arrested by anti-terror police today . Police sources say the arrest is not directly connected to the three Cardiff men currently in Syria. Meanwhile a 32-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism and fraud and 12 addresses are being searched as part of an investigation linked to Syria. Officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism unit held the man today in west London and he is currently being questioned at a police station in the south of the capital. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and arranging funding for terrorism in Syria. Police said that 12 addresses are being searched - one in Hertfordshire and the rest in west London. Concerns have been raised for several months about the number of would-be British jihadis who are travelling to the war-torn Middle Eastern state. Counter-terrorism police launched a campaign earlier this year to encourage women to inform on male relatives who they suspect of planning to travel to Syria to get involved in fighting. The issue again reared its head when Aseel Muthana, 17, followed his older sibling Nasser, 20, from Cardiff to join Isis in Syria. Young recruit: 17-year-old Aseel Muthana was allegedly a member of a violent Cardiff gang before he fled to join his brother Nasser fighting for Isis in Syria . Another friend Reyaad Khan, also from the city, appeared in a shocking recruitment video aimed at luring jihadists to Syria and Iraq. In February Aseel fled Britain to fight in Syria after telling his parents he was staying at his friend's house ahead of a maths exam at his school. But police then arrived at his home the following night after it emerged he had gained a second passport by lying about his age and was in Cyprus and about to sail to Syria. His brother Nasser was a star medical student who secretly travelled to Syria from his family home in Cardiff despite being offered the opportunity to study medicine by four universities. His family have not seen him since November 2013. Furious father Ahmed Muthana, 57, said if his sons ever return to the UK, he would like to see them jailed. He says the Welsh capital is facing a crisis with extremists leafleting communities and holding 'pop-up' events to groom young men.

"House prices across the UK soared by 11.8 per cent in the last year, the biggest annual rise for almost a decade. Britain's booming housing market shows little sign of cooling, with the average property hitting a new all-time high of £188,903. In London prices are 25.8 per cent higher than a year go, the Nationwide reported as ministers prepare emergency plans to encourage house building in a bid to prevent the property market reaching boiling point. The 11.8 per cent rise in the year to June is the biggest increase recorded since the year to January 2005, Nationwide said . The latest house price index from Nationwide reveals that prices in June were 11.8 per cent higher than the same month last year. The last time soared by the same rate was in the year to January 2005, two years before the financial crash. Between May and June prices were up 1 per cent, pushing average prices up £2,391 above a previous peak in cash terms which had been recorded just one month earlier, in May. In London, prices rocketed by 25.8 per cent in a year, the biggest increase in the capital since 1987. It means the average house in London now costs more than £400,000 for the first time, hitting £400,404 in June. It means prices in London now 30 per cent above their 2007 peak and the gap between values in the capital and the rest of the UK is 'the widest it’s ever been', according to Nationwide’s report. However, big gains are not confined to London and the south east. In Southern Scotland, which includes Ayrshire and the Borders, prices are up by 14 per cent on the previous year, as are prices in Belfast in Northern Ireland. In South Wales (West), which includes the Vale of Glamorgan, Bridgend and Swansea, house prices have seen a 12 per cent year-on-year jump. After London, Cambridge was named as the top-performing city for the housing market. Prices in Cambridge have surged by 20 per cent over the last year to reach £419,187 typically. St Albans was the third strongest-performing city, with values lifting by 18 per cent annually to reach £451,800 on average. Newcastle was named as the worst-performing city, with a 3 per cent annual uplift taking prices there to £181,473 typically. Across the UK, all regions recorded annual price gains for the fourth quarter in a row, with the largest being in London and the smallest in Scotland, where values have risen by 5.4per cent annually to reach £141,872 on average. The average house price in the UK is now £188,903, less than half the £404,000 recorded in London . The number of new homes built this year is expected to fall, leaked documents reveal. Ministers expect 128,000 homes to be started in 2014-15, down from 133,650 last year, BBC Two's Newsnight reported. Embarrassingly for the government, the official figures are due to be published in February 2015, just three months before the general election. Tackling the housing crisis and helping more people to buy their own home is likely to be a key issue of the election campaign. Panicked ministers are now examining emergency measures to kick-start new housebuilding. There are 9,000 sites with permission for 350,000 homes which have not started building, the leaked report states. Housing minister Kris Hopkins told Newsnight: 'We’ve delivered 445,000 new homes over the past four years and housing starts are now at their highest since 2007 but we’re going further, building on the success of schemes like Help to Buy to get Britain building and investing billions of pounds in new affordable homes. 'I’ll be bringing pressure to bear on the small number of slow-coach councils that need to raise their game to meet what they have signed up to do and deliver the new homes their communities rightly expect.' In Wales, property prices are up by 9.3 per cent on a year ago, now standing at £145,812 typically. in Northern Ireland, where the housing market is still recovering from some sharp falls seen in the wake of the financial crisis, values have risen by 8.4 per cent annually to reach around £117,150. Prices in Northern Ireland are still around half the level they were at their peak. Prices lifted annually by 16.4 per cent in the Outer Metropolitan commuter belt area, by 14.0 per cent in the Outer South East, by 9.8 per cent in the South West, by 9.5 per cent in East Anglia, by 8.3 per cent in the East Midlands, by 8.2 per cent in the West Midlands, by 8.1 per cent in the North, by 7.1 per cent in the North West and by 7.0per cent in Yorkshire and Humberside. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said house prices surpassed their 2007 peak levels in the second quarter of this year, 'just as UK economic output is likely to have surpassed the high water mark reached before the financial crisis'. He said the latest figures show there is still 'significant variation' in the performance of the housing market across the UK. Across the country as a whole, prices are just under 1 per cent above their pre-financial crisis peak, but when London is taken out of the equation they are 0.4 per cent below this previous high. Prices in southern regions are now above their 2007 peaks, while those outside the South are still below this level. Last week, the Bank of England moved to put curbs on riskier mortgage lending by announcing that loans of 4.5 times a borrower’s income or higher should account for no more than 15 per cent of new mortgages issued by lenders. The Bank also said that lenders should apply a new 'stress test' ensuring that borrowers can keep up their mortgage repayments in the event of a rise of up to 3 per cent in interest rates over the first five years of the loan. There have already been some signs of a slight slowdown in the housing market since the launch of stricter mortgage lending rules under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) at the end of April, which mean mortgage applicants must be quizzed in more detail about their borrowing habits. Experts have said it is too soon to know whether the impact of these new rules will be temporary, as they bed in, or more longer-lasting. It has also been said that a continued shortage of properties on the market is still helping to push prices upwards. Mr Gardner said that the Bank’s new measures are 'unlikely to have a significant impact on housing transactions or the pace of price growth in the near term'. He continued: 'Most major lenders are already using a stress rate in their affordability calculation that is broadly consistent with the new stress test. 'Similarly, the proportion of house purchase loans at or above 4.5 times borrowers’ income is currently some way below the 15per cent cap.' Mr Gardner said that the Bank’s new policy measures, alongside the MMR rules, should help to limit the risk of house prices becoming detached from earnings, while mounting speculation over possible interest rate rises may also dampen housing market activity in the months ahead.","Price rises  'picked up' in the year to June, says Nationwide building society .

"French police using tear gas have stormed a migrant camp on the French coast where more than 600 migrants were waiting to illegally cross the channel to Britain. Three people were arrested as they attempted to escape the authorities' crackdown, including two activists from the No Border Network. Police cars and dinghies blocked road and sea access to the Calais port after they received a court order backing local authorities' concerns over sanitary conditions in the food distribution centre. Many of those at pictured at the centre today were from countries that had suffered conflict, such as Iraq . Migrants, pictured here being evacuated from Calais, have been trying to cross the channel for years . The local administration said in a statement that 610 migrants, including 121 children, had been evacuated. They will be questioned and their cases examined individually. 'It began at around 6am. I was inside and the cops came and they blocked all the exits and used tear gas to stop people from fleeing,' said Celine, a 25-year-old volunteer at the food distribution centre. Camille, a nurse, said about 25 migrants had managed to escape. Many of them came from countries that had suffered conflict such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Sudan. In recent days many migrants from this centre have tried to cross the channel on boats or on vehicles . The migrants evacuated from the food distribution centre have been occupying the area for two months . The migrants had been occupying the food distribution centre since police cleared three makeshift camps holding 650 people at the end of May. French police have been trying for years to dislodge migrant camps in and around Calais. But the flow has been persistent, with many migrants hoping to hide in trucks or other vehicles crossing to Britain, where they believe conditions are better for would-be refugees than in France. The town of Calais has struggled to deal with migrants who travel there in a bid for refugee status in Britain . A spotlight has been shone on the situation in recent days with large a number of dangerous and desperate attempts made by migrants to cross the border. Yesterday two suspected illegal immigrants squeezed into a rubber toy dinghy were rescued half a mile from the Dover coast in a desperate bid to cross the English Channel. It is thought they may have been helped by other people amid reports the dinghy was dropped from a yacht which had already sailed some of the journey between France and England. And last Saturday eight Afghan immigrants had to be rescued around five miles off the port of Dover in the Channel when their RIB's motor broke down after running out of fuel. The alarm was raised by the captain of a passing P&O ferry which could have run them over and they were rescued from the choppy seas by Dover Lifeboat workers. Romanian Marian Badea, 29, a ninth man who was in the boat with them, was charged with attempted facilitation. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court next week. The eight Afghan nationals who were detained following the rescue are to be deported, said a spokesman for the Border Force. The Romanian man was believed to have been trying to smuggle the eight Afghans into Britain under the cover of darkness when the 50hp outboard motor ran out of fuel, leaving the boat drifting in force four winds . It was a repeat of a similar incident on June 6 when a Mongolian man was rescued from the middle of the English Channel trying to paddle to England in a rubber dinghy. He was spotted in a 4ft long blue inflatable kayak by a fishing boat eight miles from shore.","French police received court order to clear more than 600 migrants due to concerns over sanitary conditions at coastal food distribution centre .

"Teresa Marsden's daughter has been missing for almost one year but her mother just refuses to give up on her. Ms Marsden is so convinced that she's traveled more than 1000km along Australia's east coast posting 'missing' posters in the hope that someone, somewhere knows where her daughter may be hiding. Ms Marsden said the fact Renae was not a party girl or 'into drinking or drugs' has convinced her that she's still alive somewhere in Australia. Renae Marsden was excited about her upcoming 21st birthday when she was last seen by her family at their Glenhaven home in Sydney's northwest on August 5, 2013. She would have turned 21 on October 15. Teresa Marsden (left), pictured with her daughter Renae Marsden(right) at a Pink concert two weeks before her disappearance, is determined to find her child . Renae then headed to dinner with work friends in Watsons Bay, which she never made, and her last communication was a text message to her mum telling her she loved her and she was her best friend. 'It was just a general message. She was upset but it wasn't like a goodbye or anything,' Ms Marsden said. 'I let it go - I tried to ring her but her phone kept going to voice mail. 'But this is not the first message Renae sent me like that - it's not a message that was out of the ordinary - alarm bells didn't go off.' Encouraged by a friend, Ms Marsden notified police about an hour after Renae sent the text message that she was concerned about her daughter. 'She was going to dinner and never came home. 'I would still look for her if she was, but I wouldn't be going to this extent because I'd figure she would just come home when she was ready,' she said. 'It was very out of the ordinary for her to disappear,' she said. Missing: Renae Marsden was last seen by her family in Glenhaven on August 5, 2013 - just before her 21st birthday on October 15 . In their search, police tracked Renae to Watsons Bay in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where they later found her car locked. An investigation did not find any prints on the car or signs of anything suspicious, but Renae's parents did think it was strange that her car, which was normally full or personal items and clothes, was completely empty. Renae's phone and keys have never been found. Since Christmas Ms Marsden, who has three other young children, has posted hundreds of 'missing' flyers in coastal towns cities including Chinderah, on NSW Queensland border, Mooloolaba, on the Queensland Sunshine Coast, and as far inland as Moree in outback NSW. 'I've been trying cafes anywhere and everywhere - doing all up the east coast north of Sydney,' she said. 'I mail cafes the posters to get as many posters out as possible.' 'I went up to Byron Bay and the Gold Coast at Easter to look around for her and I plan to go back to Byron and surround areas in a couple of weeks.' Ms Marsden said she believes her daughter could be hiding due to a violent person who she was scared of. 'She was frightened two weeks prior to her disappearance... but she told me not to worry,' she said. Teresa Marsden has sent 'missing' posters to cafes along Australia's east coast in the hope of finding information about her daughter Renae's whereabouts . Ms Marsden has used her daughter's fears to determine her search areas. 'I don't poster Sydney, because if she's done a runner, she's going to go elsewhere, so I'm heaidng up north,' she said. 'I started with Coffs Harbour - it was just an area I'd chosen to get 100s of flyers out.' In the months since she has been posting the flyers across Queensland and NSW, Ms Marsden said she had mostly received calls from people saying they wanted to help by putting posters up - and a few psychics. 'I had a postie lady asking me to send them up to her so she could put them out in the mail,' she said. Only one person has contacted Ms Marsden in regards to a sighting but she questions the validity of this information. 'He said he'd seen Renae but I asked for evidence and never heard back. He said he'd seen her but didn't know where so I said: ""When you figure it out get back to me"",' and I left it with him,' she said. Ms Marsden said 'hope' was driving her search. 'They say a mum knows if something happens to their kid and I don't believe she would have taken her own life,' she said. Teresa Marsden(right) said her daughter had been making plans for the future when she vanished . NSW Police are now preparing a report for the coroner, but Ms Marsden does not believe her daughter was dead. 'It's different if you see a body, but here's too much evidence to suggest she's alive. There's not evidence to suspect she's not here,' she said. 'She was at her cousin's 21st birthday two days before (she disappeared) having an absolute ball. She loved her cousin. 'There was no change in demeanour, we were having a good night.' 'Two weeks prior we went to the Pink concert together - we were a very close family, she was very close to me.' Ms Marsden added that Renae was also making plans for her own upcoming 21st birthday - on October 15 - and was planning to study in the future. 'None of it makes sense,' she said. Desperate to find her young daughter, Ms Marsden said she still has hope of finding her alive and well . A NSW Police Media spokeswoman confirmed police had presented their evidence to the coroner. 'Police are now awaiting the coroner's determination and recommendations,' she said. The information from the coroner will be used to asses if police investigations need to continue and if so, anything that might still need to be looked at. As a teenager, Renae worked in a hairdressing salon two shops down from the newsagency owner by the Lin family in Epping. After five members of the Lin family were murdered in 2009, police spoke to Renae about the family. 'She knew the family quite well so police spoke to her,' Ms Marsden said. 'She never socialised with them but she used to chat to them when she would go in a few times a week to buy magazines for the salon. 'She was quite distraught by the murders because she had known them for quite a long time.' Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 .

"A 16-year-old girl hid her pregnancy from her parents before seretly giving birth to a baby girl who was found buried in the family's backyard, authorities have revealed. Police found the full-term baby, who weighed 8.5 pounds, buried in a subdivision in Franklin County, North Carolina on Sunday, Sheriff Jerry Jones said on Tuesday. Based on preliminary information from the state medical examiner's office, authorities believe the baby was dead when she was buried - but they are awaiting the final report to determine the cause of death and whether the baby was alive when she was born, he said. The investigation began at 7.30 pm on Sunday when someone saw a text message about the incident and contacted authorities, Eyewitness 11 reported. Scroll down for video . Scene: A teenager's father found her baby's body buried in a shallow grave in their backyard in Franklin County, North Carolina on Sunday after she apparently hid her pregnancy from her family . The person 'overheard something like, so-and-so is having a baby, and she's not going to tell anyone about it,' Jones said. 'So it would be a concealed childbirth. He didn't know if it was true or not. His remarks were that ""I cannot keep this. I have to tell somebody"".' Investigators shortly found the family involved and went to their house but the girl was at work. At the home, family members were shocked by the possibility that someone there had given birth, Jones said. As investigators looked around the home, one saw what appeared to be a bloody towel or shirt in the teen's bedroom, he said. 'We had some suspicions, but we didn't have anything else,' Jones said. Investigators left and discussed getting a search warrant, but the girl's father called back about 10pm Sunday and said, 'you need to come back to our house. We found what you're looking for'. He led investigators to a shallow grave in the backyard where he had uncovered enough to see the baby's head, Jones said. Discovery: Sheriff Jerry Jones said police investigated after someone alerted authorities about seeing a text message about the hidden pregnancy. After they searched the home, the father found the body . At first, Jones was skeptical that the girl's parents wouldn't know their daughter was pregnant, he said. 'I didn't really agree with that when I first heard it,' he said. 'But the social services people said teens are very, very clever in hiding this type of stuff. There may be ways of concealment that I don't know about.' He encouraged others in this situation to talk with a counselor, get prenatal care and at least use North Carolina's safe haven laws to drop off their baby. Under that law, parents can give up a baby within seven days of birth at a safe haven center, which include hospitals and police or fire departments, without being charged with a crime. The mother of the newborn was taken to a hospital for treatment and was released on Monday night, he said. Investigators hoped to interview her on Tuesday. They believe the baby was born late Sunday morning or early Sunday afternoon, he said. Investigators believe the teenager buried the baby, he said. The newborn's father, who also is a juvenile, was aware of the pregnancy, as were some friends of his and the baby's mother, Jones said. It's not clear if they knew that the baby was buried, he said. He expects concealment of birth charges and possibly others. 'If things go the way our investigation is leading us, it could become a death investigation,' he said. 'From Sunday night and nobody knowing, it's evolved in our investigation that at least the newborn child's father was aware (of the pregnancy) and that he had told some people about it. 'From what seemed to be a clearly discrete pregnancy has turned into at least a half dozen or so people knowing about this pregnancy.'
