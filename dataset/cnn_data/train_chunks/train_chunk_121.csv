"Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) -- The wife of a former top aide to former presidential candidate John Edwards defended in testimony Tuesday having shot video in September 2008 of the house and possessions of Edwards' pregnant mistress. ""I wanted proof that I really was taking care of Rielle Hunter,"" said Cheri Young, whose husband, Andrew, was a top aide to the then-candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, who is now facing federal corruption charges. Defense attorney Alan Duncan showed the jury the videotape of the North Carolina house leased by Hunter, who was in California and had not given her consent to the taping. A number of personal pictures, Hunter's California driver's license and a tentative list of baby names were shown to the camera. Young said she had not asked Hunter for permission because she assumed Hunter was out of the country on a trip planned by Edwards' benefactor Fred Baron. ""I wasn't looking through Ms. Hunter's private things,"" Young said. Asked why she was videotaping Hunter's private items, Young responded, ""Things had gone sour"" between the Youngs and Edwards, and Young wanted to be able to show that the money given to herself and her husband had, in fact, been spent on Hunter for such items as a lease on a house and furniture. Earlier in the day, Young had defended her husband's motivations for writing a tell-all book about him. ""The only reason for my husband to write a book is because Mr. Edwards did not come forward and tell the truth,"" she testified. She was responding to questions from Duncan about profits from the book. Young pointed to an interview with ABC News in August 2008 during which Edwards did not acknowledge having fathered a child by Hunter as a critical moment in the decision to write ""The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards's Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down."" ""It was discussed as a way to completely tell the truth in 2008,"" she said. ""I wanted the truth to come out."" The defense pointed out that Cheri and Andrew Young stand to make more money if the book is used as the basis for a movie about the disgraced politician. ""Would you like to get additional income from the movie being made?"" the defense lawyer asked. To that, Cheri Young offered no apologies. ""Yeah, I'll take income,"" she said. But she maintained that the only reason she was still involved in the story was because of the court case. ""I came here because I had to come here,"" she said. The defense also said Young has little first-hand knowledge of the events, i.e., that most of what she knew she learned second-hand from her husband, not from primary sources. Young testified that she had not been in the same room with her husband when he made many of the calls that have been cited in the case. The defense also tried to assert that Andrew Young was drinking heavily in 2006 and 2007, that it affected his memory and that he was mixing alcohol and Ambien. The prescription medication is used in the treatment of insomnia. Its combination with alcohol can increase the chance that a person taking the medication will experience side effects, according to the package insert. The defense added that Andrew Young's work for Edwards was a source of tension in their marriage, which caused Cheri Young to resent her husband. She denied the claim. Cheri Young had testified Monday that Edwards told her that using money from one of his benefactors to pay his mistress's expenses was legal. ""Get the money in,"" said Edwards, who was then running for president, Cheri Young recalled Monday. Prosecutors say those donations, which weren't reported to federal authorities, were illegal and represent a chief reason Edwards is being tried on six felony counts. Also charged with conspiracy and making false statements, he could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Young testified Monday that she felt ""disgusted"" after being asked to endorse and deposit checks from 101-year-old heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon intended to pay Hunter's expenses. Edwards, who was then married, eventually admitted having carried on an affair with Hunter, whom his campaign had hired as a videographer, and fathering her child. Cheri Young sobbed on the stand Monday after explaining her reaction to being told that Edwards wanted her husband to claim that he was the father of Hunter's child. ""The first thing in my mind was how in the world Mr. Edwards could ask one more thing of us,"" Young said of her thoughts at the time. Despite her reservations, Young said she participated in a December 2007 conference call with her husband, Edwards and the then-pregnant Hunter. ""Mr. Edwards was trying to get everyone on board,"" Young testified. ""(He talked) over and over about the campaign."" She said Edwards also said that he didn't want his wife, Elizabeth, who had been diagnosed with cancer, to find out about the affair and child. Elizabeth Edwards died of breast cancer in December 2010. Andrew Young did once claim to be the father of Hunter's child, though Edwards -- after losing his bid for the Democratic nomination -- acknowledged that the child was, in fact, his. He is accused of concealing $725,000 in contributions from Mellon and more than $200,000 from Texas lawyer Baron, who has since died, from the public and from the Federal Election Commission by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports. Edwards' attorneys have argued that Andrew Young was involved in a ruse to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors for his personal use. The former aide admitted during questioning by Edwards' attorney that he used campaign donations for his own benefit, including to fund construction of a home that included a pool and a theater. CNN's Ted Metzger, Eric Fiegel, Oliver Janney and Scott Garber contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Things had gone sour"" with Edwards, Cheri Young says .

"(Oprah.com) -- Many years ago I had a blind date in a mediocre Chinese restaurant with a dour tax attorney with whom I was hopelessly mismatched. There seemed no possibility of common ground until he proudly informed me he was an officer of some organization of mycologists. Perhaps whatever passion there was in this man lay in mushrooms rather than law or human relationships. I told him I had collected mushrooms once myself. In fact, it was one of my most purely happy early memories. Oprah.com: How do you find love? I was 7 or 8, and my favorite aunt, Rose Wallman, who often borrowed me from my parents because she was childless, came to take me for an afternoon mushrooming expedition in Forest Park, New York. Aunt Rose was equipped with a basket from Woolworth's and a copy of ""The Little Golden Book of Mushrooms"". I was thrilled to go foraging with her because I had been reading the Heidi books and it seemed like something Heidi would do, even though Aunt Rose and I were not in the Alps. Forest Park was as close as you could come to a real forest in the borough of Queens. Aunt Rose, as much a neophyte mycologist as I was, delighted me by appearing to rely on my judgement in matters of life and death. We would spot a mushroom and consult ""The Little Golden Book"", searching for a matching illustration. Mushroom or toadstool? would be the question. (At this point in my narrative, the tax attorney interrupted me with a withering pronouncement: ""There are no toadstools -- only toxic mushrooms."" ""To me at 8, they were toadstools,"" I said firmly, and shortly afterward went home alone.) To continue my story, anything we both designated ""mushroom"" would be promptly picked. By the end of the afternoon we had gathered quite a variety; golden and in various shades of brown, they lay nestled in Aunt Rose's basket with clinging bits of moss and pine needles. The tax attorney told me he did not necessarily eat the rare specimens he collected; my aunt, however, was planning to sautÃ© the whole lot in parsley butter but said she could not take the responsibility of inviting me to share the feast. All evening I worried about her, until the phone rang. Aunt Rose had not only survived but reported to me that the mushrooms were delicious, and ever since I have regretted not sampling that dish seasoned with a bit of danger. Oprah.com: What Oprah knows for sure about adventure . I thought of Aunt Rose quite often after I bought a small cabin in Vermont on the edge of the woods. She would have been pleased that I finally had my own Forest Park, complete with deer, moose, porcupines, and a mythical bear or two. Where my lawn ends, there are wild apple trees and blackberry brambles. In the fall after it rains, I'm likely to find boletes in the garden. My friends and neighbors up there are experienced mushroom hunters who wisely collect only what they're absolutely sure of and eat everything they gather. Strings of dried mushrooms hang from the rafters of their kitchens. If you're out driving with them, they're likely to stop the car to harvest giant speckled pheasant's backs jutting from dead elms along the roadside or the slightly phosphorescent shaggy manes that show up at night, luminous in the headlights. I've heard tales of giant puffballs, big enough to serve six, and of certain outcroppings of morels in hillside cow pastures. If you ask, ""But where exactly do you find your morels?"" you won't get an answer -- such secrets are respected by all -- but you will get an invitation to come to dinner and try some. Oprah.com: How to throw a stress-free dinner party . I went to the Strand bookstore in New York City and bought an enormous illustrated tome on mushrooms, which I hauled up to Vermont. It was full of Latin names and stern warnings and symbols representing degrees of edibility. I studied the picture of the lovely white mushroom known as the angel of death, learned how to make spore prints on paper towels, and felt properly nervous but still eager to proceed. Finally I went off to the woods without my mushroom bible, which was far too heavy to carry. I was a middle-aged city dweller still unaccustomed to being alone in the woods, and sometimes I thought I had to be crazy as I scrambled down the ravines and over fallen tree trunks and wrenched my sneakers out of oozing mud. If I broke my leg, who would find me? Perhaps days would pass before my friends started inquiring, ""By the way, have you heard from Joyce?"" And once I was rescued and was asked, ""Why did you take such a foolish risk?"" The truth would be somewhat ridiculous: ""Because I wanted chanterelles."" Oprah.com: 11 ways to ruin a summer vacation . I'd been told they grew everywhere in Vermont, and even for a beginner like me, the delicious little saffron trumpets were easily identifiable. Like a child, I wanted there to be chanterelles in my part of the woods. I found only three or four of them that first day, growing out of rotted logs, but still it was a victory. I brought them home in a strawberry box and put them in an omelette after double-checking them with the book. In the following days, I went farther afield and brought home a few more, saving them up until I had enough to cook with pasta. I liked the way the urge to seek them cleared out my mind, brought purpose and suspense to my rambles; I thought of nothing in the woods but of spotting a few dots of cadmium yellow in last year's dead brown leaves. One day, wandering contentedly in circles, I completely lost my way. I headed toward the sunlight and found myself in a strangely familiar place that turned out to be my neighbor's yard. There was a lone chanterelle growing in his driveway. With a twinge of guilt, I picked it. Oprah.com: Comfort food gets a healthy makeover . My city cat had come to Vermont with me; I'd kept her in the house for fear of losing her to coyotes, but finally she made her escape through some torn screening. I ran after her, tearfully calling her name, but she melted into the woods. As I walked back to the house, I found myself in a stand of birches near the road, only a few yards from my door -- the ground was covered with small yellow trumpets, more than I'd ever hoped to see in one spot. They'd been hiding in plain sight -- like the cat, as it turned out. She materialized on the porch at five the next morning, ravenously hungry and full of fleas. So thanks to her I have my own secret place, filled with the mysterious bounty of the forest. I can only guess at what makes the chanterelles so abundant there. Is it the particular amount of sunlight filtering through the trees, the birch bark and decaying limbs on the ground mixed with just the right proportions of maple leaves and pine needles? My chanterelles come back year after year. Like all miracles, it's nothing measurable. Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price. That's like getting 18 issues FREE.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso ended his 2011 Formula One commitments wearing a Santa Claus outfit and the robes of a Magi, and the Spanish driver hopes next year will bring a return of the old Ferrari spirit. The legendary Italian marque has won 31 world titles overall, but none since clinching a 16th constructors' crown in 2008. Alonso was fourth in the drivers' standings this year, 135 points behind Red Bull's all-conquering Sebastian Vettel after winning just one race, while teammate Felipe Massa was a massive 274 points off the pace in sixth. After being Father Christmas for Ferrari employees at the team's Maranello headquarters, and then one of the Three Wise Men at a sponsors' party, Alonso turned his attentions towards his bid to add a third world title to his 2005 and 2006 successes at Renault. Argentina's new F1 project . ""This is the time when one is always optimistic, but then we must wait for the start of the season to see where we really are. It's true that in the past few days, there was a good feeling at Maranello and there's an air of confidence about it,"" the 30-year-old told Ferrari's website. ""We want to reacquaint ourselves with the taste of winning that has eluded us for a while. Last spring, we made important changes to the structure of the technical part of the team and now we have adopted a new approach, a less conservative one, in the design of the new car. ""The philosophy behind the 2012 car is very different to that of 2011, especially in some key areas like suspension and aerodynamics."" Alonso, who joined Ferrari in 2010, is now looking forward to unwinding before testing begins again in Jerez in February ahead of the opening race in Australia on March 18. ""Now's the time to take it easy for a few weeks, time to recharge the batteries and be 100% ready for next season, which I expect will be much more of an equal fight than the one just gone,"" he said. ""Red Bull will still be very strong, but I think they will have less room for improvement than us, as we were so far behind this year.""","Fernando Alonso confident that Ferrari can return to winning ways in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Defending motorcycle champion Marc Coma of Spain won Wednesday's 362km fourth stage of the Dakar Rally from San Juan to Chilecito, although the Spaniard still trails KTM team-mate Cyril Despres in the overall standings. The 35-year-old finished over two minutes ahead of Despres, leaving the Frenchman still eight minutes and 10 seconds ahead of Coma in the overall standings. The pair are already well clear of their rivals, with third-placed Helder Rodrigues of Portugal, who finished fourth on the day, nearly 27 minutes adrift. Coma, who is playing catch-up after losing 10 minutes on Tuesday when he took the wrong route, told reporters: ""I tried to drive at a very high pace from the beginning, but it was difficult. ""I was able to overtake a few drivers and gain some time on Cyril and I will keep on fighting every day."" Meanwhile, nine-time overall winner Stephane Peterhansel took the lead in the car section after coming home first in Wednesday's stage.

"(CNN) -- Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen is excited ahead of his return to Formula One next season, having signed a two-year deal with the renamed Lotus team in November. Raikkonen claimed the drivers' title four years ago while racing with the legendary Italian marque Ferrari before leaving the sport in 2009, going on to compete in the World Rally Championship and NASCAR. ""There has been quite a bit of noise in the press about my comeback and there have been a lot of rumours,"" the 32-year-old told the UK-based team's website. ""For me, coming back to Formula One is a good thing and I hope it will be for the team and the fans also."" Raikkonen has a wealth of experience in F1, having started 156 grands prix across eight seasons racing for Sauber, McLaren and Ferrari, but still gets a thrill out of preparing a car for the grueling year ahead. ""I love this time of the year at the factory,"" he said. ""There's a real buzz surrounding the new car. ""Every single department is working flat out in order to have everything ready on time. You can really feel people's dedication and it's nice to be a part of it. ""You spend so much time sitting in the car so the position is really crucial, it needs to be 100% right. I'd rather spend a lot of time getting it right at this time of the year because there are many races in the season. Getting it right the first time is imperative."" Raikkonen and Frenchman Romain Grosjean will form a new-look driver partnership at Lotus, replacing Brazil's Bruno Senna and Vitaly Petrov of Russia. This will be the team's first year racing under the legendary Lotus name, having previously been known as Renault and then Lotus Renault after the French manufacturer scaled down its F1 involvement. This season will see six world champions take to the track, with Raikkonen lining up alongside Red Bull's 2010 and 2011 titleholder Sebastian Vettel and Mercedes' seven-time winner Michael Schumacher plus Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. The opening race is the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park in Melbourne on March 18. In other motorsport news Friday, the sixth stage of the Dakar Rally had to be halted by summer snow in the Andes. The competitors were due to complete a 394km leg from Fiambala in Argentina to Copiapo in Chile containing 247km of special sections, but it was called off when the frontier was closed. ""Due to the bad weather continuing over the Andes Cordillera, the Chilean authorities were forced to close, for the night, the border at Paso de San Francisco, situated at 4,700m,"" said a statement on the race's official website.

"(CNN) -- Africa is ready to host the World Athletics Championships for the first time, the sport's president Lamine Diack told CNN. South Africa became the first nation from the continent to stage football's World Cup last year, while Cape Town finished third in the bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games. The nine-day athletics showpiece lays claim to being the third biggest sporting event on the planet behind those two competitions, but requires significantly less investment in infrastructure for the host nation. ""I think you could have a good bid from Africa in 2019, 2021,"" said IAAF chief Diack, who is from Senegal. ""I think that there is a country and an African city that can organize it. ""But you must plan the development of your city because in order to have all this investment, you need to have the facilities."" While a successful Olympic bid, such as London 2012, requires a large stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies alone, a world championships can be run on a smaller scale. ""London had Wembley. It's probably easy to do at Wembley and not to build a new stadium, but they wanted to develop this area of London. They can do that,"" Diack said. ""I think if you have a vision of development in your city, athletics can do that, the Olympics can be the way. ""The world championships are easier. You need a good stadium, good facilities -- they have these in many African countries, but you need the willingness of the government to say, 'I'm going to put in $50 million.' "" London has also won the right to host the 2017 world championships, beating a big-money bid from Qatar which -- on top of the $8 million prize fund -- offered a reported $33 million in sponsorships of the IAAF's competitions, awards dinners and development programs. The UK capital made a late move by matching the prize purse, but Diack said concerns over the legacy of its new Olympic stadium were forefront in the decision process. ""I think they picked London because, as you know, we had a very big fight to have this stadium stay in London,"" the 78-year-old said. ""It's a pity that for the Olympics, we build a stadium with 100,000 seats for an opening and closing ceremony and for athletics and, at the end, say, 'We'll destroy it.' And certainly, I feel that Britain is a very great nation of athletics."" The bidding process for football's 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar, came under great scrutiny due to allegations of corruption against top officials at ruling body FIFA. Diack is also facing an International Olympic Committee inquiry over claims that he received illegal payments from now defunct Swiss company ISL, which had an exclusive marketing contract with the IAAF for the world championships. ""I think they discovered that I received money in 1993. In 1993, something very difficult happened to me: my house was burned (down). They burned my house with all of my family inside,"" said Diack, who has been IAAF president since 1999 and was this year re-elected until 2015. ""Fortunately, no-one died, but I lost my house and I had no insurance, so I had to find a way to rent a house, find a way to build up my own house, buy something else. So many friends knew this and they said, 'We'll send my support.' ""I received this. When they asked me, I started by saying, 'This is what happened.' I didn't hear again from the ethical commission."" Diack, a former athlete who held the French/West African long jump record from 1957-60 and is now an IOC member, said he is confident he will not be found guilty of wrongdoing when the IOC considers the case in December. ""Absolutely. There's no problem,"" he said. ""And, to be clear, when I became president, the first thing that I decided is that ISL used to be our marketing company for the television rights in Europe, getting 50% of the money. I decided that we didn't need ISL, I have to make a direct contract with someone else, and so I made a contract with someone else. ""If the ethical commission says they want to meet me, I will go to them. If the executive board says, 'We want to meet,' I will go to them and I will explain myself, but I don't find myself guilty of any wrongdoing.""","IAAF president backs Africa to host athletics' showpiece event in near future .

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended Ghana on Wednesday in a move which could prevent the west-African country from competing in the 2012 London Games. The IOC cited ""political interference"" from the Ghanaian government as the reason behind the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Ghana's expulsion. ""The IOC has deployed every possible effort in order to help resolve the situation that the NOC of Ghana has been facing for 18 months and find a long-term solution with all parties concerned,"" read an IOC press release. The statement went on to claim that an ""obvious lack of cooperation of the government authorities in Ghana and a lack of respect of the Ghana public authorities"" led to the nation's ban. Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, claimed Ghana's suspension was as a result of the county's sports laws, which ""do not respect the provisions of the Olympic charter."" ""There have been many promises that the law would be changed but nothing materialized,"" Rogge told reporters at the organization's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. As a result of the IOC's decision, Ghana will also lose its Olympic funding. Ghana have won four medals at previous summer games, with Clement Quartey their most successful medalist after he claimed a silver in the men's light welterweight boxing division at the 1960 Rome Games. Eddie Blay claimed a bronze medal for the country in the same discipline four years later in Tokyo, while Prince Amartey also achieved a bronze medal in the middleweight division at the 1972 Munich Games.

"(CNN) -- Formula One minnows HRT and Marussia have become the final two teams to unveil their cars for the 2012 season after passing mandatory crash tests. Spanish-based HRT have been testing in Barcelona, taking advantage of filming day regulations which allow teams to run outside of official designated testing. The team had been unable to get the new HRT F112 ready in time for last week's testing at the Circuit de Catalunya after a failed test. But both drivers Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan have now got in vital track time ahead of the season-opener in Australia on March 18. ""The first impressions are good, certainly a step up from last year, "" India's Karthikeyan told the official F1 website. Spain's de la Rosa is also hoping the team, who run on a fraction of the budget being employed by the likes of Ferrari and McLaren, can improve during the season. ""From here it is our job to try to improve it and make progress,"" he said. They are likely to be battling with Anglo-Russian team Marussia to avoid the wooden spoon in this year's constructors' championship. Marussia's new car -- the MR01 -- has been running at Silverstone, again using filming day regulations ahead of the new season. Chief designer Pat Symonds confirmed on the official F1 website that the car had finally come through its crash test problem which caused them to miss out on the Barcelona testing. It allowed the driver line-up of Timo Glock and rookie Charles Pic to have some invaluable practice ahead of Australia. ""While we have a lot of catching up to do, we take heart from the fact that everything is on a more positive trajectory,"" said Symonds.","HRT unveil new car for 2012 season in Barcelona .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik's defense counsel had warned that the self-confessed killer would show no remorse. And that was clear from the start. No sooner were his handcuffs removed in the than he raised his arm in a fascist-style salute -- a symbol, to quote his wordy manifesto, of ""strength, power and defiance against Marxist tyrants."" He announced he did not believe in the authority of the Oslo court. His plea then followed: not guilty, though he acknowledged his acts. He claimed he was acting ""from necessity."" Rampage suspect says he acted to save Norway . He sat in the court on the first day of the trial Monday wearing a suit, no handcuffs, no restraints, no cage as you might see in other countries -- not even for a mass murderer. There were smiles and handshakes with the psychiatrists and prosecution at the start. The only barrier was bullet-proof glass between him and the family members, built to protect him rather than the other way around. This is after all Norway, a country that prides itself on its liberal values. It is a country that has endeavored, as the Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg promised shortly after the attacks last year, to respond with ""more openness, more democracy and more humanity"" to these most inhuman of crimes which left 77 people dead. And that is what they are doing -- taking pride in the fact they are a society who will respect Breivik's human rights, even when he showed no respect for the lives of others. This is why Geir Lippestad, Breivik's defense lawyer, took on this most difficult of jobs. ""I remember I woke up my wife, or she woke up by the same telephone call,"" he told reporters back in March.Â  ""She's a nurse and she said 'if he had arrived at the hospital with gunshot wounds, the doctors and nurses would have helped him, they'd do their job.Â You are a lawyer, so don't you want to do your job?'"" ""He was so close to having a bullet between his eyes, the police were so close,"" said Jorn Overby, who rescued 15 people from the waters off Utoya island on the fateful evening of July 22, 201. When I press him about whether he felt that would have been the best thing for him, he replied: ""I owe him a punch in the face for firing at me."" But his desire for revenge stops there. ""He will get the treatment he needs,"" he said. These are people who would prefer never to have to speak Breivik's name again. On the Dagbladet website you can now press a button to opt out of news relating to the deadly attacks. There is a sense the people of Norway want to see due process done and then move on. They are a people who believe their system works, which is why no matter how unspeakable his crimes and how hard these months are and will continue to be, Breivik has not been able to break them.","No sooner were his handcuffs removed than Anders Breivik raised his arm in a salute .

"(CNN) -- The head of the International Olympic Committee has urged soccer's ruling body FIFA to take a tough approach against corruption when it deals with the World Cup bidding scandal. Two members of FIFA's executive committee, Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, have been provisionally suspended following allegations they were prepared to accept bribes in exchange for their votes for deciding the 2018 and 2022 hosts. Four other officials were also suspended ahead of a full hearing next month. The IOC expelled 10 members in 1999 following the bribery controversy in Salt Lake City's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games, and its president Jacques Rogge believes FIFA should take similar action. ""I think the IOC took the right conclusions on something that was very unpleasant,"" Rogge told reporters following an IOC executive board meeting in Acapulco, Mexico.

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) have opted not to re-award the women's 100m gold medal at the Sydney Games in 2000, which was stripped from Marion Jones two years ago. In line with IOC practice, controversial Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou, who finished second to Jones in Sydney, would have been expected to receive the gold medal. Instead, the record books will show no gold in the women's sprint at Sydney but two silvers, with third-placed finisher Tanya Lawrence of Jamaica promoted to silver alongside Thanou. Lawrence's compatriot Merlene Ottey was awarded a bronze medal instead of fourth place. It is believed to be the first time in the modern history of the Games that an Olympic event will not have a gold medallist. ""The actual awarding of a gold medal, of any medal, is certainly not a right and therefore in this case it will not happen,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters. Adams underlined Thanou's more recent problems, notably evading anti-doping tests in 2004, in which, ""she disgraced herself."" ""It's felt that with her conduct she didn't deserve to be honored with this recognition,"" he said. Jones' 200m gold went to Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas with Sri Lanka's Susanthika Jayasinghe moving up into second and Jamaica's Beverly McDonald stepping onto the podium with bronze. Jones was stripped of all her medals she won nine years ago after admitting doping offences, and was sent to prison in the United States after lying to federal investigators.","The IOC have opted not to re-award the women's 100m gold medal from Sydney 2000 .

"(CNN) -- Olympic 1500 meter champion Rashid Ramzi has been stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for doping at the 2008 Beijing Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced. The Bahraini runner, his country's first Olympic champion, also faces a two-year ban from track and field. Moroccan-born Ramzi tested positive for CERA, an advanced version of the endurance-boosting hormone, EPO. The 29-year-old's disqualification means that Kenya's Asbel Kipruto Kiprop will be awarded gold, New Zealand's Nicolas Willis has been upgraded to silver and fourth-placed Frenchman Mehdi Baala will get bronze. Ramzi was one of five athletes who were caught out by a new test for CERA and all have been punished. The other medallist to test positive was Italian cyclist Davide Rebellin, who won silver in the individual road race. Also being sanctioned are German cyclist Stefan Schumacher, Greek 20km walker Athanasia Tsoumeleka and Croatian runner Vanja Perisic. Under IOC rules all five will be barred from the 2012 London Olympics. The IOC statement read: ""The samples were collected and tested at Games-time and were subject to further analysis earlier this year when a fully validated test to detect CERA became available. ""Originally, six athletes showed adverse analytical findings in their A samples. However, one athlete was not sanctioned due to the presence of CERA not being detected in her B sample."" Ramzi is the highest profile star to fall foul of the new test and agency reports said he would appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration in Sport. In 2005 he did the 800 and 1500m double at the 2005 world athletics championships, becoming the first man to do so at a global event since New Zealand legend Peter Snell in 1964. Ramzi originally competed for Morocco, but switched to cash-rich Bahrain in 2002 after joining their armed forces.","Bahrain's Rashid Ramzi stripped of Olympic 1500m gold from Beijing .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- From Fitzrovia to Covent Garden, London is embracing its charming -- and sometimes cheeky -- past. Every era, from the roaring '20s to the swinging '60s, is represented, with new takes on old-fashioned locales: chip and sweets shops, hidden Prohibition-style hangouts, even ballrooms. The shelves at Hope and Greenwood, in Covent Garden, are filled with glass jars brimming with British sweets. But rather than flaunt themselves as fusty Churchillian relics, these new spots are drawing stylish Bright Young Things who can't get enough of the city's collective nostalgia trip. They're celebrating inspired design, tastes and bygone lifestyles with zeal. At the forefront of London's retro renaissance: sugar. Behind a shiny strawberry-red façade in Covent Garden, British confectionary is experiencing a resurgence at Hope and Greenwood, a sweet 1950s-style candy store named after its sugar-loving owners. Glass jars and cut-crystal candy dishes that grandma would love brim with classic and all-but-disappeared ""pick and mix"" English candies -- Minty Humbugs, Raspberry Ruffles and Traffic Light Lollies. It's the kind of place that will even inspire adults on a strict diet to indulge in sweets (and sweet thoughts) of yesteryear. Travel + Leisure: See London's best retro spots . Over in the trendy, up-and-coming neighborhood of Marble Arch, Cocomaya is attracting followers with its jewel-like handcrafted chocolates tantalizingly displayed under glass domes on marble counter tops and antique mirrors. And places such as East End's Treacle are delighting locals and visitors alike with a return to the no-nonsense proper British teahouse, serving up comforting classics like Jammy Dodgers and buttercream cupcakes. Bourne & Hollingsworth (named after the department store that once existed on its site) is decidedly more adult; the quirky basement bar in Fitzrovia is tricked out to feel like grandma's -- complete with signature floral wallpaper and consciously stodgy décor.

Now a shadow of its former 1939 no-frills self, the newly renovated fish and chips shop is giving a lighter gourmet twist to an old London standby; golden, delicately fried cod and haddock is the restaurant's main event, supported by more elegant briny treats like raw oysters and classic shrimp cocktail.

"(CNN) -- La Liga leaders Barcelona returned to winning ways with a 3-0 home victory over Racing Santander on Saturday, extending their advantage over second-placed rivals Real Madrid to seven points. After an impressive unbeaten run in all competitions, Barcelona suffered their first defeat in 28 games midweek, losing 3-1 to Spanish second division side Real Betis in the second leg of their Copa del Rey clash, but going through 6-3 on aggregate. But it had been 28 years since Racing Santander had won a league game at the Camp Nou and having also lost seven of their last 10 away league matches, never looked likely to get the better of the reigning Spanish champions. Pep Guardiola's team was missing Brazil right back Daniel Alves as well as Jeffren Suarez of Spain -- who has been sidelined for five weeks with muscle tear in his left thigh -- but the absence of the two players did not hamper the Catalan giants. Which football league is the world's best? Spain forward Pedro put Barca ahead after just three minutes after a cross from international teammate David Villa. Argentina forward Lionel Messi made it 2-0 after 30 minutes easily putting a penalty past Racing goalkeeper Toño, awarded for a foul by Henrique on Villa. It was the brilliant Messi's 19th league goal of the season. Ten minutes after play resumed following half-time, Andres Iniesta got his name on the scorecard with Messi, Villa and Pedro combining to get the ball to the Spain midfielder, who duly made it 3-0. Barca's emphatic victory was reminiscent of their 3-0  away win over Racing in the opening game of the 2010/11 season. Unable to exact revenge, the Cantabrians are left just four points above the relegation zone. Real Madrid will be hoping to close the gap on Barcelona when they host Real  Mallorca on Sunday. Elsewhere in La Liga, Valencia moved above Villarreal into third with a last minute winner from Aritz Aduriz clinching a thrilling 4-3 win over nine-man Malaga. Malaga had Argentine defender Martin Demichelis sent off on 16 minutes for conceding a penalty, which Juan Mata converted, and central defender Helder Rosario red-carded in the 65th minute for dissent. Former Real Madrid star Julio Baptista, signed from Roma in the January transfer window, drew Malaga level at 3-3 with his first goal for the club on 79 minutes, but Aduriz struck in stoppage time to secure a vital three points. Sevilla moved to joint seventh place thanks to a 4-1 win over Levante. Brazil forward Louis Fabiano scored a hat-trick for the southern Spanish side, with French midfielder Julien Escude also finding the back of the net. Spaniard Xisco Munoz scored a consolation goal for Levante, but the Valencia-based team are now second from bottom of the table.","Barcelona defeat Racing Santander 2-0 to extend lead at top of La Liga .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The 2005 London bombings on three subway trains and a bus, which killed 52 people, could not have been prevented, according to an official report into the attacks released Tuesday. The wreck of a bus destroyed by a bomb in central London on July 7, 2005. Police and intelligence services did all they could to trace suspects and avert attacks given the resources, intelligence and evidence they had at the time, said the report by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which reports directly to the prime minister. ""It is a very shocking fact, and it's one we have to live with,"" said Kim Howells, a lawmaker who chairs the committee. Some 700 people were wounded in the bombings on July 7, 2005. All four bombers died in the blasts. The finding contradicts portions of the committee's 2006 report into the bombings, which said the chances of preventing the attacks could have been increased. Having additional resources in place might have alerted law enforcement agencies to the intentions of the July 7 bombers, the 2006 report said.  Watch what the new inquiry concludes » . But the report released Tuesday said it would have been impossible to trace every person connected to the plot. ""If you want complete coverage, you're going to have to have hundreds of thousands -- literally -- of security and intelligence officers, and that's not the society we live in,"" Howells said at a news conference. ""I'm afraid that it is an extremely uncomfortable fact."" Law enforcement agencies could not have simply shifted resources to cover areas that needed attention, the committee said, because other operations were deemed more urgent at the time and officers had to make ""hard choices"" about the suspects and leads it wanted to pursue. ""Hindsight is a wonderful thing,"" said committee member Michael Mates. ""Having gone into all the details, we can't find any reason to criticize the judgment they took at that time."" He added, ""I wish we could say it won't happen again, but we can't."" Resources are only part of the problem, the committee said. ""It is not simply a case of 'throwing money at the problem' -- MI5 operates under legal constraints, too,"" the report said. MI5 is Britain's domestic intelligence agency. ""MI5 must have good reason to investigate an individual before they are permitted to use intrusive techniques -- the law is designed to protect an individual's right to privacy."" Under the law, there was no reason for police to have followed some of the people now deemed to have been involved in the attacks. Surveillance or further investigation simply wasn't justified in the months before the attacks, said committee member George Howarth. ""With hindsight, we are now able to consider past events, connect them and understand what might have been happening. But this is only with the benefit of hindsight,"" the report said. Police coverage is now better than it was, Mates said, and he praised the British government for spending more on law enforcement and the security agencies for recruiting more staff. The committee did, however, criticize the communication between police and security services, just as the previous report did. It also criticized the record-keeping of MI5. It is the panel's most comprehensive report yet into the 2005 attacks. The committee looked at every detail that police and intelligence agents knew, including recordings, photographs, and records. It aimed to deliver a more complete report than the one issued in 2006, Howells said. The final result took more than 14 months to produce and ran to more than 100 pages. ""We appreciate that everyone wants to be reassured that there will never be another 7/7. Such an absolute assurance cannot be given,"" the report says. ""What our agencies can do is to build an intelligence network that gives them as much information as possible and then try and stop those that it comes across -- which is what they have been doing. But we must be realistic. Despite the increased efforts of the agencies, and the increased resources at their disposal, the odds are stacked against them.""","Report: Police and intelligence services did all they could to trace suspects .

"(CNN) -- World champion Casey Stoner is urging seven-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi to put a disappointing 2011 behind him and mount a serious challenge on his Ducati this season. Italian legend Rossi failed to win a race for the first time in his glittering career as his works bike was way off the pace of Stoner's all-conquering Honda. But Stoner knows that the public want to see close racing and Rossi taking his accustomed place on the podium. ""I'm hoping, for Ducati's sake, that they can put together a competitive bike this year because the championship needs it,"" the Australian told the official MotoGP website. ""Regardless of what the riders want, everyone needs as many manufacturers at the front as possible. Yamaha and Honda want competition; unfortunately Kawasaki and Suzuki are gone from the championship, so we need all bikes at the front."" Stoner doubled up on his 2007 title success as he claimed 10 victories last season to take the title off Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo and he sees the Spaniard as his main rival again in 2012. ""Jorge was first in 2010 and second in 2011, he will always be there fighting.

"(CNN) -- Monte Carlo is a millionaire's playground which has blended wealth and sophistication with the fast-paced thrills of motorsport since the early 20th century. Formula One has been a regular visitor to the principality since 1929, but rallying has returned this week after a three-year hiatus for the opening round of the 2012 world championship, with the sport's undisputed king Sebastien Loeb seeking an unprecedented ninth crown. So how important is Monte Carlo to rally and motorsport? ""It is very difficult to drive a train with no locomotive,"" Ruchdi Hajjar, director of the Automobile Club de Monaco told CNN. Hajjar said Monte Carlo's absence from the World Rally Championship was down to a disagreement with the sport's governing body over regulations which were introduced for the 2009 season. ""Due to the alternation of regulations, the Monte Carlo Rally had to leave the WRC in 2008. We were requested by the FIA to come back in 2012 which we did after obtaining some guarantees of changes in the regulations that we hardly believe in."" In those interim years, Monte Carlo served as the first round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) season, a championship aimed at developing young and amateur rally drivers. France's Loeb dominated the race prior to its spell away from WRC, claiming five wins in six years. ""The Monte Carlo rally has to be in the world championship,"" the Citroen driver said in quotes report by AFP. ""For me, it's a no-brainer. ""It is the world's most famous rally; you just can't have a world championship without it."" This year marks the 80th edition of the race in its current format, but rally driving in Monte Carlo dates back to 1911. Since then the Mediterranean port has become deeply entrenched in motorsport folklore. ""Indianapolis, Le Mans, Monza, Monaco F1 Grand Prix, Monte Carlo Rally, (these are) indestructible legends, pearls of the crown,"" Hajjar said. ""The rally and all other events organized by the Automobile Club participated in making Monaco one of the capital cities in motorsport."" This year's course spans 430 kilometers (267 miles) and comprises of 18 timed stages. Sunday's final stage will pit the three top-performing drivers against each other over 5.2 km in a ""Power Stage"" between Sainte Agnes and Col de la Madone. Loeb's Citroen teammate Mikko Hirvonen is thrilled to see the race return to WRC, although he admitted to having mixed feelings when he spoke ahead of the action getting under way. ""I have a kind of love and hate relationship with the rally,"" the 31-year-old Finn said. ""I mean I love it when I'm not there but when you're up in the mountains with the wrong tires doing icy downhill with the slick tire then I hate it. ""But it's a real challenge and I'm very happy to start the season over there."" After Monte Carlo, the WRC season moves to Sweden on February 9, with the world championship coming to a close in Spain on November 11.","The Monte Carlo Rally returned to the World Rally Championship this week .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The famous ""empty"" fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square is to be occupied by volunteers for 100 consecutive days, 24 hours a day, the artist Antony Gormley has announced. Marc Quinn's work ""Alison Lapper Pregnant"" caused a stir when it was unveiled on the fourth plinth. Since 2005 the Mayor of London's Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group has picked an artist or artists to fill the landmark space with a new piece. Gormley and Yinka Shonibare, whose scale replica of Nelson's ship, HMS Victory, will follow later in the year, were selected from a shortlist of six artists. What would you do on the plinth? Tell us . Gormley, renowned for iconic works which include ""The Angel of the North,"" Thursday announced his plans to encourage volunteers from around the UK to stand on the plinth. The work, titled ""One & Other,"" will run from July 6 to October 14 and involve 2,400 people who will stand on the plinth for an hour each. The volunteers can do anything they like on the plinth. Trafalqar Square, which is popular with tourists, is one of London's landmarks. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. Over the decades, the square has been the place where Londoners go to celebrate sporting victories or national occasions, as well as stage demonstrations. The fourth plinth is the only one not to hold a statue. Built in 1841, it was intended to hold a tribute to King William IV -- but fundraising efforts proved insufficient. Since then it has remained empty, despite arguments over the decades as to a worthy occupant. In 1999, it was decided that a rotating series of artworks should occupy the plinth. Pieces to have occupied the space in the past have included a life-size statue of Jesus, an inverted replica of the plinth and a colored glass hotel for the square's famed pigeons. Gormley said the idea behind his piece was very simple. ""Through putting a person onto the plinth, the body becomes a metaphor, a symbol. In the context of Trafalgar Square with its military, valedictory and male historical statues, this elevation of everyday life to the position formerly occupied by monumental art allows us to reflect on the diversity, vulnerability and particularity of the individual in contemporary society. ""It's about people coming together to do something extraordinary and unpredictable. It could be tragic but it could also be funny,"" Gormley said. London mayor Boris Johnson said it was a fantastic idea. ""It's going to be a brilliant case of people coming to art and art coming to the people as the people become the art. A very public demonstration of democracy in action."" Ekow Eshun, chair of the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, said Gormley's idea was ""outstanding."" ""(It's) a bold, arresting work that reflects on the multi-faceted nature of modern Britain."" Applications will be taken from April, with the winning volunteers randomly selected.","Public get chance to stand on London landmark for 100 days .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Protesters threw bricks and bottles Friday at police outside a mosque in London after about 1,000 people showed up to counter a planned a right-wing demonstration there, police said. Police arrest a protestor in Harrow, London, after fighting broke out at a planned right-wing demonstration. One person was arrested ""to prevent a breach of the peace,"" police said in a statement. The right-wing demonstration's organizer, Stop Islamisation of Europe (SIOE), said on its Web site one of the demonstration's planners had been arrested. Seven other people were arrested during the melee for possession of ""offensive weapons"" -- including bottles of bleach, a hammer and a chisel, police said. Police said incidents at the scene began when the crowd -- believed to be either members of an anti-fascism group or there to provide support to the Harrow Central Mosque -- went after three youths, ""caught up with them, and assaulted them,"" police said. ""Police had to intervene to prevent the crowd from continuing with their attack."" It was not immediately known if the youths were affiliated with any political group. Police said they had identified and stopped a number of people believed to be heading to the right-wing protest prior to the demonstration's start time, preventing them from reaching the area. It was not immediately known how many, if any, of the group's supporters had successfully arrived outside the mosque. ""One person was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace as police believed if the SIOE demonstration started it would have resulted in serious disorder,"" police said. The group said on its Web site that the demonstration had been called off and that Stephen Gash, listed as one of the group's contacts, had been arrested ""to prevent a breach of the peace."" ""If you are on your way to the demo, don't go, it's being called off right now,"" the post read. ""The police can't handle the muslim counter demonstrators [sic].""

"A controversial British politician convicted of inciting racial hatred could soon be sipping tea with Queen Elizabeth at one of her annual garden parties. British National Party leader Nick Griffin, right, pictured in August last year at a party political event. Nick Griffin is the leader of the British National Party, a right-wing group that opposes immigration and wants Britain to withdraw from the European Union. The party said Griffin will attend the queen's July 21 garden party at Buckingham Palace as a guest of Richard Barnbrook, an elected BNP member of the London Assembly . But pressure was mounting Thursday for Barnbrook to pick someone else. ""Unless Mr. Barnbrook brings a more acceptable guest along and doesn't turn it into a political stunt, the invitation will be rescinded,"" Assembly Chairman Darren Johnson said. Johnson spoke after London Mayor Boris Johnson asked him to intervene in Barnbrook's plans, the assembly said in a news release. ""We cannot tolerate any such abuse of the invitation or any potential embarrassment to Her Majesty,"" the mayor wrote in a letter opposing Barnbrook's choice of guest. Griffin was convicted of inciting racial hatred in 1998, a London court official said. He was ordered to serve nine months in prison, a sentence that was suspended for two years, the court official added. Griffin was elected leader of the BNP the following year and re-elected in 2007, according to the party. Queen Elizabeth hosts at least three garden parties every summer at Buckingham Palace as a way to reward and recognize public service. About 8,000 people attend each one, Buckingham Palace says. People are invited on the recommendation of local and national organizations, which are given a quota of tickets, the palace says. In this case, Barnbrook was in line to receive an invitation because he is a recently elected member of the London Assembly, which was allocated a certain number of seats, the assembly said. The palace said it has not yet sent out any invitations. Asked about Griffin's possible attendance at a garden party, a palace spokesman indicated a guest would be refused only if he is judged to be a direct threat to security. ""The queen does not scrutinize and is not consulted on the list of accompanying guests, as they are official guests and not personal invitations,"" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named in line with policy. ""Buckingham Palace relies entirely on the nominating organizations"" to compile their guest lists, the palace spokesman added. Spokespeople for the London Assembly said at issue was not Barnbrook's invitation, because he is entitled to receive one as an elected member of the local government. ""The bone of contention here is his choice of person to accompany him,"" said an assembly spokesman, who asked not to be identified in line with policy. Barnbrook dismissed ""hysteria"" over the issue as a ""to-do and a hoot."" In comments on the party's Web site, Barnbrook said that if he had the chance to speak with the queen at the party, he would raise the issue of knife crime education among children. ""I would also like to wish her a very happy summer and sample some of her famous tea and clotted cream, which I hope comes from her son's estate in Cornwall,"" Barnbrook said. Garden parties have been held at Buckingham Palace since Queen Victoria began them in the 1860s, the palace says. The queen and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, circulate among the guests so that everyone has an equal chance of speaking to a member of the royal family, the palace says. Guests are served tea and refreshments from long buffet tables and ""the quantities served are enormous,"" the palace says. At a typical garden party, around 27,000 cups of tea, 20,000 sandwiches and 20,000 slices of cake are consumed. A staff of about 400 will serve guests, according to the palace.","London mayor asks assembly member not to take BNP leader Nick Griffin to party .

"(CNN) -- Nasser Al-Attiyah kept his Dakar Rally title defense alive as he clawed back almost eight minutes in winning Saturday's seventh stage in Chile. The Qatari driver is still more than 42 minutes behind leader Stephane Peterhansel in sixth place overall, having lost significant time to the Frenchman's Mini in the opening stage of 14 and then on Thursday. But his surging form in the Hummer, passing five drivers in the second half of the 419-kilometer special in and around Copiapo, has given him hope that all is not over going into Sunday's halfway rest day. ""The car worked perfectly well today and we attacked from the beginning to the end of the special. We took a lot of risks to set the best time,"" the 41-year-old said, having lost a stage when Friday's leg from Fiambala in Argentina was called off due to snow in the Andes. ""Our objective is to claw back seven or eight minutes every day. And today we did it perfectly. We will do our best to repeat this performance in all stages from Monday onwards, or even try to do better."" Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 due to security problems in Africa. He has a lead of 11 minutes and 22 seconds over Mini teammate Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland, who was fifth last year. The 46-year-old was third in Saturday's stage, seven minutes clear of Holowczyc and 23 seconds behind Hummer's American Robby Gordon. Gordon, an experienced NASCAR driver, is third overall -- 13 minutes off the pace after finishing 7:30 behind his teammate. Motorbike champion Marc Coma moved to within eight minutes of leader Cyril Despres after shaving 2:03 off the Frenchman's advantage on Saturday. The Spaniard triumphed in the sand dunes to keep alive his hopes of a fourth title for the KLM team. ""It is common knowledge that the stage before the rest day is always difficult, and today was not an exception, with stifling heat and very soft sand,"" Coma said. ""Nevertheless, we rode very fast and I was able to attack. We know the strategy well, so we are aware that I will probably gain two minutes one day, then Cyril will gain two minutes the next... And it is hard to change this when there is but one road."" Despres, also a three-time winner on bikes, admitted he had lapsed in concentration. ""I was a bit lazy today, since Marc led the race from km 200 onwards, the start of the second special, but I think that is also part of the race. So I thank him for this,"" he said. ""There is always a strategic aspect, since we know we can control two-minute gaps. Having said that, I finished with my hands paralyzed, but it was a really beautiful special with beautiful dunes.""","Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah wins Saturday's seventh stage of the Dakar Rally .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dick Clark, the music impresario and host of ""American Bandstand"" who died this week, has been cremated, his representative said Friday. ""He has been cremated, but no other plans have been finalized,"" Clark publicist Paul Shefrin told CNN. Clark, 82, suffered a heart attack Wednesday while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California, for an outpatient procedure, Shefrin said. Attempts to resuscitate Clark were unsuccessful, he said. As the host of the popular ""American Bandstand,"" Clark shaped American tastes in music trends, and with a fresh-scrubbed, boy-next-door persona, he introduced the world to likes of Buddy Holly and James Brown. Your memories of Dick Clark . In December 2004, Clark suffered what was then described as ""a mild stroke,"" just months after announcing he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve"" specials. He appeared briefly as a co-host with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2005. Born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, New York, on November 30, 1929, he began his broadcast career working at a radio station managed by his father. Clark's ""American Bandstand"" began as a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956. The show was picked up by ABC and broadcast nationally a year later. By 1958, it was the show to watch, with 40 million viewers tuning in to learn about the latest in music. ""If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet,"" singer Aretha Franklin told CNN's ""AC360."" The savvy entrepreneur was a pioneer in introducing African-American groups and other performers to millions of young TV viewers. His audiences were among the first integrated on television. In 1960, the Ku Klux Klan sent death threats to Clark when he brought his short-lived ""American Bandstand"" spinoff ""The Dick Clark Show"" to Atlanta. The National Guard was called in to protect the show and its integrated audience -- black and white teens. CNN's Alan Duke, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Formula One's all-conquering Red Bull team announced on Thursday that Swiss Sebastien Buemi will serve as their reserve and test driver for the 2012 season. Buemi will provide back-up for Red Bull's current pairing of double world champion Sebastian Vettel and Australian Mark Webber. The 23-year-old spent three years with Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso, but was dropped by the Italy-based outfit ahead of the forthcoming campaign. ""It's good to remain with Red Bull for another year and have this opportunity with the world championship-winning team,"" Buemi told the sport's official website. ""I would prefer to be driving at the races of course, but working with Red Bull on the development of their car and providing them with feedback throughout the season is the next best thing."" Buemi finished 15th in the drivers' standings last season with 15 points, 11 points adrift of his Spanish teammate Jaime Alguersuari. His best finishes in 2011 came at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and in Hungary, where he finished eighth on both occasions. The 2012 Formula One season will begin with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18. Meanwhile, Frenchman Cyril Despres won Thursday's fifth motorcycle stage of the Dakar Rally, ahead of Spanish rival Marc Coma, to consolidate his overall lead. Despres won the 184km stage to Fiambala in Argentina by one minute 41 seconds from Coma and now has a 9:51 lead over his fellow-KTM rider. In the car section, Qatar's defending champion Nasser al-Attiyah lost more than 20 minutes after his Hummer overheated, with Mini driver Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland winning the stage. Holowczyc finished just over a minute ahead of American Remy Gordon with overall leader Stephane Peterhansel back in third. The result means Peterhansel now leads Holowczyc by 4:18 in the standings while al-Attiyah has dropped to eighth place overall, over 50 minutes down on the leader.","Swiss driver Sebastien Buemi will serve as Red Bull's reserve and test driver in 2012 .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece will hold new elections in response to a political stalemate that left the debt-racked country unable to form a government, the office of President Karolos Papoulias said Tuesday. The announcement comes as the Greek debt crisis threatens the stability of the European Union's single currency. Papoulias has called for all parties to meet with him Wednesday to set up a caretaker government that will conduct the new vote, his office said. Greece has been in a political deadlock since elections nine days ago left no party with a majority. The leaders of three different parties have tried to cobble together a workable coalition, but all have failed. That leaves Greece facing another vote, probably in mid-June. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe has watched with a nervous eye, fearing Greece could fail to make debt payments as early as next month. And that could force the country out of the euro, the currency used by 17 European Union countries. Markets across Europe fell slightly on the news of political talks breaking up Tuesday. The Dow was flat in New York in morning trading. The collapse of Greek talks came as France's new president, Francois Hollande, met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel hours after his inauguration, and as European finance ministers met in Brussels, Belgium. What if Greece exits the eurozone? The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have been pumping money into Greece to keep the country in the euro, but they have demanded that the Greek government slash spending to get the funds. When angry voters went to the polls on May 6, they punished politicians who imposed the austerity measures, greatly reducing the number of seats held by the center-right New Democracy party and the Socialist PASOK party. Radical leftist leader Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party reaped the benefits of voter frustration with austerity, urged Greeks on Tuesday to continue resisting ""the parties of the bailout."" ""They asked us to leave the country without any hope,"" he said, arguing that the May 6 election had left the terms of the bailout ""null and void."" New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, meanwhile, said his party would ""keep fighting for a developing Greece within Europe"" and ""against those who say they want to get Greece out of Europe."" His party narrowly came in first in the May 6 elections, but opinion polls since then have suggested that Syriza would finish in first place in a new election. Analysts have warned that Greece must not remain without a government for long. ""If no government is in place before June when the next installment (of loan money) from the European Union and International Monetary Fund is due, we estimate that Greece will run out of money sometime between the end of June and beginning of July, at which point a return to the drachma would seem inevitable,"" Bank of America/Merrill Lynch wrote in a report released Friday. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","Radical left leader Alexis Tsipras says bailout terms are ""null and void""

"(CNN) -- A flat tire saw Stéphane Peterhansel's lead in the Dakar Rally cut to seven and a half minutes by American Bobby Gordon who finished second behind stage eight winner Nani Roma. Peterhansel suffered a puncture 30km from the end of the stage between Copiapo and Antofagasta and saw his overall lead whittled down to seven minutes 36 seconds by Gordon. The American lost out to Roma, from Spain, by just five seconds and is still awaiting his first stage win in the 2012 rally. Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah, from Qatar, was disrupted by technical problems and had to stop on several occasions. He now trails Peterhansel by over 45 minutes. Pole Krzysztof Hołowczyc is third, 12 seconds behind Gordon and 7 minutes 48 secs behind the leader. Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 but he didn't enjoy his best stage on Monday. He told the Dakar Rally's official website: ""I am losing loads of time. I drove quite slowly in the rocky parts because I was scared of punctures. And despite this... I had one 30 km from the finish. It was a bad special, but that is the way it is. ""Gordon started three minutes before us, and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him. I think that when he saw us he stepped it up, leaving us in the dust. ""He can win this thing, so it is essential for him to manage this situation as well as he can."" Defending motorcycle champion Marc Coma sealed the 20th stage win of his Dakar Rally career as rival Cyril Despres got stuck in the mud. Stage eight saw Coma, from Spain, snatch the lead from the Frenchman and build a lead of one minute and 26 seconds. Despres spent ten minutes trying to extricate himself from a patch of mud and cut a frustrated figure at the end of the stage. He said: ""There was a torrent of mud between the inspection of the reconnaissance car two days ago and today. Therefore, it did not appear in the road book and I was the first to fall into the trap. ""There was no way I could have avoided it. I am awaiting the organisers' decision: after Ullevalseter, Gonçalves and a few others had gone through, they took a detour, otherwise there would have been 200 vehicles trapped in the mud.

"(CNN) -- Juan Roma won the third stage of the Dakar Rally in Argentina Tuesday as Mini teammate Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland took the lead in the overall standings. It was the second stage win on the endurance rally for the team, with Roma coming home one minute and nine seconds ahead of the race leader at the end of the 208km leg from San Rafael to San Juan. In the motorcycle section France's three-time champion Cyril Despres took command on their longer 270km special to claim a decisive victory and take the overall lead. Despres, who made a poor start to the 14-day race, took more than 13 minutes off KTM teammate and defending champion Marc Coma of Spain, who trailed home seventh. Dutch rider Frans Verhoeven took second with Portugal's Paulo Goncalves in third.

"(CNN) -- America's Robby Gordon scored a convincing victory in the 12th stage of the Dakar Rally in Peru Friday. Gordon, driving a Hummer, finished over 15 minutes clear of Russia's Leonid Novotskiy, in a Mini, with Ginel De Villliers of South Africa (Toyota) in third. He recorded a time of two hours 14 minutes and 32 seconds for the 245km timed section of the leg from from Arequipa to Nasca, much of it over sand dunes and awkward terrain. Race leader Stephane Petherhansel of France in his Mini lost time by being stuck in the dunes, but came home sixth. He leads second-placed Nani Roma of Spain, also driving a Mini, by over 20 minutes with two days to go. NASCAR star Gordon is fourth overall, but faces disqualification for an infringement of the rules on Wednesday's stage which he is appealing. Rally row: Does the Dakar damage the environment? Peterhansel, who has won the motorcycle section six times, is bidding for a fourth win in the cars and has Roma as his main rival. Third-placed De Villiers is over an hour back in the overall standings. Meanwhile, Spain's Marc Coma reclaimed the overall lead in the motorcycle section with victory on the stage, leapfrogging France's Cyril Despres for first place. It was a superb ride from the KTM star, who led home compatriots Joan Barreda Bort, on a Husqvarana, and KTM teammate Jordi Viladoms. Despres finished fourth on the leg and trails the Coma by one minute 35 seconds overall in a titanic battle. The new leader was delighted with his performance on the stage. ""It was a difficult day. I set off four minutes after Cyril (Despres) and I managed to catch up with him. ""It's no way near over, because there's another big stage tomorrow,"" he told the official race website.

"(CNN) -- The United States' hopes of reaching the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals for the first time were dashed in New Zealand on Tuesday, after a 27-10 defeat to Italy. The bonus-point win was crucial for Italy's bid to qualify for the last eight, with the Azzurri now facing a winner-takes-all clash with Pool C leaders Ireland in Dunedin on Sunday. Two-time world champions Australia can go top of the table with victory over winless tournament debutants Russia on Saturday. ""We are happy because we took the five points,"" captain Sergio Parisse, who is hoping to lead Italy into the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time, told the tournament's official website. ""It was the important thing for us. We scored four tries, so that's important. Now we're looking forward to our last match against Ireland with a lot of confidence. It was a difficult match for us and now we're ready to take the maximum against the Irish."" Italy, under the guidance of former South Africa coach Nick Mallett, flew out of the blocks in Nelson as Parisse scored the game's first try after just two minutes. But the U.S. responded through fullback Chris Wyles, who converted his own try to level at 7-7. The fightback stung Italy into action, and tries from flyhalf Luciano Orquera and prop Martin Castrogiovanni ensured a 20-10 halftime scoreline. The vital fourth score came as Italy's powerful scrum earned a penalty try for the second time this tournament, which back-row forward Mauro Bergamasco converted. ""We are good in the tight play, so why shouldn't we be able to use it?"" prop Andrea Lo Cicero said. ""Why shouldn't we be able to profit from it? Why should others profit from being weak in the scrum?"" In Tuesday's other match, Japan and Canada played out a 23-23 draw in Napier -- only the third in the World Cup's 24-year history. Japan's Brave Blossoms looked set to record their first victory at the four-yearly tournament since overcoming Zimbabwe in 1991, but, despite leading from the 24th minute to the 79th, were denied by a late penalty from Canada flyhalf Ander Monro. The draw eliminated Japan, while Canada will need to record a shock bonus-point win over hosts New Zealand on Sunday and hope second-placed France fail to pick up a point against Tonga in order to advance. Canada's South Africa-born center DTH van der Merwe scored the contest's first try after five minutes, before Japan responded with tries from hooker Shota Horie and wing Kosuke Endo and a penalty from New Zealand-born James Arlidge to claim a 17-7 halftime lead. Wing Phil Mackenzie scored a superb solo try to bring Canada back into the contest three minutes after the restart, before Arlidge looked to have made the match safe for Japan with two more penalties. But Monro saved the day for Canada by crossing Japan's line for a 75th-minute try before kicking a last-minute penalty.","U.S. eliminated from the Rugby World Cup after Tuesday's defeat to Italy .

"(CNN) -- New Zealand woke up to a giant collective hangover Monday as the rugby-mad nation savored its triumph in the World Cup final in Auckland. No matter the 8-7 final win over France was more notable for perspiration than inspiration, the All Blacks had finally laid a 24-year-old hoodoo since their victory in the first-ever World Cup in New Zealand in 1987. Despite being the No.1 ranked international team for most of the intervening years, success on the ultimate stage eluded successive All Blacks teams. The nadir perhaps was the failure of the 2007 team, who fell victim to an inspired French team in Cardiff in the quarterfinals. But also long in the memory were defeats in the 1995 final to South Africa and semifinal defeats in 1999 and 2003. But Graham Henry's men, badly missing the influence and the accurate boot of injured fly-half Dan Carter, held on for a one-point win in the lowest scoring final in the tournament's history. Blog: Are formidable France owed an apology? For four million New Zealanders, the manner of the victory mattered not a jot, a welcome diversion in a year which began with the Christchurch earthquake disaster and continued with a mining disaster and nasty oil spill in the Bay of Plenty. After the final at Eden Park, New Zealand were named team of the year in the International Rugby Board annual awards and Henry was coach of the year. Player of the year was the French captain Thierry Dusautoir, who did his best to spoil the All Blacks' party with his second half try. On Monday, captain Richie McCaw his team paraded the William Webb Ellis Trophy through the streets of Auckland on an open top bus with an estimated crowd of 200,0000 in attendance. Similar celebrations are planned for Christchurch and Wellington on Tuesday and Wednesday.","A massive crowd in Auckland celebrates Rugby World Cup triumph .

"(CNN) -- Call it ""Occupy Facebook."" Or, perhaps, ""UnOccupy Facebook."" Hoping to capitalize on frustrations with the social networking giant, not to mention some of the anti-corporate sentiment bubbling up on Wall Street and beyond, entrepreneurs have launched an upstart site called Unthink. The Tampa, Florida-based startup wants to be everything that Facebook and rival Google+ are not -- and it has the manifesto and sassy YouTube video to prove it. ""I couldn't wait to tell my story. I couldn't believe that all this was free,"" says an actress in the video, strutting through Bohemian city streets in an off-the-shoulder T-shirt with the words ""Wild and Free"" scrawled on it. ""But I never knew that I'd be part of some damn puppet show -- that you thought you could own me. Well, you can't own me!"" Later, she confronts a guy in a Google+ T-shirt and another hoodie-wearing character with a striking resemblance to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The video is part of a series of hype-building efforts, along with cryptic news releases promising a ""secret project"" and ""social revolution,"" that preceded Tuesday's limited launch. Opened for invite-only beta testing on Tuesday, Unthink says it will offer an alternative to the privacy concerns some people have about using Facebook or Google's new rival network. Facebook and Google both collect information about users to tailor advertising to them. Privacy concerns have cropped up over various features Facebook has rolled out -- from mobile check-ins to integration with other websites that can make a user's online behavior more public if settings aren't tweaked. Unthink promises that, under its terms of use, all content will remain the property of the user. After signing up, an app lets users transfer photos and other info from Facebook to the new site. ""We worked hard for more than three years to research people's needs and present them with a solution that will empower them,"" Unthink CEO and founder Natasha Dedis said on the company's website. ""Our mission is to emancipate social media and unleash people's extraordinary potential. Our -- not so covert -- mission is to spark a social revolution. We believe in people."" Dedis said she had the idea for the site when her son wanted to join Facebook and she read what she called the site's oppressive terms of use. According to TechCrunch, the site is bankrolled with about $2.5 million in investments from venture capitalists. And its business model for fighting the corporate social-media giants? Corporate sponsorships. The site will let users either pick a participating business (presumably one they like) to ""sponsor"" their page or pay a $2 annual fee for the service. Through much of Wednesday, after tech blogs began reporting on it, pulling up the Unthink site delivered an ""over capacity"" message. Unthink isn't the first startup that has hoped to capitalize on anti-Facebook sentiment. Last spring, Diaspora raised $200,000 on crowd-funding site Kickstarter to develop a decentralized networking site. But more than a year and a half later, only an unfinished alpha version has been rolled out and, last month, developers sent out a plea for more money to people who have already signed up. The question, of course, is whether there's any appetite for yet another social networking platform in a landscape dominated by Facebook, with its 800 million users, and to a lesser extent, Twitter. Even Google has struggled to pull users away from Facebook where, despite complaints, users have appeared willing to deal with occasional privacy concerns in return for a convenient online hangout populated by all their friends. But if even a small percentage of those users choose to abandon ship for the ""revolution,"" it may be enough for Unthink to declare victory.","New ""Unthink"" social networking site lets users own their content .

"(CNN) -- Scores of protesters gathered outside a Sudanese courtroom Tuesday as the trial of a woman who faces 40 lashes for wearing clothes deemed indecent was postponed. Lubna al-Hussein was told she had pants considered too tight and a blouse too transparent. Lubna al-Hussein, who says she was arrested for wearing pants that were too tight, faces a new trial date of September 7, her attorney Nadil Adib said. The delay was to allow the judge to consult Sudan's Foreign Ministry on whether al-Hussein is immune from the charges because she was formerly a U.N. employee, he said. Al-Hussein -- who writes for a newspaper and worked for the media department of the United Nations mission in Sudan -- resigned from her U.N. position to deliberately lose immunity and face the charges. She was ""disappointed"" with the court's decision to delay her trial, Adib said. ""She wanted to have her case tried in order to clear her name and have the law announced unconstitutional,"" he said. Al-Hussein was arrested along with 18 other women on July 3 at a Khartoum restaurant after police burst in and checked women for their clothing. ""I don't think she was targeted specifically,"" Adib said. ""They attack public and private parties and groups. They are called 'morality police' and she was just a victim of a round-up."" At the time of her arrest, al-Hussein said she was wearing pants that police deemed too tight, a blouse they said was too sheer. She said she was also wearing a hijab -- or headscarf. Protesters gathered outside the courtroom in Khartoum Tuesday to support al-Hussein, carrying banners and wearing headbands with the messages, ""No return to the dark ages"" and ""No to suppressing women."" Others demanded an amendment to the country's public order law which human rights activists say is vague on what constitutes indecent dress. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply concerned about al-Hussein's case. ""The United Nations will make every effort to ensure that the rights of its staff members are protected,"" Ban said. ""The flogging is against the international human rights standards. I call on all parties to live up to their obligations under all relevant international instruments."" Al-Hussein told the British Broadcasting Corporation that she wants a public flogging to make a point about the treatment of women in Sudan. She even sent out 500 invitations to witness her lashings. ""I'm not afraid from pain ... but flog is not pain, flog is (an) insult, insult to humans, insult to women,"" al-Hussein told the BBC. ""This happened in Khartoum and under the eye ... of media and all over the world ... to girl from Khartoum for only wearing trousers and sit in a restaurant,"" she said. ""I want people (to) imagine that. What can be happening to women in Darfur? This is my message.""

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button underlined the potential strength of the McLaren-Mercedes in 2012 with a convincing victory in the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, Melbourne, the opening race of the new Formula One season. Button had a quicker start than teammate and fellow-Briton Lewis Hamilton, who was on pole position, and never looked likely to relinquish his advantage, despite the intervention of the safety car giving some brief hope to world champion Sebastian Vettel. Vettel overtook Hamilton after the safety car was deployed on lap 38 when the Caterham of Vitaly Petrov stalled on the track and, for a moment, the German's Red Bull threatened to catch Button. Latest Formula One standings . But 2009 champion Button began pulling away once again and took the chequered flag a comfortable 2.1 seconds ahead of Vettel, with Hamilton a further 1.9 seconds adrift in third position. Vettel's teammate, local favorite Mark Webber, ensured McLaren and Red Bull took the first four places, while two-time world champion Fernando Alonso produced a superb drive to finish fifth for Ferrari, despite starting a lowly 12th on the grid. Japan's Kamui Kobayashi finished an impressive sixth for Sauber while 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen came home seventh in his Lotus on his return to the sport after two years in rallying. The second Sauber of Mexican Sergio Perez finished eighth while Daniel Ricciardo ensured both Australian drivers ended up in the points by securing ninth place for Toro Rosso, just ahead of Force India's Paul Di Resta. Button, who has now won at Melbourne in three of the last four years, told the official Formula One website: ""Every win means a lot and, for us as a team, it really shows how important the winter is. ""We've had a strong winter, Saturday's qualifying really showed that, so it's nice to come away with a victory in the first race of the new season."" Vettel, who is bidding to win a third successive world title, was philosophical in defeat, adding: ""Jenson drove a fantastic race and was unbeatable, but I'm very happy to finish second, it's a lot of points.

"(CNN)  -- In many cases it's a woman that grips the blade -- maybe clean, maybe dirty -- that cuts a girl's path to womanhood. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni wants to ban the practice of female circumcision in his country. The cutter, who works for a fee, can pursue any number of surgical options for the young girl's rite of passage. She can remove the girl's clitoris entirely, narrow her vagina with stitches, or make other excisions of the girl's genitalia. A traditional symbol of a child's maturity to womanhood, the girl undergoes a circumcision. Often without an anesthetic, she feels every slice. And sometimes girls that become women under the knife die under it, too. In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni wants to outlaw female circumcision, and those that continue to perform the bloody practice would face the death penalty if a girl dies as a result of the procedure, Press Secretary Tamale Mirundi told CNN Wednesday. ""If a girl dies during circumcision that would be murder,"" Mirundi said. ""The punishment for murder in Uganda is death. You will be hanged."" Museveni's move to ban female circumcision is in line with other countries and organizations that have sought to decrease the prevalence of female circumcision, also known as female genital cutting or female genital mutilation. The practice involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and creates scar tissue that can cause complications during labor. But in nearby Kenya and Tanzania, where female genital mutilation is illegal, the practice is still rampant because people are not sensitized to the health consequences of circumcision and laws are not enforced, said Godfrey Odongo, an Amnesty International Uganda researcher. While Amnesty International does not support the death penalty, Odongo said the group wants to see Uganda ban the practice. He worries it won't be done, though, because Uganda has a ""mixed"" track record on enacting laws to protect women, he said. Mirundi, however, said he thinks that with the president's support behind it, Uganda's parliament will outlaw the ancient ritual. Rooted in paternalistic culture and practiced for centuries, female circumcision in Uganda is thought to protect a girl's chastity by ""reducing the urge for sex in women,"" Mirundi said. In Uganda, female genital mutilation is popular among tribes that live near the eastern border with Kenya, Mirundi said. He said he does not know how many female circumcisions have occurred in Uganda nor how many girls have died from them. The Sabini and Karamajong tribes are the primary adherents to the custom of female circumcision, he said. The tribes, he said, make up less than 10 percent of the country's population, which the World Bank estimated at 29.9 million in 2006. The World Health Organization estimates that 100 million to 140 million girls and women have been circumcised. Another 3 million girls are at risk of being circumcised each year, the organization says. The practice is extremely painful and traumatizing, and can result in prolonged bleeding, a higher risk of HIV infection, infertility and even death, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. The cultural practice occurs in parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and in some immigrant communities in Europe and North America, with the majority of those who have undergone the procedure living in 28 countries across Africa, according to the United Nations Population Fund. Mostly women perform the circumcisions on girls ranging in age from infancy to 15, the U.N. Children's Fund said. In some cultures, women endure repeated circumcisions. Those that do the cutting in Uganda earn an income on the procedure, Mirundi said. What once was done for free and deemed a privilege to perform now rakes in less than $1 per girl, Mirundi said. Even for a country that the World Bank reported as having 53 percent of people living on $1.25 or less a day, ""It was not big money,"" he said. ""Poverty is quite a big factor and directly intrinsically linked to the economic interest [in female circumcision],"" Odongo said. Museveni proposes to distribute money to the practitioners to give them financial support until they find other work, Mirundi said. The money could come in the form of a low-interest rate loan, he said. Governments and local leaders must promote other ways to earn an income to successfully outlaw female circumcision, said U.N. Population Fund spokesman Abubakar Dungus. Tribal leaders, especially, must insist on alternatives to the cutting ceremony, such as gifts, he said. While referred to as a rite of passage, the cutting also subjugates women to a chastity reinforced by scars and a culture that dictates that circumcised girls are more attractive to prospective husbands. ""Very often it's the mother of the girl who takes her daughter to be cut. You know the reason?"" Dungus asked. ""Because she feels, 'Oh my god, my daughter won't get a husband if I don't cut her."" Soraya Mire's mother took her to be circumcised when she was 13. The Somalia native said she felt ""tricked into it by a person that was supposed to protect me -- my own mother."" Mire, now 47, in 1994 released a movie detailing the practice, ""Fire Eyes."" When the activist heard that Museveni wants to outlaw female circumcision, it brought back memories of her own experience of being ""stitched like a curtain,"" she said. ""I thought of my first pain as a child of 13 and realizing this was not really love; this was not a gift of womanhood,"" she said. Mire, who received corrective surgery and has helped other women get corrective surgery, is writing a memoir about her trials as a ""survivor"" of female genital mutilation and the struggles to reconcile with a family that shunned her after she spoke out against the practice. She said that speaking out against female circumcision is not a betrayal of culture, it is a public acknowledgment of what is right and what is wrong. For Museveni, it is a movement toward modernity. ""You must grow out of that culture that is not supported by scientific information,"" Museveni says in a statement posted on his Web site.","Ugandan president wants to outlaw performing genital mutilation .
Circumcision is symbol of female child's maturity to womanhood in some cultures .
Under ban, if girl dies during circumcision, cutter would face hanging .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso has slammed Formula One's rules on car testing, describing the regulations as like asking footballers to train with tennis balls or tennis stars to play with bats. The two-time world champion questioned the wisdom of the current rules, which allows one three-day in-season test in addition to a number of officially sanctioned pre-season tests. The Spaniard, who won the drivers' championship in 2005 and 2006, said there was only so much a team could learn from using computer simulators, explaining that some drivers look elsewhere in a bid for much-needed practice. ""How much a new technical component can deliver in terms of performance remains a question mark after being tried out only on the simulator,"" the 30-year-old told a press conference at Ferrari's annual Wroom media event. ""F1 is one of the very few sports in which training is forbidden ... It's like telling Lionel Messi to train with a little tennis ball or Rafael Nadal to play with a ping-pong bat...We go karting because we have no alternative."" The restrictions on testing mean some drivers turn to other motorsport disciplines, with Poland's Robert Kubica suffering compound fractures to his right elbow, shoulder and leg in a rallying accident last February. Kubica missed the whole of the 2011 season due to the crash and suffered a further setback on Wednesday when it was announced that he had broken his right leg during a fall at his home in Italy. The 27-year-old had already ruled out a comeback in time for the start of the 2012 world championship, with his former team Renault, now known as Lotus, recruiting an all-new driver line-up of 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen and Frenchman Romain Grosjean. But the recently renamed marque's principal, Eric Boullier, took the time to praise Kubica's courage and wish him a speedy recovery. ""Robert has shown fantastic courage and determination in his rehabilitation following the accident last year,"" Boullier told the team's official website. ""It is sad to hear that he has suffered this setback. On behalf of everyone at Lotus Renault GP, I would like to wish Robert a quick recovery."" Before news of Kubica's latest injury emerged, Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali had been discussing the possibility of the former Sauber driver joining the Italian outfit as a replacement for Brazilian Felipe Massa. The future of Massa, who joined Ferrari in 2006, has been the subject of widespread speculation after a disappointing 2011 season saw him finish sixth in the drivers' standings. Domenicali described Kubica as a great driver, but stopped short of confirming or denying Ferrari's interest in him. ""Robert is a great driver, but he had very severe injuries and he is still working hard just to get back to normal living,"" he said. ""We need to wait and see. That kind of injury takes a long time to recover from."" The 2012 F1 season will begin on March 18 with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. Meanwhile, Thursday's 11th stage of the Dakar Rally saw both overall leaders consolidate their advantages with victories in the 478km leg from Arica in Chile to Arequipa in Peru. Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel finished three minutes 44 seconds ahead of Nani Roma of Spain in the car section and now leads his fellow-Mini driver by 22 minutes and 49 seconds. American Robby Gordon's challenge finally ended, as more problems with his Hummer meant he limped home nearly two hours behind to slip to fourth place overall and completely out of contention barring a miracle. Another Frenchman, Cyril Despres, extended his lead to 2:22 over fellow-KTM rider and defending champion Marc Coma in the motorcycle section, after his fourth stage victory. Despres came home 1:39 ahead of Gerard Farres Guell, with Coma back in third place, although the gap is still comparatively small with three stages still remaining.","Ferrari's Fernando Alonso criticizes Formula One's testing regulations .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A decision on if researchers can study Junior Seau's brain for clues to the NFL veteran's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their Samoan culture, his family said Monday. Seau, 43, died of a gunshot wound at his Oceanside, California, home wound last week in what the coroner concluded was a suicide. There has been speculation about whether repeated hits to his head over his 20-year pro football career could have been a contributing factor. Seau's parents, who are from the island of Aunu'u, American Samoa, were meeting Monday with Samoan elders, according to Shawn Mitchell, who was Seau's pastor. ""The Seau family is currently revisiting several important family decisions and placing them on hold in order to confer with their elders,"" a family statement said. ""All possibilities are being considered, but none will be acted upon until the Seaus arrive at an agreed upon direction."" While there was no evidence Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative disease brought on by multiple concussions, friends and family have stepped forward to say the legendary linebacker suffered a number of hits to the head during his career. Researchers have contacted the Seau family to request the opportunity to study his brain, Mitchell said last week. While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests, among the institutions the family could donate Seau's brain to is Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits. Duerson committed suicide, shooting himself in the chest in 2011 and leaving a suicide note that said he wanted his brain studied for possible damage. While Seau left no such note, he did aim the handgun at his chest. ""Him taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined,"" Mitchell said. As a linebacker, Seau played ""the most havoc-ridden position on the team. He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role,"" said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons. Seau's death follows last month's suicide of former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the NFL over concussion-related injuries. The lawsuit names more than 1,000 professional players. Both Easterling and Duerson exhibited symptoms of repetitive head trauma: memory lapses, anger and deep depression, according to family and friends. And in both cases, researchers found signs of brain trauma. The NFL has repeatedly dismissed the lawsuit's allegations that the league concealed links between football and brain injuries, saying player safety is a priority. ""Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit,"" it said. Seau does not appear to have participated in any of the pending lawsuits against the NFL. CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, warned against drawing a conclusion in Seau's case, though he said there are striking similarities between his death and other cases involving football players. The only way to determine if Seau suffered CTE is to analyze the brain tissue for ""hallmarks of the dementia-like disease,"" Gupta said. ""We can't know,"" unless Seau's brain is analyzed in this way, whether his death was related to CTE, he said.","A decision on a brain study is ""on hold"" while Seau's family consults Samoan cultural elders .

"(CNN) -- Sudan has arrested foreigners in the disputed region of Heglig, its defense ministry said Saturday, the latest in the spiraling conflict between the Sudans. Those arrested were identified by the defense ministry as British, Norwegian, South African and South Sudanese. ""They were engaged in suspicious activities, collecting war debris,"" it said. Meanwhile, a South Sudanese military spokesman reported ongoing clashes and bombings -- though a Sudanese military spokesman denied any such attacks. Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army of South Sudan, said eight bombs were dropped in Unity state Saturday. Friday, ""Khartoum-supported mercenaries"" attacked an SPLA position in a town called Wau, causing 21 deaths, he said. Three fighters were captured alive, he added. The SPLA seized three trucks, which are said to belong to the Sudanese Armed Forces, said Aguer, vowing to retaliate against ""all these acts of aggression."" But Al-Sawarmi Khalid, a spokesman for the Sudanese Armed Forces, said, ""We have not bombed Wau, or any other place in South Sudan."" South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. The war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south. Despite the split in July, unresolved issues remain between the two, including status of their citizens, division of national debt, disputed border areas and sharing of oil wealth. Simmering tensions peaked this month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig from Sudan, raising the stakes by targeting a resource that fuels the economies of both nations. Heglig oil facilities account for about half of Sudan's production of 115,000 barrels a day. Sudan claims ownership for the region, and lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. A day after South Sudan withdrew from the disputed region, it accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks on its territory. CNN's Kim Chakanetsa and journalist Isma'il Kushkush contributed to this report.","Those arrested are British, Norweigan, South Afrian and South Sudanese .

"(CNN) -- A year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is at a crossroads. Many of the agency's proposals to ensure such a calamity doesn't happen here are good in principle, but their effectiveness will depend on how well they are executed and how quickly. It took 10 years for the agency to fully implement security upgrades made necessary by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and it will take at least five years to institute changes in response to Fukushima, whose anniversary is March 11. In the meantime, the nuclear industry is getting out ahead of the NRC by launching a voluntary program that might not adequately protect the public. What are the implications of Fukushima for the U.S. nuclear fleet? Immediately after the accident, some argued that U.S. reactors are not as vulnerable. But it became clear that Japanese reactors and those in the United States are similar in many ways. For example, the General Electric Mark I reactors at Fukushima, like the 23 Mark I reactors in the United States, had hardened vents to release heat and relieve pressure from their containment buildings during an accident. But the vents won't work without electric power. The Fukushima and U.S. reactors also lack control-room instruments that would monitor spent fuel pool water levels and temperature. And U.S. plant owners' plans for managing emergencies probably would not have worked any better than those at Fukushima. Last summer, an NRC task force reviewed the Fukushima accident and came up with a dozen recommendations to reduce U.S. reactor vulnerability. The NRC agreed to implement some of the proposals in the near future, but relegated the task force's top recommendation to the back burner. That top recommendation called for the NRC to clarify its ""patchwork"" regulatory framework for events that reactors are not intended to withstand, such as the earthquake-tsunami combination that overwhelmed Fukushima -- an event termed ""beyond-design-basis."" It would make the most sense for the agency to address this key issue first. By relegating it to last, the agency complicated how it will address other recommendations. For example, the task force said that the NRC should require plant owners to put measures into place to help workers cope with a loss of electric power and its on-site emergency backups, called a station blackout. The precedent comes from the NRC's post-9/11 requirement that plant owners install portable diesel-fueled pumps and generators to protect their facilities from a prolonged station blackout caused by an aircraft attack. But because the NRC defines an aircraft attack as a beyond-design-basis event, it did not require that this equipment meet high quality and reliability standards, or be hardened to withstand other potential threats, such as natural disasters. Indeed, post-Fukushima inspections have confirmed that some of the equipment at many plants would not survive earthquakes or floods. While the NRC deliberates, the nuclear industry has stepped into the breach with the ""Diverse and Flexible Coping Capability"" program, or FLEX, designed as the foundation of its Fukushima response. Under FLEX, plant owners are supplementing and relocating the post-9/11 equipment, ostensibly to better respond to severe natural disasters. Plant owners are dispersing it on and near reactor sites but don't plan to upgrade it to resist natural disasters. The industry is banking that enough equipment will be around so that some of it would be available in a catastrophe. The NRC proposed that plant owners provide reasonable protection for emergency equipment, but did not define how to meet this requirement. In the meantime, plant owners have purchased more than 300 pieces of FLEX equipment without waiting for NRC guidelines, which will make it difficult for the agency to later institute standards that could force the industry to replace the equipment. Last July, the Union of Concerned Scientists released recommendations for strengthening reactor safeguards. The NRC staff initially selected three of these recommendations --enlarging emergency evacuation zones, expanding potassium iodide distribution, and accelerating the transfer of spent fuel from pools to dry casks -- for further evaluation. A few months later, however, the agency decided that its established approach in each area is adequate. Adequate? Hardly. For instance, the NRC justifies its one-size-fits-all, 10-mile-radius emergency evacuation zone by arguing that evacuations could be expanded in a serious accident. But the agency has yet to explain how that would happen and will not be taking up this issue until a later date. The NRC is downplaying its task force's most important recommendation and potentially undermining efforts to improve U.S. reactor safety. The agency is not adequately addressing deficiencies in its emergency evacuation planning and spent fuel storage standards. All the while, the nuclear industry is outpacing the agency with a low-budget, voluntary and potentially ineffective plan. For the 116 million Americans who live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant, that's cold comfort. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal beat 10-man Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 on Tuesday to qualify for the Euro 2012 finals. With the playoff first leg in Bosnia tied 0-0, Portugal were looking for a fast start and got it as Real Madrid star Ronaldo netted early with a trademark free-kick. A second from Manchester United's Nani after 26 minutes looked to have eased Portugal's path to Ukraine and Poland next year, but Zvezjdan Misimovic converted an early second-half penalty following Fabio Coentrao's handball. Ronaldo then scored a superb second to equal Luis Figo's international record of 32 for Portugal and put his side 3-1 ahead. How should football tackle racism? An incident-packed second half saw Bosnia lose Senad Lulic for a second yellow, but a goal from Emir Spahic gave them renewed hope against the nervy hosts. However, a late double from Helder Postiga and a further strike from Miguel Veloso saw the Euro 2004 runners-up romp home in spectacular style. They were joined in the finals, as expected, by the Republic of Ireland, who drew 1-1 with Estonia to seal a 5-1 aggregate victory after a decisive four-goal win Friday's first leg. The Irish -- whose only previous appearance in the finals of a European Championship was in 1988 -- opened the scoring through Stephen Ward after 32 minutes. Estonia's Konstantin Vassiljev equalized in the second half with a long-range shot which eluded goalkeeper Shay Given. The Czech Republic booked a fifth successive Euro finals place with a 1-0 win in Montenegro. The Czechs led 2-0 from the first leg in Prague, and a fine individual goal from Petr Jiracek in the 81st minute sealed their qualification. It was a similar story in Croatia, where the home side, who led Turkey 3-0 from the first leg, played out a 0-0 draw to go through.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores double as Portugal beat Bosnia 6-2 in Euro 2012 playoffs .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Shameen's brown eyes seem lost as she thinks about the one day she wants to forget, but it is all she can think about. Nearly 90 percent of Afghan women suffer from domestic abuse, according to the U.N. Still traumatized, she recounts the events that led her to a safe house in Kabul. She was raped and nearly stabbed to death by her husband just seven days before we met her. Her lips are quivering and her eyes full of fear. ""He forced himself on me,"" she said. ""All I could do was scream."" She was married off 15 years ago when she was a teenager. Throughout those years she was tortured and abused, suffering daily beatings with an electrical wire or the metal end of a hammer. This was her normal life. ""He chased after me with a hammer. He said if I made any noise he would put holes through me,"" Shameen said. Shameen and her husband could not conceive a child. And in Afghan society, it seems, the blame always falls on the woman. After one severe beating, she ran from her home and to the police station. Her husband promised the police he would not attack her anymore, so she gave in and agreed to go back home with him. Days later, Shameen's husband took her on a trip to visit her sister's grave -- a 15-year-old sister who was burned to death for displeasing her husband. Shameen says her younger sister was 11 years old when she was forced to marry an older man. He would beat and abuse her until one day he killed her. As Shameen walked along the graveyard with her husband he took her near a shrine where he forced her to the ground, lifted her burqa and raped her. He then threatened her with a knife and asked her who was going to help her now. She was screaming as he slashed her throat and body. A passerby saved her. Now, she has no one to turn to -- not even her own parents. In their eyes, she has brought them shame, an offense punishable by death. In Afghanistan, a woman is blamed for the injustices she must live through. Shameen says when her sister was killed, her parents turned a blind eye. She misses her parents and siblings but knows she can never see them again. ""They'll kill me,"" she said without flinching. She now hides in a safe house, isolated and alone. Like most Afghan women, she has lost all hope. Afghanistan is a country where for centuries women have been considered property -- not equals, like the constitution states. They are often beaten, raped and even sold to the highest bidder. There are very few places women can turn to. Authorities brought Shameen to a shelter run by Women for Afghan Women (WAW). The organization started in New York to provide humanitarian assistance to women who do not know they have rights.  Watch Abawi's report from the shelter » . In this safe house, WAW is currently providing care, security and an education for 54 women and children. Nearly 90 percent of Afghan women suffer from domestic abuse, according to the United Nations Development Fund for Women. Despite that, there are less than a dozen shelters like this one in Afghanistan, usually run by non-governmental organizations. Abusers are rarely prosecuted or convicted, and most women are afraid to say anything. ""Their mothers are beaten by their fathers. They're beaten by their fathers, by their brothers. It's a way of life,"" said Manizha Naderi, director of WAW. Naderi is an Afghan-American who grew up in New York and has returned to Afghanistan to work with other women in hopes of bringing a change, although she said it will take generations. ""They see their mothers being beaten, they see their sisters their aunts, everybody,"" Naderi said. ""So that's what they expect."" It is not just women who suffer. Hosnia is a smiling eight year old who likes to play with her toys and other young girls at the shelter. She rocks her body on the mat where she sits, the rocking swaying her green plastic earrings as she talks with a muffled sweet voice. ""I have a difficulty,"" she said, when asked what she is doing at the shelter. Her smile fades as she remembers the circumstances that brought her here. Just three years ago when Hosnia was five, she was raped and left for dead outside her home in northern Afghanistan. Her father found her bloody body floating in a creek. She spent a month in the hospital as her little body recovered from that brutal assault. Out of love and fear for his daughter's life, Hosnia's dad brought her to this safe house. According to WAW, her rapist was a young man from an affluent family and quickly released from jail because of bribes and family connections. The organization forced the authorities back on the case and he was then sentenced to six years in a Kabul juvenile prison. He has three years left in his sentence, and Hosnia's parents fear for their daughter's life. So the shelter is her home now and the women and children here, her family. ""We will take care of her through adulthood,"" Naderi said. Hosnia's father, a poor farmer, knows the only chance for his girl to have a future in a country where rape victims are punished, is if she grows up here. This shelter has dozens of heart-wrenching stories; it also houses dozens of women and girls who have the courage to live in a country where one of the biggest dangers is to be a woman.","U.N.: Nearly 90 percent of Afghan women suffer from domestic abuse .

"(Budget Travel) -- Airport security is a traveler's rite of passage: the long lines, the ID check, the shuffling of personal items. Get through security faster with these easy strategies. To move through security quickly, wear slip-on shoes, minimal jewelry and no belt. Pack like you're making lasagna (no, seriously!)  You probably don't want a security official inspecting your carry-on bag by hand. Time-consuming inspections usually only happen when an X-ray machine operator can't identify items. Avoid this hassle by packing in a way that keeps your curling iron, hair dryer, and other hard-plastic or dense items separate in your bag, instead of allowing them to get tangled in a pile -- and look suspiciously like a bomb or a weapon on an X-ray scan. Layer your electronics and toiletries in between your clothes like you're spreading ricotta cheese in between strips of pasta to prepare lasagna. Put heavy clothes on top to act as a weight and secure loose items. Remember the 3-1-1 rule  If you plan to go carry-on only, any liquid should be kept in a 3.4-ounce bottle or smaller. You're only allowed as many bottles as can fit in one quart-size, clear ziplock bag. Find bottles in your local drugstore's travel or $1 section, or online. Buying products packaged in small amounts can be expensive: We recently found face wash in a two-ounce bottle for for $9, shaving cream for about $6, and contact lens solution for $10.50. By transferring your liquids from standard-size bottles into TSA-friendly containers, like these squishy bottles from humangear.com, you should save a lot of money. Dress for success  Slip-on shoes (preferably with socks; think of the dirty feet that have been on that linoleum), minimal jewelry and no belt is the standard uniform for moving through security fast. If you insist on wearing jewelry and a watch on the plane, take them off and slip them into a pocket in your carry-on before you enter the security cordon. Use flight-ready toiletries  Keep your travel bag stocked with ""flight ready"" items that don't break the TSA's liquid rules, such as solid perfume, and lip balm instead of lip gloss. Buy a TSA-approved laptop bag  The TSA allows laptops to go through the X-ray in checkpoint-friendly laptop bags, like a simple $20 Skooba Skin. The most common and cheapest is a laptop sleeve. Consumer Reports recommends a few here. Laptops are also among the most-forgotten items at security, so label yours with a business card or ID tag. Keep an eye peeled for new security programs  Fifty airports (including Boston, Chicago, and Seattle) have security lines split among Expert, Casual, and Family travelers. Look for the signs and hit the line that's right for you -- we suggest Expert now that you've read our tips. Also, remember that 18 airports and five airlines are currently participating in the Paperless Boarding Pass pilot program. If the program covers your flight, you can go straight to the security checkpoint and use your cell phone as a boarding pass. Read about it on our blog. It's showtime Once you've presented your ID and boarding pass, get moving. Find the shortest line -- look especially for lines toward your left because studies show that Americans are more likely to turn right than left when entering a building, so lines on the left will tend to be shorter. Grab two bins. The TSA is asking travelers to put shoes directly on the X-ray belt, so do that first. Pull out your quart-size bag of liquids and small electronics (like an iPhone) and lay them on top of your jacket. In the second bin, put your laptop (or, if you've got just got one bag or purse, use this bin for that). After successfully passing through the metal detector (because we know you will), grab your shoes and slip them on, then snag your other belongings and slip them back in your bag.

"Lincoln, Nebraska (CNN) -- When University of Nebraska-Lincoln assistant football coach Ron Brown stood in front of the Omaha City Council in March to speak against a proposal to protect sexual identity, he was merely exercising his right as a private citizen, he would later say. It came as no surprise that Brown, an outspoken born-again Christian and a preacher, believes that homosexuality is a sin. But his passionate opposition to the proposed amendment to the city's anti-discrimination policy raised questions as to whether Brown was really speaking as a citizen. After all, the university's own anti-discrimination policy does just what Brown spoke against: It protects students and staff from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. Adding to the confusion, when addressing the council, Brown gave his address as ""One Memorial Stadium, Lincoln, Nebraska,"" home turf of the Nebraska Cornhuskers. ""The question that I have for you all is, like Pontius Pilate, what are you going to do with Jesus?"" Brown asked the council. ""You will be held to great accountability for the decision that you make. And so, like Pontius Pilate, who didn't -- who kind of waffled around -- he wasn't sure. He knew what to do, I think. But he let political correctedness (sic) shape his thinking."" The measure passed anyway, by a 4-3 vote. Brown's comments triggered national media attention and calls for his dismissal. This week, all eyes were on Lincoln, Nebraska, where the City Council held a public hearing on a similar change to its anti-discrimination policy. Many expected Brown to show up at Monday's hearing, particularly because this time the vote would be in his own backyard. But that didn't happen. Instead, Brown penned a letter published in the Lincoln Journal Star newspaper a day before the hearing. It stated his support of UNL's anti-discrimination policy, despite his personal beliefs. ""I have and will embrace every player I coach, gay or straight ... but I won't embrace a legal policy that supports a lifestyle that God calls sin,"" he wrote. Brown told the newspaper he stayed away from Monday's hearing to avoid media attention being diverted from the issues and toward him. CNN's repeated attempts to reach Brown for comment went unanswered, and an athletic department spokesman said he would not be commenting further. It's unclear how much pressure the University of Nebraska has put on Brown to keep quiet after the uproar over his public comments in March. In an interview with CNN, UNL chancellor Harvey Perlman acknowledged that Brown's views are in stark contrast to the university's anti-discrimination policy. He said he has spoken to the coach, telling him to be clear when he speaks publicly that he's not doing so on behalf of the school. Perlman said he ""absolutely"" understands why a gay football player would feel uncomfortable playing on the team now. Brown's comments, according to Perlman, brought a ""certain level of embarrassment"" to the school, and more than 2,500 people have signed an online petition calling for him to be fired. But the chancellor said that just because Brown has an opinion that differs from the university's is not grounds for dismissal. The coach merely exercised his right to free speech, Perlman said. ""If I thought he was discriminating against a football player or anybody else on the basis of sexual orientation, that would violate university policy and would be grounds for some remedy,"" Perlman said. ""But I have no evidence that he's done that."" One of Brown's biggest fans over the years was Brett Major, who was born and raised in Omaha and, like most Nebraskans, bleeds Husker red. Major, an active member of the Christian faith who is also gay, credits Brown with helping strengthen his relationship with Jesus Christ. ""I was in middle school (and) my dad invited him to come speak at our church,"" said Major, now a first year master's student at Wake Forest University. ""He's a very engaging, dynamic speaker. It's hard not to like him when you hear him speak."" But his reverence for Brown changed when he heard what the longtime Huskers coach said to the Omaha City Council. ""It doesn't bother me that he thinks homosexuality is a sin and all that ... I hear people say that all the time,"" Major said. He heard Brown express his position against homosexuality in 1999 on a Christian radio program, triggering outrage from the American Civil Liberties Union, which threatened a lawsuit. Brown's comments in Omaha went beyond his opposition to homosexuality, according to Major. ""I don't agree that along with that he should be preventing any group of people from getting jobs that they deserve and to allow them to be fired from jobs,"" Major said. ""That's not what the Bible teaches."" Major said the worst part is that Brown's comments make it even more difficult for LGBT athletes to feel comfortable living their lives openly. ""There's a whole community of LGBT athletes out there that are playing for the teams that we know and love across the country,"" Major said. ""It's about those athletes and creating an environment in NCAA athletics that they feel comfortable in."" Major and his parents, who are both Nebraska graduates, wrote a letter to the university saying they believe ""more should have been said"" by university officials to make it abundantly clear that discrimination against LGBT individuals has no place at Nebraska. Although Brett Major wrote that the University of Nebraska needs to ""take a stand against Ron Brown,"" neither he nor his parents called for Brown's firing. In fact, Major believes the university has a unique opportunity to turn the negative situation into a positive one by ""publicly show(ing) some support, acceptance and advocacy for one of the most marginalized groups in our culture."" ""I want gay and lesbian athletes to know that we love it when they score a touchdown ... and I want them to know that we hate it when they fumble -- just like everyone else,"" Major said.","Huskers assistant coach voiced opposition to a city anti-discrimination policy amendment .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma man said he doesn't hate African-Americans and counts some of them among his best friends. Murder and hate crime charges were filed on Friday accusing him and another man of killing three strangers because they were black. Clark Brewster, lawyer for 19-year-old Jake England, told reporters Friday he would not comment specifically about the April 6 shootings that left three dead and two others wounded in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He did show a video of an interview his team conducted and recorded with England from jail, in which the suspect described the trauma of watching first his father and then, nearly two years later, his girlfriend being shot dead a few feet away from him. England also talked of growing up and living in North Tulsa, which has a large African-American community, and saying he had friends of all races. ""I always got along with everybody,"" he said in the tape, recorded Friday morning. ""It didn't matter what color he was."" That view is starkly different from the portrayal of England offered by prosecutors, as well as in the probable cause affidavit that led to the arrest of him and 33-year-old Alvin Watts. In addition to commenting on his girlfriend's suicide in January, England lamented his father's death exactly two years earlier ""at the hands of a f--king n----r"" in an April 5 message on his Facebook page. England said in the jailhouse interview that he used those words ""just to express how I was upset at the guy who shot my Dad"" and they do not mean he was a racist. Authorities say he and Watts went into a largely African-American section of Tulsa shortly after midnight and gunned down apparent strangers at four locations. Two men and one woman died after being shot in the chest -- with one of them found ""lying face down"" outside a funeral home -- while two others were shot and survived. All the shooting victims are black. Police have identified Watts and England as white, though the probable cause affidavit released Friday noted England was a co-owner of a truck that had Cherokee Nation license plates. Three Crime Stoppers tips helped lead authorities to the men, according to the affidavit. In the first, made last Saturday, a caller described England as ""a racist (who) hates black males"" and said he had ""bragged about other shootings."" Another person phoned to say that England had gone off to burn his truck, which was similar to the vehicle seen by several people -- including one of the survivors -- in and around the area where the shootings took place. Sheriff deputies soon after found a 1989 Chevy truck with the Cherokee Nation tag on fire in North Tulsa. The third caller to contact Crime Stoppers on April 7 said England had ""made several comments about killing black people"" and wanted ""justice"" for his father's killing. This person added that England ""uses drugs and will not go down without a fight."" Neither England nor Watts offered resistance when they were taken into custody early Sunday, Tulsa Police Capt. Jonathan Brooks said. England confessed to shooting three people, while fellow suspect Watts admitted to police that he shot the other two, both of which were fatal, according to police documents. Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris on Friday filed charges against both men on three counts of first-degree murder tied to the deaths of 54-year-old Bobby Clark, 49-year-old Dannaer Fields and 31-year-old William Terrell Allen. They also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill related to the two people who were wounded, according to the press release from the district attorney's office. In addition, the men face five counts of malicious harassment. The district attorney notes that, according to Oklahoma law, the charge infers that a person has acted ""maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability."" The charge is equivalent to a hate crime under Oklahoma law, according to Partners Against Hate, a joint project of the Anti-Defamation League, the Leadership Conference Education Fund and the Center for Preventing Hate nonprofit groups. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking Friday outside the First Baptist Church in North Tulsa, challenged why this ""hate crime"" charge is considered a misdemeanor, and not a felony, in Oklahoma. The maximum penalty for a conviction is a year in prison and a $1,000 fine. Still, the civil rights leader lauded authorities for filing charges in the case that effectively asserted the victims were targeted due to their race. The Rev. Al Sharpton voiced a similar sentiment, canceling a planned trip to Tulsa and saying in a statement he was ""glad that (prosecutors) filed first-degree murder and hate crime charges."" ""We're glad that they've made that decision in the right direction today,"" Jackson said. Brewster said he decided to represent England after getting a letter Monday from the suspect's mother, who has been incarcerated for the past 11 years. The lawyer described his client as a hard-working young man who had served as a father figure to his teenage sister and is himself the father of a baby son born to his late girlfriend. He also said England harbors no ill will toward African-Americans. ""Many (of his friends) are black. He has family members that are black. And there's no hatred of blacks in him at all,"" said Brewster. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the Tulsa shootings to determine if federal civil rights were violated, said spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa. She called it an ""open investigation,"" but not a hate crimes investigation per se. Watts and England will appear in court Monday, when a judge will set a date for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors filed a motion Friday asking that both defendants be held without bond and not be released if they come up with the $9.16 million bond set Monday, when authorities outlined murder but not the malicious harassment charges. ""Both defendants are a danger to public safety in this community, and they have strong incentive to flee the jurisdiction if they were able to make bond,"" the prosecution argued. The maximum sentence for each charge of shooting with intent to kill is life in prison. England and Watts could face anywhere from life with the possibility of parole or a death sentence for the murder charges. First District Attorney Doug Drummond said in a press release that the prosecution likely will decide whether to seek the death penalty after the preliminary hearing is complete. Calling the shootings ""tragic and senseless,"" Drummond characterized the filing of charges as a ""first step to obtain justice."" Jackson similarly cautioned against celebrating too early that the suspects were detained and charged, noting the legal process ahead could be long and complicated. ""This is a first down, not a touchdown,"" he said. ""This is a charge, not a conviction.""

"(CNN) -- Military investigators said Monday that they do not suspect foul play in the death of an Army captain who collapsed during a video call with his wife. Capt. Bruce Kevin Clark, 43, was using the video calling service Skype to speak with his wife, Susan Orellana-Clark, on April 30 when he slumped forward. He was dead when military personnel arrived two hours later. Orellana-Clark said Sunday in a statement that she saw what appeared to be a bullet hole on the wall behind her husband after he collapsed, leading to speculation he had been shot. While the cause of death is not known, investigators have ruled out a gunshot, Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman Chris Grey said in a statement. ""Agents conducting the investigation, found no trauma to the body beyond minor abrasions and a possible broken nose most likely caused from Captain Clark striking his face on his desk when he collapsed,"" Grey said. ""Although we have not completely ruled it out to ensure a complete and thorough investigation is conducted, we do not suspect foul play in the death of Captain Clark at this point in our ongoing investigation,"" he said. In a statement Sunday, Orellana-Clark said that her husband seemed to be in no distress when he was ""knocked forward,"" revealing what she said appeared to be a bullet hole in the closet door behind him. Orellana-Clark said she was releasing the details ""to honor my husband and dispel the inaccurate information and supposition promulgated by other parties."" Two U.S. military officials with knowledge of the investigation conducted in Afghanistan confirmed that it took two hours from the time Clark collapsed while on Skype with his wife until military personnel arrived. They said Orellana-Clark's request had been routed through several commands in the United States before it was relayed to Afghanistan. No wounds were found on Clark's body, according to one of the officials, who said the death has been determined to be ""noncombat"" and suicide has been ruled out. An official determination of cause of death is pending autopsy and toxicology results, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is still under investigation. Clark, who was a chief nurse, was assigned to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, but deployed with a medical unit from Fort Hood. He was stationed at Tarin Kowt, about 85 miles (140 kilometers) north of Kandahar. In addition to his wife, Clark is survived by two daughters. CNN's Chelsea J.

"London (CNN) -- So finally, after long drawn out negotiations, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy seem to have reached some consensus on the recapitalization of European banks. However, they are unable to give us the blueprint of the agreement until the end of the month, just ahead of the G20 meeting in Cannes in early November. And it is not yet clear if the other 15 eurozone member countries will agree on the plans. This is nail-biting stuff -- the world really does not have time to wait. This financial crisis is more to do with the strength and stability of the banks than it has to do with Greece or any other philandering economy. If the banks are well capitalized, then the storm can be ridden through. But the longer the European Union takes to make decisions about sovereign debt the more damaged the banks will become. The strong banks will want to attract fresh private capital and the weak will be reliant of public and taxpayers' money. It has become increasingly clear is that there are far too many banks in Europe. This crisis provides a classic opportunity to cut the number of banks by at least 30%. The EU should use its powers to force distressed banks into the arms of those banks with solid balance sheets. Clients and customers of banks not capable of meeting their financial obligations due to the toxic state of their balance sheets must be protected, with their assets and liabilities being transferred to safe havens -- regardless of the potential damage to existing shareholders. Beyond Greece, banks in Italy and Spain are in need of rationalization because of the respective size of their economies. For instance, the assets of the vulnerable cajas must be swept up by the four main Spanish banks. In Germany there are also far too many landesbanks, or savings banks. Some are very strong, but there are plenty which have no place independently going forward. Quick action will restore confidence. The model used by the UK government to protect the customers of Bradford & Bingley should probably be adopted as the norm in the next few years. If a bank's situation looks dire it should be closed and the business dissolved into: ""The First Bank in Boot Hill."" The banking industry is likely to look totally different in 10 years time. The large banks will be focused on corporate and investment banking and investment management, and retail banking will be dominated by large cash rich companies. Look at General Electric -- it has a decent banking base. Why couldn't the likes of Tesco, Vodafone, and even Apple provide the best banking services imaginable? These companies' attention to the analysis of customer relations management is superb. They understand the nuances and foibles of retailer better than any other sector by a country mile. Surely our money would be very safe in these very competent hands? This may not happen soon, but it's possible in the future. Meanwhile, Belgian's government has agreed to pay â‚¬4.5 billion for the retail banking business of Dexia bank, a dominant municipality lender. Belgium, France and Luxembourg leaders have drawn up a guarantee for Dexia's interbank and bond funding, of up to â‚¬90 billion over 10 years. The markets are now waiting for results from other banks, including JPMorgan's on Thursday. Next week, Goldman Sachs will be in the spotlight. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Buik .","The German and French leaders seem to have reached some consensus on European banks' recapitalization .
But there is no clarity around the plan, and the world does not have time to wait .
There are too many banks in Europe, and the weak ones should be swept up, or fail ."
"(CNN) -- One Goh, the 43-year-old Korean-American man suspected in the execution-style shooting deaths at a small Christian college in California, seemed a doting son visiting his parents in senior housing. But at the same time, he was capable of displaying unbridled anger at the school, according to police and others who had contact with him. The portrait of Goh emerging one day after six women and one man were shot to death at Oikos University in Oakland is of someone who felt he was ""teased"" and ""picked on"" at the college, which eventually expelled him, possibly for poor behavior, police said. Goh was self-conscious of his inability to speak English like a native and felt that students and others at the school made fun of him, police said. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said it wasn't immediately clear why Goh had been expelled from the college but, ""We've been told that some of the possibilities are that he was expelled for his behavioral problems, anger management, but nothing specific."" While Goh appeared close to his family, he struggled personally with significant debt, including a tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service, according to court records. His brother, a soldier, reportedly was killed last year in the line of duty. CNN affiliate KGO said the brother, a staff sergeant in the Army, died in a car accident while training with the Special Forces. After the shooting, which just lasted minutes, the gunman drove off in a victim's car, and when the suspect surrendered to police at a grocery story in the Oakland suburb of Alameda, the gunman showed no remorse and told police he was angry about his expulsion from the college, police said. No charges have been filed yet in the mass killing as police continue their investigation, authorities said. Goh was being held Tuesday in Alameda County's Santa Rita Jail pending an initial appearance in court this week. The early, broad impressions of Goh have drawn the attention of civic and church leaders in the city's Korean-American community, who were scheduled to attend a memorial service in Oakland Tuesday evening. Community leaders will work together to help those living in the area and those affected directly cope with the tragedy, said June Lee, executive director of Korean Community of the East Bay, based in Oakland. Oikos University, located in a one-story structure that resembles a converted office building, caters to the Korean-American Christian community but also has students from diverse backgrounds. It offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. ""First of all, we would not want to localize this story too much,"" Lee told CNN. ""We think that Koreans or Asians are mainstreamed. We're not so much different from others. It is a tragedy and we recognize that. We're looking for a way to help the families and the community that are impacted by this incident."" Community and faith leaders have yet to determine what issues need to be raised in the aftermath of the mass shooting, she said. ""We need to identify the issues first. All the community leaders are willing to convene and to have a collective strategy in the community,"" Lee said. Meanwhile, Police Chief Jordan said that Goh, after he surrendered, didn't appear ""to be remorseful at all.""

"Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) -- The trial of former presidential candidate John Edwards took a dramatic turn Wednesday when his daughter abruptly left the courtroom during testimony about a fight between her mother and father over his affair with a campaign videographer. Cate Edwards left during the testimony of Christina Reynolds, former research director for Edwards' 2008 campaign. Reynolds was recounting an October 2007 confrontation between Elizabeth and John Edwards at the Raleigh, North Carolina, airport after the National Enquirer reported the candidate was having an affair with Rielle Hunter. Elizabeth Edwards, a breast cancer patient, tore at her clothing, exposing her chest, the witness said. ""You don't see me anymore,"" Reynolds quoted the wife as saying. As Reynolds described the incident in the airport hangar, John Edwards covered his face with his hands. He then looked back at his daughter and said, ""I don't know what's coming ... do you want to leave?"" Cate Edwards said something back, stood and left the courtroom. Some in the courtroom reported seeing her wiping tears in her eyes as she left. She returned to her seat behind her father after a court recess. Elizabeth Edwards died of breast cancer in December 2010. Prosecutors say donations to pay his mistress's expenses were illegal and a chief reason John Edwards is on trial in federal court on six felony counts. Also charged with conspiracy and making false statements, Edwards could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Edwards is accused of using false and misleading campaign disclosure reports to conceal from the Federal Election Commission more than $900,000 in donations -- $725,000 from Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon and $200,000 from the late Texas lawyer Fred Baron. Also Wednesday, a former Edwards staffer testified about his travels with Edwards in 2006, before the latter announced his candidacy. Josh Brumberger said he told Edwards that Hunter seemed a ""little nutty"" and her video work was ""shoddy and unprofessional."" Edwards insisted Hunter should receive health insurance, even though she was a consultant, Brumberger said. The former aide also said he told Edwards that the staff was noticing he was treating Hunter differently than he did others, such as carrying her bags. It all came to a head at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in October 2006. A red-faced and cursing Edwards, who was bound for China, pulled him to the side, Brumberger testified. Edwards said that ""if I thought he was (blanking) her, why didn't I come to him like a man and ask,"" said Brumberger. ""He said he didn't trust me anymore. He was basically firing me."" On cross-examination, Brumberger said all of those incidents occurred before the presidential campaign. Edwards eventually admitted to having carried on an affair with Hunter and fathering her child.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An extensive federal report released Monday concludes that roughly one in four of the 697,000 U.S. veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War suffer from Gulf War illness. A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo. That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals, including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas. The 452-page report states that ""scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans."" The report, compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, fails to identify any cure for the malady. It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time. ""Today's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War,"" said Anthony Hardie, a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare. ""This is a bittersweet victory, [because] this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along,"" Hardie said at a news conference in Washington. ""Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans."" The committee's report, titled ""Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans,"" was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake. Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001, it calls for a ""renewed federal research commitment"" to ""identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues.""  Watch CNN's Elizabeth Cohen report more on Gulf War illness » . According to the report, Gulf War illness is a ""complex of multiple concurrent symptoms"" that ""typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems, chronic headaches, widespread pain, gastrointestinal problems, and other chronic abnormalities."" The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease -- among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts. The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple ""biological alterations"" affecting the brain and nervous system. iReport.com: Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness? While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease, it is, according to the report, no longer difficult to identify a cause. The report identifies two Gulf War ""neurotoxic"" exposures that ""are causally associated with Gulf War illness."" The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills, given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents. The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict. The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness -- including low-level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires -- though it fails to establish any clear link. The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran's exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time. ""Gulf War illness isn't some imaginary syndrome,"" said Ken Robinson, the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996-97. ""This is real, and it has devastated families. Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration. Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again."" Robinson noted that soldiers in the field today are not at risk for Gulf War illness, because the military is no longer using the PB pills or pesticides that led to the illness in 1990 and 1991. The report backs Robinson's conclusion, noting that no problem similar to Gulf War illness has been discovered among veterans from the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s or in the current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. The committee report also backs Robinson's call for more effective treatments among veterans suffering from Gulf War illness. Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001, it calls for a ""renewed federal research commitment"" to ""identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues."" Specifically, the report calls for at least $60 million in new annual federal funding on research committed to improving the health of Gulf War veterans.","NEW: Officer who investigated illness: ""This is real, and it has devastated families""

"(CNN) -- Islam Mohmand and his two wives have so many children that he sometimes gets confused and needs help to remember all of their names. They have 20 kids in all but would be happy to bring even more into their small family house. But population experts in Pakistan, where the Mohmands are from, say families like theirs are fueling a population explosion that is fast becoming the country's most dangerous crisis. Pakistan's population has grown from around 33 million in 1947 to more than 180 million people in 2012, making it the sixth most populous country in the world. It is also one of the world's poorest, with 60% of Pakistanis living on just $2 per day, according to the World Bank. The majority of the population -- 70%, according to the United Nations -- is largely illiterate and resides in rural areas lacking the most basic services. With only one in five Pakistani women using modern birth control, the United Nations estimates Pakistan will become the world's third most populous country after China and India by 2050. ""I consider the population problem the biggest problem of this country,"" said Akbar Laghari of Pakistan's Department of Population Welfare. ""The future is bleak because of this."" He admitted the government has to share the blame as not enough is done to offer effective family planning services and teach people about birth control. ""We don't have that much mobility, we don't have the resources,"" he said. ""Because of the political upheavals in the country and frequent changes in government ... they [the government] are not giving it top priority."" With widespread poverty, an energy crisis, woeful public services, and a bloody, resource-draining insurgency, Pakistan can ill afford to see this rapid growth continue. ""Naturally there will be epidemics, there will be wars -- there will be fights for food, water and everything,"" Laghari warned. ""It's a huge concern that we're growing at one of the fastest rates in Asia,"" said Zeba Sathar, Pakistan country director for the Population Council, a non-profit organization that specializes in public health research in developing countries. ""I think it's an ignored problem. We're brushing it away and I'm afraid we're losing time."" Sathar says many people are unable to make informed decisions because support services such as family planning are lacking. ""The poor end up with many children because they don't have access to right kind of information,"" she said. ""We're doing a lot of research where women say 'we didn't want that many children,' or they wanted to have them later but they just didn't find the services. ""The philosophy is we're not into controlling the number of children. If you can bring up a healthy family with 20 children, kudos to you. It's a question of running out of resources. It's when the 15th one suffers."" But the Mohmand children are already paying the price -- the family can only afford to send four of their offspring to school, the rest have to work to support the family. A lack of education is not the only challenge. Pakistan is a deeply conservative country, where some view birth control as un-Islamic. ""None of these methods is allowed in Islam,"" said Maulana Tanveer Alvi, a Muslim cleric. ""Whatever is born in the world -- animals, humans, anything living -- God is responsible for their care. ""The process of reproduction will go on until God stops it. Why should a Muslim worry about the increase in population when God has taken responsibility for everyone's care?"" Culturally, many women are often confined to the marital home and deprived of the right to make important decisions such as whether to have a child. ""Women don't always get to choose ... they require permission from their husband or even their mother-in-law,"" said Laghari. However, other Muslim countries with similar problems to Pakistan, including Bangladesh and Iran, have introduced measures to curb their growing populations. Experts say those countries started with the political will to do something and spent a lot of time and resources on family planning efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) says government field workers and satellite clinics are the two crucial elements in the campaign in Bangladesh -- which saw its population grow from 75 million when it gained independence in 1971, to more than 142 million currently. It said thousands of Health and Family Welfare centers have been upgraded nationwide, while Family Welfare Assistants provide door-to-door visits giving millions of couples family planning support and sexual health education.","Pakistan's population has grown from around 33 million in 1947 to more than 180 million people in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- It could be an alien spacecraft or a 21st century version of Captain Nemo's Nautilus from Jules Verne ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" but in fact it's a live-aboard, ocean-going laboratory that could be exploring the seas as soon as late next year. Called the SeaOrbiter, the part submarine, part research vessel is the concept of French architect Jacques Rougerie. Currently the centerpiece of France's pavilion at Expo 2012 in Yeosu, South Korea, it has spent almost 12 years floating around as a mere concept. It recently completed its industrial design phase and construction is slated for October this year. ""All technical issues are resolved, all the modeling is done,"" says Ariel Fuchs, education and media director of the SeaOrbiter project. ""We gathered institutional and industrial support five or six years ago and it's been a real institutional and financial project for the last two years."" It is expected to cost around $43 million and when built, will be 58-meters in height, taller than Nelson's Column, a monument in London. When launched, around 50% of the vessel will be below the water line, allowing for constant underwater study, Fuchs says. ""One of the first users will be the science community,"" he says. ""It's designed to explore the ocean in a new way, mainly spending time under the sea, giving people the opportunity to live under the sea for a very long time, to observe, to undertake research missions, like marine biology, oceanography and climate issues."" Rougerie's inspiration for SeaOrbiter comes from ocean explorers like Jacques Cousteau and the experimental Tektite underwater capsule laboratory that was used by oceanographer Sylvia Earle in 1969. Earle is one of many vocal supporters of the SeaOrbiter project; others include former NASA Administrator Dan Goldin and astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien. The space connection doesn't stop there as SeaOrbiter has enlisted the support of the European Space Agency and other industrial organizations to help develop the technology needed for the ambitious project and its onboard systems. Designed to drift with ocean currents, the vessel will generate the majority of its power for life-support systems and propulsion to avoid other ships and storms from renewable energy, including solar, wind and wave power, Fuchs says. A side project is underway in conjunction with EADS, the European defense and space systems conglomerate, to develop a biofuel as the ship's main power source. ""It meets the requirements of today's philosophy of sustainability,"" Fuchs says. When built, the ship is expected to go to Monaco -- the same place where Jacques Cousteau began his missions. ""The larger education plan is explaining how important the oceans are in to the balance of the planet,"" says Fuchs.","SeaOrbiter is a unique, ocean-going research vessel .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari have admitted their approach to the 2011 Formula One season has been too conservative, after the Italian team failed to register a podium finish in the first three races of the year. Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, are fifth and sixth respectively in the drivers' standings, with the former trailing current leader and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel by 42 points. The legendary marque's team principal Stefano Domenicali said the problems stem back to the design of the Italia 150 car. ""Our approach was not aggressive enough at the design stage,"" the 45-year-old told Ferrari's official web site. ""There was a problem with the correlation between data gathered from the wind tunnel and what we saw on track so this did the damage in these first few months."" Domenicali, who has been with Ferrari since 1991, said the team's form must improve ahead of three races in four weeks, starting with the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday. ""If there is one thing you don't want to do, it's panic as it definitely does not help you do better. ""Now we are about to tackle three races in four weeks: it will be important to show that we are back on form and to make it to the podium, something that has escaped us in all of the first three races of the season."" Ferrari's chief designer Nikolas Tombazis has called for a more aggressive approach in order to move Ferrari up the grid, and he claimed the current car cannot challenge Red Bull and McLaren's dominance. ""We have tried to see if our approach was too conservative and we realized that, for various reasons, we were neither reactive nor aggressive enough in the development stages,"" Tombazis told the sport's official web site. ""At the moment, we don't have a winning car and, on those of our competitors we can see innovative solutions introduced in a more aggressive fashion than we have done. ""Maybe we were a bit too passive in our approach. We did not push hard enough in some areas of development and unfortunately, the results can be seen on track."" Ferrari have won the constructors' championship on 16 occasions and provided 15 drivers' champions since making their debut in the sport in 1950.","Stefano Domenicali has said Ferrari have not been aggressive enough .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy kept his nerve in the face of a last day charge from Tiger Woods to win the Honda Classic Sunday and jump to the top of the world rankings. The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland finished with a one-under-par 69 for a 12-under total of 268 at the PGA National in Florida. The victory will see him leapfrog England's Luke Donald as world No.1, a week after missing out on the honor when beaten by Hunter Mahan in the WGC Match Play final. 14-time major winner Woods showed he is still a force to be reckoned with after a closing eight-under 62, his lowest final round as a professional. He finished by draining an eight-foot eagle putt on the 18th to set the clubhouse target on 10-under 270. World no.3 Lee Westwood also charged through the field on the last day with a 63 to finish on eight-under. McIlroy, under constant pressure from those ahead of him and playing partner Tom Gillis, had to wait until the eighth for his first birdie of the day. He dropped a shot at the 12th, but retrieved it with a birdie at the next to give himself a cushion playing the ""Bear Trap"" holes of 15, 16 and 17. The U.S. Open champion duly completed that test in level par and he played safe on the 18th for a par-five to wrap up his third PGA tour title. ""First and foremost it's just great to win this tournament,"" McIlroy said. ""It was tough today, especially seeing Tiger make a charge. I knew par would probably good enough today, that's what I was trying to do."" The 43-year-old Gillis birdied the 18th to tie Woods for second, two back, for his best finish on the tour.","Rory McIlroy wins Honda Classic tournament in Florida .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Imagine abandoning your own children because you can't afford to feed and clothe them. It's a parent's nightmare that in Greece, mired in economic crisis, is increasingly becoming reality. Kassiani Papadopoulou, 34, from Athens, is a single mother, unemployed and unable to care for her three young children. Because of the poor economic climate in Greece, she felt she had no choice but to leave them in a care home, which she tries to visit every few weeks. ""It's really difficult, really tragic for a true mother to leave her children,"" she told CNN. ""But when you understand they are not at fault and deserve a future, it's better to make a move like this, than have them beside you without even a plate of food."" After years of recession, and biting austerity measures, including job cuts and tax rises, Greece is in financial despair. The Hellenic Statistical Authority, which compiles data for the state, said the unemployment rate in the first quarter of the year was 22.6%. It also said 27.7% of the Greek population is on the verge of poverty or facing the danger of poverty. The numbers don't include groups like Roma, who are Gypsies, illegal immigrants, the homeless and institutionalized people. The country's heavily indebted economy is dependent on bailout funds from the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? But that troika is demanding deeper cuts to social spending, creating what social workers are calling a wave of ""economic orphans,"" abandoned not through lack of love, but money. ""I think this is the first time I've seen so many poor families asking for help for their own children,"" says Stelios Sifnios, director of SOS Children's Villages, a European charity providing support for struggling Greek families, including orphanages. The authority lacks a count for economic orphans, but one of its statistics signals potential problems for families. It says 22.9% of all types of families with children under the age of 18 are on the verge of or face the danger of poverty. ""Before the economic crisis, the majority of our kids came from problem families, with parents who were drug addicts or alcoholics. Now most new arrivals are from families who can't afford them,"" he adds. Kassiani says she wants to take her children home, but can't afford it. ""I feel powerless for being unable to stand on my own two feet,"" she says, blaming successive Greek governments for her predicament. ""For me, its all those who govern. They've all looked out for themselves instead of the people and the poor like us, who should be the responsibility of the State."" But in Greece, the state can barely afford to care.

"(CNN) -- Meeting planner Gail Murphy heard about the travel warning to Mexico too late in the day on Monday to do anything about her plans to head to Cancun the following day. Alberto Morales wore a mask on his flight from Mexico City to Denver, Colorado, on Monday. ""I'm in good health,"" said Murphy, who is heading to the Eighth Annual Mexico Showcase and Travel Expo from her home in Shelburne, Vermont. ""I'm a risk taker, so I'll go anyway."" In light of the swine flu, the U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning against any non-essential travel to Mexico. The move could potentially devastate an already struggling tourism industry in the country. The World Health Organization urged countries not to restrict international travel or close borders, as such measures would not in themselves stem the outbreak. Efforts to contain the outbreak by restricting travel would be unlikely to work without ""draconian measures,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency's assistant director-general. But he said people who are ill should put off trips abroad, and people who fall ill after a trip should see a doctor. Mexico is the epicenter for the swine influenza virus outbreak. More than 100 deaths in Mexico are being investigated as possibly tied to the outbreak. The WHO confirmed 73 cases of swine flu Monday, but health officials in Scotland, California and Texas confirmed nine more, bringing the worldwide total to 82. Reports of the illness in Mexico couldn't have come at a worse time for the country's tourism industry, which is already grappling with negative publicity about drug-cartel fueled violence. ""They were having a terrible time anyway with all of the problems on the border and now to be hit with this, too,"" said Barbara Nassau, owner of New York-based In House Travel Solutions. She added that the outbreak has the potential to hamper travel similar to the way it was affected when bird flu hit China. iReporter Dyana Pari Nafissi works in international business development in Mexico City and said tourism in the country had already been dealt a blow by fears of violence. iReport.com: Watch Dyana discuss what's happening in Mexico . ""We've been on a steady decline since the first U.S. travel warning about the drug cartels,"" she said. ""When you look at the kids that braved [that travel warning], and now they are back [in the U.S.] and they are sick. It's devastating to the economy here."" Some of the confirmed cases in the United States were high school students who recently returned from a trip to Mexico. News of the outbreak didn't seem to overly concern travelers arriving Monday at Denver International Airport on a Mexicana flight from Mexico City. Two Mexicana crew members who didn't want to be named said about 60 percent of the passengers wore masks during the flight. Ernesto Vargas, a Mexican businessman, didn't wear a mask. ""I thought about carrying one with me, but the crew wasn't wearing a mask. So we asked them, and it seemed quite safe."" Alberto Morales, another businessman, said he wore a mask in the Mexico City airport and on the plane. ""Yes. I have a mask, and we are using the mask."" Is he concerned? ""Don't worry, I am OK,"" he said with a laugh. ""People are afraid about the flu, but we have many precautions and the government has a good sense for this trouble,"" Morales said. Ian Jeffries, a spokesman for Expedia.com, said the company had no data as of Monday on cancellations or changes caused by fear of swine flu, but added that it was prepared to aid any of its customers that had concerns. ""Expedia is currently offering to waive Expedia-imposed change and cancel fees for hotel and air reservations originally booked to Mexico,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and modify our policy accordingly."" Several major U.S. airlines also are waiving fees for those who want to change their travel plans to Mexico. Jeffery Brown arrived at the airport in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday after spending five days in Cancun with his wife. They saw people in surgical masks but didn't notice any widespread concern. ""My wife and I were a little concerned, but you know we haven't seen anybody sick in our resort, and we haven't seen anybody sick at the airport,"" he said. ""Nobody said a word about it [at the resort]."" Mexico isn't the only country that potentially has a tourism headache on its hands. Cases of swine flu have also popped up in Canada and Spain as well as the United States and Scotland.  Watch how businesses might be affected by swine flu » . Steve Weakland, border security coordinator for the United States Customs and Border Protection  Atlanta field office, said all of his personnel have received illness recognition training. If a traveler exhibits symptoms of the disease, CBP employees have been trained to inform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further investigate. ""Our guys are more the recognition aspect of it,"" Weakland said. ""We wouldn't make any diagnosis or anything along those lines."" Teresa Roberts planned to take her mom to Akumal, Mexico, for Mother's Day and said she was more worried about traveling to New York for business than she is about contracting swine flu south of the border. ""Just because of the number of different travelers that go through the airports in New York from all around the world,"" said Roberts who flies about two or three weeks a month  from her home in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'm not nervous about going to Mexico at all."" Many in the tourism industry appeared to be taking a wait-and-see approach. Disney Cruise Lines, which does not sail into Mexico, said it is closely monitoring the situation, as did officials for theme parks including Universal and Sea World in Orlando, Florida. Meg Barton travels several times a year to Mexico from her home in Round Rock, Texas, and also isn't overly worried. Because of her father's recent heart surgery, she is already an avid hand washer and is always cautious about germs when abroad. ""I don't drink a lot of water in Mexico ever, and I am really more concerned about the drug issues in Mexico than I am the swine flue,"" Barton said. ""We take antibiotics and Pepto with us when we travel."" Eric Meyer of Lafayette, Colorado, flew in to Minneapolis-St. Paul with his wife and baby to visit family in Minnesota and lamented that ""It's out there, but what can you do?"" ""Wash your hands maybe and call it good,"" he added. ""Put a mask on? [I'm] not gonna go that far and be that guy yet."" Rochelle Yates said a client of her New York City-based Yates Travel is planning to take plenty of antiseptic products on an upcoming trip to Cancun. Most seasoned travelers know to guard against infectious disease ordinarily, Yates said. ""My clients are people who travel all over the world, and they know that you have to take precautions regardless,"" Yates said. ""You have to wash your hands no matter where you are, if you are on a cruise ship, in a hotel or even in your own house.""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni troops raided a third al Qaeda stronghold in a southern province, killing 40 suspected militants, authorities said Friday. The troops entered Shaqra town in Abyan province. Militant leaders fled, leaving behind large caches of heavy artillery, according to two security officials who did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Most of the town is under government control, and troops have surrounded militants and given them a deadline to surrender, the defense ministry said. The operation comes three days after government troops retook Jaar and Zinjibar towns from the militants. Government forces killed more than 80 militants during the operation in the same province, the officials said. . Most of the militants have been forced to find safe havens amid an escalated crackdown, said Ahmed al-Ashwal, the Yemeni chief of staff. Militants are trying to regroup In Azzan, an al Qaeda-controlled town in neighboring Shabwa province, officials said. Clashes with troops there Thursday killed 17 militants, three local security officials said. The clashes are inching closer to Balhaf, home of Yemen's strategic gas and shipping port. Yemen is intensifying its fight against al Qaeda after a year-long political crisis allowed the militant group to seize large areas in the south.

"(CNN) -- Anti-government protests across Syria -- one propelled by the funeral of an assassinated Kurdish opposition leader -- turned deadly again Saturday as security forces cracked down, activist groups said. Mashaal Tammo, a spokesman for the Kurdish Future Party and a member of the newly formed Syria National Council, was shot dead Friday at a private residence in the northeastern city of Qamishli. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said after Tammo's funeral, more than 50,000 people joined a mass demonstration demanding the overthrow of the government of Bashar al-Assad. It said two people were killed. The group said a 14-year-old child was killed in Damascus province and 14 others were injured when security forces opened fire on a funeral procession for protesters killed Friday. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria reported a different toll. It said five people were killed in Qamishili. Another two died in Hama; one in Douma; and one in the Damascus suburb of Dumair. Meanwhile in London Saturday, five protesters were arrested outside the Syrian Embassy. A spokesman for London's Metropolitan Police said three people were arrested after climbing the roof of the embassy and two others were taken into custody for separate incidents related to the protest. There was no breach of security, the spokesman said. In Qamishili, anti-government activists were also staging a general strike to mourn Tammo, the LCC said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported Friday that he was killed by ""an armed terrorist group."" Local activists said he was slain by members of a pro-government militia. Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, condemned the assassination ""in the strongest terms,"" in a statement Saturday. ""Mr. Tammo's death follows other targeted assassinations in the past days, which are totally unacceptable. These appalling crimes further add to the EU's grave concern over the situation in Syria. All those responsible for and complicit in these crimes must be held accountable,"" the statement said. Tammo had previously spent more than three years as a political prisoner for his criticism of the Syrian government, it added. In Istanbul, Turkey, several dozen Syrians gathered in a hotel basement to remember Tammo. ""The regime is trying to play a game of ethnicity so people fight each other,"" said Omar Shawaf, a Syrian opposition activist. ""Mashaal Tammo was someone who represented unity of ethnic groups. This dirty regime will not keep quiet until they destroy the country and create a civil war."" Mourners relied on some of the same technology that has publicized the uprising in Syria, a country where the media is strictly controlled.. ""The government tried to kill him one day before his murder and one month before his murder,"" said Abdul Ghafar Mohammed, speaking via Skype from Qamishli. ""Now Tammo has become a flame of the revolution."" In Arabic, Tammo's first name, Mashaal, means flame. The EU's Ashton also condemned the beating of opposition leader Riad Saif and urged an end to all violence to allow for a peaceful transition to democracy. A White House statement Friday said Saif was subjected to a ""vicious and unprovoked assault."" The LCC described the attack on Saif, who was beaten in the Damascus neighborhood of Medan, as a ""dangerous development"" and said the Syrian government was taking advantage of the ""lax attitude"" of the international community to repress political opponents by violent means. The Syrian Observatory said Saturday that tens of military tanks were blocking routes out of the western city of Homs, a day after protests over the death of Tammo were held there. Mobile and landline networks were reported to be down. Clashes also broke out Saturday between security forces and protesters who had pulled down a statue of al-Assad, the LCC said. The United States called Friday for al-Assad to ""step down now"" following the assassination and amid continuing violence in the nation. Assad should resign ""before taking his country farther down this very dangerous path,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in the White House statement. ""It is also notable that these acts of violence took place just three days after the U.N. Security Council failed to pass a resolution calling for international human rights monitors in Syria in face of brutal repression,"" he said, referring to a resolution vetoed by Russia and China. Earlier this week, Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution condemning Syrian authorities for using violence against anti-government demonstrators. The two nations argued the proposed resolution would lead to military intervention similar to the NATO operation to protect anti-government protesters in Libya.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hoping to eliminate a problem before it spreads rather than fighting an outbreak once it's discovered, the USDA announced Wednesday a new tracing method it hopes will protect consumers from eating contaminated meat and poultry. The new strategy changes how meat and poultry processors and the U.S. Department of Agriculture trace E. coli contaminated food in the U.S. food chain. According to the USDA, if food safety inspectors find E. coli during routine sampling, they will now move quickly to identify the supplier and target removing the tainted product from store shelves. CNN.com Health library: What is E. coli? Additionally, new regulations require meat and poultry processors, farmers and retail establishments to have recall plans in place, notify federal officials within 24 hours if a contaminated product is found and requires better documentation of how they controlled the hazardous meat. According to data on the Centers for Disease Control's website, multistate outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are reported about four to six times a year on average in the United States. Currently, officials are fighting an outbreak of salmonella from contaminated tuna that has been reported in 24 states and Washington. According to the CDC, 258 people have been infected nationwide. Yellowfin tuna tied to salmonella outbreak . The FDA says better tracing will help government officials collaboratively find contamination sources before outbreaks start. According to the CDC, around 48 million people, or one in six Americans get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die each year from foodborne diseases.","USDA announces a new tracing method for contaminated meat, poultry .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey mother pleaded not guilty Wednesday to child endangerment charges after being accused of illegally allowing her 6-year-old daughter to tan at a salon, according to prosecutors. Patricia Krentcil, 44, was arrested on April 24 and later released on $25,000 bail following the alleged incident, said Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutors say Krentcil allowed her daughter inside a stand-up tanning booth at a salon in the northern New Jersey town of Nutley. It's not clear when the incident is alleged to have taken place. Krentcil's attorney said the charges are unfounded. ""Forget about the presumption of innocence. My client is 150 percent innocent,"" John D. Caruso told reporters Wednesday. ""She loves that child more than her own life and would never, ever, allow her child to go inside a tanning bed."" He said that Krentcil allowed her daughter to accompany her to the salon, but never allowed the girl into a booth. New Jersey law makes use of artificial tanning facilities by children under the age of 14 illegal. Children over age 14 can use tanning equipment only with permission of a guardian.

"(CNN) -- Newer threats, such as pirate skiffs chasing freighters and desperate regimes mining harbors, have intensified the U.S. Navy's need to handle an array of ""real-world"" scenarios. Meeting the challenges requires robust training on the use of sonar and explosives and the testing of gear that will protect shipping and counter traditional naval forces. The environmental impact of those technologies resurfaced Friday with the publication of new estimates on the number of whales and dolphins off Hawaii and California that could die or be injured as a result of their use. The U.S. Pacific Fleet, in a draft study, said the use of sonar and explosives in those regions from 2014 to 2019 could cause up to 200 deaths and 1,600 injuries each year, including hearing loss, among marine mammals. The death estimates are based on the use of explosives or animals being struck by ships. But, Navy officials told CNN, those numbers -- a result of mathematical modeling -- are worst-case scenarios. ""We believe ... with our mitigation efforts and the Navy commitment that those injuries and mortalities will be none,"" said John Van Name, U.S. Pacific Fleet senior environmental planner in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The National Marine Fisheries Service requires such data before it issues permits the Navy needs to conduct training and exercises. The Navy contends improved mitigation efforts, including the posting of lookouts and the practice of turning sonar power down or off when marine mammals are spotted, are making a difference. And, they said, today's sailors are boarding vessels with environmental sensibilities. ""They have the awareness the entire nation has,"" Van Name said. ""And they bring it with them. "" At a time when officials expect training and testing to likely increase in the deep, blue waters off Hawaii and California, environmentalists are keeping a wary eye on the Navy. ""I am not saying they are not well-intentioned,"" said Zak Smith, staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""But I am not sure their choices make them the best environmental stewards they could be."" The debate over sonars and whales has gone on for years. It centers on balancing the need to defend the United States, while safeguarding its natural resources. It has also played out in court. In 2008, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted sanctions placed on the Navy over its underwater sonar testing. Environmental interests, said Chief Justice John Roberts for the majority, ""are plainly outweighed by the Navy's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines."" Smith argued that the use of lookouts aboard Navy ships is not fully effective. ""Most marine mammals don't spend much time at the surface,"" he said. ""When they do, you better have good weather conditions to see them."" Smith points to other consequences from the use of sonar and other acoustic sources off California and Hawaii. Government estimates for 2014 to 2019 indicate there may be about 2 million cases of temporary hearing loss among marine animals, Smith told CNN. ""Marine mammals use hearing the same way we use sight"" to find food, he said. ""This kind of constant barrage and harassment is not a recipe for healthy populations,"" Smith added. Van Name challenged Smith's assessment, saying the 2 million number includes all behavioral and ""temporary"" responses, such as an animal turning its head, stopping feeding or moving out of the area. ""The animal fully recovers,"" Van Name said. The report also indicated monitoring in 2009-2010 off Hawaii and Southern California showed 162,000 marine mammals with no evidence of distress or unusual behavior during Navy activities. The older Navy analysis, for 2009-2013, estimated about 110 marine mammals would be injured or killed in Hawaii and California. Van Name and Alex Stone, environmental impact statement project manager with the U.S. Pacific Fleet, urged caution when making comparisons between the studies. They cited additional research, a wider geographic area, updated computer models and different study areas in the new analysis. ""It is clearly not our intention to harm any animals,"" Van Name said. Three, perhaps four, dolphins, died in 2011 during a Navy training exercise involving underwater explosives near San Diego. The area had been cleared but dolphins moved in too late for divers to be able to turn off a charged timer, Stone said. ""The dolphins were at the wrong place at the wrong time."" After the incident, the size of the mitigation area was increased. ""We learned from this lesson and moved forward,"" Stone said. ""The limited impacts we are expecting are to individual animals, not to the species population,"" he said. Smith, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is trying a different approach. The agency is identifying marine mammal ""hot spots"" with a high population density, Smith said. The Navy, he said, should do a better job of not using disruptive sonar and explosives in such zones. Van Name said the Navy already identifies areas for special protection, including a humpback whale sanctuary off Maui. Crews also are aware of calving season and areas. The Navy is seeking public input over the next 60 days as it moves forward in the permit process. ""We encourage the public to engage with us so we can do a better job,"" Van Name said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- It was a public relations battle featuring two well-known masters of the media, a beauty queen, and a controversial question: Should someone born a man be allowed to compete in the Miss Universe pageant? On the East Coast was Donald Trump, the New York business tycoon whose fortune and brand is boosted by his ability to navigate storms of controversy. On the West Coast was Gloria Allred, a Beverly Hills lawyer legendary for her ability to draw hordes of cameras to her law office to capture her outrage over alleged injustices done to her clients. The client is Jenna Talackova, a 23-year-old, 6-foot-1-inch blond Canadian, who underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago. Talackova won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for Canada's national title, but she was then told the Miss Canada Universe pageant in Toronto on May 19 was only open to ""naturally born females."" ""I am a woman,"" Talackova said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in Allred's conference room Tuesday. ""I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust."" Allred attacked Trump, who owns and controls the Miss Universe franchise, for questioning Talackova's sexuality. ""She did not ask Mr. Trump to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male,"" Allred said. How she became a female is not important, she said. ""The Miss Universe competition is designed to find the one person in the world whose human qualities make them worthy of the Miss Universe crown and title,"" Allred said. ""Jenna is beautiful in every way. Her life story will undoubtedly inspire people throughout the world."" Talackova, in a 2010 interview, said she knew she was a girl at age 4. She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19. Trump, warned of Allred's attack when the lawyer alerted reporters Monday afternoon that she would hold the news conference, shifted his pageant's position in an announcement Monday night. Talackova could compete provided ""she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions,"" the Miss Universe Organization said. Trump's maneuver didn't appear to temper Allred's outrage. ""The last-minute statement by Mr. Trump's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue,"" she said. ""Instead of stating clearly that Jenna will be allowed to compete, Mr. Trump qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous."" She asked Trump for ""a clear answer -- not a wimpy, wishy-washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank."" Allred didn't know it then, but Trump gave a clearer statement to CNN in New York two hours earlier. ""We went by the laws of Canada and the laws of the United States, and those laws say that she should be allowed to enter the pageant,"" Trump said. ""So she will be entering the Miss Canada pageant."" When read Trump's new statement, Allred paused for several seconds and said ""I stand by my statement. We want this rule eliminated."" ""We want a clearer statement that this rule will be eliminated,"" Allred said. ""Step up, say it loudly, say it clearly, this rule will never be in effect again for anyone."" Allred declined to have Talackova react to Trump's decision to let her compete. ""Sorry,"" Talackova whispered to a reporter, apologizing for her silence. Allred would not say if her client still intended to compete in the pageant. Controversy over pageant rules is not new for Trump. The media stir over Miss California Carrie Prejean's same-sex marriage comments at Trump's Miss USA pageant three years ago raised the profile of that competition. Prejean, in response to a question from a judge, declared her opposition to same-sex marriage. Trump initially said Prejean could keep her Miss California title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. He eventually fired her for ""contract violations,"" including missed public appearances. Allred has affected more than beauty contests. She hosted several news conferences in 2010 to reveal evidence that Meg Whitman, who was then the Republican nominee for governor of California, employed an undocumented worker. The October surprise hampered Whitman's campaign at a crucial time in her race against Jerry Brown, who won the election.

"(CNN) -- In print advertisements, which comes first -- the word or the image? The brief for Harley Davidson parts and accessories was to encourage more riders to personalize their bikes. The popular answer to this question would be either can come first, but I'm going to stick my neck out and say it's the visual. If for no other reason than to create discussion. It does all depend on who is asked and what period of time they worked in advertising, but we're in 2008. I am, after all, an art director, so that may explain my opinion. Any kind of print advertising should be treated as an art form. That's how it all started many years ago and is still true today at its best. Print advertising is always so much more interesting when it's visual. It's a piece of printed medium that is there to be explored, studied and then rewarded. My first example for Harley Davidson parts and accessories does exactly that. The brief was to encourage more riders to customize or personalize their bikes. Quite a simple brief really, but when you're asking someone to put their artistic stamp on a bike, it's a little dull to do it through words alone. Hence, the visual of a face made out of many Harley parts and meticulously art-directed at the same time. The line ""Build Yours"" came after the visual idea. It's a good line that acts as a signature to the picture. No fancy words needed. Just simplicity. The next example is equally as simple. It's an ad for Sony In-car speakers. Sony makes damn good speakers with an amazing sound, and they wanted to tell everyone that. However, everyone talks about sound, and when they do it in print it hardly ever comes over as believable, mainly because a print ad has no sound attached to it! So rather than talk about the sound, the ad talks about the experience that comes with the sound. If you know your music, then you'll recognize the famous Bob Dylan album cover ""Freewheelin'."" Print advertising can be very effective when it subverts what people already know. In this case, the album cover is recognizable, but its context completely changes by looking at it from the point of view of an open top car. With clever lighting on the car and fabulous retouching, the car looks like it's in the street where the album cover was shot. The line, ""Get closer to the music"" does all the work in explaining the idea, but the visual does all the emotional heavy-lifting in describing the experience. Once again, the visual came first. As I said at the beginning, opinions will vary and perhaps it's true that either line or visual can come first, but this is based on my own experiences. Maybe someone should write a case for the line?","Any kind of print advertising should be treated as an art form .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters in northern Colorado face another round of nightmare conditions on Monday as high temperatures, low relative humidity and gusty winds whip a blaze near Fort Collins. The High Park Fire has consumed more than 56,000 acres so far, fire authorities said. It is about 45% contained. More than 1,700 personnel were battling the blaze. ""It just feels really dire. It's scary,"" resident Lupe Sandoval told CNN affiliate KUSA TV. ""You feel bad for everybody."" The National Weather Service rates the fire risk in six Western states on Monday as ""critical."" Red flag warnings are posted across 10 states, warning of high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures. The High Park Fire is west of Fort Collins, has destroyed at least 181 homes, according to a statement posted on InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. ""The assessment is still under way and this number will continue to grow,"" the statement said. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed one life, a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. ""It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service and toured the Colorado blaze. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said a tree struck by lightning more than a week ago sparked the mammoth blaze in his state. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling an 11,988-acre fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze is 30% contained. Meanwhile Sunday, a new fire broke out and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy complex has scorched more than 296,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. More than 3,200 fire personnel from across the United States are helping local departments battle the fire that began on May 16. The blaze was 80% contained as of Sunday.

"(Fast Company) -- On Tuesday, Amazon launched Instant Video, a streaming movie and TV service that features more than 5,000 titles. The long-rumored service is offered for no additional cost to members of Amazon Prime, the company's loyalty program, which gives customers all-you-can-eat free two-day shipping for a $79 annual fee, and already boasts millions of members. At $79 a year -- or $6.58 per month -- Amazon's new service is less expensive than subscriptions for Netflix and Hulu, which cost $7.99. Will Amazon's service have a big impact on the latter companies? To some degree, Amazon is now a competitor to Hulu and Netflix, but the competition is indirect. Hulu and Netflix more recently have focused on delivering fresher content to customers. Amazon Instant Video is more or less centered on longer-tail content. Fast Company: More about Amazon . ""It's a mix--movies from Sony and Warner Bros. tend to be a little older, five to seven years, but we've got some more recent movies,"" says Cameron Janes, director of Amazon Instant Video. ""You are not going to find day-and-date movies. You're not going to find brand-new movies in here because the movies are generally older."" The same goes for television. ""We don't have day-after-broadcast TV in our Prime offering,"" Janes says. What's more, in addition to offering newer content, Netflix also offers a much larger library, with an estimated 20,000 titles available for streaming, quadruple Amazon's offerings. In a letter to customers featured prominently on Amazon.com today, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos touted the new offerings, from March of the Penguins to The Dick Van Dyke Show. Of the 18 titles Bezos listed, 16 of them are also available for instant streaming on Netflix. Instant Video appears to be aimed less at Netflix and Hulu, and more at attracting new customers to Amazon Prime. When users search for a movie title online now, they'll will be peppered with benefits of the program. Searching for ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" for example, non-members will see that they can buy the DVD for $15, not including shipping fees, or rent or buy the film via streaming for $3.99 or $11.99, respectively. However, if they become members of Prime -- for only $6.58 a month--they won't have to spend a penny on the film, since it's available on Instant Video. (And if they still want the DVD, there's always free shipping.) Those ramped up benefits might be enough to pull Amazon users over to Amazon Prime. But will it be enough to sway users into canceling their Netflx and Hulu subscriptions? It's too early to say. As Janes says, ""We're just getting started.""

"Paris (CNN) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy courted far-right voters Monday in advance of a May 6 runoff against Socialist Francois Hollande, who won the most support in the first round of France's presidential elections. Sarkozy said he has a ""duty to listen"" to far-right voters after National Front candidate Marine Le Pen attracted a record amount of support in the first round of voting Sunday. ""We must respect the voters' will,"" Sarkozy said Monday, calling the support for Le Pen a ""crisis vote."" Hollande narrowly beat Sarkozy as 10 candidates competed in the first round of the election. Hollande and Sarkozy now go to a second round because no one got a majority Sunday. A poll of 1,004 people shows Hollande with support from 54.5 percent of respondents compared with 45.5 who said they would vote for Sarkozy. The French Institute of Public Opinion said it conducted the poll Sunday night. Sarkozy, of the center-right RPR party, has been a significant figure on the European and international stages since becoming president in 2007. Under his leadership, France has played key roles in international hot spots such as Libya and Syria, not to mention during the pan-European debt crisis, but the domestic economy has been a prime focus of the election. France is struggling in the face of sluggish economic growth and a 10% unemployment rate. Hollande generally supports ""more government action to stimulate the economy"" whereas Sarkozy favors policies such as lowering some taxes and possibly repealing the mandatory 35-hour limit on the work week, said Michael Leruth, who teaches a course about the election at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, through spokesman Georg Streiter, expressed her support Monday for Sarkozy, but said she would work ""closely and well with any elected French president."" Sarkozy is pressing for three debates with Hollande before the next round, accusing the Socialist of ""fleeing his responsibilities"" by saying he wanted only one debate. Aurelie Filippetti, an adviser to Hollande, said Sunday there would only be a single debate, on May 2. ""There has always been one debate, and there's no need for (that) to change,"" she told CNN. The far-right Le Pen, 43, did not specifically direct her own supporters to rally behind or against anyone in the runoff, but on Sunday night, she described Sarkozy as ""the outgoing president"" and characterized her party as ""the only opposition."" ""We have never been as high as this,"" she said, pointing to her showing. ""This is only the beginning. Let us continue to fight."" Her National Front party -- founded and, until last year, led by her father -- has been known for anti-euro, protectionist policies, its stringent positions on curbing immigration and other more right-wing stances that would appear to jibe more closely with the views of Sarkozy than Hollande. Yet Ludovic Dedanne, a Le Pen adviser, accused Sarkozy of breaking promises during his five years in office and said people ""do not trust"" him. He recommended that his candidate's supporters ""abstain"" in the runoff. With all votes counted on Monday, Hollande had 28.63% support, followed by Sarkozy at 27.18%. Le Pen garnered 17.9% of the vote, while Jean-Luc Melenchon on the extreme left had 11.11% and centrist Francois Bayrou had 9.13%. The gap had tightened appreciably from earlier results, when Hollande held a 6-percentage-point lead with just less than half the votes counted. Turnout was 79.47%, officials said. That marks a drop from 2007, when 84% of the nation's voters went to the polls, though key players from both Hollande and Sarkozy's camps described it as a ""strong turnout"" indicative of citizens' high interest in the race. The results appeared to be historic, and a bad sign for Sarkozy. Several high-profile Hollande supporters told CNN that a French president running for re-election has never failed to place first in the first round of the vote. Especially with neither of them close to a majority, who assumes the presidency hinges on what support Sarkozy or Hollande can get from those who didn't back them Sunday. In his speech Sunday night, Melenchon urged his supporters to ""fight against Sarkozy"" -- noting that he's not ""asking for anything in exchange"" from Hollande for siding with him. ""I'm asking you not to drag your feet,"" Melenchon told his backers. ""I just ask you to mobilize."" One year ago, Hollande wasn't even considered by many as the Socialist party's best hope. That distinction belonged to then-International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who polls suggested could challenge and possibly beat Sarkozy. But Strauss-Kahn's political prospects floundered in the wake of sexual assault charges -- later dropped -- after an incident at a New York hotel, as well as accusations he participated in a prostitution ring in France. That helped propel the 57-year-old Hollande, who has never formally held any national elected office, to become his party's presidential choice. He is now aiming to become France's first left-wing leader since the late Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995. French Trade and Tourism Minister Frederic Lefebvre described Hollande as ""the choice of the past,"" with other Sarkozy backers playing up the fact that Francois Mitterand didn't select him as one of his ministers during his 14 years as president, which ended in 1995. Yet Hollande adviser Filippetti said that Le Pen's strong showing suggested that Sarkozy couldn't get those more philosophically aligned with his views to support him, despite his ""aggressive"" efforts. That will leave the incumbent hard-pressed to unite all French, she said. ""The people ... don't trust Nicolas Sarkozy any more,"" Filippetti said. CNN's Hala Gorani, Jim Bittermann, Saskya Vandoorne, Azanie M'Packo and Rachel Ramsay in Paris; Dan Rivers and Justine Redman in Toulouse, France; Diana Magnay in Berlin; and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: An opinion poll shows Hollande leading Sarkozy .

"Paris (CNN) -- A friend of Pippa Middleton's, the sister-in-law of Britain's Prince William, apologized Wednesday for an incident in which a friend of his brandished a toy gun at press photographers in Paris. Arthur de Soultrait said he, Middleton and a friend of his were in a car being followed by paparazzi on Saturday when the unnamed friend waved the toy pistol at the photographers. Middleton ""had no idea he was going to do that and told him to stop immediately. She did not find it funny,"" de Soultrait said in a statement. She had been ""subject to constant and dangerous harassment by paparazzi throughout her time in Paris,"" he said. ""I regret enormously that this incident happened, and especially that Pippa has been subject to subsequent attention through no fault of her own,"" he concluded. Middleton is the younger sister of William's wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. William is second in line to the British throne behind his father, Prince Charles. Photos of Middleton in the car with the man wielding what seems to be a gun caused a storm of outrage which should act as a wake-up call, royal watchers warned. ""This story is very damaging for her,"" veteran London-based public relations expert Max Clifford said. ""There has been nothing but a honeymoon for Pippa since last year's royal wedding, so this is dreadful,"" Clifford said. ""It comes particularly at a time when guns in Paris are such a sensitive issue. The reality is, she could have been shot by police."" Middleton has been a target for tabloid newspapers and paparazzi since her sister married Prince William in April 2011. Shortly after the wedding, personal pictures of the 28-year-old began to leak out to the press, including a photo showing her in a bikini while on vacation in 2006 with her sister and Prince William. A photo of Middleton sunbathing topless on that trip was also made public. Later, undated photos from a private party showing her dancing in her bra were leaked. Lawyers said Middleton was unlikely to face charges over the incident in Paris unless it could be proved that she encouraged the driver to point the gun on public streets, but the driver could face charges of threatening with a firearm. Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the photo because Middleton is not a member of the royal family. There has been a spate of gun violence in France recently, including a series of attacks last month that killed seven people, including three children. The incident took place while security was heightened ahead of France's presidential election. ""Pippa must understand she's in the middle of a media spotlight, and she can't just turn the attention on and off,"" Clifford added. ""I assume she has PR advice, but either she's getting incredibly bad advice, or she's not listening."" The photographer who snapped the shot was ""considering his options"" about a formal police complaint, The Sun reported. The Daily Express' royal correspondent Richard Palmer commented that ever since Middleton became last year's most celebrated bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister, she has been ""riding the crest of a wave of popularity. Some think she has also been riding for a fall."" Palmer said Middleton was popular at high-society events, but she and her friends needed ""to learn how to behave in front of the cameras in return."" The incident ""will have embarrassed her sister, Kate, her brother-in-law Prince William and also the queen in her Diamond Jubilee year. She needs to explain herself and apologize.""","Pippa Middleton was being chased by paparazzi in Paris, her friend says .

"(ArsTechnica) -- Some people still doubt the iPad's chances for success, but current sales rates suggest that the device could rank among top consumer electronics categories within a year. As noted by Bernstein Research analyst Colin McGranahan, consumers are adopting the iPad faster than any other consumer electronics device, including the iPhone and the near-ubiquitous DVD player. ""The iPad did not seem destined to be a runaway product success straight out of the box,"" said McGranahan in a recent note to investors, acknowledging the many criticisms about the iPad's lack of certain features at launch. ""By any account, the iPad is a runaway success of unprecedented proportion."" The iPad's current sales rate is approximately 4.5 million units per quarter, according to Bernstein. That tops the 1 million per quarter that the original iPhone sold at launch, and the 350,000 per quarter when DVD players first launched. If the current rate persists, the iPad could become a $9 billion per year business, blowing right past game consoles and cell phones to become the fourth largest consumer electronics category. That would put the iPad right behind TVs, smartphones and laptops. With numbers like these behind it, it's no wonder that companies like Samsung and Research in Motion are rushing to score a piece of the touchscreen tablet market. With yet more competing products in the pipeline, Apple will have to work hard to translate its first-mover advantage into consistently stellar sales as it has done with the iPod and the iPhone.

"(CNN) -- After three days of testimony, the details and accounts from the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse trial are, improbably, even more chilling and horrific than could have been imagined. Multiple accusers, now grown men, have broken down on the witness stand describing acts of forced oral sex and intercourse, threats and manipulation. Another witness left the courthouse with a black bag over his head, such, presumably, was his level of shame and embarrassment. We respect the judicial process and the presumption of innocence. Yet calling these witnesses ""alleged"" victims, as we must absent a verdict, nonetheless feels callous. While no one would dare imply that his suffering is akin to that of a sexual assault victim, another figure damaged in this sordid scandal took the stand on Tuesday, bolstering the prosecution's case: Mike McQueary. Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know . It is McQueary, of course, who has played a -- perhaps, the -- crucial role in the Penn State narrative since the story broke in November. Then a graduate assistant for the Nittany Lions football team, McQueary was at the Lasch Football Building in 2001, when he heard what he described as ""skin-on-skin smacking sound"" coming from the shower facility. Using a mirror, McQueary could see Sandusky standing behind a boy ""propped up against a wall"" performing a sexual act. Though almost 6 feet 5 inches, and 30 years Sandusky's junior, McQueary did not physically intervene or call the police. He chose only to slam a locker door, as he testified, in hopes of breaking up the incident. The following day, after conferring with his father, McQueary reported what he saw to Joe Paterno, the team's revered coach. Paterno then waited another day to speak to the athletic director. The athletic director then talked to a superior, who relayed the incident to university president Graham Spanier. The allegation lost severity with each retelling. An act initially described as man-on-boy intercourse had become horseplay that made a witness ""uncomfortable."" Initially, McQueary was cast as a villain, the embodiment of the banality of evil. How could he not have confronted Sandusky that evening? Or at least called the cops? And how could he have remained silent as he saw Sandusky in the same football facility and at various functions, sometimes in the company of young boys? As of last fall, McQueary was a prominent Penn State assistant coach. Since then, he has been placed on administrative leave by the school. His coaching career, to say nothing of his reputation, is in tatters. But recently, McQueary has become, at a minimum, a more complex figure. As we have learned more about the insularity of the Penn State football program, McQueary's inaction that evening becomes, if not altogether understandable, at least somewhat easier to comprehend. What's more, CNN is among the news outlets reporting that Gary Schultz, Penn State's former vice president for finance and business, kept a secret file on Sandusky that included e-mails among administrators about inappropriate behavior. This not only contradicts previous statements by administrators; it suggests that McQueary's initial statements in 2001 were more forceful and clear than they've been portrayed. Asked about the incident in the trial, McQueary admitted, ""I've said repeatedly I didn't do anything physically to stop it. It's been well publicized ... Did I pull the boy out of there, did I physically go and assault anybody, did I remove him? ... Physically [I] didn't remove the young boy from the shower or go and punch Jerry out."" McQueary went on to assert that, after 2001, he was so repulsed by Sandusky he couldn't occupy the same room, so much so that other members of the football staff took notice. Why, he was asked, didn't he quit? ""I would never resign from Penn State University,"" he said. As heart-rending as the victims' testimony has been, McQueary's firm and unambiguous account could be just as damaging to Sandusky. The defense will argue that the accusers have embellished their stories, motivated by the financial gain of a civil suit. In the case of McQueary, now 37, it's hard to argue there's a profit motive. Plus, having another adult corroborate the accounts of the many witnesses undermines the defense's claims of conspiracy among the victims. More than a decade ago, McQueary's failure to act with sufficient conviction may have permitted a serial sexual abuser to continue on. If McQueary's honest testimony enables a jury to convict Sandusky, at least he will have made the most of his second opportunity to do the right thing.

"(CNN) -- The interesting news in the latest CNN/ORC International poll that Bill Clinton is pulling a 66% favorable rating among Americans suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt Barack Obama as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months. The question is: Which has he been doing more of lately? The poll was a reminder that Americans tend to be more forgiving of their presidents over time, no matter how long they served, which party they hailed from or how voters may have felt about a commander in chief at the moment he stepped down. Jimmy Carter (54%), George Herbert Walker Bush (59%) and Clinton, who have been out of office between 31 and 11 years, all earned personal approval ratings north of 50%; only George W. Bush, who stepped down three years ago, is below 50%. But even his rating has improved since he returned to private life. Being an ex-president is almost always good for your approval rating. Photos: Secrets of the Presidents Club, from Truman to Obama . The CNN poll appears at the moment when Clinton has once again been playing an outsize role on the public stage, and many have suggested all sorts of theories and reasons for maneuvering. Some have read in his comments about Mitt Romney (he called his business record ""sterling"") a desire to undercut Obama or set the table for a run by his wife, Hillary, in 2016. This analysis gained momentum when Clinton told CNBC that economics demanded that the Bush tax cuts should be extended temporarily. That comment led Clinton to apologize. But the evidence doesn't really support a campaign of sabotage. A simpler explanation for Clinton's capering -- and one that better fits Clinton's record -- is that he is a permanent political consultant. And his ""candidate"" isn't paying close attention to his advice. Clinton is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future. Fighting about who did what in the 1980s, Clinton thinks, is a sure loser. Better to focus on who has the better plan going forward. (Remember the chorus of his campaign song? ""Don't stop thinking about tomorrow."") So he has taken his approach to the airwaves. It is easy to forget that Clinton has differed with the White House in the past about how to frame a political race. In 2010, working through Vice President Joe Biden, he urged Obama to make the case that the president had done a number of things to improve the lives of Americans in his first two years and suggested the president campaign on his record. But the White House resisted this approach, fearing the stimulus and health care reform were not popular enough to brag about and instead tried to make the Republican agenda the issue. Clinton disagreed but (mostly) kept his mouth shut about it. He doesn't seem willing to bite his tongue now. Photos: Clinton's last days in office . Clinton isn't the first president to meddle in presidential politics after his own presidency ended. So great was his dislike of Dwight Eisenhower that Harry Truman couldn't stay out of the 1952 race and even campaigned against Ike that fall. Richard Nixon made life unpleasant for Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primary (and seemed determined to undercut George Bush in 1992, to Clinton's benefit). But Clinton's grudge isn't personal; it's about how best to mount and run a campaign. How much of his personal popularity Clinton will spend to win this argument is unclear, but nearing age 66, as the new poll shows, the former president has time to earn it back.","Bill Clinton is riding high in the opinion polls, with a 66% favorability rating .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- The Mexican Supreme Court has ordered the release of 20 people who were convicted in the massacre of 45 people in 1997. Mexican Mayan Indian massacre survivors reenact the killings of 45 people in Acteal village in this 2003 photo. The court ruled that authorities obtained evidence illegally and that the defendants were denied due process and lacked an adequate defense. The 20 were convicted for taking part in a massacre in the community of Acteal, in the southern state of Chiapas. Four of five Supreme Court justices decided Wednesday to order their immediate release, the court said in a statement. ""It's obvious that the evidence was obtained illegally,"" said Judge Jose de Jesus Gudino. Investigators say 45 men, women and children were killed in Acteal by people who suspected they had links to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, a group that launched a rebellion against the Mexican state in January 1994. It was nearly four years after that rebellion, on December 22, 1997, that the 45 unarmed indigenous peasants were massacred in Acteal. Then-President Ernesto Zedillo  ordered an investigation that eventually led to arrests. In addition to ordering 20 people released, the Supreme Court called for the review of cases involving six others who were convicted in the massacre. Judge Juan Silva Mesa decried the judicial process that led to the convictions. ""For me there is no greater injustice than allowing them, under and in the name of the law, to commit injustice"" and thereby ""affect someone's fundamental human rights,"" he said. CNN's Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.","Mexican high court orders release of 20 convicted in 1997 killings of 45 people .

"(CNN) -- Spain's defence of their European Championship crown got off to an uncertain start as Vicente del Bosque's side had to come from behind in a 1-1 draw with Italy. The World Cup holders lost their opening game in South Africa two years ago against Switzerland and when Antonio di Natale gave Italy a second-half lead another upset threatened. Cesc Fabregas quickly equalised but Sunday's game in Gdansk provided evidence that the winners of Euro 2008 have work to do if they are to become the first team to win three successive major international tournaments. Spain next face Republic of Ireland on Thursday, and the Irish lie bottom of Group C after a 3-1 defeat at the hands of an impressive Croatia in Poznan. Striker Mario Mandzukic scored twice with headers, either side of a Nikica Jelavic goal for Croatia, and Slaven Bilic's side now lead the group with Ireland facing an uphill battle to qualify for the quarter-finals. Spain 1-1 Italy . Spain coach Del Bosque chose not to play a recognised forward preferring to pack his team with creative midfielders -- much like Barcelona -- with the likes of Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Fabreas breaking quickly from midfield. If this formation allowed Spain plenty of possession it was also a tactical set-up that was relatively vwell contained by Italy's organisation. Iniesta tested Gianluigi Buffon with an early shot and later in the first half went close as he tried to lob the Italian goalkeeper, while Leonardo Bonucci well timed tackle prevented Fabregas from testing Buffon. Not that Italy were solely content to sit back and soak up Spain's attacks - far from it -- and Iker Casillas was probably the busier of the two goalkeepers. In the opening half the Real Madrid goalkeeper stopped two shots from Antonio Cassano, as well as an Andrea Pirlo free-kick, though the pick of the Spanish keepers's saves came just before the interval when he reacted quickly to push away Thiago Motta's goalbound header. Early in the second half Mario Balotelli should have given Italy the lead following a mistake by Sergio Ramos but the Manchester City striker dawdled allowing the Spanish defender to retrieve the ball. Almost immediately Italy coach Cesare Prandelli withdrew Balotelli, replacing him with Di Natale. Within three minutes the switch produced immediate results as Pirlo sent Di Natale clear with the Udinese forward curling the ball past Casillas. Italy's goal provoked an equally swift response from the defending champions as David Silva's flick flummoxed the Italian defence allowing Fabregas to sweep the ball past Buffon. Finally Del Bosque decided it was time to bring on a foward, introducing Fernando Torres, who probably should have done better when he was sent clear by Jesus Navas' pass. Soon afterwards Torres was sent clear for a second time but his attempted lob went over the bar. Croatia 3-1 Republic of Ireland . Sunday's second Group C contest was supposed to take second billing, but in torrential rain in Poznan the Croatians laid down a marker for the tournament with a clinical display against the Republic of Ireland. It had been 10 years since the Irish last qualified for a major tournament and their noisy fans seemed keen to make up for lost time, but with less than three minutes gone they were silenced by a Croatia goal. Ireland's marking went missing as Mandzukic was given all the time in the world to head Darijo Srna's deflected right-wing cross into the net, with Irish keeper Shay Given struggling to get across his line. The goal temporarily stunned Ireland but they always carried a threat from set-pieces which eventually brought them an equaliser. Aiden McGeady's wickedly inswinging free-kick from the left caught Vedran Corluka cold at the back post, as Sean St Ledger sneaked in to head past Croatia keeper Stipe Pletikosa. It was the Croatians' turn to look rattled but the game was opening up beautifully as both teams saw the value in going for victory and three vital points with matches against holders Spain and Italy still to come. Croatia coach Bilic leaves his post after the tournament after a successful six-year spell in charge and three minutes before half-time, he saw his team take a lead that this time they would not relinquish. More sloppy Ireland defending led to Stephen Ward slicing a clearance straight into the path of Jelavic, and as he showed last season at Everton, the striker is a deadly finisher inside the penalty area as he clipped calmly over Given. Soon after half-time it was all over as a lightning-quick Croatia break led to Mandzukic's header coming back off the post, hitting Given on the back of his head and -- unfortunately for the Ireland goalkeeper -- rolling into the net, though the Wolfsburg forward was given the goal. Ireland tried hard to find a way back into the match and Robbie Keane had an appeal for a penalty turned down, but Croatia were too strong and held on with ease to move top of Group C ahead of a meeting with Italy in Poznan on Thursday.","Defending European champions Spain draw 1-1 with Italy .

"London (CNN) -- Prince Harry tore up the royal tour rule book on his recent visit to the Caribbean, according to veteran royal photographer Arthur Edwards. Edwards should know -- he has covered 200 royal tours, more than anyone. And it was an extraordinary royal tour. The press coverage surpassed even the media's expectations. Harry was himself and it came across on camera. People around the world enjoyed getting to know Prince William's younger brother. A royal tour is a series of engagements. Each event is planned months in advance and the press is briefed on what to expect. But with Harry you never quite know what will happen. You know he will arrive and leave, but there is no way to predict what might happen in between. Watch Prince Harry talk about ""emotional trip"" On March 6, I was in Kingston, Jamaica. The entire royal press pack had agreed that the main event of the day would be Harry meeting sprinter Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world. The plan was for Bolt to give Harry some tips on how to come out of the starting blocks. We wanted to know if they would go on and race each other. The organizers said they didn't know. When Harry arrived, he immediately hit it off with Bolt. They were laughing and goading each other which gave us some great images. Watch Harry take on world's fastest man . But before we knew it, Harry had used a distraction technique to get a head start against Bolt and he raced off to the finish line. The image became front page news in the UK and in other parts of the world. But while Harry is happy enough performing in front of the mainstream media, it's a relationship of tolerance. A senior royal source told me he does have a problem with paparazzi photographers who have invaded his life in the past -- and tormented his mother, Diana. After racing Bolt, Harry set off to meet Portia Simpson-Miller, the staunchly-republican prime minister of Jamaica. We expected a handshake, we got warm embrace. Then, at an inner city school we were treated to a spectacular display of Harry's dancing skills to a track by Bob Marley, who he later impersonated at a state dinner. Harry even made it on to the fashion pages that day with his eye catching blue suede shoes. Harry turns every engagement into an event, and that's what makes him unique as a royal. The royal source told me Harry didn't have a strategy for this tour. ""He just went for it."" But don't assume he's just having fun. This is someone who puts duty first. It's a lesson he took from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, I am told. It was out of duty that he agreed to go on the trip on her behalf. While he enjoyed the tour, for him it is always about supporting the queen and only she would be the judge of whether it was a success. So what did she make of his time in the Caribbean? CNN has learned that everyone, including the queen and Harry's father, Prince Charles, ""was very pleased and proud"" of his performance. The palace source was speaking to CNN for a documentary airing this weekend: ""The Royals: Harry, The Soldier Prince."" It's the first in a four-part CNN series to mark the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth's reign. The source says the Caribbean tour was a milestone in Harry's life. It was the first time people got to see him as a whole rather than in a series of snapshots. The public believe Harry is a special and gifted young man, the source said. He is particularly good at reading situations, and people saw that on display over a period of time. Harry was seen as possessing a confidence and emotional intelligence that allowed him to move naturally from goofing with Bolt, to connecting with a young child to being a statesman. Harry, I am told however, would never see himself as a statesmen. So has Prince Harry finally come of age? Is the man who once wore a Nazi outfit to a party and got into all other sorts of trouble now consigned to the past? The royal source puts it like this: ""The impulsiveness of Harry's youth has turned into the fun you saw on the Usain Bolt track in Jamaica. He has matured."" In another sign of his maturity, CNN has learned that Prince Harry has finally left home. He recently moved out of his father's residence, Clarence House -- where he had a bedroom and study -- into a small flat at Kensington Palace where his brother and sister-in-law live. Harry wanted to have his own place, and the two brothers ""wanted to be together,"" the source said. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and his new bride Kate, are living in Nottingham Cottage at the moment but will move into a large apartment in the main building when renovations are complete. When they move, Harry will take over the cottage. Watch more about William's palace upgrade . Harry recently referred to the Duchess of Cambridge as his ""sister."" It was a slip of the tongue but indicative of the closeness of their relationship, says the source. But it is the relationship between the two brothers that looks set to define the future of the British monarchy most of all. The source tells me: ""Prince Harry and Prince William are a double act for the rest of their lives. They are very loyal and trust each other. Loyalty is key. Harry is very respectful towards William."" I am told the brothers are also aware of their different, but complementary qualities. William has gravitas. Harry is livelier. William, second-in-line to the throne, is due to be king one day, but this could be decades away. When it does happen, the monarchy is likely to be a slimmed down version of what we see today. There won't be an array of siblings and cousins sharing official duties. The two Princes know they will bear the brunt of responsibility for royal engagements, so it needs to be a partnership. But Harry's current priority is his military career. His only official duties for the rest of this are likely to be occasional appearances to mark the queen's diamond jubilee and as an Olympic ambassador. Harry came out as the top gunner on his recent Apache helicopter course. He wouldn't have accepted the award if he thought it was bestowed on him because of who he is, my source tells me. Read more about Harry's helicopter training . The prince loathes being treated as anything but an ordinary officer. His military colleagues say they often forget his royal status. The army provides Harry with normality. According to a friend who trained with Harry, he even has a nickname which goes back to his time at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst: Harry Potter. The prince is currently preparing for redeployment to Afghanistan. His last military mission to the country was cut short when news leaked that he was on the ground. The media strategy this time round is still being worked out, but news blackouts aren't seen as viable anymore in an age of social media, so this deployment may well be announced. But if the Taliban knows that he is there, won't that make him and his regiment a target? It's a matter for the military but my senior royal source tells me: ""The thinking is that being an Apache pilot is quite an anonymous job and the Apache is already a target. They can't be more of a target than they already are."" The palace doesn't see a need for Harry to have extra personal security in Afghanistan either because his military base will, by its nature, already be secure. Harry says he has three hats: soldier, prince and 27-year-old with buddies. He endeavors to be himself whichever hat he is wearing, and that's what defines him. At different points in his life one hat will be more important than the others, which is why right now, he is the Soldier Prince.","Prince Harry different to other royals, says veteran snapper Arthur Edwards .

"(CNN) -- Health coverage is easy to get if you're healthy. The problem is when you're sick or have a history of illness. For decades, people with life-threatening chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease or stroke faced numerous barriers to getting the care they needed. Insurers could deny coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition, terminate coverage when the cost of a patient's care exceeded arbitrary dollar limits, or raise premiums to unaffordable levels in response to a diagnosis. As a result, patients had to skip or cut short their treatment because of costs, or go deeply into debt to pay for needed care. The patient protections enacted into law in 2010 are changing that, enabling more Americans to afford lifesaving care. These protections provide patients with the best chance to beat their illness. When fully implemented in 2014, they will require insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions, eliminate dollar limits on the coverage a patient can receive and ban the practice of inflating premiums for people with health concerns. The law makes these protections possible by requiring that most Americans buy health insurance. By ensuring that coverage extends both to healthy people, who are less expensive to insure, and to those who are sick, who cost more, the law helps to keep costs down for those who need care the most. Unfortunately, the ""individual responsibility"" requirement has been attacked as unconstitutional, posing a grave threat to the law's critical patient protections. Federal appeals courts are divided on the issue, and the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on the matter this week. Opinion: Health reform could survive loss of individual mandate . Our organizations, which represent tens of millions of people across the country with life-threatening chronic diseases, together submitted a friend-of-the-court brief asserting that the individual responsibility provision is essential to preserving the protections that patients desperately need and deserve. We already know what a health care system without such a requirement looks like: Many healthy Americans opt not to buy health coverage until they are ill, and costs skyrocket as insurance pools fill with people in urgent need of treatment and care. People with pre-existing conditions are charged exorbitant rates for health coverage, putting critical care out of reach for many American families. As a result, many people with a chronic illness must resort to emergency room care, which lowers their chances of surviving their illness and drives up costs system-wide. Opinion: Why health care reform law is unconstitutional . Many of those who want the individual responsibility requirement struck down also express support for the patient protections that the provision makes possible. Several states have tried such an approach by enacting insurance protections for patients with pre-existing conditions without compelling healthy people to enter the insurance market as well. These states are now among the most expensive in the country in which to buy insurance, and two of them, Kentucky and New Hampshire, ended up repealing those protections because of increasingly unaffordable premiums. Half of all non-elderly Americans are living with a pre-existing medical condition. They need the protection from discrimination by insurers that the Affordable Care Act provides. Our hope is that the Supreme Court will enable all Americans to benefit from the promise of access to guaranteed, affordable and adequate insurance. It is a promise our nation must keep. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Brown, Larry Hausner and John Seffrin.","Writers: Health coverage easy to get if you're healthy, not so if you're already sick .

"(CNN) -- As the world knows, peace can sometimes be fleeting. One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow. After scoring against the Thunder in the second quarter, World Peace was cheering his own shot when he hit the Oklahoma City guard in the back of the head, knocking him down. Watch the NBA.com video of the hit . Harden was on the floor for several minutes, and did not return to the game after being diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Thunder. World Peace was ejected from the game and faces possible suspension. The Lakers won 114-106 over the Thunder in double overtime. ""During that play I just dunked on (Kevin Durant) and (Serge) Ibaka, and I got really emotional and excited. It was unfortunate that James had to get hit with an unintentional elbow,"" World Peace told reporters after the game. ""I hope he's OK. The Thunder, they're playing for a championship this year, so I hope that he's OK and I apologize to the Thunder and to James Harden,"" he said. Hours later, World Peace tweeted that he watched the replay again: ""Oooo .. My celebration of the dunk really was too much ... Didn't even see James ... Omg... Looks bad."" Harden told ABC's Lisa Salters he had ""a little bit of a headache."" On Monday, the Thunder said Harden was undergoing testing. ""Harden participated in a series of limited activities per NBA guidelines, but has additional steps that must be taken under the league-mandated concussion policy before he can make his return to the court,"" the team statement said. ""He will be re-evaluated tomorrow and is currently listed as day-to-day."" World Peace's act was called ""disgraceful"" by game commentators, and sports analysts said the behavior was reminiscent of the ball player they once knew as Ron Artest. ""He has gone to such lengths to rehabilitate his image, and to revert back to this? He lost control,"" said Michael Wilbon, an ESPN analyst. Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest. ""Ron Artest has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace. But it took many years of research and soul searching to find a first name that was both personally meaningful and inspirational,"" his publicist said at the time. Back when World Peace was still Artest and playing for the Indiana Pacers, he made headlines in 2004 for his role in a brawl between players and fans at a Pacers-Pistons game after somebody threw a drink on him. The NBA suspended Artest for 86 games. Fast forward to September 2011, when Artest announced the name change. Even before it was finalized by the court, World Peace was working on making the world a more peaceful place. In 2011, he raffled off his 2010 NBA Championship ring to help mentally ill youths. For his work with the youth, he was given the NBA's citizenship award for philanthropic work. A star turn on ""Dancing With the Stars"" garnered the basketball player a new legion of fans. But in the world, peace sometimes comes with a price: The NBA is now reviewing World Peace's less than peaceable actions.","NEW: The Oklahoma City Thunder says James Harden is undergoing testing .

"(CNN) -- Protesters and activists demanding justice for slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin are no closer to closure, even with the news that second-degree murder charges were filed against shooter George Zimmerman. The charges were the latest development in a heated national debate over race and justice in America. The debate on CNN iReport mirrored a national outcry, which saw thousands taking to the streets in ""Million Hoodie"" marches, demanding that formal charges be filed against Zimmerman. ""Justice for Trayvon"" was a common refrain on the placards of street protesters, and in the comments section of CNN and other news and media websites. There was also a countervailing opinion of skepticism about the murky details of the case. Before the charges against Zimmerman were filed, many expressed concern over how the case was playing out in the court of public opinion, saying that judgment should be withheld until the legal system had enough time to render a proper verdict. Reaction to the charges against Zimmerman has been mixed, with many iReporters and CNN commenters expressing a mixture of relief, puzzlement and disappointment. Anthony Milian, an iReporter from Greenville, South Carolina, said he believed the special prosecutor in Florida made a just decision in filing the charges but was also quick to note that this development does not mean that justice will be served. ""The Trayvon Martin situation is not the first time a black child has been gunned down for suspicious reasons,"" he said. ""The violence toward black people needs to stop, regardless of whether someone wears a hoodie, wears gold caps in their mouth, or has a style that you deem dangerous or stupid."" W.J. O'Reilly of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, said he was skeptical of Florida's judicial system. ""It will be very difficult to convict him on second-degree murder charges,"" he said. ""I don't have too much faith in Florida justice, given the Casey Anthony debacle."" Other iReporters and CNN commenters wondered whether manslaughter charges would have been more appropriate. Kathi Cordsen of Fullerton, California, noted that Zimmerman's admitting to shooting Martin could soften the charges, especially since he voluntarily turned himself in. She said she also was mistrustful of the way the case has been portrayed in the media. ""The prosecutor said public pressure and media coverage did not contribute to the charges being filed,"" she said. ""I find that hard to believe."" On February 26, the 17-year-old Martin was shot dead by community watch officer Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. The black teenager, who was wearing a hoodie and who was unarmed, was walking to the home of his father's fiancee when he was shot. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, told authorities the killing was an act of self-defense. A national uproar began when Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said on March 12 that Zimmerman had not been charged because there were no grounds to disprove his account of the events. Commenters flocked to CNN and iReport to register their outrage. Thema Bryant-Davis, an iReporter and Los Angeles-area clinical psychologist, echoed the sentiment that racial tension and stereotyping factored in the killing. ""It points to what researchers have termed 'unconscious racism.' People are not even aware of their biases,"" she said. ""Trayvon is dead, and we cannot be silent,"" said Bryant-Davis, whose brother, Jamal Bryant, was an organizer of some protest rallies in Florida. Washington educator and activist Omekongo Dibinga was more pointed in an iReport video titled ""Trayvon Martin dead. Am I next?"" in which he shared his experiences with racial stereotyping and related them to the Martin shooting. ""Most black people, like me, put themselves in Martin's shoes because it's what we've had to deal with,"" he said. ""Most whites put themselves in Zimmerman's shoes because they've seen black men before and have been suspicious of them. Few try to step outside of their shoes."" New York videographer Albert Trotman attended a ""Million Hoodie"" march in his city and captured an emotionally fraught interview with a protesting mother and son. ""This could be Trayvon,"" the hoodie-clad mother said, nodding to her son as the wail of police sirens tore through the night air. ""We're all Trayvon's mother, as far as I'm concerned."" She added, ""I have two sons -- one of them is 22; this one is 13. Any of them could be in the same situation. I could be in the same situation."" As more facts in the case emerged, the conversation shifted to the controversy surrounding Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows for the use of deadly force in cases of self-defense. Defenders of the law have said Zimmerman's actions were legal and justifiable on these grounds, while critics argue that such laws precipitated Martin's death. New York iReporter Patrick O'Connell expressed support for ""Stand Your Ground"" and similar laws, citing the safety of his two young daughters. He said he wanted to feel like his house was secure and did not want to be defenseless if it were ever broken into by an intruder. ""If you don't have a gun, then how are you going to protect yourself from someone who is armed?"" he asked. Patrick Ingram of Arlington, Virginia, said he felt differently, calling these laws ""scary."" ""As an African-American, I could be walking home from a bar somewhere late at night and someone could look at me and shoot me and not be prosecuted to the full extent of the law because of this rule,"" Ingram said. Nick Swann, an iReporter from Rochester, New York, decried what he saw a ""rush to judgment"" in media outlets' coverage of the shooting and protests and said he hoped to see due process properly play out. ""Can you imagine what this world would be like if we took the law into our own hands, made decisions without due process?"" he asked. ""We would have no world."" But even though legal proceedings are now in motion, Egberto Willies of Kingwood, Texas, expressed bitter disappointment at how long they take, describing the arrest as ""anticlimactic and late."" ""Justice was delayed because of who Trayvon Martin was: A black kid who, as far as the justice system was concerned, was of lesser value. There was so much that was done wrong with this case,"" he said. ""The United States has displayed what many already know: There are two justice systems in America.""","iReporters and CNN commenters react to George Zimmerman's arrest in Trayvon Martin's death .

"(CNN) -- Europeans are revolting -- against their leaders and established political parties, against an austerity plan 'made in Germany', and against a future that promises declining living standards and shriveling public services. Within the past few days, Greeks have fled to opposite ends of the spectrum, with significant numbers voting for far-left and far-right parties that were but specks on the political landscape two years ago. The French turfed out the president who wanted to make them more competitive and less indebted -- and voted for a candidate pledged to reversing the recent rise in the retirement age. Two million voters deliberately spoiled their ballot papers after the leader of the far-right National Front said that's what she would do. In local elections in Britain both parties in the ruling coalition were rebuffed. The left and protest groups did well in Italy's local elections Monday, with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party taking a beating. Comedian Beppe Grillo, who wants Italy to default on its debt, took 21% of the vote in the city of Parma. And in Germany Sunday, Chancellor Angela Merkel was snubbed in a state election -- voters apparently weary of Germany's hard-earned ""fiscal rectitude"" being tarnished by those spendthrift Mediterranean types. Even if Europe is financially out of intensive care -- after a series of summits that basically endorsed Germany's blueprint for the future and sought to stabilize the banking system -- the economic and employment outlook remains grim. In response to popular discontent, the rhetoric is changing: less stress on austerity, more on engineering growth. Hence Merkel's olive branch to France's new Socialist President, Francois Hollande: ""We are talking about two sides of the same coin -- progress is only achievable via solid finances plus growth."" But one Merkel ally -- Volker Kauder of the Christian Democrats -- was less tactful. ""There will not be new public programs to boost activity, such as the (opposition) German Social Democrats and Francois Hollande are calling for,"" he told a German newspaper. Hollande has vowed not to endorse the European Union's treaty on fiscal discipline without new growth initiatives. If he means it, the markets won't like it. Chances are, according to Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group, that it was fodder for the campaign trail. ""His EU growth agenda means little in actual policy substance,"" Bremmer wrote Monday. ""A shift in policy rhetoric, which German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already been tacking toward, should prove sufficient to keep relations on track."" So, discard a crisis in Franco-German relations, and look for a vague compromise instead -- plus a guerrilla war on whether the European Central Bank should be in the stimulus business. Whatever government is formed in Greece, and it will likely be a makeshift coalition, it won't push Europe into diluting the medicine. The options for whoever takes office in Athens are stark: stay the internationally-prescribed course and receive further support; or go cold turkey and exit the eurozone. The Greek electorate, after seeing their incomes fall (on average) by nearly one-third in three years, are in a foul and volatile mood. And next month, whoever is in power in Athens has to find another $15 billion in spending cuts to keep international creditors happy. This might politely be described as uncharted waters. The old parties of center-left and center-right are short of a parliamentary majority even if they agree to combine, while Golden Dawn, replete with its neo-Nazi symbolism and threatening a war on immigrants, suddenly has 21 deputies. The headline in the Greek newspaper Ta Nea Monday, with no hint of hyperbole: ""The Nightmare of Un-governability."" Essentially, the European politicians so reviled by the voters have little room to maneuver. Neither Germany nor the financial markets will entertain increased borrowing or backsliding on targets to cut deficits. German proposals for labor reforms to make Europe more competitive are a long-term enterprise. So is chipping away at public debt that has swollen over the past decade and more. In Greece and across much of Europe, younger voters are suffering the highest rates of unemployment and are flocking to the political margins. In the 17 countries of the eurozone more than one-tenth of the labor force is idle, according to the latest statistics from Eurostat. Fifty one percent of Spaniards under 25 are out of work while Italian unemployment hit a 12-year high in March. Spain's new Conservative government has intensified spending cuts and is putting pressure on the spendthrift regional governments to get their budgets balanced. In January, the central government had to step in to ensure the city of Valencia could repay a $160 million debt to Deutsche Bank, while Spanish banks have suffered a sharp rise in bad loans, and property prices continue to crumble. Italy's situation is similarly parlous. Its technocratic government is trying to identify spending cuts to avert a rise in the top rate of sales tax (known as VAT) to 23%. The government expects the economy to contract 1.2% this year -- hardly the sort of performance that will get people back to work. Writing in the Financial Times last October, former British Prime Minister John Major described a European scenario that seemed like the economic equivalent of Edward Munch's ""The Scream."" The southern states ""must devalue their living standards and promote reforms to enhance efficiency. This will take years. Meanwhile, wages must fall, unemployment will rise and social unrest will increase. The severity of this medicine may not be bearable in a liberal democracy."" And when Major was prime minister, he was never one to exaggerate.","Political leaders who supported austerity, cuts suffer election defeats across Europe .
Anti-austerity votes seen in France, Greece, UK, Italy and even Germany .
Far-right, far-left and protest groups do well .
But whoever is in power austerity seems to remain the key economic policy ."
"(CNN) -- When the blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng staged his astonishing escape from house arrest, he sought American protection at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Six days later, when Chen left the embassy for a local hospital, it looked as if U.S. officials had found a solution that, as the State Department put it, ""reflected his choices and our values."" One official at the U.S. Embassy said Chen was so grateful for America's help that he told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the phone, ""I would like to kiss you."" But the picture is starting to change, with signs emerging that the Obama administration failed to effectively protect Chen. Did the United States betray the Chinese human rights lawyer? The United States said a deal with China would set Chen free and allow him to relocate within the country along with his family and attend a university. But Chen has told CNN that the U.S. government let him down. The United States insists the activist left the diplomatic compound willingly and wanted to remain in China. However, Chen said he fears for his life, his wife's safety and wants to leave the country. More troubling, he claims that U.S. officials, instead of extending their protection, pressured him to leave the safety of the embassy. If this is true, it is a dark mark of shame for the United States. Until now, President Obama had a mixed record on human rights. This was an important test for an administration that has favored pragmatism over emotionally satisfying displays. Chen's unexpected request for shelter at the U.S. Embassy created a terrible dilemma for Washington. Months ago, Clinton had already spoken on his behalf, as human rights groups characterized his detention as wholly illegal. But Chen's escape to the U.S. Embassy came at the worst possible moment, with Clinton about to visit Beijing for high level meetings on other crucial issues. America's relationship with China is complicated, to put it mildly. The United States needs Beijing's cooperation on Iran and North Korea. China is one of America's top trading partners and its top creditor. The Chinese government does not take well to lectures on human rights, saying that they are a hypocritical construct of the West and are used for political purposes. Even if the issue has merit, Beijing says, it would be an internal matter; none of America's business. Chen, who has been blind since childhood, is a self-taught lawyer. He became a fierce advocate for the poor and disabled and gained attention when he exposed abuses of China's one-child policy, uncovering the brutality of lower level officials who carried out forced abortions and sterilizations on thousands of poor Chinese women. Initially, Beijing heard his case and even arrested some of the offenders. But Chen said Beijing's actions amounted to very little. As his international profile rose and he redoubled his commitment to empower the people before the government, Chinese authorities turned against him. In 2006, the Chinese government sent Chen to prison on charges that he disrupted traffic and damaged property, charges that he denies. After he left prison four years later, he and his family were placed under harsh house arrest. Human rights groups say they endured daily beatings and a near-starvation diet. On April 29, under cover of darkness, Chen climbed the wall that had been built around his house. His blindness meant the dark gave him an advantage over the scores of security personnel that kept watch over him. He had led his captors to believe he was ill, and they lowered their guard even more. Once over the wall, a network of activists helped him, with one of them, He Peirong, driving him 300 miles to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. She is now under arrest. When President Obama was asked about Chen, he said he was aware of the situation but refused to address it, saying only, ""Every time we meet with China the issue of human rights comes up."" Obama disappointed human rights activists early in his administration when, for example, he resisted coming out strongly in support of pro-democracy activists in Iran, claiming it would not be helpful to ""meddle"" when hundreds of thousands took to the streets. He was criticized for canceling a meeting with the Dalai Lama, and after he finally met him, for having him leave through a back door to lower the profile of the meeting, in order to sooth China. His continuing support for some dictatorships and tepid, inconsistent positions on the Arab uprisings have also spurred criticism. At the same time, his pragmatic diplomacy appears to have borne fruit, most notably in Myanmar. And human rights activists say he has come a long way since his earlier stumbles. The Chen case, however, could become iconic. If the Obama administration cannot explain what went wrong, it will have opened itself to criticism from human rights advocates and from Republican rivals, that he badly fumbled. The Chinese government has demanded an apology from Washington for helping Chen and for interfering in Chinese domestic affairs. But the Obama administration, which claimed it had stayed true to American values in the Chen case, needs to prove that it has the moral strength to stand up for one courageous individual who sought help. This is not just about Chen. It is about universal principles of human rights, really, and about America's willingness to defend them on the global stage. The whole world is watching.

"(CNN) -- Each year, more than 3 million Muslims commit to Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that represents the fifth and final ""pillar"" of Islam and the largest annual human gathering on the planet. Every Muslim who is physically and financially able to do so is expected to make this pilgrimage once in their lifetime. As described in the Hadith of Gabriel, each pillar of Islam acts as a guide to day-to-day conduct for Muslims, outlining proper professions to God, prayer and spiritual mindfulness, not unlike the Book of Common Prayer for Anglicans or Judaism's Siddur. For this year's Hajj, iReporters from around the world documented their journeys, describing their experiences as they complete this Islamic sacrament. Thanks to the power of social media and platforms like CNN's iReport, they've been able to share their faith with the world, giving Muslims and non-Muslims alike a glimpse of the significance of this powerful and transformative event. The 2011 Hajj also holds special significance for Muslims in the wake of the Arab Spring this year. Though the pilgrimage has traditionally been thought of as an undertaking for middle-aged or senior Muslims, increasing numbers of young pilgrims have been making the trip to Mecca in the past decade. While on Hajj, Muslim pilgrims travel great distances to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, during the last month of the Islamic calendar, which is tied to the lunar calendar. At Mecca, nestled among the mountains and deserts of the western part of the country, lies the Sacred Mosque. This is the spiritual epicenter of Islam and the location of the Kaaba, the first Islamic house of worship, built by the patriarch Abraham and his son Ishmael. When Muslims orient themselves to Mecca for their five daily prayers, they are praying in the direction of the Kaaba. During Hajj, ""One needs to spend money, exert one's body, behave with character and in all of that turn sincerely to God,"" says iReporter David Coolidge, 32, a Muslim chaplain at Brown University. ""If one can spend a few weeks totally devoted to one's faith, it makes it that much easier to make one's faith a living reality when one is at home and living one's ordinary life."" Jeddah, the ""city of pilgrims,"" the first official stop on the Hajj . As iReporter Amaan Haq explains, Muslims engage in prayer and contemplation at Mecca for several days, undertaking rituals meant to spiritually purify themselves and bring their souls into better alignment with God. ""The major rituals include walking around the Kaaba seven times, drinking from the holy Zamzam Well and holding a vigil at the plains of Mount Arafat led by an Imam, a Muslim cleric, kind of like a priest,"" he said. These observances are then followed by a three-day festival called Eid al-Adha, a global celebration for all Muslims commemorating Abraham's piousness and obedience to God."" Haq, 27, made this year's Hajj with his wife, whom he recently married. He describes his pilgrimage as ""quite breathtaking,"" remarking on the powerful sight of people from all walks of life gathered in the same ceremonial garb, for the same purpose. ""I saw people from Brazil, Spain, from China, from Japan -- Muslims from all over the world speaking different languages, coming with their own cultures and ways of doing things, but all gathered here because of their bond with Islam,"" he said. Haq views his Hajj as a powerful renewal of his faith, expressing his awe at the sheer number of people gathered at Mecca and the sense of fulfillment he feels at seeing the Kaaba with his own eyes. ""Islam hasn't been seen in a very positive light over the past decade, but this event really shows how everyone from all walks of life, from all over the Earth, is out here for the same purpose,"" he said. ""It's amazing. There's no type of discrimination here. Everybody is gathered here as one body. There's this powerful feeling of brotherhood and togetherness. ""Growing up in a Muslim family and reading about it or seeing videos of it, none of that helped me grasp what was actually going on. When you actually do it, it's very strenuous. It's hard work. But it's also the most rewarding thing I've done in my life."" Video tour of Mecca . Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, credits the enthusiasm of young Muslims to participate in Hajj to a ""revival, an Islamic awakening around the world, part of which we have seen in the Arab Spring."" Though Muslims in particular may be reconnecting with Islamic values, he notes that a belief in unity, peace and justice is a central principal of all Abrahamic faiths. Awad also believes that in times of global turmoil and economic uncertainty, many young Muslims are drawn to the Hajj out of a yearning for equality and camaraderie. All pilgrims at Mecca are expected to dress and behave in a manner that removes all outward signifiers of wealth or social standing and focus entirely on their spiritual development. ""I think many young people are rediscovering the proud heritage of Islam and that they belong to a higher cause,"" he said. ""And I think more people are going on Hajj now because they want to attach themselves to that higher cause and the higher values that they sometimes see challenged by worldly governments and societies. ""It's a rediscovery of their roots and their identity,"" he continued. ""Hopefully, that strength and momentum and that spiritual charge will help them go back to their societies and play constructive and moral roles in their communities."" Closeup video of pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba, one of the Hajj rituals . iReporter Yousef Awaida, 22, shares this belief in an Islamic awakening among Muslim youth, observing how Mecca during Hajj is a sea of tranquility and unity in one of the most turbulent regions on the planet. ""So many people have all come here for the same purpose: to seek God's mercy and forgiveness,"" he said. ""In reality, many of these people, when not in Mecca, will fight and spill each other's blood. But in this moment, in this city, I have not seen one confrontation. ""Here, Muslims can strengthen the foundation of their faith: Being one people, who worship one God."" That's a sentiment echoed in Amaan Haq's experience while on Hajj. ""I've never really had this feeling in my life,"" he said. ""To know the importance of this landmark, in this city, in this place. To know the history of the people who have been in this place and worshipped in this city -- not just in our lifetime or generation but throughout history -- that's an out-of-this-world feeling."" A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the Book of Common Prayer as a text for Catholics. It is a book of prayers and services for Anglicans.","More young Muslims embarking on Islamic pilgrimage than ever before .

"(CNN) -- International pressure built Tuesday for leaders of the military group that seized power last month from Mali's democratically elected president to restore the nation to civilian rule. The African Union said Tuesday it will impose more sanctions on the country, one day after the Economic Community of West African States slapped the ruling military junta with travel and economic restrictions after last month's coup. The AU supports the sanctions imposed by the ECOWAS in Mali and ""further decided to impose their own sanctions, with asset freezes and travel bans against leaders of the military junta and all those involved in contributing to the 'destabilization' of Mali,"" said Ramtane Lamamra, commissioner for peace and security. The AU also condemned recent attacks in the north by Tuarag rebel groups and declared ""null and void"" any of their statements or demands, adding them and all those involved in attacks in the region to the sanctions imposed. On Monday, ECOWAS imposed a travel ban on the coup leaders and imposed a diplomatic and financial embargo that regional leaders discussed last week, ECOWAS Chairman Alassane Ouattara said. ""All diplomatic, economic, financial measures and others are applicable from today and will not be lifted until the re-establishment of constitutional order,"" said Ouattara, Ivory Coast's president. He said ECOWAS leaders will meet again this week in Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan to discuss the possible activation of troops from member states. ECOWAS had given the officers until Monday to hand over power or face sanctions. Under the sanctions, the five neighboring ECOWAS members will close their borders to landlocked Mali except for humanitarian purposes. Its member states are to deny Mali access to their ports, freeze Mali's accounts in regional banks and suspend Mali's participation in cultural and sporting events. Hours after ECOWAS' announcement, the U.S. Department of State announced that it was imposing sanctions on travel to the United States on those people ""who block Mali's return to civilian rule and a democratically elected government"" and on their immediate relatives. Included are ""those who actively promote Captain Amadou Sanogo and the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy, who seized power from democratically elected President Amadou Toumani Toure on March 21,"" it said in a statement. The United States released a statement earlier Tuesday in support of the West African states, saying it is ""deeply concerned about the ongoing political crisis in Mali."" ""We also urge all armed rebels to engage in dialogue with civilian leaders in (the capital city of) Bamako to find a nonviolent path forward for national elections and a peaceful coexistence,"" said Victoria Nuland, spokeswoman for the State Department. The department warned U.S. citizens against all travel to the country and authorized the departure of non-emergency personnel and all eligible relatives. Senou International Airport in Bamako remained open but ""the availability of flights in the future is unpredictable and depends on the overall security situation,"" the department said in a statement. Before Tuareg and Islamic rebels took control of northern Mali, it had been hailed as a shining example of African democracy, having experienced more than 20 years of democratic government. The impoverished country now has no access to the sea and is heavily dependent on foreign aid. The coup leaders pledged Sunday to hold talks toward the establishment of a transitional government, which they said would organize ""peaceful, free open and democratic elections in which we will not participate."" But the statement did not specify when the talks or the elections would be held. ""The measures taken by the junta are in the right direction, but are not sufficient,"" Ouattara said Monday. Amnesty International has raised concerns about the safety of civilians in the area, citing reports of violence and looting. The warning came as international pressure increased on the military junta that grabbed power last month in Bamako. The Tuareg, who seek a separate homeland in northern Mali, announced over the weekend that they had seized control of the northern regional capitals of Timbuktu and Gao, a major blow to the military government. Both towns are hundreds of miles north of Bamako. ""The armed groups who seized these towns in the last three days must ensure human rights abuses do not occur and where they do, they must take action and remove anyone implicated from their ranks,"" Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty's West Africa researcher, said in a statement on the organization's website. The Islamist group Ansar Dine seized control of Timbuktu after the military stepped down on Monday, said Yehye Tandina, a broadcaster in the city. The streets of Timbuktu were quiet Tuesday, though the city was cut off from the rest of the world; shops and banks had been looted. ""We are surviving on hope,"" Tandina said. ""In reality, there is nothing in Timbuktu."" Military officers led by Sanogo seized power on March 22, overthrowing President Amadou Toumani Toure. The junta said Toure had failed to properly equip soldiers battling the growing Tuareg insurgency. Moussa Ag Assarid, a spokesman for the main Tuareg rebel group, the National Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad, has said the group now ""controls all of northern Mali."" ""We are proud and ready to declare our homeland free from the south,"" he said. ""Now the MLNA wants a nation."" Amnesty said it had received reports from witnesses in Gao of armed men looting homes and a hospital. ""The looting must be halted to ensure that the civilian population can safely go about their lives,"" said Amnesty's Mootoo. In another northern city, Kidal, residents were fleeing their homes, Amnesty reported. According to the organization, more than 200,000 people had fled the north of Mali since the Tuareg uprising began in January. Timbuktu was a thriving commercial hub and a center of Islamic scholarship in the 14th and 15th centuries, and it's home to three clay mosques that date back more than 700 years. The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization urged the combatants to avoid damage to the sites, which were added to the agency's World Heritage List in 1988. ""UNESCO stands ready to share its expertise and experience to help Mali ensure the safeguarding of Timbuktu,"" Director-General Irina Bokova said in a statement Monday.

"(CNN) -- You could likely count on one hand the number of writers who could scare the daylights out of you as effectively as they could cheer you up. And there aren't too many fingers on that hand representing those writers who could do both in the same story or even on the same page and convince you that they know what they're doing. Overheard on CNN.com: Ray Bradbury was 'very down to Earth,' or maybe Mars . Ray Bradbury, who died early Wednesday at age 91, knew what he was doing when he threw you into a dark place leaking menace and dread at every corner and when he lifted you into an enchanted realm bursting with magical properties. Favorite quotes from Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451' At times, these places -- light or dark, weedy or glistening -- were part of a distant past closely resembling Bradbury's Waukegan, Illinois, childhood of blessed summer evenings and portentous autumn twilights -- evoked most memorably in his 1957 autobiographical novel, ""Dandelion Wine."" At others, they were places conceived in a hypothetical future that often looked like a hyped-up version of the present day -- or at least whatever ""present day"" Bradbury happened to be writing. Top five Bradbury films . Think, for instance, of ""The Martian Chronicles,"" a collection of short stories regarded as Bradbury's breakthrough when it was published in 1950, even though he'd been writing and publishing fantasy, horror and science fiction for at least a decade before. Bradbury imagined a red planet whose colonization by Earthlings brings upon its dry terrain both the sweetly nostalgic graces of early to mid-20th-century Americana and some of the harsher aspects of human nature -- disease, war, bigotry and so on -- over time wreaking irrevocable havoc upon the native Martians and their civilization. News: Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury dies . Bradbury was hardly the first to use the medium of science fiction -- or as its more serious followers prefer, ""speculative fiction"" -- to engage social issues. But his success in bringing his futuristic Gothic tales to such publications as Esquire, the Saturday Evening Post and Mademoiselle broadened the audience for science fiction and elevated the genre's standing in the literary mainstream. My last conversation with Ray Bradbury . Wherever he was published, whatever he wrote about, Bradbury spoke to his readers in a style described by critic Gilbert Highet in his introduction to the 1965 collection, ""The Vintage Bradbury"" as ""a curious mixture of poetry and colloquialism ... so brisk and economical that it never becomes cloying, so full of unexpected quirks that it is never boring."" Interview: Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels' Some disagreed. Even Highet conceded in the same paragraph that he ""occasionally"" found Bradbury's writing ""a little too intense and breathless."" Still others griped that they found Bradbury's blend of robust affirmation and astringent gloom too glib and calculated to please as wide an audience of soreheads and romantics as possible. But Bradbury's more intelligent and incisive readers found greater resonance in his writing than his deceptively simple approach evoked on the surface. Rainn Wilson, others tweet tributes to Bradbury . One such fan was the Argentine fabulist and poet Jorge Luis-Borges, who in his introduction to his Spanish-language translation of ""The Martian Chronicles, asked: ""What has this man from Illinois done, I ask myself when I close the pages of his book, that episodes from the conquest of another planet fill me with horror and loneliness?"" And there was nothing calculated or contrived about Bradbury's blend of optimism and pessimism. The man who once wrote a guide entitled ""Zen in the Art of Writing"" (1994) embraced all his contradictions -- light and dark, elegist and gadfly, dreamer and skeptic -- as one with a universe whose perils and possibilities he greeted with the same open-hearted wonder. ""I prefer to see myself,"" he told an interviewer for the Paris Review in 2010, ""as the Janus, the two-faced god who is half Pollyanna and half Cassandra, warning of the future and perhaps living too much in the past -- a combination of both. ""But,"" he added, ""I don't think I'm too overoptimistic."" What did Bradbury mean to you? Share with us on CNN iReport!

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani judge sentenced Osama bin Laden's three widows and two daughters on Monday to 45 days of house detention for living illegally in Pakistan, the widows' lawyer said. The judge ordered that after their term, the five be deported back to their countries of citizenship, said Amir Khalil, the lawyer. He said the time served began March 3, when the five were formally arrested or taken into custody, and that they would all be released by mid-April. The widows -- identified by U.S. and Pakistani officials as Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar -- have been in Pakistani custody since U.S. Navy SEALs raided bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad and killed the al Qaeda leader in May 2011. The daughters are ages 17 and 21, Khalil said. Since all five defendants confessed to impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying illegally in Pakistan, there was no need for a trial, said Khalil, who added that his clients would not appeal the ""lenient"" sentence. They will serve their sentence in the Islamabad residence where the trial took place, Khalil said. A source familiar with the widows' case said last week that the Yemeni government has expressed willingness to let Fateh, bin Laden's youngest widow, return home. Saudi Arabia, where the other two women are from, has been resistant. The judge also fined each of the defendants 10,000 rupees, or about $110, Khalil said, adding that the fines had been paid in court. Bin Laden spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children -- at least one of whom was born in a government hospital, Fateh has told Pakistani investigators. A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. ""While we may never be able to corroborate every detail, generally speaking, bin Laden's wife's account seems plausible, and it confirms some previously held theories on where the al-Qaeda leader was hiding over the years,"" a U.S. official said about the widow's account. In the January 19 police report, Fateh said she had always wanted to marry a holy warrior. When word of plans for her arranged marriage to bin Laden came in 2000, she flew to Pakistan, crossed the Afghanistan border at Quetta and went to Kandahar. She said she did not recall exactly when, but she was married before the 2001 attacks on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. She lived with bin Laden and his two other wives until the attacks. The family ""scattered"" after that, she told police. She said she returned to the southern port city of Karachi with her eldest daughter, Safia, and stayed in an apartment for eight or nine months. She said that ""all the things were arranged by some Pakistani family and Saad,"" bin Laden's eldest son. They moved six or seven times in Karachi before she reunited with bin Laden in the border city of Peshawar. They moved to the Swat Valley, living in two houses over an eight- or nine-month period. Next, they shifted to Haripur, also in northern Pakistan. Fateh's daughter Aasia was born there in 2003 and son Ibrahim the next year. Fateh said she stayed in a hospital on both occasions. They settled in Abbottabad in 2005 and stayed there for six years before bin Laden was killed. Fateh gave birth to two more children in Abbottabad -- daughter Zainab was born in 2006 and son Hussain in 2008. Fateh said two families, whom she called the Ibrahim and Abrar families, stayed with them while they were in Swat, Haripur and Abbottabad, and ""everything was arranged by them."" She said some members of those two families were killed in the raid, as was bin Laden's 20-year-old son, Khalid. She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan. CNN asked Pakistani officials in Washington, in e-mails and over the phone, whether they had any knowledge of Fateh's movements and got no response.","The 5 will be released in mid-April, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- An intensive weekend search of rugged terrain near Los Angeles failed to turn up evidence of a missing FBI agent, but authorities continued searching for the man there and elsewhere, an agency spokeswoman said Monday. Special Agent Stephen Ivens appeared to be distraught and may have been suicidal, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said, citing interviews with family members and evidence collected by investigators. She declined to elaborate. Ivens, who works on counterterrorism cases, was last seen by family Thursday night, a police statement said. His FBI-issued service revolver is also missing, Eimiller said. Investigators and volunteers working for local police, as well as about 50 FBI agents, had searched the rugged Verdugo Mountains after bloodhounds tracked his scent in the area, according to authorities. Authorities have since scaled back, but have not ended, the mountain search, Eimiller said. ""We're not ruling out that he may have gone in a different direction,"" she said. Ivens is white, 6-feet-tall and weighs approximately 160 pounds. He wears prescription glasses, police said, and is described as having brown hair with a receding hair line and brown eyes. FBI agent Steven Gomez told CNN affiliate KCAL that he could not expand on Ivens' duties beyond that he handled ""national security-type"" work.

"(CNN) -- All eyes this week are on North Korea, which looks set to move forward with a provocative long-range missile launch. Last month, Pyongyang announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between Thursday and April 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of its founder, Kim Il Sung. Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch -- which would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions -- as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. And a South Korean intelligence report says it's likely to precede a nuclear test, as it did in 2006 and 2009. Pyongyang insists its intentions are good and have invited foreign journalists, including CNN correspondent Stan Grant, to view the secret launch site. CNN on Monday interviewed Jim Walsh, an international security analyst from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on ""Starting Point"" to help explain the tense situation: . CNN: This whole parading the journalists through -- letting people see -- is this Kim Jong Un bragging internally? Is it sending a message to the international community? Both? Jim Walsh: It's a good question. Often when North Korea acts out, its purpose is to communicate with the broader world, communicate to the United States or to Japan or South Korea. This is really about internal messaging, being able to go to its own public and say, ""Look, all these Western journalists are here, we're really important, we're really a big deal."" And why do I say it's internally driven? Because they are going through a political transition. This young guy, this 20-something-year-old, has taken over for his father (Kim Jong Il), and he's in the middle of trying to consolidate his position. And it's the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth. ... They've been planning big events for years now for this. So this is all about regime legitimacy and talking to the North Korean people and the military, the elites in the military. CNN: CNN saw what appears to be a satellite. I think most of the media there agree that there definitely is a satellite for this rocket, to launch this satellite into space. ... We also know that this is a country that has nuclear ambitions, no matter how nascent it is or successful it might be. Walsh: Yes, well, you know, this missile is not the greatest missile in the world. There are two characteristics if you have a modern missile program: One is solid fuel, and the other is a modern-guidance system. This missile has neither of those. And four tests, four long-range missile tests over like 15 years, is not a very active missile program. It's more like a tube filled with gasoline than it is anything else. The big worry is they're going to fire it up there, and it will get wobbly on them and start to veer off course like the last two did. That's the real concern I have: not the missile itself but that the missile might stray into foreign airspace and that Japan or South Korea might feel inclined to shoot it down and then suddenly we're off to the races with an international incident. CNN: Are we looking at a scenario where we're going to see a couple of missiles get launched or troops marching down to the (demilitarized zone)? Should people be legitimately scared about this? ... Walsh: Well, I think it is about trying to impress the family and the military. I don't think they're going to march a lot of people toward the DMZ. I think that would be provocative. Certainly, you could see other missile tests. That's a good question. They've done that in the past, short-range missiles. But I'm afraid what we're really looking at here, further down the road, is there's going to be the missile test, then there's going to be international reaction, and then (North Korea) is going to have to push back. So I would not rule out a nuclear test sometime later this year if this continues to ratchet up. CNN: This is obviously very provocative behavior by the North Koreans, even after there was just this highly publicized deal for food for this starving country. So what's the point? What are they trying to do? Walsh: That's the $100,000 question, and we really don't have an answer here. Now I know lot of people who have been following this over the years. They sort of think this is the same old, same old -- that we cut a deal and they've broken the deal; they got something, but they didn't live up to their promises. Well, that's not what's happening here. There was a deal, and we really hadn't given them anything yet. We haven't given them the food aid. So that tells me one (of) two things happened. Either there was some misunderstanding about the contents of that deal -- the Americans thought one thing, the North Koreans the other -- or maybe that deal got back to Pyongyang and then ran into trouble there. Maybe the military pushed back, or there was something else going on. But at this point, we don't know the reason. If we had an answer to that question, that would tell us what's going on inside North Korea. It's the most opaque society in the world -- more than Iran, more than any other place on Earth -- so we really don't know what's going on.","North Korea appears moving ahead with plans to launch a long-range missile .

"(CNN) -- Here's a fact that may surprise people: Garbage collecting is one of the most dangerous jobs you can do. A bulldozer shuffles more trash on to a heap on a landfill in Macedonia. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the people who collect our trash are carrying out ""high-hazard"" roles. And staggeringly, they are three times more likely to be killed at work than the police or fire services are, according to Toxicsaction.org. Much of this could have to do with a fairly basic fact: the majority of our trash goes to landfills, and landfills have been accused of (among other things) being breeding grounds for disease. If landfills do leak, leachate -- a toxic substance -- is released into the groundwater and soil, leading to the possibility that local drinking water supplies could get contaminated. And one of the contaminants that can potentially escape into the water supply is vinyl chloride, a human carcinogen. According to Toxicsaction.org, there have been higher incidences of liver cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among adults that live within close vicinity of landfills -- while children have been known to be born with birth defects. Modern landfills are now installed with filtering systems, so they in theory shouldn't leak at all. But as far as the old ones are concerned, that's not always necessarily the case, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report in 1987 which said: ""eventually all landfills leak"". 'Landfill gas' Aside from leachate, there is, of course, the massive environmental risk associated with landfills. Landfills give out what is commonly referred to as ""landfill gas,"" made up 50 percent to 60 percent methane and 35 percent to 40 percent carbon dioxide (CO2). Methane is more than 20 times more powerful than CO2 when it comes to heating the atmosphere, scientists say. And landfills are releasing enough of it to earn them the title of biggest methane producers in the world. (The world's methane levels have also tripled in the last 150 years, according to PlanetArk) According to the EPA, in 2000, global landfills accounted for more than 730 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent -- representing more than 12 percent of global methane emissions. (The United States, Africa, Eastern Europe and China together contributed 42 percent of the world's landfill-generated methane emissions.) And the figures are going to keep growing, the EPA says, by 9 percent between 2005 and 2020. Just 1 million tons of waste in a landfill produces enough methane, that if you removed it from the atmosphere, the EPA says, it would be the same as taking 8,800 cars off the road. Waste varies by nation . The amount we send to landfill varies vastly from one country to another, but in sheer number of tons, the clear leaders are China and the United Staes. According to United Nations figures, the U.S. sends 53.4 percent percent of its municipal waste (222 million tons) to landfills, while China is catching up, with 43 percent of its waste going to landfills (148 million tons). (China has a growing waste problem, with now 65 percent of its cities on the edge of landfills, according to Time.) It is estimated that the U.S alone could have around 10,000 abandoned landfills which are a potential hazard to those that live nearby. But according to the United Nations Environmental Protection Programme (UNEP), that number could be even higher. According to UNEP, ""tens of thousands of square kilometers of land"" worldwide have been contaminated to date by inadequate landfills and the unsafe handling of hazardous waste. The agency says the U.S could have as many as 40,000 of them, with six European countries having another 55,000. (According to WasteAge, less than 10 percent to 15 percent of closed U.S. landfills ever get redeveloped.) The developing world's landfill problems are getting increasingly severe, too, UNEP says. It points out that in Latin America, two-fifths of landfills that exist ""do not meet even minimum standards, and are little more than rubbish tips,"" UNEP says. While in Africa, anything up to 80 percent of solid waste is left out in the open, presumably untreated. Some governments around the world have come to the conclusion in recent years that securing old landfills -- by redeveloping them (or regenerating, as it is known) into something else -- is better than doing nothing at all. Landfills have been redeveloped over the years with varying degrees of success. (Around 70 golf courses in the U.S. used to be landfill sites, according to WasteAge). According to the Scotsman newspaper, a landfill site in Glasgow has drawn ire from locals over the years who suspect that it's toxic waste could be responsible for Down's syndrome births in the surrounding areas. The locals have more reason to be cheerful these days, however, since the local county council decided to transform it into the UK's largest urban forest. Liverpool is another city in the UK that was heralded for its decision to build a park on top of its old landfill. Even Fresh Kills, in New York, which before its closure in 2001 was given the accolade of the world's biggest landfill (covering 3.5 square miles, with 225-feet high towers of trash and allegedly viewable by space) is being primed for development as an urban paradise -- although it could take up to 20 years to bear fruit. According to the Sierra Club, the Center for Urban Restoration Ecology (CURE), lacking the funding to fully regenerate the Fresh Kills site, set out to see if it could prompt natural forces to take care of it for them back in the early 1990s. CURE planted a small number of trees and shrubs to attract birds, bees and small mammals to it in the hope that they in turn could drop more seeds to develop it further. (As CURE's director said in an interview with Sierra Club, ""We wanted to find out if we could enlist the birds as landscape architects."") All seems to be going well there so far. But in Thailand, it's another story and perhaps there is a lesson here for any governments looking to regenerate their landfills on a more ambitious scale. Cracks have been appearing in the runway at Bangkok Airport, according to Time, delaying take-offs and disrupting schedules. It turns out Suvarnabhumi International is sitting on a landfill -- which may be sinking. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- FARC rebels in Colombia say they will release French journalist Romeo Langlois on Wednesday, according to a statement posted on a website linked to the armed leftist insurgent group. The France 24 journalist was seized last month in a FARC attack on a Colombian army unit engaged in counter-narcotics operations. His capture came almost exactly two years to the day after he did a special report on whether the guerrillas could keep fighting after their leader and a top military commander were killed. Langlois, a correspondent with more than 10 years experience in the country, appears to have spent several days with a mobile FARC unit to prepare the April 2010 report. He described them as ""in a weak position"" and said they were ""tired of fighting for 40 years in the jungle."" He was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked and captured him on April 28, the Colombian government said. Four people were killed and six were wounded in the attack, according to the Ministry of National Defense. Langlois was lightly wounded in the arm when he was captured, but was treated and is out of danger, according to a man who claimed to represent the rebels. The man in military garb referred to Langlois as a prisoner of war in a video posted on the France 24 website on May 7. FARC announced a week later that it was prepared to release the Frenchman and called for negotiations involving the International Committee of the Red Cross and others. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said his government would do whatever was necessary to guarantee Langlois' release. ""The Colombian government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible, but if you really want to be viewed well by the world, release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him,"" he said earlier this month. Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. While severely weakened in recent years, the rebels have continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: France 24 journalist Romeo Langlois was wounded when captured, rebels say .

"(CNN) -- Alabama prosecutors will seek the death penalty against a grandmother who authorities say forced her granddaughter to run as punishment for eating chocolate, an official said Tuesday. Joyce Garrard, 46, is facing a capital murder charge in her granddaughter's death, said Heather Rickles, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office in Etowah County, Alabama. Authorities say Savannah Hardin died last month after her grandmother and stepmother forced her to run around the family's house for three hours as punishment for lying about taking a chocolate candy bar. A grand jury also indicted stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin, 27, on a felony murder charge, Rickles said. That means she will not face the death penalty if convicted. Dani Bone, an attorney representing Garrard, told CNN affiliate WBRC that the allegations were false. ""I think it makes for good newspapers, it makes for good television. It think it's absolutely unfair to this family who again have lost a child, a grandchild and now they have two family members who were falsely accused and wrongly incarcerated,"" Bone said. Last month, attorneys for Hardin said she was devastated by her stepdaughter's death, and urged the public to disregard rumors and assumptions. ""Unfortunately, whenever a child passes, our society wants to place blame, our media wants to sensationalize and our elected officials want to make grandiose statements that are not based on facts,"" attorneys Morgan Cunningham and Vincent Pentecost said in a statement. Authorities said the girl had a bladder condition that could have been worsened by eating the candy, according to WBRC. ""It is alleged that the grandmother was out in the yard with Savannah, and she was encouraging her with the words, 'Move it! Move it! Move it!' -- much like a drill sergeant,"" Natalie Barton, spokeswoman for the Etowah County Sheriff's Office, told CNN last month. At one point, prosecutors say Savannah was crawling, crying and begging to stop, WBRC reported. Barton told HLN's Nancy Grace, ""That young body simply could not take it. That is child abuse. (Garrard) overstepped (the) line."" At about 6:45 p.m. that day, Hardin called 911 and said Savannah had suffered a seizure and was unresponsive, Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin said in a news release. Savannah died last month at Children's Hospital in Birmingham. A state pathologist ruled her death a homicide. ""Preliminary reports show Savannah was extremely dehydrated and had a very low sodium level,"" the release said. Several people had seen the third-grade student at Carlisle Elementary School outside in her yard running, but at first they didn't suspect anything, said Barton. ""In the initial reaction, who thinks that it's a punishment when you see a 9-year-old out in the front yard running?"" the spokeswoman said. ""It was a beautiful day here that day, she was probably just simply outside playing. ""(Neighbors) didn't start putting two and two together until they saw the medics arrive at the house."" Marcus Reid, assistant district attorney in Etowah County, called Savannah's death ""one of the most serious cases we've ever had."" ""We've had too many children die because parents and stepparents and people responsible for them don't do what they should do,"" he said last month.","9-year-old Savannah Hardin died after she was forced to run for eating chocolate .

"Freetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) -- Jabati Mambu has lived all his adult life without his right hand. He was only 15 when rebels of the Revolutionary United Front swept through Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. In their signature, sinister style, they hacked off Mambu's hand with a machete. Mambu, now 28 and a goalkeeper for Sierra Leone's amputee football (soccer) team, was one of thousands of victims who felt huge relief Thursday after an international tribunal convicted former Liberian President Charles Taylor on 11 counts of aiding and abetting the rebels to carry out war crimes. Taylor convicted in The Hague . ""I think this should send out a very big message to those who want to commit crimes,"" Mambu said. ""People will listen, even if they don't care, and they will know what has happened today is important for us victims."" Those who suffered in Sierra Leone's notoriously brutal civil war reveled in the fact that Taylor was finally held to justice for the bloodshed, an act of accountability that had seemed implausible to many. In the diamond-mining region of Kono, where much of the atrocities took place, almost everyone has a story to tell about the rebels, who the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded were supported militarily by Taylor. ""Things went bad, but this will let people know that it will not go unpunished,"" said the Rev. Sahr Christian Fayai, head of the Human Rights Commission in Kono. Fayai saw loved ones die, children abducted, women raped and homes burned. ""My experience was very bitter. I lost everything in a heartbeat,"" he said. The verdict, he said, will help heal the wounds. Or at least begin healing. The court found Taylor guilty of abetting murder, rape, conscripting child soldiers, sexual slavery and mining diamonds to pay for guns in the decade-long war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. Who is Charles Taylor? It has been another decade since Sierra Leone emerged from violence. But another Kono resident was still too afraid to speak openly. He had seen hell and lives in fear of retribution for telling the world about it. During the worst of the war, he and his family walked by the cover of night to escape across the Guinea border. But the rebels caught them and lined them up with others for execution. One of the rebel fighters recognized the man and called him out. He asked his son to point to all those he knew. The boy picked out his father, mother, sister and grandfather. Everyone else was shot to death. ""They killed them in front of our faces. My boy was so terrified -- he was only 5."" Thursday, the man watched a judge read out Taylor's verdict on a television screen in a bank. He stood among amputees and ex-combatants. They felt vindicated: Taylor, they said, had robbed them of their youth and education. They might have been something in life had it not been for him. Justice took a long time coming, the Kono resident said. But it prevailed. ""Now I am waiting to see what will be the sentence,"" he said. ""Will it be a life sentence? We live with the bitterness of war. We can see scars all over."" Opinion: Who really benefits from these trials? In Taylor's homeland, Liberia, the reaction to the court's historic ruling was mixed. Taylor had just become the first former head of state to be convicted by a war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg trials after World War II. In Monrovia, the Liberian capital, a man sported a ""not guilty"" T-shirt and advocated for Taylor's freedom. Others said they want their president back. ""If I want him to come back? Yes. I would be happy,"" said Dennis Zomo. ""I'm a Christian. I don't have any bad mind against him."" Daniel Rogers said he was angry about the bad reputation the world has attached to Liberia. He said the people of Sierra Leone were hardly innocent. ""We did not chop our people's arms during our war. We are not ... wicked enough to chop up people,"" he said. ""We expect that our war crimes court, the court of Liberia, will come here, too, to try people from Sierra Leone."" Added Ali Kemokei: ""I feel there was an international conspiracy. President Taylor never ... went to fight in Sierra Leone."" But not every Liberian was defending Taylor. ""I feel good for Taylor to be guilty,"" said Sekei Duklay, ""because he killed my people, he destroyed this country, so I don't like him. I want they should (put) him in jail for life imprisonment."" Back in Freetown, people gathered at the Special Court Thursday to watch the verdict. Taylor's proceedings were moved to the Netherlands because of fear that the trial might trigger instability in Liberia. How 'blood diamonds' fuel conflicts . In Freetown, Taylor still has a following. ""The court says it is trying those who are most responsible,"" said Elred Collins, head of the Revolutionary United Front Party and the former spokesman for the rebels. ""Every Sierra Leonean took part in the war. In one way or another, they did take part in the war,"" he said. ""So if you would like to bring everyone to justice, I don't know when the case will end."" For Mambu, the amputee footballer, there is no end, either. Not yet. And not for other victims of the war, who said that the conviction of one man was not enough to help get the damaged lives of thousands of others back on track. ""I think more has to be done for the things that happened to us not to happen again, like amputation, rape, burning of houses,"" Mambu said. In Sierra Leone, said aid worker Jennifer Harold, there are bullet holes in all the buildings. And there are bullet holes in the national psyche. In that sense, the verdict was a big victory, said Harold, World Vision's director in Sierra Leone. Change is slow, she said. But with Taylor likely to go to jail, the victims of his war know now that they don't have to be mired in the past. Journalist Damon van der Linde reported from Freetown, Sierra Leone and CNN's Moni Basu reported from Atlanta. Journalist Bonnie Allen contributed to this report from Monrovia, Liberia.","An international tribunal finds Charles Taylor guilty of aiding war crimes .

"(CNN) -- Actor Alec Baldwin told a luncheon crowd at the National Press Club in Washington on Monday what it was like getting kicked off a plane for using his cell phone. ""A very young Asian-American woman, who was a very breathtakingly beautiful woman and very serene, she said, 'Mr. Baldwin, would you gather your things and come with me, please.' And it just kind of had this narcotic effect on me. It was like ... she just spoke very quietly and very calmly. And they threw me off the plane,"" he said. He said it felt like a scene from a Michael Mann movie ""where you would expect really smart writing and great acting."" Baldwin was kicked off the American Airlines flight in December when he was accused of refusing to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed. Baldwin was in Washington Monday to promote federal funding for the arts. In his remarks he pointed out that spending for the arts stimulates economic spending. The ""30 Rock"" actor is currently under contract to promote Capital One Bank. ""Becoming a spokesperson for a bank at the time of the banking collapse and at the genesis of the Occupy Wall Street movement was not a goal of mine in my career,"" he told the crowd. He says all of his proceeds from that deal flow through his foundation and go to arts funding.","Baldwin was accused of refusing to turn off his cell phone on the plane .

"(Mashable) -- As with any high-profile product release, Apple's new iPad device has been peppered with complaints since reaching consumers' hands on March 16. Among them: that magazines look terrible on the iPad 3′s high-resolution display. The complaints were first brought to light by Tumblr blogger Jamie Billett. He pointed out that in the New Yorker's iPad app, the text on some pages is rendered as HTML, and the text on other pages is rendered as an image (.png) file. The latter pages now appear ""badly aliased"" -- i.e. conspicuously pixelated -- throughout the app because the images haven't been formatted to accommodate the iPad 3′s 2048 x 1536-pixel resolution, he complains. (The iPad 2, by comparison, has a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels.) The New Yorker and other Conde Nast title have taken the heat for looking poor under the new display, but they're not alone. Titles from other magazine publishers -- we looked at Time magazine and Sports Illustrated from Time Inc., and at Esquire and O: The Oprah Magazine from Hearst -- all suffered from the same problems. The only exception? Vogue, which launched its iPad edition the same day the iPad 3 hit stores. The title planned its debut in conjunction with the tablet's release, and thus was able to optimize for the iPad's ""retina display"" ahead of time, a Conde Nast spokesperson told us. The spokesperson added that the company is ""working to optimize the rest of our digital edition portfolio over the next few weeks."" But what will the 'optimization' process entail? How much will it increase file sizes? (We noticed, for instance, that Vogue's premiere issue was a full 408 megabytes on the iPad 3, and less than 300 on the iPad 2.) We spoke with Zeke Koch, senior director of product management of Adobe's digital publishing arm, to find out. Adobe's software powers all of Conde Nast's editions for tablets. Magazine publishers who use Adobe's software all begin with InDesign to develop layouts, Koch explained. Those layouts can then be exported in three different kinds of formats: as images (.png or .jpg), PDF or HTML. Different kinds of files -- images, for instance, or video and audio files -- are embedded within those larger file types. Since magazines began publishing on tablets, ""virtually all"" publishers have chosen to export their digital editions as PNG (.png) files, Koch said. ""The primary reason they did that is because the fidelity is perfect. What you see on the desktop when you're designing is exactly what you see on the iPad when you're finished. Images are the fastest thing to load, and if you're trying to create a quick, effortless browsing experience, images are the way to do that,"" he explained. ""That was okay when there was only one screen size -- when you were just working with the iPad 1 and 2,"" he added. ""When the iPad 3 came out, you were now dealing with a device with four times as many pixels."" The iPad 3 applies an anti-aliasing filter to all low-resolution content, which blurs images ever so slightly. As a result, photographs still look about the same on the iPad 3, but the text looks a lot worse -- i.e., visibly blurry, or pixelated. What Vogue did -- and what all other titles will have to do in the coming weeks -- is begin exporting their digital editions as PDFs, said Koch. But what about file size? I pointed out to Koch that Vogue was nearly as large as Wired's first issue for the original iPad. Unfortunately, he said, magazine files will be larger for iPad 3 readers because the image and video files need to be delivered at a higher resolution. Owners of first and second-generation iPads will still be able to download smaller, lower-resolution files, however. A magazine that is around 400 megabytes on the iPad 3 will be around 280 megabytes on the iPad 1 and 2, Koch said. But why not render in HTML? I asked Koch. Wouldn't that make the files smaller, and give readers the added benefit of selectable text? Koch claimed that publishing in HTML wouldn't substantially reduce the file sizes. ""In both cases, you have a bunch of words, and descriptions of where things should be, and multimedia. Those multimedia files are still the same size."" He said the big disadvantage with HTML is that it's ""not very good at layout out things predictably and perfectly."" Rather, it's optimal for helping people create content that will adapt to any size screen. Ultimately, however, Koch believes most publishers will move to HTML as standards improve and as publishers move to publish on a wider range of tablets. So there you have it. Magazine readers need not despair about the appearances of their magazines for too much longer, as publishers are working to optimize their editions. The fix is relatively simple: publishers will have to increase the resolution of their image and video files, and export their digital editions as PDFs. iPad 3 owners will have to suffer longer download times, and won't be able to store as many magazines on their devices as iPad 1 and 2 owners, but that's the price one pays for a visually stunning reading experience, no? © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- The Denver Broncos are in ongoing contract talks with free agent quarterback Peyton Manning, a member of the Broncos organization told CNN on Monday. Manning was released earlier this year by the Indianapolis Colts, the only team for which he'd played in his 14-year pro career. In the subsequent weeks, the Super Bowl XLI victor -- who has been named the National Football League's Most Valuable Player a record four times -- has been hotly sought after by several teams. He did not play during the 2011 season after having surgery to repair a neck injury, and he ended his career with the Colts this month in an emotional news conference. All indications Monday were that the Broncos were the only ones negotiating with the star quarterback, deflating several other teams in the process. The Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans and Arizona Cardinals were said to be among the others interested in signing Manning. SI's Peter King: Bad news for other teams . While the signing hasn't been made final, several Denver Broncos players expressed excitement Monday that Manning had picked their team to join. Running back Lance Ball wrote ""Wow!"" on his Twitter feed, while offensive lineman Ryan Clady tweeted, ""Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" ""It makes you think big,"" linebacker Robert Ayers told reporters. ""If you look at [it] historically, the teams that won the Super Bowl are teams with a guy like Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees and Eli (Manning) and Aaron Rodgers and all those guys. So it definitely makes you confident."" Linebacker Joe Mays, who officially signed again with the Broncos on Monday, told CNN affiliate KMGH, ""We're definitely going to go for that Super Bowl ring, and we're going to do whatever it takes. We've got the man at quarterback to play for us."" Titans owner K.S. ""Bud"" Adams said in a statement that he spoke with Manning on Monday morning. ""I want to thank the whole organization for their efforts in trying to sign Peyton and also to Peyton for the time he put into the process,"" he said. ""Peyton called me this morning to inform me of his decision and obviously I am disappointed, because I thought we would be a perfect fit."" Manning told Adams that he will sign with the Broncos, KHOU-TV of Houston, Texas, reported. ESPN, citing multiple unnamed sources, said Manning would become the Broncos quarterback unless some unexpected problem surfaced during contract negotiations. The Denver Post, citing an unnamed NFL source, said Manning called former Broncos quarterback John Elway, who is now the team's executive vice president for football operations, to say he wants to play for the Broncos and wants to negotiate exclusively with the team. SI's Don Banks: Manning seeks to follow Elway arc . Manning's agent, Tom Condon, declined to comment. The arrival in Denver of a superstar of Manning's stature would raise questions about the fate of Tim Tebow, who became the Broncos starting quarterback last year amid electric fanfare and led the team into the playoffs. Tebow won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, when he played for the University of Florida Gators. SI's Chris Burke: Manning Watch over; Tebow Watch begins . On Friday, Elway traveled to North Carolina to watch Manning practice. ""Watching him throw today was the next step in this important process for our team and Peyton. It was a productive visit and went well,"" Elway said on Twitter. ""We enjoyed visiting with Peyton today in N.C.

"(CNN) -- The defeat of French President Nicholas Sarkozy at the hands of Francois Hollande has the potential to greatly affect European politics and the future of the euro, as many have noted. But the election of the first French Socialist president since 1995 also could dramatically change France's role in the world, at a particularly sensitive time. No doubt both sides of the Atlantic will keep a close eye on the rhetoric and actions of the new French leader in the days ahead. Almost from the outset, Hollande will be in the international spotlight, with the G-8 meeting at Camp David, Maryland, and the NATO Summit in Chicago less than two weeks away, and a G-20 meeting scheduled for June in Mexico City. The NATO alliance faces a complex transition in Afghanistan. The international community is dealing with an increasingly untenable situation in Syria and may soon have to contemplate military action. And while the nuclear crisis with Iran is at an ebb, it is by no means over. There are already strong signals that a Hollande administration will bring more change than continuity. Sarkozy, while not a Gaullist, sought to restore French national pride based on France's role as a leader in the international community. His efforts were most notable in his participation in the NATO operations in Libya. Hollande will inherit record debt of just over $2 trillion and a jobless rate hovering around 10%. It is unclear what price the French defense establishment will have to pay to meet the president-elect's desire to balance the budget by 2017, but with the Ministry of Defense in the midst of an internal review, French military policy will likely see changes driven by Hollande and his team. Hollande's advisers have stated that the new leader is likely to announce an accelerated timetable for French withdrawal from Afghanistan that could bring all French troops home by the end of this year. While the operational impact of the early removal of all 3,300 French troops could be addressed with some effort, there may be greater political fallout from the French rejection of the principle of ""in together, out together,"" especially given the lack of public support for the Afghan mission throughout Europe. The president-elect's advisers have also claimed the new leader has reservations about Sarkozy's support of increased participation in NATO, specifically the French decision to rejoin NATO's military command structure. Jean-Yves Le Drian, a key adviser to Hollande and a potential defense minister, is reported to have said that Hollande would demand a greater decision-making role for France within NATO. But France cannot, of course, have its cake and eat it too. French participation in both Afghanistan and Libya has been significant -- but equivocation regarding NATO commitments will make requests for increased authority ring hollow to other alliance members. Rather, if France is to have a greater say, then Hollande must be willing to put alliance interests ahead of national interests from time to time. Still, Hollande has also intimated that he could take a more pragmatic approach and understands that French actions could have practical and symbolic impacts that might detract from French standing in the world. He is a career politician and no doubt understands the downside of placing France at odds with its allies unnecessarily at a time when concerted action by the trans-Atlantic powers on economic and security issues could not be more important. Indeed, President-elect Hollande's advisers say his No. 1 foreign policy priority will be helping to revive Europe's economy. No doubt, the economy will be the driving issue during the U.S. general election, and political pundits will be considering whether the Sarkozy defeat holds lessons for voters who will go to the polls this autumn. Just as in France, there is no shortage of voter anger with incumbents, and the low approval rating for Congress suggests we may see new faces on Capitol Hill in January. Likewise, the United States faces important policy challenges on health care, immigration, and of course taxation and spending. But beyond that, the dynamics of French and American politics part ways. Indeed, for the United States it will largely be the Hollande policy agenda that matters more -- not the political circumstances under which he gained office. In a world rife with instability and faced with a fragile economic recovery, there will remain an imperative for effective alliances, forward-looking foreign policy, and strong and internationally respected leadership. Hollande may wish to be a leader singularly focused on French and European economic needs, but success in these matters may rest on his initial ability not only to find a balance between politics and policy, but to demonstrate that he can work effectively with his fellow world leaders. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark R. Jacobson.","Mark Jacobson: Election of Francois Hollande has global implications .

"(Rolling Stone) -- On a recent afternoon in Toronto, Queen's Roger Taylor was checking out rehearsals for Queen Extravaganza -- a 25-date tribute tour with a lineup hand-selected by him and his bandmate, guitarist Brian May -- when singer Marc Martel belted out a few notes from ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" stopping the 62-year-old drummer in his tracks. ""It was as if Freddie (Mercury) was in the room,"" Taylor said today during a conference call with journalists. ""It was uncanny."" Martel is just one of three singers selected to join the Queen Extravaganza lineup after a lengthy online audition process. The nine lucky musicians will kick off their trek on May 26 in Quebec City after making their live debut last week on ""American Idol"", where they were joined by Taylor and May. ""We had such a fantastic response,"" said Taylor. ""We weren't just looking for copies of us. We were looking for great musicianship, great charisma and the right people, the right sort of personalities that fit into the band. What we weren't looking for were lookalikes."" Martel first discovered Queen's music while watching the 1992 film ""Wayne's World."" The 36-year-old singer, who is also in the Nashville-based band Downhere, was later encouraged by his bassist to study Mercury's singing. ""I realized, 'Wow, this guy did so many amazing things with his voice,' especially in the studio,"" Martel explained. ""He really pushed himself."" The tribute tour is just one of the projects that Queen have planned for 2012. Taylor and May will also play five Queen shows in Europe later this year with singer Adam Lambert on lead vocals. According to Taylor, Queen will perform in Moscow, Ukraine and London. He described the Ukraine show as a ""very big outdoor"" co-headlining gig with Elton John; the London gigs will take place at the Hammersmith Apollo. ""We were hoping to do a festival in London, but for various reasons that didn't happen,"" Taylor said. Lambert, who performed with Taylor and May on the 2009 ""American Idol"" finale, has long been on the duo's radar. ""Brian and I have seen quite a lot of his shows,"" Taylor added. Any plans to perform with Lambert beyond that are unclear for Queen, who have toured on a handful of occasions over the past decade with Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers. ""I don't know whether that's going to be ongoing,"" Taylor said. ""Brian and I are not the young men we once were. These are slightly experimental -- we've got to see how they go, see how we get on, if it really works. Who knows what might happen. It really is slightly experimental right now. We didn't really want to commit ourselves to too many things."" The Extravaganza, Taylor said, was conceived as a way to present Queen's music as the band originally intended. Complex tunes like ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" will finally be performed in their entirety. ""We will be able to do what we couldn't do before -- all the harmonies, all the little parts we put onto the record,"" said Taylor. ""This will give us the tools to do that."" In typical Queen fashion, the Extravaganza will also be quite the visual spectacle: Taylor and May have hired designer Mark Fisher, who worked on Pink Floyd's The Wall concerts and every Rolling Stones show since 1989, to work on the tour. ""I don't want our music to be represented in any average kind of way,"" Taylor said. ""We look to excel with this and really teach other bands how to really do a show properly."" While Martel's vocal resemblance to Mercury is striking, Taylor noted that there's no replacing Queen's iconic singer, who died in 1991. And Taylor firmly dismissed the notion that he would ever perform with a ""hologram"" of Mercury, the way that Dr. Dre did with one of Tupac Shakur at Coachella. ""I don't want to sit up here with a hologram of my dear friend,"" said Taylor. ""Were somebody to use a hologram of Freddie, I don't think I would have an objection. But I don't want to. It just didn't sit too well with me. ""When Freddie died, we were in shock,"" continued Taylor. ""And it didn't go away for five years. We would have probably remained together. We were very tight and very close. We never saw the need to break up. I think he'd love (these shows). I think he would have been really flattered. He would have loved the idea of keeping our musical flag flying. Brian and I always sort of imagine he's in the room."" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security has granted asylum to an Albanian immigrant, his wife and teenage son after a years-long deportation battle. According to a letter from the Department of Homeland Security, Edmond and Rudina Demiraj and their teenage son, Rediol, were all granted asylum ""for an indefinite period."" The letter also said that asylum status for each person may be terminated if the family ""no longer has a well founded fear of persecution because of a fundamental change in circumstances."" CNN first reported on the Demiraj case last fall. The Department of Justice was then threatening to deport the family to Albania even after Edmond Demiraj promised to testify in a human trafficking case. Attorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj's testimony in a prosecution against fellow Albanian immigrant Bill Bedini. In exchange for his willingness to testify, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised protection for him and his family. They also promised them Green Cards, he said. That offer, Demiraj said, was verbal and never committed to writing. The trial never took place because Bedini fled to Albania after entering a plea of not guilty, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. When prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony, they handed him over to immigration officials, who promptly deported him. Within a few weeks back in his native Albania, Demiraj says, Bedini tried to kill him. Demiraj says only luck saved him. He was wounded in the attack and eventually returned to the United States, entering illegally through Mexico. He spent seven months in an immigration jail before being allowed to remain in the U.S. on temporary status. In the intervening years, lawyers for the Department of Justice told a succession of courts that Demiraj and his family should be deported, even though they said they feared for their lives. At one point, Josh Rosenkranz, an attorney for Demiraj, told CNN that the deportation proceedings were a ""shameful display of how the U.S. government will use people who they need to keep us safe and then cavalierly discard them when they are no longer of use to them."" ""We are extremely happy for the Demiraj family,"" Rosenkranz said in a statement. ""All along, they have wanted to live the American dream legally and safely."" When asked about the case, a Department of Justice spokesman told CNN that it was not responsible for asylum decisions although the DOJ later pointed out that its Executive Office for Immigration Review administers the courts that deal with asylum claims from international residents who are in the country illegally, like the Demirajs.","Justice Department wanted his testimony in human trafficking case that never occurred .

"(CNN) -- A group of masked gunmen stormed a popular bar in the Mexican city of Chihuahua late Friday, killing 15 people, including two journalists, state prosecutors said Saturday. At least 10 suspects entered the Colorado Bar wearing what looked like police uniforms and opened fire on the crowd inside the bar, according to Carlos Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Eleven people died at the scene, and the other four died en route to the hospital. The victims ranged in age between 25 and 72. Among them was Hector Javier Aguirre Salinas, the owner of a news website and a respected journalist. A second journalist, Francisco Javier Moya -- who in years past had served as the news director for a radio station in Ciudad Juarez -- also was killed. ""The crime of our partners and the rest of those killed in the attack, cannot go unpunished,"" Roberto Delgado, president of the Association of Journalists in Juarez, said in a statement on the killings. Prosecutors said they collected at least 30 shell casings from a variety of weapons, including several bullet casings from an AK-47. Northern Mexico has been ravaged by battles among rival drug cartels, police and government troops for the past several years. More than 47,000 people have been killed since the Mexican government launched a crackdown on drug traffickers in December 2006, according to government statistics. Journalist Arturo Chacon contributed to this report for CNN.","Prosecutors said at least 10 gunmen stormed the Chihuahua bar Friday night .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Attorneys in the child sexual abuse and conspiracy trial of two Philadelphia priests debated Monday over which potential witnesses jurors would be allowed to hear regarding a third defendant who pleaded guilty to molesting boys just days before opening remarks. Defrocked priest Edward Avery of the Philadelphia Archdiocese pleaded guilty to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and conspiracy to endanger the welfare of child after admitting that he sexually assaulted a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year. Avery, 69, was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years. The Rev. James Brennan is accused of attempted rape of a 14-year-old, and Monsignor William Lynn is accused of covering it up. Lynn is the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for shuffling predator priests from parish to parish. Witness: Philadelphia priest raped me when I was 14 . Lynn is accused of knowingly allowing Avery and Brennan access to children despite allegations of sexual abuse of minors. Both have pleaded not guilty. Although jurors were told Avery is no longer on trial, they have not been told why. His guilty plea does not require him to testify. Prosecutors said Monday the former altar boy whom Avery admitted molesting in the church sacristy is scheduled to take the witness stand this week. He was abused six years after the archdiocese learned Avery had abused someone else. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington argued that if Lynn's defense attorneys ""attacked the creditability"" of the witness, the Commonwealth would be allowed to tell the jury Avery pleaded guilty. ""Monsignor Lynn put a powder keg out there,"" Blessington said while the jurors were out of the courtroom. Defense attorney Jeff Lindy dismissed that claim, arguing that allowing jurors to hear Avery's plea or having other witnesses alleging abuse after Lynn left his post as secretary of clergy put his client at a disadvantage. ""It doesn't shine any light on what Monsignor Lynn knew,"" he said. ""Things he didn't know about could not possibly go to his state of mind."" After listing to both sides in open court, Common Pleas Court Judge M. Teresa Sarmina suggested that perhaps prosecutors call Avery to the witness stand. Sarmina delayed ruling on also allowing additional victims to testify against Avery. ""I wouldn't be surprised if there were many, many more,"" she said. ""Why didn't they come forward until 2010? There's a myriad of reasons. It takes a lot to come forward."" Jurors also heard the remainder of testimony about a former priest accused of abusing a 15-year-old boy for three years, beginning in 1984, engaging in ""everything sexually two men can do."" While in treatment, the priest admitted to having a sexual relationship with the teen. He also described a number of incidents where he was the victim of sexual abuse, including a time when he was tied down by several seminarians who tried to rape him and that a friend came to his aide. He also revealed another incident when he was 10 and made to ""kiss"" a group of boys' genitals. Prosecutors also plan to call Monsignor Kevin Quirk to the witness stand. A West Virginia judge ordered Quirk to testify, noting he was a ""necessary and material witness,"" according to court documents obtained by CNN. Quirk presided over Brennan's 1996 canonical trial for an alleged sexual abuse of a minor.","Defense, prosecution argue about which witnesses jurors should be allowed to hear .

"Jarratt, Virginia (CNN) -- Teresa Lewis, called the mastermind in the murder-for-hire deaths of her husband and stepson, was executed Thursday night, Virginia Department of Corrections officials said. Lewis, who was given a lethal injection, was pronounced dead at 9:13 p.m. ET at Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt. Death penalty opponents argued that Lewis, a 41-year-old grandmother, should not have died for a 2002 conspiracy that spared two triggermen a capital sentence. Instead they got life without parole. Lewis was the first woman executed in Virginia in nearly a century. The victims' family members witnessed the execution, state Department of Corrections spokesman Larry Traylor said. News media witnesses said Lewis appeared frightened when she entered the death chamber and approached the gurney. Asked if she had last words, Lewis said, ""I just want Kathy to know I love her. And I am very sorry."" The inmate was referring to her stepdaughter, witness Kathy Clifton, daughter of murder victim Julian Lewis and sister of victim C.J. Lewis. ""She has no recriminations, she has no ill will for anybody,"" Lewis attorney Jim Rocap said. ""I think frankly that she had accepted what was going to happen tonight a long time ago, and she was very peaceful with that."" The death row inmate pleaded guilty in the 2002 slayings of her husband and stepson in their rural home near Danville, Virginia, about 145 miles from Richmond. Lewis, whom the state argued is evil, was the first woman executed in the United States in five years. She requested a last meal of two fried chicken breasts, sweet peas with butter, German cake (first choice), apple pie (second choice) and a Dr Pepper soft drink, officials said. Rocap also released a statement late Thursday. ""Tonight, the machinery of death in Virginia extinguished the beautiful, childlike and loving human spirit of Teresa Lewis ..."" Rocap said. ""Teresa asked that I send her thanks and love to all of those who have supported her in this fight for her life. In her words, 'It's just awesome.' It is our hope that Teresa's death will cause a re-examination of the badly broken system of justice that could allow something as wrong and unjust as this to happen."" On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution appeal. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell also rejected a clemency request. ""Having carefully reviewed the petition for clemency, the judicial opinions in this case, and other relevant materials, I find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was imposed by the Circuit Court and affirmed by all reviewing courts,"" McDonnell wrote. ""Accordingly, I decline to intervene and have notified the appropriate counsel and family of my decision."" Lewis and her lawyers argued to the governor that she had an IQ that was borderline mentally retarded and that she was manipulated into committing the crimes by a dominant male co-defendant. She pleaded guilty to her participation in the murders but later regretted her actions, they said. Two anti-death penalty groups pleaded with McDonnell to show clemency. ""Teresa's death sentence, imposed despite clear evidence of her diminished mental capacities, disabilities and addictions, undermines any confidence that she was properly adjudicated to be 'worthy' of death,"" argued Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. ""The final failure of the death penalty system in Virginia rests squarely on the desk of Governor McDonnell. He should do the right thing and allow Teresa the same punishment, which was given to her co-defenders -- life imprisonment."" ""I just want the governor to know that I am so sorry, deeply from my heart,"" Lewis recently said. ""And if I could take it back, I would, in a minute. ... I just wish I could take it back. And I'm sorry for all the people that I've hurt in the process."" Lewis admitted to police that she concocted the plot to kill her husband, Julian, and his son C.J., an Army reservist set to be deployed to Iraq. At the time, she was having an affair with Matthew Shallenberger and paid him and then-19-year-old Rodney Fuller to commit murder for the victims' insurance money. Court records show that Lewis gave the two killers cash to buy weapons and left the door of the home open for easy entry. Lewis was in bed with her husband when he was hit with a shotgun blast by Shallenberger. Julian Lewis survived long enough to tell police, ""My wife knows who did this to me."" Fuller killed C.J. Lewis in his bedroom down the hall. Despite her guilty plea, a state judge later sentenced Lewis to death while sparing the lives of Shallenberger and Fuller. At sentencing, the judge called her ""the head of this serpent."" ""I can frankly say that Teresa Lewis is as evil a person as I've ever met,"" David Grimes, commonwealth's attorney for Pittsylvania County, who was at the scene shortly after the crimes occurred. ""I would wager with some assurance that you wouldn't find anyone who knew her before this event occurred who thought she was mentally retarded or had a limited mentality -- that it would ever cross their minds."" Her supporters said Lewis was deeply remorseful and had been a model prisoner, helping fellow female inmates cope with their circumstances. ""I do feel I could be a lot of help to some of the women, which I have already. From my understanding, I've already helped a lot to change their lives or made them look at their lives in a different way,"" Lewis said. Amnesty International and best-selling author John Grisham were among those supporting leniency. Grimes said Lewis had a ""fairly low"" IQ but noted that courts have concluded she was not mentally retarded. The state also argued that Lewis waited 45 minutes after the shootings before calling police and that she had involved her then-16-year-old daughter in the plot. Rocap argued that such evidence suggested ""Teresa could not have been the mastermind."" ""Shallenberger has stated, and the experts that have examined her agree, that she was being used by Shallenberger, not the other way around,"" he said. Lewis' attorneys said that Shallenberger admitted he used Lewis to get at the $250,000 she would receive in the event her stepson died. A letter from Shallenberger to another woman, they say, said that the only reason he slept with Lewis was ""so she would give me the insurance money."" ""She was exactly what I was looking for,"" he wrote. ""Some ugly bitch who married her husband for the money and I knew I could get to fall head over heels for me."" Furthermore, they said, Shallenberger said he ""manipulated the whole thing"" and ""knew he was going 'take' Lewis from the moment he met her,"" according to an affidavit from one of their investigators. But Shallenberger, who committed suicide in 2006, refused to sign the affidavit and actually tore up and ate part of it. Still, Grimes said, his investigation showed that Lewis took an active role in the plot, that she connived and manipulated everyone from her late husband to her lover to her children. From early on, he said, Lewis schemed several different ways to get the inheritance money. She helped plan an earlier plot to kill her husband that failed.","Teresa Lewis, 41, died Thursday night by lethal injection .

"(CNN) -- The CEO of a top research firm didn't mince words about Apple in a new blog post. ""Apple will decline in the post Steve Jobs era,"" wrote George Colony, CEO of Forrester Research. ""Here's why."" The iPhone and iPad maker will coast for two to four years on its current momentum, Colony said; but Jobs, who died in October, left a void because his successor, Apple CEO Tim Cook, doesn't possess his star power. ""[W]ithout the arrival of a new charismatic leader it will move from being a great company to being a good company, with a commensurate step down in revenue growth and product innovation,"" Colony wrote. An Apple spokesman declined to comment for this story. The fade Colony describes doesn't appear to be on the immediate horizon. This week, Apple reported doubling its profits in the first three months of the year, largely on the strength of the 35.1 million iPhones it sold (a number that far exceeded predictions). The company said it also sold 4 million Mac computers, 11.8 million iPads and 7.7 million iPods during the quarter. Colony predicted that Apple's long-term fate will mirror that of onetime industry leaders like Sony and Kodak when they lost enigmatic leaders, or Disney in the 20 years after Walt Disney's death. In his post Wednesday, Colony described Apple in almost religious terms. ""Charismatic organizations are run by people with 'the gift of grace,' "" he wrote, citing sociologist Max Weber. But when that leader is gone, shifting to a more bureaucratic leader (which works for some organizations) doesn't translate well, he wrote. ""In charismatic organizations, the magical leader must be succeeded by another charismatic -- the emotional connection of employees and (in the case of Apple) customers demands it,"" Colony said. ""Apple has chosen a proven and competent executive to succeed Jobs. But his legal/bureaucratic approach will prove to be a mismatch for an organization that feeds off the gift of grace."" Colony pointed to Apple executives Jon Ive and Scott Forstall as being better suited to run the company, saying they appear to possess the charisma and design sense to ""legitimately"" lead Apple. Forrester is a global technology research company founded by Colony in 1983 and is considered a leader in analyzing the technology industry.","Forrester CEO says Apple needs a charismatic leader like Steve Jobs .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Three of four minors accused of taking part in a brutal videotaped gang rape of a teenager will face full prosecution, a spokesman for a South African court said Wednesday. The boys appeared in court Wednesday -- along with three others who are not minors -- to apply for bail. The seven suspects are between the ages of 13 and 19. A bail hearing will be held May 3 for the minors and June 20 for the adults, said the spokesman, Mthunzi Mhaga. It is unlikely that the suspects, accused of a crime that has shocked many in South Africa, will be granted bail, officials have said. An eighth suspect -- a man who was found with the victim -- is scheduled to appear in court on May 4, court officials said. The images of the assault of the 17-year-old girl, believed to be mentally ill, swept across the Internet last week and touched a nerve in South Africa. The shocking footage shows the girl pleading for her attackers to stop, and it has some activists saying it is an example of the country's problem with rape. The girl went missing on March 21. Police suspect she was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave. The cell phone video of her gang rape surfaced and went viral among schoolchildren in Soweto, a vast township near Johannesburg. The Daily Sun, a local tabloid, alerted police about the attack after a concerned mother whose daughter was watching the video handed it over to the newspaper. Police embarked on a search for the girl and the people in the video. Eight suspects have been arrested and charged with kidnapping and raping the teen. Seven of them were seen on the video; the other was a 37-year-old man found with the girl last week. A woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa, according to local aid groups. More than 60,000 cases of sexual assault were reported in the year to March 2011, down from 70,000 in 2008, police said. Women's rights activist Lisa Vetten says in the province of Gauteng, where Johannesburg is located, one in every five rapes is a gang rape. ""Rape is a young man's crime,"" she said. ""It's a bit of a performance for them, showing off to each other how macho they are. We need to teach our young men that you can be masculine in ways that do not involve violence and degrading women."" The mother of the 17-year-old has said this was not the first time her daughter has been raped. She was raped in 2009 and 2010, and authorities have done little to address the issue in the past, the mother said. ""It's 2012 now, and I'm still waiting for DNA results,"" she said. After the girl was found and as the news of the video emerged, the government placed her in a safe house -- a place where she can attend school and socialize in a secure environment. ""They are coming now because things have turned out this way,"" the mother said. ""They shouldn't pretend as if they have been standing up for me. They never stood up for me.""","Seven suspects, ages 13 to 19, are applying for bail .

"Washington (CNN) -- New documents made public this week about possible Secret Service misconduct include allegations of sexual abuse, domestic violence, drunken behavior and guns being accidentally discharged. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General released on Thursday logs of reports to its hotline dating to 2004. The documents were made public while the office investigates reports of sexual misconduct by Secret Service personnel with prostitutes in Colombia ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena this spring. Many of the items are blacked out to redact names and other information, and in numerous instances it's not possible to determine if the complaints were credible or if any action was taken. In one report dated August 23, 2011, a Secret Service employee said that during a work trip another employee pushed her onto a bed, got on top of her and tried to engage in sex. The woman said she told the agent ""no"" several times and was able to push him off of her. The log says supervisors viewed the employee who complained of the assault as""conscientious and dependable."" Her report was investigated and the matter was ended in February with some kind of ""administrative disposition"" which was not specified. All the names were redacted. Another allegation made October 23, 2003, said that an agent forced a female acquaintance to have non-consensual sex with him at a hotel in Killeen, Texas. The case was closed in January 2005 and there is a notation saying ""allegation not substantiated."" That same month, an anonymous person reported that the FBI was investigating whether an agent was involved in a prostitution ring. The allegation was that FBI wiretaps recorded calls from two phones and the numbers traced back to the unidentified agent. According to the log note, the agent said he got a phone number ""from a woman handing out fliers on the street and called it out of curiosity."" The agent retired. A redacted October 7, 2010, entry with no specifics says there was a report a Secret Service employee might have been involved in the leak of national security information. The case appears to still be open. A number of reports concern off-duty Secret Service personnel being arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol or for alleged domestic violence. There are also incidents of misfiring guns while on the job, including a September 26, 2007, log note that an agent accidentally discharged one round from a submachine gun while on temporary assignment in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. A Secret Service spokesman described the material as an intake log covering eight years with items that either mention the Secret Service or concern matters that have been referred to the law enforcement agency. ""The vast majority did not involve alleged misconduct by Secret Service agents or officers,"" said spokesman Edwin Donovan. Bill Hillburg, a spokesman for the Office of Inspector General agreed that only a small number of the reports dealt with allegations against the Secret Service. ""None of it is related to our investigation of Secret Service behavior in Cartagena,"" Hillburg said. He said all the hotline reports were noted and passed on to the Secret Service. Hillburg added that the hotline number is well-advertised to the public. The DHS released the 229 pages of log notes as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request by news media. Dozens of entries concern such things as Nigerian fraud schemes. Some items discuss possible terror concerns or threats against presidents. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who co-chairs the committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, released a statement reacting to the logs. ""While some of the allegations proved to be unfounded or frivolous, others appear to be legitimate, and that adds to my concern about apparent misconduct by some of the personnel of this vital law enforcement agency,"" said Collins, whose committee is investigating the Colombia incident. Collins added that in her committee's hearing last month, it was revealed there have been 64 allegations of sexual misconduct by Secret Service employees over the past five years. One of those included a 2008 case in which an employee solicited a prostitute who was actually an undercover police officer. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan testified before Collins and other members of the committee last month that the behavior by employees in Colombia was the result of poor choices by a dozen agents who were drinking heavily. ""This is not a cultural issue,"" he said. The April scandal led to nine Secret Service members losing their jobs. Three others were cleared of serious misconduct. A dozen members of the military were also involved. Collins told Sullivan at that hearing, ""I continue to believe that the problem is broader than you believe it to be.""","Logs of reports to Inspector General's hotline are made public .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters on Friday battled a massive wildfire that has so far claimed more than 100 homes in northern Colorado. The High Park Fire has scorched more than 52,000 acres, forced thousands of people to flee and claimed at least one life. The blaze was 15% contained Friday, up from 10% on Wednesday. Nick Christensen, an executive officer with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, said Friday that 112 homes have been destroyed. Many burned days ago, but authorities are just starting to get into the affected areas to assess the damage, he said. That figure is expected to rise. ""It's really not just a list of numbers; these are stories. Each one of these represents a family that's been displaced from their home -- that may have lost some family heirlooms, some photos, possessions, kids' toys,"" Christensen said. ""It's really devastating and sad."" At least one of the homes belonged to a Larimer County Sheriff's Office employee, he said. First measured at two acres early last Saturday, the High Park Fire -- which officials say was caused by lightning -- has since grown exponentially. It is about 15 miles west of Fort Collins, Colorado. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from across the United States to help local departments. Besides the main blaze, they are also battling a 200-acre spot fire, which broke out just north of the burn area. Helicopters flew back and forth Friday, dousing the flames with water. Complicating firefighters' efforts was a thunderstorm, which brought little rain, but kicked up strong winds, said Brett Haberstick, an incident command spokesman.

"(CNN) -- The former Rutgers University student convicted of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate -- who later committed suicide -- will not be deported back to his native India, a U.S. immigration spokesman said Monday. ""Based on a review of Mr. Ravi's criminal record, ICE is not initiating removal proceedings at this time,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Ross Feinstein said Monday. Dharun Ravi, 20, was found guilty in May on all counts including invasion of privacy, witness tampering, hindering apprehension and bias intimidation. His former roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, killed himself by jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River after learning Ravi had secretly recorded Clementi's intimate encounter with another man. The September 2010 death of Tyler Clementi, and Ravi's trial this year, thrust the issue of cyberbullying and prejudices against homosexuals into the national spotlight. While Ravi could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison, New Jersey Superior Judge Glenn Berman instead gave him a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. The judge said at the time that he took factors including Ravi's youth and his lack of a criminal record into consideration when handing down his sentence. He also did not recommend that Ravi be forced out of the United States. Berman told the Indian national the only reason he did not recommend deportation was because the man involved in the videotaped encounter with Clementi, identified in court only as ""M.B.,"" said in his victim impact statement that he did not believe Ravi should be made to leave the country -- and would be willing to write a letter to that effect. Ravi is a citizen of India who graduated from a U.S. high school and had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university at the time of Clementi's death. U.S. immigrations officials commonly deport non-citizens who are convicted of ""certain crimes"" like an aggravated felony, domestic violence or drug and weapons offenses, Feinstein said. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement are ""legally prohibited from removing individuals who are lawful permanent residents of the United States"" if they have not been convicted of such crimes, the agency said. Moreover, an immigration judge must decide whether or not to deport someone. Ravi began serving his 30-day jail term on May 31, two days after apologizing in a written statement for spying on Clementi with a webcam. His lawyer filed a notice of appeal of his conviction earlier this month, a New Jersey Middlesex County Court spokesman said.","Dharun Ravi was convicted in May of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate .

"(CNN) -- The bonds we renew in person between friends and family as we visit during the holiday season get reactivated online after we all go home. This is the time when feast and Facebook go hand-in-hand. And as it turns out, these two activities are more related than you might imagine. Two years ago, we published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed weight gain could spread from one person to others in our real-life social networks. When we gain weight, so do people who are one ""degree of separation"" from us: our friends, siblings, spouses, and co-workers. The effect doesn't stop there. It also spreads to people who are two degrees removed from us, like our friends' spouses, or our siblings' co-workers, or our friends' friends. In fact, it even spreads to three degrees of separation, to our friends' friends' friends. Our social networks contain large interconnected clusters of people who gain weight in parallel. Several social processes might explain the appearance of such clusters. One reason might be a kind of social contagion, whereby behaviors or attitudes related to body size flow through the network. On the other hand, although a pair of friends might influence each other, they also might choose to be friends with one another because they were similar in the first place. Or they might both react the same way to something in their environment, like a new doughnut shop down the street. Teasing these effects apart requires the right kind of data. When we followed thousands of people and mapped their social networks over 32 years, we found that obesity can spread from person to person to person. Today, when people say ""social network,"" they usually think of Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace, and not necessarily the kinds of real-world networks we studied. Connection and contagion are so fundamentally rooted in our evolutionary psychology that they carry over even to very modern aspects of our lives -- including e-mail, blogs, and social networking sites. Alas, our study only went up to 2003, before online social networks became so popular. So a natural question to ask was whether the same clusters of overweight individuals exist online and, if so, under what circumstances. We started following a group of over 1,700 interconnected college students on Facebook about four years ago. In addition to all of their personal information and daily status updates and wall posts, we also had a very important resource: their photos. Although we could not put each of these students on a scale, we could study their photos and develop a systematic way to estimate each student's weight. It's true that people tend to post only flattering pictures of themselves, but, since everyone does this, we can still get an idea of who is relatively heavier than whom. And, it turns out that roughly a quarter of the people in our study were overweight or obese, which is close to the figure for college students nationwide. At first, when we analyzed the whole Facebook network, we were surprised to find no evidence of clustering. There did not seem to be any relationship between your weight and the weight of your Facebook friends. But we soon realized that this makes sense. Our previous work showed that the social contagion of obesity only works between people who have close social relationships. Even though we may have 1,000 ""friends"" online, the very tenuousness of these relationships means they may not be as powerful as a single real-world connection. So, you probably won't gain weight if just any old Facebook friend does. But what about your Facebook friends who are real friends -- the old-fashioned kind you had over to dinner at Thanksgiving? Do they affect us? And how might it be possible to figure out which Facebook connections are also important, real-world connections? One idea we had was to use the tagged photos that people share with one another online. If you upload a picture of someone, the chances are good that you have a real-world connection with them. In fact, while the average student in our sample has over 110 Facebook friends, they have only six ""picture friends,"" a number very similar to the number of ""close"" friends people list when asked in sociology studies. It turned out that when we restricted our analysis to ""picture friends,"" we found evidence that overweight people cluster on Facebook. The results suggest that if one of your picture friends is obese, it increases the likelihood that you are obese by 11 percent. And, even more remarkably, if a picture friend of your picture friend is overweight, it increases the likelihood you'll be overweight by 4 percent. In other words, we find evidence that clusters of overweight friends extend two degrees of separation on Facebook. Many processes could underlie this clustering online, just as was the case in the offline world. Perhaps people are more likely to befriend others who resemble them in terms of body size. Perhaps groups of online friends share exposures to things that make all of them gain -- or lose -- weight in synchrony. Or perhaps when one of your close friends online gains weight, you follow suit. It is not yet clear which of these processes is occurring, but this is the first evidence we've seen that suggests the online world may be like the offline world when it comes to body size. Of course, picture friends and real-life friends are likely to be one and the same. In fact, the reason we looked just at picture friends is because we think it is these real-world connections that are most likely to be the paths through which emotions and behaviors are transmitted from person to person to person. Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter give us new ways to keep in touch, but in many ways our online networks are really just an extension of the real-world networks that we have all inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years. Online as well as offline, human beings connect with each other and influence each other, and this influence can spread in a social chain reaction in ever-more-modern ways. As you enjoy your festive meals this season, take a moment to consider how truly powerful a real social bond can be. The effect of friends and family on your life remains long after the last of the leftovers are eaten. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler.","Christakis and  Fowler: During holidays, feast and Facebook go hand-in-hand.

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina resident was found guilty Thursday on terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people overseas. Anes Subasic, a 35-year old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Bosnia, also was convicted of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. He will face up to life in prison at sentencing in August. Subasic is the seventh member of a North Carolina group of men convicted of terror activities. They were led by Daniel Boyd, who pleaded guilty in February 2011 to conspiring to kill people abroad and to provide material support to terrorists. Boyd's sentencing was delayed so that he could testify against three other co-conspirators who were found guilty last fall. Two of Boyd's sons also pleaded guilty and are in prison. According to the government, from November 2006 until at least July 2009, Subasic and the others worked to provide money, weapons training, transportation and personnel to ""advance violent jihad."" ""Subasic was part of a group of terrorists; some viewed their own country as the enemy,"" said M. Chris Briese, who heads the FBI's Charlotte field office. ""Subasic was part of a conspiracy to commit violent acts against U.S. service members and others abroad,"" said John Khin, an official with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. In a separate trial last fall, Subasic was convicted on two counts of illegally obtaining citizenship. An eighth man, Jude Kenan Mohammad, also was charged in the terror conspiracy. He has never been arrested and officials believe he is in Pakistan or may have died.","Anes Subasic is found guilty of conspiracy to murder people overseas and other charges .

"(Real Simple) -- I live in Chicago, and one of my best friends, Phyllis, lives in San Francisco, so we aren't able to see each other as often as we would like. The times we do get together, we like to live it up, and for us, living it up always involves chowing down. So last January, when Phyllis sent me an e-mail saying she was coming for the weekend, I knew exactly what restaurant I wanted to take her to. It's called Tom's Steak House. Most of its customers have been coming for decades; the waitresses have a good-hearted, cigarette-scented toughness about them; the steaks are the size of Cook County; and the salad dressings are served from a twirling ""carousel,"" so that you can legitimately play with your food. It's the kind of place that's frozen in time, where you just have to order a Rob Roy. After Phyllis arrived, I told her where we were headed that night. ""You're going to love this place,"" I kept saying, and Phyllis, in turn, kept saying, ""Oh boy."" But as the hour approached, a kind of lethargy set in. It was freezing outside, and we were so cozy inside, dressed in comfortable, slouchy clothes, listening to good music, turning on lights against a darkening winter sky. I asked Phyllis if she would mind if we stayed home. ""We can have martinis and I'll cook, OK?"" I said, and she readily agreed. Real Simple: 5 inspirational friendships . What to make? I wondered. Suddenly I remembered that my neighbor Suzie had given me a recipe, saying, ""I really liked this, and I think you will, too."" It was for a sausage and bean ragout, and when I read the list of ingredients, I thought, Hmm. This does sound good. It's easy to make and even low-fat. I'm going to make it! Then I never did. But now Suzie's recipe seemed just right for the occasion, even though neither Phyllis nor I, experienced (and good) cooks both, knew exactly what a ""ragout"" was. I mixed up some martinis, put a CD on the stereo, cranked up the volume, and tied on my apron. While I browned spicy turkey sausage and onion and garlic, Phyllis sang along with the singer-songwriter Duffy and danced around the dining-room table. It is one thing to see your friend dance around a table when she's 25, quite another thing to see her doing it when she's 62. I love a 62-year-old woman who doesn't shy from thrusting her pelvis out all over the place; I couldn't stop smiling. Real Simple: When friendships go wrong . Then Phyllis lowered the volume on the stereo and came to sit down at the kitchen table. ""I need to talk to you about something,"" she said. I stopped chopping basil and looked over at her. ""It's very embarrassing for me,"" she said, and I saw tears well in her eyes. Phyllis is an extremely honest person, often quite blunt. For the most part, I truly appreciate that kind of honesty, and so I'm willing to suffer whatever consequences may come along with it. But I got a little nervous. I stood still, waiting. I thought she was going to criticize me, and I hoped that I could listen with an open mind and heart. Instead, what she said, in a very small, tremulous voice, was ""I don't think you liked what I gave you for your birthday."" One month earlier, I had celebrated my 60th birthday -- a big one, I think most would agree -- and I had been excited to get Phyllis's gift. She's good at coming up with things you never would have thought of for yourself but instantly love. What she gave me was letters I had written her over our many-years-long friendship. She had bound them into a book and then done something to every page -- enhanced it with color, with silver sprinkles of confetti, with little candy hearts, with autumn leaves, with rubber stamps of coffee cups, with cutout ads from vintage magazines, with collages of various sorts. It was a true work of art, a labor-intensive wonder, and I loved everything about it -- except the person I was in most of those letters. Real Simple: How to be a good friend . Many of the pages represented a time of life when I was desperate and unhappy; I had written to her of pain and grief and fear and frustration, because she was my dear friend and I needed to talk to her, if not in person, then on paper. So when I opened the book, I felt as if I had been given tapes from therapy sessions. I felt caught between gratitude and appreciation, and embarrassment and despair. I tried to convey my admiration at the time, but Phyllis would have been completely insensitive not to pick up on my ambivalence, and she is anything but insensitive. So now, with us alone and in our stocking feet in my kitchen, she told me of her own sadness, of how she had told other friends that I had not liked what she had so earnestly and carefully and creatively done. I came over to embrace her, weeping myself. I said, ""It's not your gift I didn't like -- it was me I wasn't so crazy about."" While the ragout simmered on the stove, we talked for some time. Phyllis reminded me that at one point she had offered me my letters back and I had told her I didn't want them, but she decided to go ahead and give them to me anyway -- with the best of intentions. ""I wanted to show you how you had changed,"" she said. Real Simple: Break out of your relationship ruts . True enough. The person who wrote those letters spent an awful lot of time feeling bad: about herself, about choices she had made, about life in general. That person did not look upon planet earth as a particularly good place to be, and in fact had articulated more than once the wish to be done with it all. The person I am now may have her share of dreary days -- who doesn't? -- but she is routinely dazzled by the truth of a simple equation: Life offers far more good than bad. I had placed the gift in my study, in a place hidden from view but close at hand. I wanted it to be there whenever I was ready to look at it: to accept it as best I could, until I could accept it fully. And some time after my birthday, I found myself paging through Phyllis's gift. It wasn't a fun read, exactly, but I was surprised by what I found. Certainly the letters showed how sad I had been, but they also illustrated that even in those dark days I had a pretty dang good sense of humor and a deep love for many things: my children, nature, art, food, the eccentricities and vulnerabilities of people. Real Simple: Inspiring stories of marriage . I told Phyllis that I was sorry for how I had made her feel and that I hadn't told her I had come to appreciate the gift. We wiped away tears, forgave each other, and freshened our drinks. Suzie's recipe was divine. We both kept saying, ""Man, this is sensational,"" then smacking our lips and taking more. But the gift Phyllis and I enjoyed that day would never have happened if we had been out in public. We needed to be in our stocking feet, comfortable in the way that being in your best friend's kitchen makes you be. I know now that the dictionary definition of ragout is ""a richly seasoned stew of meat and vegetables."" For me, it will always suggest another kind of mix: a warm kitchen on a winter's day, an old friend's candor and absolute trust, and a new friend's generosity in giving me a recipe, which is always about more than it seems. That's because sharing the things that nourish us helps to fill an empty place. Sometimes that place is the stomach. Sometimes it's the heart. And sometimes, the best times, it's both.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Did you ever wonder why Charlie Brown kept charging at the football, despite the fact that Lucy always pulled it away and he wound up flat on his back? You would think that experience has made him skeptical. It's because he really wanted to believe that, this time, things would work out. And when you really want to believe in something, you have a short memory when it comes to past disappointments. That's how it is with many Latinos and other immigration reform advocates. They want President Obama to become the person they voted for -- who promised Latinos that he would fix a broken immigration system, stop dividing families, and push through Congress a Dream Act-like legislation that would give undocumented young people a pathway to legal status if they go to college or join the military. None of that happened, and so Latinos -- who, in 2008, voted overwhelmingly for Obama -- are ambivalent about the president's re-election. Something had to be done to convince Latinos that the president is on their side. Today, something was done. Or rather, something was promised. The Obama administration announced that it would stop deporting younger illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children -- provided they meet certain conditions -- and begin granting work permits to them. Illegal immigrants will supposedly benefit from the new policy if they were brought to the United States before they turned 16, if they are 30 or younger, if they have lived in the country for at least five years, if they have no criminal record and if they attend or graduated from a U.S. high school, or have served in the military. The policy change could affect as many as 800,000 immigrants -- so-called DREAM'ers -- who would have benefited from the DREAM Act had it not been blocked by Congress. These people have been living in fear of being deported by the same administration that is now offering the pardon. Confused? Just wait. It gets better. We've only just begun to make our way down this rabbit hole. The administration is obviously trying to ""checkmate"" a nearly identical proposal floated by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, which reportedly would also stop DREAM'ers from being deported and issue them work permits. The Rubio plan would not offer a pathway to citizenship. About this omission, the left was incensed. But Obama isn't offering a pathway to citizenship either, and yet many in the left couldn't be happier. Where is the consistency? Then there is the inconvenient fact that we're not supposed to even need this kind of policy change because, according to Obama, his administration isn't deporting DREAM'ers at all; instead, it's concentrating its enforcement efforts on criminals. That's exactly what Obama told Univision anchor Jorge Ramos during a March 2011 trip to El Salvador. A couple of weeks later, Obama had to swallow those words when -- during an education town hall meeting in Washington, sponsored by Univision -- he was confronted by a DREAM'er holding deportation papers. So now we're supposed to applaud the administration for not deporting people the president had claimed weren't being deported in the first place. Of course, the administration is deporting DREAM'ers, along with gardeners, housekeepers, nannies and ice cream vendors who represent no threat to public safety. It's a waste of time for officials to deny that. Just this week, I wrote in my CNN.com column about another one of Obama's broken promises. The administration pledged to use prosecutorial discretion to free from deportation proceedings individuals who had been in the country for a number of years, had U.S.-born children, or were otherwise rooted in the United States. That included DREAM'ers. So far, the promise hasn't amounted to much of anything. I expect a similar outcome with DREAM'ers. Some of them may benefit from Obama's new initiative, but many probably won't. That's because the idea behind the DREAM Act -- trading legal status for college attendance or military service -- is still unpopular with most voters in this country. The administration has no interest in antagonizing a wide portion of the electorate in an election year. It doesn't matter anyway, at least not to the president. All he cares about is his bid for re-election, and whether this latest stunt helps improve the turnout of Latino voters. It might. People get fooled, especially if they're not paying attention. In fact, I've realized that Obama's immigration record is most impressive to those who follow it least closely. In other words, the closer you follow the record, the less impressive it seems. Overheard on CNN.com: Decision to defer some deportations symbolic . In the words of Ronald Reagan, the last president to actually grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants and not just talk about it, Latino voters, immigrant advocates and the DREAM'ers themselves should -- in response to this latest promise -- ""trust, but verify."" And, given the administration's record, they can skip the first part. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Obama administration says it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants .

"(CNN) -- An American pilot whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union will be posthumously awarded the Silver Star next week, 50 years after he was released from prison and returned to the United States. The award for valor is being bestowed on Francis Gary Powers for exhibiting ""exceptional loyalty"" during harsh interrogation while in captivity by the Soviet Union for nearly two years, the Air Force said. The Silver Star is the third-highest combat military decoration awarded to members of any U.S. military branch for valor in the face of the enemy, the Air Force said. The award will be presented to his family Friday during a ceremony at the Pentagon, officials said. 7 Special Forces soldiers receive Silver Star for Afghan valor . Powers was shot down on May 1, 1960, during a reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union, and spent 21 months in a Moscow prison. He languished through 61 days of interrogation by the KGB, a trial and conviction for espionage and started serving a 10-year sentence. The incident was one of the most dramatic and tense moments of the Cold War, and is credited in large part with the collapse of arms control talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the Paris Summit. Toast to Silver Star-awarded fallen sailor goes viral . After the United States denied the downed plane was used for spying, the Soviets produced large pieces of the plane and put Powers on television. During the summit, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev launched into a tirade against President Dwight D. Eisenhower for refusing to apologize, and Eisenhower canceled the talks. Powers finally returned to the United States in 1962 after a spy exchange with the Soviet Union. He wrote about his rocky return to the U.S. in his 1970 book, ""Operation Overflight: A Memoir of the U-2 Incident."" Upon his return, Powers was criticized for not destroying his plane and the intelligence cache, and for not taking a suicide pill before the Soviets captured him. He was debriefed by the CIA and testified before the Senate Armed Services Select Committee. It was determined that he followed orders and did not give away critical information to the Soviet Union. Powers worked at Lockheed Martin for seven years and later served as a helicopter pilot broadcasting traffic updates in Los Angeles. He died in a 1977 helicopter crash.","NEW: Powers' family will receive the Silver Star on his behalf .

"(CNN) -- An illegal immigrant who this week was awarded $200,000 in a lawsuit against a Tennessee sheriff's office will ask a federal judge to grant her permission to remain in the United States legally, her attorney told CNN. A jury on Thursday awarded Juana Villegas the damages in a civil case against the joint government of Nashville and Davidson County in which she alleged that county sheriff's deputies violated her rights when they shackled her while pregnant, while in labor and during her postpartum recovery. She had initially filed suit against federal officials, but the judge dismissed that part of the case . Now, her attorney, Elliott Ozment, says that he will ask the judge who oversaw the case to grant his client a U-visa, a special status that can be conferred on victims of crimes who are in the country illegally. The U-visa would allow Villegas -- a Mexican national -- to live and work legally in the country for three years, and can be renewed for another three years, Ozment said. During that period, she can adjust her status and become a legal citizen. It's a long shot, as a U-visa has been awarded by a federal judge only one time before. Usually, they are conferred by other immigration authorities. ""We think the level of misconduct has risen to such a high level that she deserves a U-visa for what she suffered,"" Ozment said. ""She has been the victim of a terrible, terrible wrong."" Consideration of Villegas' fate comes as the Department of Homeland Security announces its intention to individually review roughly 300,000 pending deportation cases in federal immigration courts. Lower-priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- will be suspended. Villegas' story begins on July 3, 2008, when she was nine months pregnant and driving home with her three children from a doctor's appointment in metro Nashville. A police officer pulled her over and, according to Villegas' complaint, decided to arrest her for driving without a license because the officer suspected she was in the country illegally. The decision to arrest her was influenced by a controversial agreement between the police department and the federal government that allowed local officers to help enforce immigration laws, known as section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. She was transported to a detention center, where two days later, she went into labor. According to court documents, Villegas was taken to Nashville General Hospital where she was placed on a gurney with her hands and feet shackled. Once in her hospital room, two Davidson County sheriff's deputies refused to leave the room while she changed into her hospital gown, and unplugged her phone so she couldn't alert her husband about her labor, court documents say. Afterwards, one of the deputies shackled her left foot and right hand to the hospital bed, something that the medical staff called a ""barbaric"" violation of medical standards, court records state. The shackles were finally removed before she delivered the baby. ""During the trial she testified about how she was afraid for the safety of her baby,"" her attorney, Ozment said. ""She didn't know what to expect. She didn't know what was going to happen."" After she had delivered the baby, and against doctor's orders, a third deputy shackled her to the bed again, according to the court documents. The sheriff's department's policies that led the deputies to shackle her throughout the ordeal were a violation of the U.S. and Tennessee constitutions, her lawyers argued. In April, U.S. District Judge William Haynes ruled in favor of Villegas, and after a three-day trial this week, the jury set the $200,000 award. Villegas' lawyers had asked for $1.2 million. Villegas also sued the U.S. government, alleging that she was wrongly arrested under the program. That lawsuit was dismissed. Villegas had once been deported from San Diego and returned illegally into the United States, and had lived here for years, her lawyer said. At the time of her arrest, her eldest son was 14, and he had been born in the United States.","Juana Villegas sued a sheriff's office for violating her rights .

"(CNN) -- A sensational strike from Poland captain Jakub Blaszczykowski kept alive the co-hosts' hopes of reaching the quarter finals of Euro 2012 as they held Russia to a 1-1 draw. Russia had looked set for a second successive victory that would have sealed their place in the last eight, thanks to Alan Dzagoev's third goal of the tournament. Dzagoev reacted quickest to glance home Andrei Arshavin's first-half free kick and take his place as the tournament's top goalscorer. But Blaszczykowski struck a superb left-foot equaliser on 57 minutes to earn Poland a second successive 1-1 draw and ensure that Group A remains wide open. Earlier, Czech Republic had kept their qualification hopes alive with a deserved 2-1 win over Greece, who can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Russia in their final game. Czech Republic 2-1 Greece . The Czechs, needing a response following their 4-1 defeat to Russia, got off to a remarkably fast start. Two goals in the opening six minutes saw them take immediate control of a game they were desperate to win. First, Petr Jiracek took advantage of an incisive pass from Joroslav Plasil to fire past Greece goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias. Greece conceded again three minutes later when lively full-back Gebre Selassie cut in from the right and pulled the ball back beyond the grasp of Chalkias for Vaclav Pilar to bundle in. It was an even worse start than the Greek's first-half horror show against co-hosts Poland and when the beleagured Chalkias shuffled off to be replaced by Michalis Sifakis midway through the first half, it was hard to tell if he was injured or had simply had enough. Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out. Proof of that was served when Giorgos Fotakis headed in four minutes before half-time, only to see his effort ruled out for the narrowest of offsides. Their luck slowly began to change after the break, though, and finally turned courtesy of a horrible mistake by Czech Republic's highly experienced goalkeeper Cech. The Chelsea goalkeeper appeared to have Giorgios Samaras' low cross covered, but the presence of defender Tomas Sivok seemed to distract Cech, who fumbled the ball to allow substitute Theofanis Gekas to roll the loose ball into an empty net. Having fought back from a goal down and with only 10 men in their first game against Poland, Greece looked set to stage another second-half revival. But their approach play remained predictable and Cech, eager to make amends for his error, was never seriously threatened again. The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages. Poland 1-1 Russia . Tuesday may have been Russia day, but Blaszczykowski's sensational equaliser ensured it became a national day of celebration in Poland too. The co-hosts remain unbeaten after a second successive 1-1 draw and Blaszczykowski's 57th-minute thunderbolt provided a fitting hallmark to a hugely entertaining game. It ensured Poland took away the point they deserved, but it could have been more. The co-hosts made a lively start and the impressive Robert Lewandowski saw a crisp left-foot strike fly just over before Eugen Polanski had a goal disallowed for offside. Instead, it was Russia who took control eight minutes before half-time. Andrei Arshavin was the provider, his searching free-kick inviting Dzagoev to ease through a crowded area and steer home a deft header. Russia looked set to build on that lead and Arshavin remained a constant threat, but too often his final pass proved wayward. That was a trait which ultimately came to haunt Russia as, from one such stray ball, Poland broke with devastating effect. When the ball finally found its way to Blaszczykowski, he took one right-foot touch to set himself up for a shot before unleashing an unstoppable left-foot shot that flew past Russian keeper Vyacheslav Malafeev. Malafeev had no chance with that strike but rescued his side on three other occasions to ensure that Russia stay top of Group A -- but with everything to play for in Saturday's final round of group matches.","Co-hosts Poland share 1-1 draw with Russia in Group A .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- An estimated 10,000 Argentines marched on the historic Plaza de Mayo in the capital, Buenos Aires, on Wednesday to demand more anti-crime measures, reflecting a top priority among Argentines, according to recent polls. Graciela Lopez takes part in the march on Wednesday. Her 16-year-old son was killed by a drunk driver in 2007. There were other anti-crime marches throughout Argentina on Wednesday night, as well. At least three police officers have been killed in Buenos Aires in recent weeks, and other high-profile crimes have grabbed the nation's attention. An employee of Argentina's most famous TV talk-show host, Susana Gimenez, was killed last month. That prompted Gimenez to call for the return of the death penalty. The death penalty was outlawed in Argentina in 1984, a year after the country's military ended its seven-year dictatorship, during which some 30,000 people were killed. Organizers used the Internet to mobilize people, setting up a Web page asking Congress to declare a national security emergency, and creating a Facebook page for the march. More than 106,000 people signed up as ""friends."" Those gathered in the Plaza de Mayo -- many carrying photos of their dead loved ones -- asked their leaders to act against rising crime. ""We need to scream loud, so our president can hear us. All social classes are being affected by this crime wave. There needs to be sanctions for those responsible for this insecurity,"" said Graciela Lopez, 43, whose 16-year-old son was killed by a drunk driver in 2007. A small-business owner who was robbed in November echoed Lopez's sentiments: . ""The police patrol cars hardly ever pass by. We are surrounded by delinquents. Our kids can't even take the bus to school without being worried about being assaulted. We are here to ask the government to get aware of what is happening to us, and that our president finds an answer for this insecurity,"" said Liliana Peyrera, 41, who owns an ice cream shop in the Buenos Aires suburb of La Tablada. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been criticized for not focusing enough on crime. Her justice minister has defended the government's efforts, saying Argentina has one of the lowest murder rates in South America. ""The government -- from the president to the senators to the judges -- they need to comply and uphold the laws that exist. We don't need new laws; we need to prosecute people that break the law,"" said Jorge Quiroga, 62, a mechanic who attended the march with his wife.","Buenos Aires rally is largest of various anti-crime protests across Argentina .

"(CNN) -- Severe storms tore through the Midwest and South Friday into Saturday, killing at least 39 people. The National Weather Service confirms 42 tornadoes hit 10 states, stretching from Alabama to Ohio. This comes only days after another deadly line of storms spawned multiple tornadoes, damaging hundreds of homes and businesses across seven states. Disaster relief organizations are mobilizing across the region to provide aid to survivors and begin cleanup efforts. Kansas . An EF2 tornado struck the small community of Harveyville, Kansas, Tuesday night during the first round of severe weather. Recovery operations and debris removal began Thursday, and over 500 volunteers and 55 private contractors turned out to help, according the Kansas Adjutant General's Department. ""There's a lot of devastation. It's really, really rough. You're looking at people's lives,"" one volunteer told CNN affiliate KTKA. ""The families that are here are really grateful that we're just here to help."" The United Way of the Plains is helping coordinate volunteers. Those interested can register by e-mail to harveyvilletornado@gmail.com. The organization says no clothing donations are needed at this time, but anyone in the area with large equipment or construction materials can register by calling 2-1-1. Officials will contact you if the items are needed. Missouri . The severe storms continued through parts of Missouri early Wednesday morning. No deaths have been reported in the area, but the city of Branson suffered significant damage to its popular entertainment district. Several relief organizations responded immediately to provide meals and shelter to those in need. The AmeriCorps St. Louis Emergency Response Team set up volunteer reception centers and is coordinating efforts to remove debris. For more information on volunteering with AmeriCorps response efforts in Taney and Stone counties, log on to the Volunteer Branson website. Illinois . An EF4 tornado with 170 mph winds leveled parts of Harrisburg, Illinois, Wednesday, killing at least six. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed and about 100 people were injured by the storm, according sheriff's deputies. AmeriCares is one of the organizations providing assistance in Illinois. The organization is preparing a shipment of medical supplies and disaster relief items for a Harrisburg clinic if needed. AmeriCares is preparing additional medical and emergency assistance for other affected states, including tetanus vaccines for survivors and first responders helping with cleanup efforts. Operation Blessing International is also providing aid to storm victims and first responders in Illinois. Volunteers with the organization brought a convoy of vehicles to the area, including trailers with construction supplies and a mobile kitchen that can serve thousands of hot meals. Harrisburg Police Chief Bob Smith directed anyone interested in volunteering with cleanup efforts in the area to call Operation Blessing at 618-294-9600. Indiana . Multiple tornadoes touched down in southern Indiana during a second round of severe weather on Friday, including an EF4 that struck the town of Henryville. An EF2 tornado devastated the nearby town of Marysville. ""We have whole communities and whole neighborhoods that are completely gone,"" Indiana State Police Sgt. Jerry Goodin said. Local agencies are still assessing the damage, but the large volunteer response has already made an impact. ""It's been overwhelming the response with people wanting to help, and we really appreciate that. But right now we don't need any volunteers,"" Goodin said. ""We feel that there will be a need for volunteers later on as this cleanup continues. As that need arises, we'll put that information out there."" The American Red Cross is among the relief organizations providing aid in the area. The organization has opened shelters and is providing meals to displaced residents. Anyone wishing to volunteer with shelter operations must complete an application at the Clark County Red Cross. Scott County set up a Disaster Relief Fund for all affected communities in the area. Donations will help meet the immediate needs of individuals in Scott, Washington, Clark and Jefferson Counties. The fund has already helped provide items like blankets, socks and kerosene to local residents in need, said volunteer David Coates at the Disaster Relief Center in Scottsburg. Tax deductible donations payable to the Disaster Relief Fund can be mailed to P.O. Box 112, Scottsburg, Indiana 47170. Kentucky . Areas throughout Kentucky are picking up the pieces from several tornadoes, but overnight snowfall is complicating cleanup efforts. In the hard-hit town of West Liberty, Morgan County ARH Hospital was heavily damaged. All second floor windows of the hospital were blown out and doors were torn off their hinges. The storms caused at least 21 deaths and widespread damage across several counties in the state. ""Nobody knows what to do now really. It's just devastation,"" West Liberty resident Lana Prater told CNN's Rob Marciano. After completing work assignments in Kansas, a Veteran Emergency Response Team from Team Rubicon relocated to West Liberty to assist local authorities and other relief organizations. The team will help with search and rescue operations as needed and debris removal. Samaritan's Purse is also assisting with cleanup efforts in West Liberty. The organization sent a tractor-trailer and volunteers with emergency supplies and equipment to the town. Four other trucks are stationed in other affected areas across the Midwest. Samaritan's Purse is also asking volunteers to help with cleanup efforts in multiple areas. For more information, go online. Tennessee . The National Weather Service confirmed an EF3 and multiple EF2 tornadoes cut through several counties in Tennessee, injuring at least 29 people. The Salvation Army responded quickly to help storm victims and first responders in Tennessee and other affected states. The organization served more than 200 meals at an evacuee center in Chattanooga and set up a shelter at the Cleveland office. As the lines of storms stretched east Friday into Saturday, severe weather and tornadoes devastated other communities in Georgia, Ohio, Alabama and Ohio, causing severe damage and killing two people .

"(CNN) -- These days, people don't want to take a vacation from gaming. And it's changing the way companies like Disney Cruise Line are building their $900 million floating cities. Disney launches its newest ship, the Disney Fantasy, out of Port Canaveral, Florida, this week. On the sister ship to the Disney Dream, Walt Disney Imagineers have created interactive experiences that can't be played anywhere else -- including Disney theme parks. ""Because technology has become more progressive in the home, it challenges us as Imagineers to design experiences for guests that they can't do at home,"" said Bob Zalk, a senior show producer for Walt Disney Imagineering. ""With the Magic Play Floor, you take a piece of video wall technology, put it on the floor, and you make it an interactive experience that's very physical in nature."" The Magic Play Floor, which is available on both the Dream and the Fantasy, is made up of 32 high-definition displays that push 14 million pixels, which isn't something that's going to be replicated on an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. This massive floor puts arcade games like ""Dance Dance Revolution"" to shame and allows up to 32 kids (16 adults) to gather around the edges and interact with the video games that unfold on the screens by using their feet or hands. Around the border of these displays are light pad controllers. There are 48 sensors in each controller that detect the location, the motion and the proximity of each player. Of course, these games are based on hit Disney movies like ""TRON: Legacy,"" ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""The Princess and the Frog."" Each ship has two of these interactive floors on board in the Oceaneer Lab and Oceaneer Club for kids and tweens. ""We have magical appearances through our living character program, where Stitch from 'Lilo and Stitch' and Crush from 'Finding Nemo' appear in the spaces on screen and interact and talk live with the kids,"" said David Duffy, creative director for Disney Cruise Line Entertainment and Port Adventures. ""It really is an amazing experience for the little ones to see them make a pizza with the Magic Play Floor while Stitch talks to them in real-time."" In those same play areas, kids can also interact with Magic Play Tables, which are roughly the size of a foosball table. What separates this video game machine from anything else is that it offers full touch-screen interaction and exclusive games developed by Disney Imagineers based on films like ""Bolt"" and ""Cars."" All of the games have been designed for up to four players. ""We've designed these experiences to empower kids to go in and just do fun stuff,"" Zalk said. With more passengers now accustomed to playing games on Facebook, including the new ""Disney Animal Kingdom Explorers,"" Disney Imagineers are creating experiences that blend motion sensor technology and storytelling. The Fantasy introduces a Muppets game as part of the Midship Detective Agency catalog of experiences. Karen Leung, interactive show producer at Walt Disney Imagineering, headed the team that developed the new Muppets game, which features original video of Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang. She said that many members of her team have a game design and software development background and they keep abreast of new technology like Kinect for Xbox 360. The Midship Detective Agency, which also includes two additional games (also available on the Dream) featuring Mickey Mouse and his pals, was developed using facial capture technology and motion capture technology similar to Kinect. ""A key part of the interactive experience is the detective badge, which has a specific agent number and a special bar code,"" explained Leung. ""Each person has a unique bar code, so when you go up to a piece of art, it senses the bar code and will know what scene you're on and what game you're playing on. Depending on what piece of art you're going to, you'll see a different scene customized to where you are in the game."" The game, which sends players to all areas of the ship, is actually an additional level of interactivity that enhances Enchanted Art pieces. Guests who stand in front of this art will see animation come to life. There are video games built into the different stations, which require players to turn the badge to manipulate on-screen items like lighting fireworks and tightening pipes with a wrench. The Muppets game adds a lie detector to the equation, which offers additional interactivity with characters. (The Fantasy is also showing he Muppets' new movie in its Buena Vista Theater.) The Fantasy adds a golf simulator to the mix on Goofy's Sports Deck. Designed for avid golfers, this video game features 80 authentic courses that are displayed on a giant screen inside an air-conditioned room on one of the upper decks. Players choose from real Calloway golf clubs and swing an actual ball into the screen. ""The system uses motion sensors and infrared lines that intertwine with each other,"" explained Jaco Gouws, assistant port of interest manager on the Disney Fantasy. ""The ball goes though this system, and the angles are calculated as it passes from one line to the next, and then the ball enters the video game screen and proceeds into the course. It's designed so you can do everything from play a full game to just practice putting or go to the driving range."" For younger passengers, the room houses an adjacent simulator. Utilizing the same motion sensor and infrared technology, passengers can pick from hockey, football, soccer and baseball and use actual balls to interact with Goofy and the gang. Interactivity is spread throughout the ship, including a new dinner show at Animator's Palette that allows guests to draw an animated figure and then watch it come to life with classic Disney characters. Zalk said that just as there's been an influx of passengers who game, there are more Imagineers that have grown up playing games. That's influencing the types of experiences that are being designed for vacationers.","Each ship has two interactive floors on board for kids and tweens .

"Washington (CNN) -- For several fear-filled minutes last Friday, three passengers on board American Airlines flight 2332 in Dallas called emergency dispatchers to report a flight attendant's apparent meltdown, asking for help and trying to make sense of her strange rant. The flight, which was on the ground, never took off, and no passengers were hurt. But the 911 calls, released Tuesday, show the mutual confusion of the callers and the 911 dispatchers as they tried to piece together information, which was sparse on both sides of the phone line. ""We're on flight 2332 and, um, they're talking over the radio about crashing our plane,"" the first caller, a woman, told the emergency dispatcher. ""OK, who is talking about crashing your plane?"" the dispatcher asked. ""The attendants, over the PA,"" the caller said. ""Please help us."" Obviously perplexed, and wanting to confirm the bizarre report, the dispatcher repeated the information. ""You're currently on board the flight, and the attendants are announcing over the PA system..."" ""Yes,"" the caller interjected. ""...that they're going to crash the plane?"" the dispatcher asked. ""Yes,"" the caller said. ""Did they say why?"" ""No,"" the caller answered. The dispatcher implored the caller not to hang up, asked for her name and phone number, and asked precisely what the flight attendant said. ""Her specific words were, 'This plane is not going to take off before it crashes,'"" the passenger said. A second female passenger called, and the dispatcher told her help was on the way. ""Listen, we've got people that are coming to you. I need you to give me some information so you can help me fill them in, OK?"" the dispatcher said. ""(You are) going to be OK. As long as that plane doesn't take off, you are still fine. You are still on the ground, right?"" The passenger confirmed the plane was still on the ground and said a passenger in the back of the plane had just gone up front. ""OK, don't be alarmed. He may be a sky marshal,"" the dispatcher said. ""They fly armed and they are in plainclothes. So don't be alarmed."" The man, it was later learned, was another passenger who helped detain the flight attendant. The third 911 caller, a man, asked ""Are you all aware of what's going on on flight 2332 right now?"" ""It looks like they're physically restraining a flight attendant,"" he said. ""She's lost it. People are helping out."" Finally, another call came from the airport control tower, saying the matter was nearing a resolution. ""Flight 2332 returning to the gate. Altercation on board. Fight being reported,"" the control tower official reported. Friday morning's event at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport was a rare disruption blamed on a flight attendant, but did not appear to involve any criminal intent. Local and federal officials said they had not filed charges against the airline employee, adding to speculation she had suffered a mental breakdown. One passenger later told CNN the flight attendant appeared confused even before the flight pulled away from the gate. The passenger said she overheard the flight attendant say she was bipolar and had not taken her medication. As the plane taxied towards the runway, the flight attendant made references to needing to perform ""cross-checks,"" and then appeared to be attempting to reach the pilots. Unable to reach the pilots, she announced on the plane's public address system that she was no longer responsible for the safety of the aircraft and that it might crash. Fellow crew members scuffled with the woman for control of the microphone, and passengers moved in to restrain her. The flight attendant and a colleague were taken to a hospital for treatment, American Airlines said.","Flight attendant reportedly suffered mental breakdown on American Airlines flight .

"(CNN) -- Forty-four years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down on the balcony of a Memphis hotel, the Tennessee city is overcoming what some call protracted guilt and embarrassment, and naming a street in his honor. A nearly 1-mile stretch of Linden Avenue will be renamed Dr. M.L. King Jr. Avenue on April 4, the anniversary of the civil rights leader's assassination. The honor has been a long time coming. More than 900 U.S. cities have streets named after King. The largest concentration is in the South, led by Georgia which, according to an article by Derek H. Alderman of East Carolina University in the New Georgia Encyclopedia, has more than 70 roads named after the Atlanta native, . But in the city where he died, the omission has been, to many, glaring. ""We never wanted to address losing Dr. King's life here,"" said former Memphis City Councilman Berlin Boyd, who helped lead the street-naming effort. Born and raised in Memphis, Boyd, 34, said he always wondered why there was no official street tribute for King. During his brief five-month term in a vacated council seat -- from August to January -- Boyd decided to get the ball rolling. ""I had the opportunity to do something, and we got it done,"" Boyd said. The east-west Linden Avenue, while less famous than Beale Street with its many blues clubs and restaurants just a block north, was selected because that was where King marched in support of striking sanitation workers. The avenue also was a pivotal location during the strike. A photo shows the civil rights leader on Linden, Boyd said. The council proposal was approved earlier this year by a land-use control board. ""He marched along this street; we wanted something that had a real nexus to this city,"" said Mayor A.C. Wharton. One of Dr. King's associates during the 1968 sanitation workers' march was the Rev. James Netters, a former city council member. Netters advocated for an intersection in honor of King in the early 1970s; The council decided to rename a portion of Interstate 240 as a substitute, he said. ""Naming Linden is better than nothing,"" Netters said. The downtown thoroughfare is close to the historic Clayborn-Ball Temple, a focal point for many meetings of the sanitation strikers. King was scheduled to speak there on April 3, 1968, but, because of a large crowd, the rally was moved to Mason Temple. It was there that he delivered his famous ""I've Been to the Mountaintop"" address. Linden Avenue is a busy downtown thoroughfare and is on one side of FedExForum, home of the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. The area around the street is undergoing a significant transformation, Wharton said. ""This is the right time"" to rename the street, the mayor said. Demolition of a public housing project is making way for a mixed-use development, and other projects will change the landscape. Long-term plans include naming up to 5 miles of Linden Avenue for King. King was killed April 4, 1968, by James Earl Ray. The National Civil Rights Museum, located at the Lorraine Motel where he was killed, will sponsor a commemoration on the anniversary date. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was with King at the Lorraine, said the assassination left Memphis with a deep sense of pain and guilt. He contends the city could ""do more to memorialize Dr. King's legacy."" For the city, the street naming is a large symbolic step in honoring King. ""There is no way we could do enough for him ... that would measure up to what he gave up the United States of America,"" Wharton said.","A 1-mile stretch of Linden Avenue will be named after the civil rights leader .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan came from behind to defeat Juventus 2-1 in Thursday's Italian Cup quarterfinal, increasing the pressure on Juve coach Ciro Ferrara. Diego's 10th-minute strike looked to have set the Bianconeri on their way to a much-needed victory at the San Siro. But Lucio levelled after 72 minutes and Mario Balotelli grabbed a last-gasp winner for Inter to secure a two-legged last-four date with Fiorentina next month. Ferrara's side came into the match on the back of five defeats in six Serie A games and lying sixth in the table -- a mammoth 16 points adrift of leaders Inter. But, despite their poor recent run, the visitors started well and broke the deadlock after just 10 minutes. Diego cut inside Esteban Cambiasso and lashed a low shot through the legs of Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo. But Inter fought back after the break and levelled 18 minutes from time when goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was left wrong-footed when Wes Sneijder's free-kick took a wicked deflection -- and Lucio nipped in at the far post to prod home the equalizer. And Buffon was powerless to prevent Inter's winner at the death, keeping out Thiago Motta's initial effort but unable to prevent Balotelli to net the rebound. Meanwhile, in Spain, Getafe reached the Copa del Rey semifinals despite losing 1-0 at home to Real Mallorca. Aritz Aduritz made up for an earlier penalty miss with a 45th-minute headed goal to level the aggregate score 2-2. But Getafe's two away goals from the first leg 2-1 proved enough to send the Madrid side through to face Sevilla in a repeat of the 2007 cup final.","Inter Milan reach the Italian Cup semifinals after defeating Juventus 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- The new 15-inch MacBook Pro will be a significant departure from the current design, with a retina display and an ultra-thin profile, 9to5Mac claims, citing sources from Apple's supply chain. It will be so thin, in fact, that it won't have room for an optical drive, just like its lightweight cousin MacBook Air. Other design changes include a power button on the keyboard itself (replacing the eject button) and, possibly, the lack of an Ethernet port (replaced by an extra Thunderbolt port). The MacBook Pro's new retina display -- the same technology that's in the new iPad -- is described as ""definitely the most important Mac innovation in years"" by the sources who've handled a prototype of the device. The specifics are unknown, but users should be able to choose between several Retina resolution modes. Finally, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro will have USB 3.0 support, and the latest Ivy Bridge processors from Intel are a safe bet, too.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Brooke Mueller, the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen, will undergo drug rehab at home while caring for her young twins, her spokesman said Monday. Mueller was arrested in Aspen, Colorado, on December 3 and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said. ""Recognizing past attempts at treatment have not been successful, Brooke has decided to take a different approach to deal with her addiction,"" spokesman Steve Honig said. Mueller will take part in a rehab program during the day, but she will be ""under expert supervision 24 hours a day, seven days a week,"" Honig said. ""In addition, Brooke has requested to be tested on a daily basis for cocaine and other illegal substances so there is no doubt as to her commitment."" The 2-year-old sons she shares with Sheen will stay in Mueller's custody and will ""be cared for by Brooke and their longtime nanny,"" Honig said. ""Charlie and Brooke's family are all fully supportive of this decision and recognize the importance of maintaining the children's normal routine."" The incidents in Aspen began when a woman at the Belly Up -- a bar and performance venue there -- complained that Mueller had been ""the aggressor"" in an assault, Aspen police said. Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar, Escobar, police said. She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, which is a felony, and third-degree assault, which is a misdemeanor. She was released after posting an $11,000 bond, Aspen police said. A court date is scheduled for December 19. Mueller has appeared as an actress in several movies, including 2004's ""A Love Song for Bobby Long,"" according to IMDb. But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen, with whom she has twin sons. The boys and Mueller were part of Sheen's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network's ""Two and Half Men."" She claimed in March that he'd threatened to kill her, saying, ""I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom,"" according to a declaration made in a restraining order against Sheen. The revelations led to a court order removing the 2-year-old boys from Sheen's home. The actor called the allegation ""colorful"" and described the quote attributed to him as fabricated in an interview with NBC's ""Today Show."" Mueller has sought help for substance abuse and stress-related issues in the past. Last December, her attorney, Yale Galanter, said that she entered a sober living facility. Earlier, in April 2010, Mueller had checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a ""return to old problems,"" her representative said. She was in substance abuse rehab earlier in 2010 ""to get her health in order,"" Galanter said at the time. The couple was involved in an alleged domestic dispute in Aspen on Christmas Day 2009 that resulted in felony charges against Sheen. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","Brooke Mueller will take part in a daytime drug program, but have 24/7 supervision .

"(CNN) -- Some of golf's biggest names failed Friday to make the cut at the U.S. Open, victims of the Olympic Club's unforgiving roughs and slick greens. The departure of such big names as defending champion Rory McIlroy, Bubba Watson and world No. 1 Luke Donald seems to have paved the way for the sport's biggest star, Tiger Woods. Woods had another solid day Friday, moving to a tie for the lead with Jim Furyk and David Toms. They all ended 1-under through two rounds. Furyk, winner of the 2003 U.S. Open, said he will be ready for the weekend. ""I feel solid and in control so far,"" Furyk told reporters. ""I know it's going to get even ... firmer and faster and even more of a stern test for the weekend."" U.S. Open leaderboard . Others struggled on the tree-lined San Francisco golf course despite the near-perfect weather. McIlroy finished 10 over. The 23-year-old Northern Irishman may have sealed his fate on the last hole Friday. McIlroy seemed to have a birdie putt set up nicely to get him to eight over. Instead, he three-putted for a bogey in a shaky performance that had the crowd groaning and McIlroy looking to the sky in frustration. ""You really have to be so precise out there, and if you're not, you're going to get punished,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""It's just something that you have to adjust to in this tournament. I wasn't able to do that very well this week."" Watson finished at 9 over as he continued to struggle hitting fairways. The grouping of Woods, Phil Mickelson and Watson was billed as the marquee pairing of popular champions, but Woods was the only one who lived up to the billing. Five-time U.S. Open runner-up Mickelson barely made the cut by ending at 7 over. The veteran lefty got a birdie at the end of the round. Also having a disappointing showing was Donald, who wilted on the northern California course, finishing 11 over. Donald said his game was off both Thursday and Friday. ""I think I missed nine putts inside 10 feet yesterday and just couldn't get the feel for the greens, the reads, the speed,"" the 34-year-old Englishman told reporters. Another crowd favorite missing the cut was 14-year-old Andy Zhang. The Chinese teen, who is the youngest golfer to ever compete in the U.S. Open, was widely followed. He had some good shots both Thursday and Friday but was plagued by stretches of bogeys and double bogeys and ended 17 over. Casey Martin, playing his first major since the U.S. Open at the same venue in 1998, missed the cut by one shot. He carded 75 to be 9 over along with Watson and 20 other players including major winners Lucas Glover, Y.E. Yang and Louis Oosthuizen. Now a coach, the 40-year-old needs a cart to get around the course due to a birth defect which causes pain in his right leg. He was the first golfer to use a cart in a major 14 years ago, causing controversy and sparking a law suit by the PGA Tour.","Tiger Woods is tied for the lead at the U.S. Open after two rounds .

"(CNN) -- Last weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix was an encouraging race for Ferrari, with Fernando Alonso's victory lifting some of the gloom which had descended over the legendary Italian team after a disappointing preseason. But while double world champion Alonso celebrated an unlikely triumph in one garage, the mood was considerably more sombre in the camp of his teammate Felipe Massa. The Brazilian has seen his position at Formula One's most successful team constantly called into question, having struggled to recapture his best form after fracturing his skull during a freak accident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. The former Sauber driver's downturn continued with a disappointing 15th-place finish at the Sepang International Circuit, having failed to finish the season-opening race in Australia after colliding with Williams' Bruno Senna. But Ferrari's team principal Stefano Domenicali has backed the 30-year-old to answer his critics. ""I well remember that, four years ago, in fact right after a Malaysian Grand Prix, which was won for us by Kimi Raikkonen, Felipe was more or less in the same situation as today,"" Domenicali told the team's official website. ""The papers were demanding his immediate replacement and he managed to react in the best way possible, thanks to support from the team, which saw him win two of the next three races."" In 2008, Massa was denied his first world title in heartbreaking circumstances. He won the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix and began celebrating, but was denied the championship by one point as McLaren's British driver Lewis Hamilton overtook Timo Glock on the final corner to finish fifth and steal the glory. ""We remember how that particular season ended, with the Brazilian actually world champion, even if it was just for a few seconds, while we took our sixteenth Constructors' title,"" Domenicali said. He also revealed that, instead of spending time with his family ahead of the next race in China on April 15, Massa is heading to Italy to work with the team at Ferrari's home base. ""He will be in Maranello to work alongside the engineers to calmly analyze everything that happened in these past two races, trying to identify why he was not able to deliver what he is capable of,"" Domenicali said. ""That's the right spirit and we are here, ready to help him."" Despite a positive result in Malaysia, Domenicali warned there is still work to do to ensure the F2012 car is competitive ahead of the next race in Shanghai. ""I asked all my people to push to the maximum to try to bring forward as much as possible the developments planned for the next few races,"" he said. ""Having Fernando leading the championship means nothing, and we definitely don't think all our problems have been made to vanish with the wave of a magic wand.""","Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali says Felipe Massa can return to form .

"(CNN) -- Days of escalating government protests failed to halt the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday, which took place even as nearby streets were blocked with burning tires and trash. Opposition calls for large protests had raised fears the Grand Prix would have to be canceled for a second year in a row and pose a threat to Formula One crews, workers, and fans. There were no major signs of protest at the race itself. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel secured the win, followed by Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean of Lotus-Renault. Activists said police arrested a group of at least seven female protesters inside the circuit who held up a signs demanding the release of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a member of the opposition who has been on a hunger strike for more than two months. A government spokesman said he could not confirm those reports. ""It has been reported but not confirmed that two women have been detained out of 50,000 attendees,"" Bahraini government spokesman Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa said. ""They tried to cause a scene at the end of the race, but they did not get very far."" Sunday's race was a ""huge success,"" he said. In addition, television reporter Jonathan Miller and members of his crew from Britain's Channel 4 were taken into custody, though there was no immediate explanation as to why. British Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote on Twitter, at what was then early Monday morning in Bahrain, that he was ""very concerned about (the journalists) detention"" and that embassy officials were ""seeking urgent consular access."" A short time later, Miller sent a message himself on Twitter declaring he'd ""been released with my crew. Breakneck drive to Bahrain airport in police van. Being deported now."" The foreign affairs correspondent wrote that police ""refused to give us back our cameras and computers,"" and that his driver and an activist accompanying them were still in custody. ""We are assured they will be freed soon,"" Miller said. Anti-government protesters had called the race a publicity stunt by the country's rulers to make the nation appear more unified. The Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled twice last year amid an uprising sparked by the success of popular revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Bahrain's Sunni-ruled government brutally crushed the Shiite uprising, though the opposition has continued to demand political reform in protests and, occasionally, clashes with authorities. The February 14 Youth Coalition, an opposition group that took its name from the day the Bahrain uprising began last year, had urged protesters to turn out during the race Sunday. ""We ask the rebels in the western villages to escalate the revolutionary mobilization to the highest levels and to continue to target the street leading to the Bahrain circuit,"" the group said on its Facebook page. Protests with burning tires and trash blocked most of the secondary roads leading to the race track, though the main highway remained open, said Mohammed al Maskati of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights. There were also protests in many nearby villages, he said. The government spokesman said there were ""pockets of violence in remote parts of the country, but there has been no activity that has been seen anywhere around the circuit or on the way to the capital."" Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa had said another race cancellation would play into extremists' hands, according to the state-run Bahrain News Agency. And the sport's governing body vowed the event would go on, despite continuing high tensions. On the eve of the race, security forces in a suburb of Manama clashed with thousands of protesters who were attempting to march to the highway that leads to the Formula One circuit. At least three people were injured during clashes, al Maskati said. The demonstration was in response to the death of a protester whose body was found early Saturday on a farm outside Manama, a day after he took part in a demonstration that was broken up by security forces, according to opposition groups. Bahrain's leading opposition party Al-Wefaq and the Bahrain Youth Society identified the man as Salah Abbas Habib Musa. The Bahrain Interior Ministry confirmed the identity of the 36-year-old man, and said the case is under investigation. Formula One is the world's most popular motor sport, and races have a TV audience of more than 500 million. Canceling the race last year cost Bahrain an estimated $480 to $800 million in potential investments. The Bahraini government has played down any risk to visitors, saying the Grand Prix will act as a unifying force amid the nation's civil unrest. Bahrain has declined to extend the visas of non-sports reporting crews from CNN, Reuters and other news outlets and told them they would not be allowed to stay for the race. Protesters, meanwhile, are using the international spotlight on the Grand Prix to call for the release of al-Khawaja, who was arrested about a year ago. Al-Khawaja is protesting the life sentence he received for his role in anti-government demonstrations. Denmark's ambassador met Sunday with al-Khawaja, who once lived in the country and holds Danish citizenship. The Danish government has asked that Bahrain turn him over; Bahraini officials have refused. He was in stable condition Sunday, the Bahraini government spokesman said. Al-Khawaja can appeal his life sentence during a hearing Monday, the government has said. CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Salma Abdelaziz, Becky Anderson and Paul Gittings contributed to this report.","NEW: A British TV crew is detained and then released and deported, one of them says .

"(CNN) -- The guitarist stands in front of a mirror messing with his mohawk. The drummer strikes a wild tempo. The singer rips off his T-shirt and begins to scream the lyrics. Basim Usmani is bassist for The Kominas, a group that blends traditional sounds with punk rock beats. They're young. They're punk. And they're rocking both their Muslim and American worlds with their music, lyrics and style. ""A lot of times people say, 'Oh wow, look, brown people playing music' [but] it's more than that,"" said 25-year-old Pakistani-American Shahjehan Khan, the lead singer for a Muslim punk band, The Kominas. The Boston-based band is one of a handful of Muslim punk bands that emerged in the United States in the past few years. The members of this four-person rock group with South Asian roots hold varying views on religion. One says he's an atheist; three others identify as Muslims -- both practicing and non-practicing. For them, punk music is a way to rebel against their conservative cultural upbringing and the frustrations of growing up a young Muslim in America. ""We aren't [just] some alternative to a stereotypical Muslim. We actually might be offering some sort of insights for people at large about religion, about the world,"" said 26-year-old bassist Basim Usmani. Blending traditional South Asian rhythms with punk rock beats, they sing in both English and Punjabi. (Kominas means ""scum-bag"" in Punjabi, according to the band.) Their songs can be at once political, serious, satirical and insinuating.  Audio slide show: On tour with Muslim punk rockers » . Their risqué lyrics and provocative song titles such as ""Sharia Law in the USA,"" ""Suicide Bomb the GAP"" and ""Rumi was a Homo"" -- a protest song against homophobia in the American Muslim community -- have drawn the attention of Muslims, non-Muslims, fans and critics alike. ""You sort of have to throw it in peoples' faces and be shocking in order to give people a different way to think about stuff,"" said Usmani. ""These punk, metal and rap scenes - so-called extreme music scenes -- are addressing issues that mainstream music doesn't,"" said Mark LeVine, a professor of Middle Eastern history at University of California, Irvine, who is also a musician and author of ""Heavy Metal Islam."" ""[Punk] allows them to rebel against society and their own culture at the same time,"" he said. iReport: Is Islam at odds with American values? Before the Islamic punk movement in North America had a voice, it had a story. The Muslim punk scene began to gel in 2003 when novelist and convert to Islam, Michael Muhammad Knight self-published his book, ""The Taqwacores"" about a fictional Muslim punk scene in Buffalo, New York. The book opens with a poem called ""Muhammed was a Punk Rocker"" and describes both conventional and unconventional characters including a Shi'ite skinhead, a conservative Sunni Muslim, a burka-wearing feminist punk and a Sufi who sports a Mohawk and drinks alcohol. ""The punk rock kids I would hang out with weren't even Muslim,"" 31-year old Knight recalls. ""They were so fiercely individualistic -- I wish that I could be a Muslim in that way: not be ashamed of my confusion, not be ashamed of my doubts. Just be myself and be proud of who I am."" The novel's title, ""Taqwacore,"" is a hybrid word stemming from the Arabic ""taqwa,"" meaning ""god consciousness,"" and ""core"" referring to ""hardcore"" -- a genre of punk music. It's now a general term for Muslim punk rock. The popularity of the book, which Knight said was born out of a search to find his identity as a Muslim-American, grew in underground youth circles and online. It didn't take long before real-life ""taqwacore"" bands like The Kominas began blooming across the country. ""It makes sense why punk has been the music of choice for young, politically active Muslims who are musical,"" said LeVine. ""The straight edge movement in punk which was about no drugs, no alcohol, was clean yet very intense and political. It's a way for them to rebel against their families in some extreme ways yet still be ritualistically, 'good Muslims.' "" ""Taqwacore"" gave voice to many young Muslim-Americans who felt muted by circumstances and created an opening for bands like Al-Thawra, Vote Hezbollah, and Secret Trial Five -- an all-girl punk band out of Vancouver, Canada. In the summer of 2007, five of the taqwacore bands organized a ""taqwa-tour"" of the northeastern United States. They played in city after city, traveling in a green school bus with TAQWA painted on the front bought by Knight for $2,000 on eBay. This summer, The Kominas continue to strike a chord with audiences around the country, hitting cities from San Francisco to New York on a multi-city tour. The taqwacore movement has also inspired two upcoming films - a dramatic feature film based on the book and a documentary. Many conservative Muslims may peg young taqwacores as heretic for their suggestive and irreverent lyrics. But the musicians say they are just trying to show both cultures how broad the spectrum of belief can be. Like many young adults balancing their religious beliefs with American culture, some young Muslims in the United States say it's a constant struggle to be accepted in both worlds. ""I had a lot of conflicted feelings growing up a Muslim in America,"" said 25-year-old Kominas drummer Imran Malik. ""It was hard not being able to do the same things that everyone else around you is doing without feeling guilty about them."" Knight, who grew up with a Catholic mother and white supremacist father, converted to Islam when he was 16. He said his message is not one of blasphemy but rather an extension of his discontent with the rigid etiquette that dictates certain practices within Islam and the stereotypes of Muslims in American. ""Muslims haven't been fully accepted as Americans but the American experience hasn't been accepted as something that can contribute to the Muslim world,"" said Knight. Knight said writing the book helped him and others connect through shared experiences. ""When I first wrote it, I felt like there would never be a place for me in the Muslim community and that has really turned around a lot,"" he said. ""The book gave me the community I needed, it connected me to all these kids that were also confused and who also went through the things that I went through."" That connection is vital to taqwacore music, bassist Usmani said. ""The music is great, but the conversation is the key to all of this. The dialogue that we have inspired is really invaluable."" ""I don't think Islam is ever going to go away, I'm just trying to see how it best fits in my life.""","A handful of Muslim punk bands have emerged in the last few years .

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka have booked their place in the semifinals of the Cricket World Cup with an emphatic 10-wicket win over England in Colombo. Openers Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga both made centuries as they overcame England's total of 229 for six with more than 10 overs to spare. Earlier, England won the toss and elected to bat and got off to a steady start as Ian Bell joined captain Andrew Strauss at the top of the order. But both were out in quick succession. Strauss bowled by Dilshan for five with the score on 29, while Bell fell two runs later for 25, caught by Thilan Samaraweera off the bowling of Angelo Mathews. Jonathan Trott and Ravi Bopara put on 64 for the third wicket, but by the time Bopara was trapped lbw by Muttiah Muralitharan for 31 in the 27th over England had only made 95 runs. Eoin Morgan hurried things along a little scoring a brisk half century, but when he fell with the score on 186 any momentum that had been gained quickly dissipated. Trott battled on until the penultimate over of the innings scoring 86 from 115 balls before becoming Muralitharan's second victim. New Zealand shock South Africa . Matt Prior tried to swing the willow at the death but could only muster one boundary in the final over -- England only scored 12 fours in the entire innings -- to give England a score of 229, and an outside chance of victory. But any hopes they might have harbored were quickly snuffed out as Sri Lanka took total control of the match. None of England's six bowlers ever really troubled Dilshan or Tharanga and the game progressed to a predictable and rather anti-climactic conclusion. Afterwards, England captain, Andrew Strauss conceded his team's total was always going to be difficult to defend. ""I think we were 30 light and at the end it felt like 50 light. I thought if we took early wickets we'd be in with a chance but fair play to Sri Lanka, the opening batsmen were outstanding,"" Strauss said. Sri Lanka's victory sets up a meeting with New Zealand next Tuesday for a place in the final which takes place in Mumbai on April 2.","Both openers score centuries as Sri Lanka beat England in the cricket World Cup quarterfinal .

"(CNN) -- Former world player of the year Ronaldinho will return home to Brazil, according to his Italian club AC Milan. The 30-year-old has been targeted by the new owners of English Premier League club Blackburn Rovers, but he is now expected to rejoin his hometown club Gremio of Porto Alegre. ""We are all sorry to lose a player of the quality of Ronaldinho. But he has made a life choice by going to Brazil,"" AC Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters ahead of the resumption of the Serie A program on Thursday. Ronaldinho is contracted to Milan until June, but is heading back to Rio de Janeiro as the two clubs seek to make a deal, according to Italian media. Who will be the best deals of the January sales? ""If it were up to me, I would already be wearing the shirt of Gremio, even if at the cost of earning less. The problem is not what they offered me, but what Milan are asking for,"" he said in quotes reported by La Gazetta Della Sport. If Gremio cannot agree a fee, then Brazilian rivals Flamengo will step in to sign Ronaldinho, according to Radio Globo. He has been unable to resurrect his career since leaving Barcelona in 2008, losing his regular place this season following the arrival of compatriot Robinho and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Ronaldinho's place in the Milan squad has gone to Italy international Antonio Cassano, but Allegri said the former Sampdoria player was not certain to feature even as a substitute in the league leaders' trip to Cagliari. Blackburn chase Ronaldinho and Beckham . The other big story of the January transfer window, David Beckham's proposed loan move to English club Tottenham, still remains in doubt. However, British media widely reported on Wednesday that his American owners the LA Galaxy will sanction an off-season switch. Tottenham's Premier League rivals Newcastle, who have also been linked with the 35-year-old former England captain along with Blackburn, tied up a permanent deal for France international Hatem Ben Arfa. The 23-year-old winger had been on loan from Marseille, but is now contracted until mid-2015 after impressing before the double leg break he suffered in October. ""During my time out, I have been inundated with messages of support from fans and I want to repay them all with good performances on the pitch later this season,"" he told the club's website. Manchester City's long-rumored signing of Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko took another step forward as the Wolfsburg player arrived in England for a medical. City boss Roberto Mancini revealed on Tuesday that the German club had agreed to sell the 24-year-old, for a reported fee of around $40 million. Romania striker Adrian Mutu may be seeking a new club after his Italian side Fiorentina threatened to take action following his training-ground walkout on Wednesday. The club released a statement saying the 31-year-old would not play in Thursday's match against Bologna, and that he had left himself liable for possible legal action. Mutu has twice been banned for drug use, while with English club Chelsea in 2004 and last year at Fiorentina.","Italian Serie A leaders expect Ronaldinho to join a club in his native Brazil .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A local court has set free a teenage boy after finding him guilty of stealing a policeman's sandals in a case that caused furor among Indonesians frustrated with perceived injustices against the poor and defenseless. The 15-year-old could have spent five years in jail for the alleged offense. He is accused of stealing the sandals from a boarding house where the cop was staying in November 2010 but was brought to trial only last month. Indonesia's Child Protection Commission decried the verdict on Wednesday, noting that the sandals presented as evidence in the court did not belong to the policeman, a fact he affirmed in court. The Commission's secretary, Muhammad Ihsan, said in a statement to CNN, ""This verdict is controversial and it hurts people's hearts. The court could not prove it, but they still gave him a guilty verdict. To be on the safe side, the boy was returned to his parents. But the verdict will be a life-long scar on the boy because he will always be considered a sandal thief. ""The judge took a safe stand between pressure between two sides, pressure from the police and prosecutor, and pressure from the public and the media. This is a country with a thousand faces,"" the commission said. To protest the charges against the boy, a campaign to gather a thousand flip-flops began on December 28. Students, teachers, construction workers, public transport drivers and lawyers among others dropped off pairs of sandals at centers set up around the country. ""Two high school students came here, took off the sandals they were wearing and walked home barefoot,"" said Budhi Kurniawan, of the non-governmental organization SOS Children's Villages and who helped start the campaign after hearing about the case. ""We came up with the idea of a thousand sandals which we see as being the symbol of resistance also as compensation for the sandals that was allegedly stolen,"" Kurniawan said. The sandals were intended for the policeman who lost his pair ""so he doesn't have to buy another pair for the rest of his life,"" Kurniawan added. The response was overwhelming. About 1,300 pairs of used and brand new sandals were collected, as calls to donate spread through BlackBerry Messenger, Facebook and Twitter. Organizers had earlier said the campaign would end only when the boy was acquitted. To express disappointment over the verdict, the sandals would be given to different government institutions instead, Kurniawan said on Thursday -- namely the national police, the attorney general's office, the Supreme Court, the Justice and Human Rights Ministry and juvenile detention centers. The boy's parents are also considering an appeal, he added. Before Wednesday's verdict, national police spokesman Col. Boy Rafli Amar told CNN it had been the boy's parents who wanted to bring the case to trial. ""In this situation, the advice from the police was for the parents to give their son more attention and guidance, but this wasn't accepted by the parents, and they wanted the legal action to be taken."" The Child Protection Commission, however, said the parents had filed a complaint with the Palu police after the alleged victim, 1st Brig. Ahmad Rusdi Harahap, and another colleague interrogated the boy. The parents allege the policemen beat up the boy and forced him to admit to the theft. The parents, according to the commission, wanted a case filed against those policemen. Both were given disciplinary action, said Rafli, the national police spokesman. According to Ihsan of the Commission, the police should have prioritized intervention and rehabilitation since the alleged offender is a minor. There have been numerous cases of minors brought to court over petty crimes. Last year a 12 year-old-boy was tried and later acquitted for allegedly stealing loudspeakers from a mosque in West Java. Another 14-year-old was detained and charged for allegedly stealing a cell phone top up card worth $1.50. According to the Commission, in 2011 alone, 6,273 minors were reported to be serving time in jail, some of them in adult prisons. The goal is to get all juveniles out of prison and change the laws governing minor offenders, Ihsan said. A bill on the protection of children's rights is under deliberation and expected to pass this year in parliament. ""The commission is pushing to abolish juvenile punishment in Indonesia. We hope it will be included in the bill. It means that first the child needs to be returned to their parents for guidance, then given training and education, and the harshest would be rehabilitation with the right intervention. We're not asking that more juvenile facilities be built. We don't want minors in jail,"" Ihsan explained. This also is not the first time Indonesians have rallied around a victim of perceived injustice. Public pressure from a similar campaign in 2009, ""Coins for Prita,"" helped a housewife escape criminal liability for complaining in a private e-mail about a hospital's service.","Indonesia's Child Protection Commission decries verdict Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- As Paige emerges from her comatose state, she mistakes the man at her bedside, her husband Leo, for a doctor. You realize Paige has no memory of her life with Leo -- not their marriage, their love, nor their ""Vow."" And that's when it happens: . Tears ready behind your eyes. Before you know it, they've rolled down your cheeks and into your popcorn. From ""Love Story"" and ""The Notebook"" to ""The Vow,"" which opens in theaters today, Hollywood has long sought to cash in at the box office by tugging at viewers' heartstrings. And while some moviegoers will buy tickets to a poignant love story looking for a sort of cathartic experience, Mary Beth Oliver, a professor of media studies at Penn State University, says it's unclear if movies actually serve such a purpose. People certainly go to the movie theater with the intention of having a good cry and letting out certain emotions, Oliver said. However, she added, there are many reasons why films make people feel better, and the movie itself might not even be one of them. ""A lot of it has to do with who you're watching the movie with,"" Oliver said. ""If I go to the movies with my best friend, and we cry all over each other and comfort one another, I end up feeling better. But really, it was ... the support my friend gave me that made me feel better. But I attribute it to the movie."" While movies might not actually make viewers feel better, they do ""allow us to experience strong emotions in safe places,"" said John Sherry, an associate professor specializing in mass media effects at Michigan State University. ""Good writers and producers know how to arrange the elements of the film to hold you in a non-critical experience state where you are engaged with the main character, and that character's experience,"" Sherry said. ""Done well, you experience the main character's emotions along with her."" And there's a reason why movies make for such great dates. ""The way that we react to the emotional experiences in movies gives insight to how we might handle those emotional moments in real life,"" he added. When two people are just getting to know one another, and impress one another, they might think twice before expressing such emotions, said Richard J. Harris, a professor of psychology at Kansas State University. Harris, who has studied couples' experiences with watching romantic movies, said more women than men give themselves permission to respond to sad or romantic movies. But holding back emotions can actually affect a viewers' overall experience, he said. ""The enjoyment of a movie is more based on the emotions you feel, rather than the emotions you express,"" Harris noted. ""But expressing [those emotions] can actually help you enjoy [the experience] more."" It's like a fan allowing themselves to get caught up in the competitiveness of a sporting event. ""When people watch a sporting event, and they're all rooting for the same team, they'll yell, cheer, hug each other,"" Harris said. ""That stuff enhances the enjoyment (of the experience)."" Even ""The Vow's"" stars, Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum, said they've had movie-induced sob sessions in the past. Tatum told the Los Angeles Times that ""Finding Neverland"" and animal movies, like ""War Horse,"" always seem to move him to tears while McAdams admitted to crying so loudly during ""The Way We Were,"" that she woke her sister up out of a sound sleep.","Based on a true story, ""The Vow"" opens in theaters on Friday .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Do you ever get the feeling you are being watched? Closed circuit cameras recording your movements, strange noises on the phone line, phone calls that suddenly stop, emails being monitored, and private computer files and Facebook being hacked into. Oh yes, secrecy is no secret in China. Privacy is anything but private. As human rights activists, artists, dissidents, lawyers and journalists can attest to, if the long arm of the Chinese state wants to get you, it can. But it isn't only the authorities that people in China need to fear -- they may want to be wary of each other. A neighbor, a boss, a former friend... anyone is a suspect, anyone can be a so-called ""cyber cannibal."" These online stalkers unite in a virtual manhunt or so-called ""Human Flesh Search"" to target perceived wrong-doers. They scour the web -- blogs, forums, anywhere personal information can be found -- peering into the deepest corners of someone's life, literally eating their privacy, revealing all secrets to exact their brand of punishment. One admitted cyber cannibal told CNN he was part of a group that outed a so-called cat killer, a woman who allegedly posted pictures of herself on the net, torturing the animals. Her case captured widespread media attention. ""This is the cat-abusing model. After being human flesh searched, she shunned media all together. She could no longer live a normal life...had to cut off from most social activities. She could no longer show up in public,"" he told us. Wang Jieyu can tell you all about the cyber cannibals' devastating reach. The Beijing television director has had his life turned inside out. His phone number, personal photos, where he works and even the identity of his parents and friends, are now public knowledge. He has been abused in the vilest language via email, he is harassed day and night with hateful phone calls. Now this once confident, sharply dressed, successful young man is reduced to hiding, wearing a mask in public for fear of being recognized. ""My life has really been messed up in the past month,"" he said. ""I received too many emails, they phone me at all hours, people abuse me... they use dirty words."" Opening his computer, he showed me page after page of abuse. Some of it is directed at his parents -- especially his mother who is targeted with crude sexual taunts. Wang says it all started when he crossed a famous Chinese pop star, Shang Wenjie. He says he made a light-hearted jibe about Shang ona popular microblog -- a Chinese version of Twitter. Within hours the singer's fans went into a frenzy. He doesn't accuse Shang of inciting the hatred, and her management has declined CNN's requests for comment. But Wang Jieyu's personal life has now gone viral. ""Every day, Shang's fans come and post nasty words from morning to night non-stop. My life and work was affected,"" he said. Film maker Wang Jing has made a documentary about the phenomenon. He called it the ""invisible killer,"" something he says taps into a deep-seated desire for vengeance, to get back at the world. ""I guess they are composed mainly of two kinds of people -- those who had tough luck with life themselves and thus hold grudges against others. They want to get even,"" he said. The Human Flesh Search engine falls through the legal cracks in China. It is not outlawed, yet Chinese courts have described it as a dangerous phenomenon that undermines privacy laws. Wang Jing says some are motivated by good, using it to uncover corruption and to highlight injustice. But he says too many others are out to destroy lives. ""It can easily go too far,"" he said. ""If anyone wants to ruin another person's reputation he can simply make up things and ask others to 'human flesh search' for him. I know another case in which a boy searched for his ex-girlfriend after breaking up. After knowing her whereabouts, he went to find her and then killed her."" When we go out with Wang Jieyu he dons his mask. This is how he lives now, afraid of being recognized and abused, still paying the price, he says, for crossing the pop star's fans. ""I'm afraid that Shang Wenjie's fans might attack. They've attacked me twice now so I'm scared. So I wear a mask to prevent them from recognizing me."" But on the web there is nowhere to hide from the prying eyes of china's cyber cannibals.","Chinese online stalkers are using ""Human Flesh Search"" to target perceived wrong-doers .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers combed through mangled wreckage early Sunday searching for survivors after two passenger trains collided in southern Poland, leaving at least 16 dead.

"(CNN) -- A day after the United States imposed stiff economic sanctions on Syria, a European Union body proposed an embargo Friday on Syrian crude oil. In Syria, meanwhile, despite the intensified world pressure for President Bashar al-Assad to halt the violence and step down, his security forces continued their tough offensive against protesters. At least 29 deaths were reported from a defiant outpouring of mass demonstrations Friday. The European Union's political security committee meeting in Brussels, Belgium, made the embargo proposal. ""We acted pretty quickly and have now got an oil embargo in the works,"" said Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. The proposal will be examined by a committee of experts and is expected to be adopted into law, Mann said. Technically, he said, it's not a done deal, but the fact that 27 countries are asking for this step indicates that it will be adopted. The committee, made up of foreign policy experts for the agency's 27 member states, also agreed to add 15 people and five companies to its sanctions list. Ashton said the designations will be ""finalized and published in the coming days."" Other proposals include stopping technical assistance to Syria from the European Investment Bank and imposing an asset freeze and travel ban on those benefiting from or supporting the regime's policies. Those will be examined early next week, Ashton said. ""The European Union continues to aim at putting an end to the brutal repression and assisting the Syrian people to achieve their legitimate aspirations,"" she said in a statement. Oil and gas make up about a quarter of Syria's economy, according to the International Monetary Fund. Much of Syria's oil sales go to European Union countries, analysts say. Unrest has engulfed Syria since mid-March as security forces wage a crackdown on peaceful protesters demanding political change. U.S. President Barack Obama, along with European leaders, called on Thursday for al-Assad to step down, a move that U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday was part of a ""steady ratcheting up of international pressure ... against what (al-Assad) is doing to his own people."" ""It's quite startling, it's horrible, and we're trying to use both diplomatic pressure and economic pressure to get them to stop doing it,"" Toner told CNN's Brooke Baldwin, referring to the use of force against protesters. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also condemned the use of force. ""We are urging that these are unarmed protesters, and there's been excessive force used against them, and this force must stop,"" she said Friday. Pillay spoke a day after a U.N. fact-finding mission announced that it has found Syria guilty of multiple human rights violations and indicated that it may be time for the International Criminal Court to become involved. ""President Assad has since announced that he has withdrawn the military, and we are monitoring this situation,"" Pillay said. Violence continued Friday despite al-Assad's claim of an end. Demonstrations against the government have occurred for months every Friday after Muslim prayers. One opposition activist group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, called the street presence on Friday ""one of the most important during the course of the protest movement"" across the country. ""For weeks, the security forces and the military, through their operations, have prevented mass demonstrations. However, in a remarkable step and due to increasing international support for the protest movement and the subsequent morale boost, many protesters have managed to overcome the security and military barriers and begin taking the steps necessary to de-legitimize the government,"" the group said. The Local Coordination Committees said 29 people were killed Friday when security forces fired on protesters in several locations. Many of the deaths occurred in the southern province of Daraa: eight in Ghabagheb, five in Herak, one in Inkhel and one in Nawa, said the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition activist group.Five deaths were reported in the western city of Homs, two in Harasta and Reheba, in the Damascus countryside, and one in Douma outside Damascus. Two children were among five people killed in the town of Ghabagheb by security forces, the observatory said. Troops wounded five demonstrators near the Omari mosque in Inkhel, in Daraa province, the observatory said. State TV said four security personnel were wounded in Inkhel when armed men opened fire and threw grenades at them from a house. Gunfire was used to disperse protesters in the Daraa province town of Tafas, the observatory said. An older man was hit by gunfire in the Daraa province city of Nawa when security forces were trying to disperse a demonstration. Demonstrators poured onto the streets of Homs and called for the toppling of the al-Assad regime. Gunfire was heard in several neighborhoods, the observatory said. Protesters also demonstrated in the capital, Damascus, it said. State TV said armed men opened fired on worshippers and peacekeeping forces and they were arrested. In the western city of Baniyas, protesters demonstrated despite a heavy security deployment, the observatory said. The observatory, which has contacts across the country, said pro-regime supporters attacked people leaving a mosque in the coastal city of Latakia, where a fierce government crackdown has taken place in recent days. Al-Ramel, an impoverished neighborhood with a Palestinian refugee camp, was one of the areas that bore the brunt of the government offensive in Latakia. An activist based outside Syria with a network in Latakia said security forces in al-Ramel and other areas targeted in the crackdown used loudspeakers to warn people under the age of 55 not to go to mosques. Others were to go to one mosque only. CNN is unable to independently confirm reports from Syria because the government has limited access to the country. Meanwhile, 6,000 of the 7,500 Palestinian refugees displaced by the violence in al-Ramel have been located. Many, particularly the children and women, ""are traumatized and in a poor condition"" and are afraid to return to their homes. a U.N. official said. ""They are in pretty bad shape. Pretty scary for young children to be rushed out of their homes in that situation,"" said Christopher Gunness, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. He said the agency has been assisting these people in Latakia, Homs, Yarmouk and Aleppo with cash grants for food, medicine and accommodations. The firing on the Palestinian camp was cited by Ashton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in their statements criticizing the al-Assad regime. ""Many people around the world were shocked by the images of unarmed refugees being shot at as they fled from their homes, amid the firing on their refugee camp,"" Gunness said. ""The good news is that our incredibly courageous local UNRWA staff have established a temporary office in Latakia, outside the refugee camp, with the cooperation of the Syrian authorities in both Latakia and Damascus.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Arizona's controversial new immigration law could harm local law enforcement efforts, a delegation of police chiefs from across the country told Attorney General Eric Holder in a closed-door meeting Wednesday. The officials, representing several major cities and a handful of Arizona communities, told Holder the requirement to check the immigration status of many individuals stopped by officers would divert police resources away from crime-fighting efforts and build mistrust between police and the Latino community. They warned that members of immigrant communities could become more reluctant to step forward and talk to police. ""In fact, the majority of us believe [the Arizona law] will actually cause crime to increase,"" said Chris Burbank, the police chief of Salt Lake City, Utah. A spokesman for Holder said after the meeting that the attorney general had heard the chiefs' message. ""The attorney general thought the police chiefs raised important concerns about the impact the Arizona law will have on the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe,"" spokesman Matthew Miller said. The chiefs told reporters that Holder gave them no indication of when -- or if -- the federal government would file a legal challenge to the law. Holder said ""there would be a decision coming soon on some of the federal issues associated with this,"" said John Harris, police chief for Sahuarita, Arizona. Harris, who heads the Arizona Police Chiefs Association, said law enforcement officials have consistently supported the use of more federal resources -- including National Guard troops -- to clamp down on illegal immigration. President Barack Obama plans to deploy up to 1,200 more National Guard troops to the U.S. border with Mexico, an administration official said Tuesday. In addition, the president will request $500 million to supplement current spending for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities, the official said. ""Any resources at this point are going to be useful,"" noted Tucson, Arizona, Police Chief Roberto Villasenor. ""But I don't want to just treat the symptoms of the problem."" Villasenor said the federal government must act to resolve the illegal immigration problem or face a ""patchwork quilt"" of state laws trying to deal with the issue. Arizona's law allows officers to check the residency status of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction -- if there is reasonable suspicion the person is an illegal resident. Critics -- including Holder -- have argued the law will promote racial profiling. Representatives of law enforcement groups supporting the law were not included in the delegation that met with Holder. Several Arizona sheriffs and other individual police officers have backed the measure as a necessary step in the face of what has been widely construed as a federal failure to protect the Mexican border. ""Arizona sheriffs are elected officials and that changes your perspective,"" noted Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. Ramsey, who opposes Arizona's law, said if the measure is upheld by the courts it would be enforced by law enforcement officials, despite any misgivings they might have. Ramsey and other chiefs said they understand the public's frustration and they recognize the popularity of Arizona's action in several state legislatures.","NEW: Aide says Holder thinks police chiefs raised important points about Arizona law .

"(CNN) -- Two male nurses face murder charges in Uruguay after reportedly admitting to killing at least 16 patients in two hospitals in the country's capital. One of the men has been charged with five aggravated homicides, while the other has been charged with 11 aggravated homicides, Judge Rolando Vomero said in an interview Sunday with CNN affiliate Teledoce, noting that the two men appeared to have acted independently of each other. Authorities are also charging a woman as being an accomplice in one of the killings, he said. According to the authorities, the two male nurses, ages 39 and 46, both said they killed the patients because they did not want to see them suffer. ""My client is fully conscious of his actions. He fully confessed in front of the judge (and) prosecutor, and his defense is that he did it out of mercy,"" said attorney Ines Massiotti. The nurses wanted to relieve patients' pain, attorney Santiago Clavijo said. ""It wasn't a vicious operation in the spirit of death,"" he told reporters. But apparently not all those killed were terminally ill. One patient had their discharge order signed one day before his death, said Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi. The killings took place at the hospitals of Maciel and La Espanola in Montevideo. One of the men worked in the neurosurgery department at La Espanola; the other worked in that same department, as well as in the cardiology ward at Maciel. The police had been investigating suspicious deaths of patients at the hospitals for weeks after a tip from a worker at Maciel. A recent death prompted the police to accelerate proceedings and provided them with enough evidence to make the arrests, Bonomi said. Authorities say they believe the nurses killed the patients either by administering a morphine overdose or by injecting air bubbles into their blood stream. The government has set up an office to provide support to the families of the victims, said Health Minister Jorge Venegas. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: The two male nurses wanted to relieve patients' pain, an attorney says .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has been named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year at a star-studded ceremony in London. The Serbian tennis star clinched three grand slam titles in 2011 and won an astonishing 41 games in a row during the season, tasting defeat only six times. He claimed the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open crowns and has started 2012 in equally impressive fashion, retaining his Melbourne title in an epic final against Rafael Nadal last month. Djokovic's victory saw him become only the fifth man in the Open Era to win three grand slam titles in a row, and convinced the 47 sportsmen and women that make up the Laureus World Sports Academy to hand him the prestigious gong. ""What stands out most for me is meeting all these legends of the sport, to exchange experiences and life stories,"" he told CNN World Sport's Pedro Pinto. ""It's an amazing experience I will never forget. Everybody is special and I respect them all for what they have done."" Djokovic said his sights were now set on matching Australian Rod Laver, who completed two calendar-year grand slams in his illustrious career. ""It's a hard task but it excites me, it gives me goose bumps,"" he said. ""I think that's the right way to embrace the challenge that is in front of you. ""Nowadays it's very physical, you have to be consistently successful in order to be one of the top tennis players but everything is possible in life.

"New York (CNN) -- Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys termed as ""courageous"" her decision not to present evidence to the grand jury that the original prosecutor, Norman Wolfinger, scheduled to convene on April 10. The Trayvon Martin family was also pleased that Corey would make the charging decision. But the question remains, will George Zimmerman be charged? Tuesday, in a bizarre development, George Zimmerman's attorneys, Hal Uhrig and Craig Sonner, during a news conference held in front of the Seminole County Courthouse, announced that they had withdrawn from his representation. They said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed Zimmerman's unusual behavior -- including phone calls to Fox News host Sean Hannity and the special prosecutor, Corey. The attorneys also said that they are concerned with Zimmerman's emotional and physical well-being and even suggested that he may be suffering from PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). In short, they said that their client had gone rogue. Clients fire attorneys every day, for no reason or any reason. And attorneys withdraw from cases around the country daily. But it is rarely done so publicly and with so much information divulged about the inner workings of the lawyer-client relationship. Rogue clients that are potential defendants spook prosecutors. It can be a nightmare to try to locate and arrest a fleeing defendant. Remember Joran Van Der Sloot. Not surprisingly, within hours of the now-infamous withdrawal, Corey issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours ""to release new information regarding the Trayvon Martin shooting death investigation."" Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor's hand. By all accounts though, Angela Corey is a seasoned career prosecutor who doesn't bend to public opinion or political pressure. During her 25 years as an assistant state attorney, Corey tried hundreds of cases, including more than 50 homicides. During her three-year-plus as state attorney of the 4th Judicial Circuit, Jacksonville's Duval County jail has seen an increase in the population, despite a drop in crime in the city. Some say this is a direct result of her aggressive prosecutorial bent. But her career hasn't been without controversy. Recently she came under intense fire for charging 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez as an adult in the killing of his 2-year-old brother, making Christian the youngest person in Florida ever to be charged as an adult. Corey, a devout Episcopalian, references her faith in discussing her cases, which some would say is a no-no for a prosecutor. In a written statement she provided in response to her detractors about the Fernandez case, Corey defended her decision to charge Fernandez as an adult by stating, ""We are blessed in the 4th Circuit to have a great working relationship with ... public defenders,"" and ""We asked for prayers for our two-year-old victim, David, and for Cristian Fernandez."" In discussing the investigation into the shooting death of Martin she said, ""What we are asking people to do is take a step back. Pray for Trayvon. Pray for his family. Listen to their words. I believe these are wonderful people who are asking for a peaceful approach to this case, while still demanding the answers they deserve. And I look forward to meeting with them to try to help them on this journey. Our victims always have a tough plight."" If she files charges against Zimmerman, it would be wise not to ""overcharge"" the case. Corey needs to be able to prove her case beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove manslaughter in Florida, Corey's team would have to prove that Zimmerman's acts caused Martin's death. Manslaughter would not be difficult to prove but for Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. Florida's law states that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force ... to prevent death or great bodily harm. So even if Zimmerman killed Martin, he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm. It seems the Sanford Police certainly believed Zimmerman's claims. But there is an exception. If Zimmerman was the initial aggressor, he cannot avail himself of the protection of the ""stand your ground"" law. Former Florida State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the co-sponsor of the law, told me by phone that the law doesn't apply to Zimmerman if he pursued Martin and was the initial aggressor. And he is right. Florida's statute makes it clear that the justification is not available to a person who initially provokes the use of force against himself, unless such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape. And that is what this case ultimately boils down to -- who started the fight. And the answer to that question is far from clear. Martin left the home of his father's fiancee on February 26 to buy skittles and an ice tea. He was unarmed. Zimmerman left his home to go to Target and was carrying a concealed weapon for which he had a permit. Martin was 17 years old, Zimmerman, 28. The police report describes Martin as 6 feet tall and 160 pounds and lists Zimmerman as 5-foot-9. Zimmerman sees Martin, deems him ""suspicious"" and calls the police. Zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following Martin. The dispatcher tells Zimmerman ""we don't need you to do that."" Martin notices Zimmerman is following him and tells his girlfriend, Dee Dee, with whom he is on the phone. She tells him to run, and he agrees to walk quickly. Zimmerman says that he returns to his parked SUV and is attacked suddenly by Martin. Dee Dee hears someone ask Martin why he is there. Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him. Dee Dee believes she hears Martin being tackled. Witnesses say they heard angry words, heard someone crying for help (many explain it sounded like the voice of a younger person) and then a single gunshot. The screams for help stop. Three witnesses saw Zimmerman straddling Martin in the grass. The incident happens 70 yards from the home Martin was walking to, not near Zimmerman's SUV. Martin is found dead, laying on his stomach. Zimmerman is bleeding from his nose and the back of his head and has stains on the back of his jacket. Zimmerman isn't tested for drug or alcohol consumption and is allowed to leave the police station with the clothes he was wearing that night. A tenet of our legal system is that when there is conflicting evidence, let a jury decide. I believe in our jury system. Let them decide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sunny Hostin.","Sunny Hostin: The state attorney has made it clear that she alone will decide on charges .

"(CNN) -- Jeremy Lin, who brought ""Linsanity"" into the lexicon when he came off the bench and led the New York Knicks to a string of wins, suffered a knee injury and will be out about six weeks, the team said Saturday. The injury could sideline the guard, 23, for the rest of the season. An MRI revealed a small chronic meniscus tear in Lin's left knee, the Knicks said on their Twitter page. The unlikely star of Taiwanese descent and Harvard degree quickly turned into a global brand, but the team has cooled off somewhat since he rose to prominence. Lin noticed the injury about a week ago, but he told reporters it had not gotten better by Saturday. ""I can't really do much, can't really cut or jump, so it's pretty clear I can't help the team unless I get it fixed right now,"" said Lin. Lin, who averaged 14.6 points and 6.1 assists per game, said he will undergo surgery early next week. Rehabilitation will take about six weeks, he said. Lin burst onto the basketball scene in early February when then-Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni called him off the bench as the Knicks struggled against the New Jersey Nets. Lin responded with 25 points, leading the Knicks to victory. A seven-game winning streak, including a victory over All-Star Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, followed, with Lin coming up with clutch plays to lead the way. ""The season has had a lot of downs and a lot of ups,"" Lin said Saturday. ""As a team we're doing OK and will be just fine.

"(CNN) -- The European Union is considering lifting some of its sanctions on Libya, a spokeswoman for the group of nations told CNN Wednesday, a day ahead of a top-level diplomatic summit on post-Gadhafi Libya. Sanctions will remain in place on Moammar Gadhafi and other individuals, the EU said, but restrictions on ports, oil and gas companies and financial institutions may be removed by the end of the week. And Italy and Spain announced Wednesday they were lifting blocks on Libyan assets frozen to put pressure on the Gadhafi regime. Italy is releasing 500 million euros ($720 million) ""to give further support to our Libyan friends,"" Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said. He also said the Italian embassy in Tripoli, Libya's capital, will reopen September 1, and that diplomats, administrative officials and experts will begin arriving soon. Frattini said he would propose the appointment of the new Italian ambassador to Libya at Thursday's council of ministers meeting. Spain is releasing 16 million euros ($23 million) and may unfreeze more, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced. And Germany recognized the rebel envoy to Berlin as Libya's official ambassdor, asking Gadhafi's representative to leave. Jamal El-Barag has until September 15 to leave, the German Foreign Office said after accrediting Aly Masednah El-Kothany as the new Libyan representative to the country. Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister David Cameron and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen are among those meeting in Paris Thursday to hammer out a way forward on Libya. Debates are set to include the freeing of Libyan assets and what a United Nations mission to Libya would entail, U.S. and Western diplomats said Wednesday. A timetable for elections is also on the agenda, they said. Sixty delegations are slated to attend the Friends of Libya conference, which aims to formally welcome the north African nation back into the international community after the toppling of Gadhafi by rebels with NATO support. The new authorities, the National Transition Council, would have to formally request U.N. assistance on matters such as election support and institution-building, and the Security Council would have to approve the mission. The diplomats will also discuss helping Libya restore basic services and get the oil industry running again. The EU sent an assistance team to Libya Monday as Tripoli faced food and water shortages.

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces unleashed a deadly push on a prominent university to clamp down Thursday on student dissent, the opposition said. Violence flared at Aleppo University, a sprawling institution in the country's largest city. It is one of several schools across the country where demonstrators have turned out in recent days to protest government policies. Seven people, including six students, were killed Thursday in the university city area, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. They were among a total of 32 Syrians killed nationwide by security forces, the LCC said. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said at least 28 people were wounded and about 200 students were arrested. Soldiers also fired at the hospital where the wounded were taken, leading to more casualties, said Mohammad Hareitan, 25, a student at the university. It was unclear how many more people were wounded in that attack. The campus website said the school will be closed until final exams start on May 13 ""due to the current situation."" The unrest came as the United Nations continued to try to impose a cease-fire in Syria and organize an observation force to monitor adherence by the regime and the opposition. Can U.N. monitors help forge peace in Syria? Amateur videos posted on the Internet show demonstrators and burned campus rooms at Aleppo University. Student demonstrators also turned out at Deir Ezzor University, the Daraa branch of Damascus University and other towns. Rafif Jouejati, LCC spokeswoman, said the ferment is a sign that the regime is turning its focus to campus dissenters. ""They have pretty well hammered farmers and villagers. They have targeted many of the professionals,"" she said of the regime. ""They are just shifting their attention."" Jouejati said students have been staging protests since the uprising began in March 2011 but now ""more and more university students are coming out as the barrier of fear is eliminated."" The regime, she said, typically has reacted to student demonstrators by surrounding the campus where they have been protesting, arresting a few students and beating them up, she said. Now, they are ""stepping up the brutality"" by firing tear gas and live ammunition, she said. At Aleppo, one person died after security tossed him from a window, Jouejati said. ""This has been building up,"" Jouejati said. ""For many of these students, it is impossible to be educated and know what's happening in your country and not stand up and speak."" She said the students taking part in the protests are from all fields of study. ""It's not just the literature people. It's the engineering folks. It's the law students. They are coming out and they are demanding freedom."" She said security forces were targeting anything that might be interpreted as dissent, such as students sitting silently on the ground. The phrase ""Stop the killing!"" assigns no blame, but it too has been targeted, she said. Outrage over the crackdown at Aleppo University emerged in Lebanon. The Syrian Revolution 2011 page on Facebook is reporting that students at the American University of Beirut were holding a demonstration in solidarity with the students in Syria. ""I stand with the students at the University of Aleppo and its martyrs,"" a protest flier said. CNN cannot independently verify reports of violence and deaths within Syria because the government has restricted access by most of the international media. The reported attacks come despite the presence of the U.N. observers, who have reported cases of cease-fire violations from the government and the opposition. The cease-fire went into effect April 12 and is part of a six-point peace plan negotiated by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan. Annan's plan includes allowing humanitarian groups access to the population, releasing detainees, starting a political dialogue and withdrawing troops from city centers -- a mandate the government has not met, according to the United Nations. The U.N. observer mission is tasked to monitor the cease-fire and the peace plan. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the mission, said 50 observers were in the country, ""deployed in the provinces of Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, Hama, Idleb and Daraa,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said. A U.N. peacekeeping official in New York said that as of noon ET Thursday, 33 military observers and 27 international civilian staff were in Syria. A total of 300 are expected to be in the country by the end of the month. A U.N. official said this week said both sides have violated the cease-fire. Though the United States seeks an end to all violence, most of the attacks have been by the government forces, said Mark Toner, the U.S. State Department spokesman. ""So far, the Syrian regime has taken, really, almost no steps toward fulfilling the core commitments of the Annan proposal,"" he said. Syria's protests started peacefully in March last year, but a government crackdown spawned violence that has left thousands dead and prompted some military defectors to take up arms against the regime forces. The government has consistently blamed the violence on ""armed terrorists."" The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the conflict while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. President Bashar al-Assad's family has ruled Syria for 42 years. CNN's Richard Roth, Amir Ahmed and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 32 killed Thursday, opposition says .

Families traveling with under-12s --- including babes-in-arms -- will be automatically allocated seats in the main all-economy lower deck, says a Malaysia Airlines spokesperson. But before we all jump to brand the decision makers at the flag carrier as a bunch of child-hating monsters, the airline is quick to point out that the 350 economy seats on the main deck of its new A380s will be enhanced and designated as a family and child-friendly inflight zone. And if there's overwhelming demand for seats in economy class from families with children and infants, resulting in full load in the main deck, ""we will still accommodate such demand in the 70-seat upper deck economy class zone of our A380."" CNNGo: Private jets a new status symbol in China . This isn't the first time Malaysia Airlines has instituted a controversial policy relating to kids in the sky. Last year, the airline decided to ban infants from first class on its 747-400 routes. The decision won cheers from some -- and words you'd never say in front of your kids from others. Given their penchant for boldly going where no airline has dared before, here's hoping Malaysia Airlines' next move will be to designate a special zone for drunks and passengers who forgot to take a shower before their flight. CNNGo: Meet the world's luckiest traveler . Sky nannies and 'Kargo Kids' While Malaysia Airlines is the first to ban or segregate the little ones on flights, other airlines do recognize that traveling with young kids on long-haul flights isn't easy. Several airlines, such as Gulf Air and Emirates, offer passengers free in-flight nanny services that range from helping with meals to entertaining the kids while mom watches a movie. In the United States, a new website hooks up fliers with nannies looking to make a few extra bucks. Called Nanny in the Clouds, passengers can sign up for free and search for potential babysitters scheduled to take the same flight. CNNGo: Could budget airlines topple Asia's legacy carriers? Canadian low-cost airline WestJet, meanwhile, doesn't offer nanny services but it did attract a lot of attention earlier this month with a hilarious April Fool's Day joke. On April 1, the airline launched a video advertising a new service dubbed ""Kargo Kids"" in which parents check their kids in with their luggage. The parents enjoy the flight, the kids are sent down to their own special club in the cargo hold. Not a bad idea, really.

"London (CNN) -- The flare on a North Sea platform that has been leaking gas for nearly a week has extinguished itself, energy giant Total said Saturday. There had been fears the flare could ignite the escaping gas at the Elgin platform, about 150 miles (240 km) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen, potentially causing a huge explosion. Total said it had received the first indication that the flare might be out at lunchtime on Friday. This was subsequently confirmed by a second surveillance flight later that afternoon, the company said in a statement. ""Our sea vessels on location reported no further flare activity through the night,"" it added Saturday. Total said Friday that it was ready to push ahead with two operations intended to stop the leak, following five days during which the site had remained stable. ""The first is to pump heavy mud directly into the well and the second is to drill relief wells to intervene at the source of the gas flow,"" Total said. The firm is ""mobilizing all means to allow these options to be implemented,"" it said. Total has two drilling rigs in the area which will be used to drill the relief wells, it said. The company, which is still investigating the cause of the leak, estimates that 200,000 cubic meters of gas a day are escaping. ""The gas cloud is fairly small in size and prevailing winds are blowing it away from the platform and dispersing it,"" Total said. ""An exclusion zone around the platform has been set up by the UK authorities taking into account a wide safety margin."" Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said Friday he had stressed the need for ""absolute transparency"" from Total and the British government with regards to the situation. While the current environmental risk ""continues to be minimal,"" he said, the authorities will continue to be vigilant. Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday. Two nearby rigs were also partially evacuated by Shell. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","The flare on a North Sea platform that has been leaking gas has gone out, Total says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Cho Myung-chul remembers what it was like to vote in North Korea. ""They have a little piece of paper and a pencil right next to it. If you don't like the candidate you can pick up the pencil and cross the name off, but the person who picks up the pencil will die. There is always someone watching outside and of course there is only one candidate."" The idea of a free election seemed impossible to Cho Myung-chul before he defected. But he is now hoping to become the first North Korean in the South Korean parliament. South Koreans head to polls on Wednesday . He stands a fair chance of being elected, number four of 46 proportional representative candidates for the ruling Saenuri party. He asks CNN, ""Can you imagine the shock of all my former colleagues and school friends in North Korea if I get a place in the National Assembly?"" Cho was a professor in North Korea and was among the elite, meaning his life was far more bearable than others. He says that South Koreans don't really know how dire life can be for many in the North and how bad the human rights situation is. ""They understand in an abstract sense that something is not right, but they don't have actual knowledge of life there."" That is one reason he has entered politics, to help the conservative party form a better policy when dealing with Pyongyang. Cho describes the difficulties he found when first trying to assimilate into South Korean life. He found it very difficult to cope, saying, ""Living here I had to re-learn everything from the beginning. There was only one thing we had in common, the language and other than that, the gap was huge."" The Korean peninsula was split in 1953 when an armistice was signed after a bloody war. The two sides have never signed a peace agreement. South Korea has since grown to become Asia's fourth largest economy whereas North Korea struggles to feed its own people, asking the international community for food and monetary aid. Cho acknowledges many defectors find it hard to adapt and says the government has to do more to help. ""There are around 23,000 North Korean defectors here now. These people are the pioneers of unification, they have to be able to settle here and succeed. If you can't reunify with this small group of people, you have no chance with 23 million people in North Korea."" Cho will find out Wednesday if his parliamentary election bid is successful as South Koreans head to the polls.","Cho Myung-chul hopes to become first North Korean in South Korean parliament .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Just hours before the opening ceremony of his new Rock & Brews chain, Gene Simmons caused a minor stir on Twitter during a ""Fox and Friends"" interview in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, claiming that ""America is a business and should be run by a businessman."" Such a blatantly capitalist statement isn't surprising from Simmons -- as he told Rolling Stone minutes before he'd make his red carpet entrance with his family in tow, ""I'm not outspoken, I just say things that make people say, 'yeah, you're right.' I hate Nazis like you do and I hate bulls***."" In fact, the El Segundo branch of Rock & Brews felt as much like a subtly protracted dry run for a potential Simmons 2016 candidacy as it was a restaurant opening. In part of the introductory presentation, he exclaimed ""El Segundo may mean 'the second city' in Spanish, but today it's the first city!"" Admittedly, the restaurant's ambitions to connect with the city are very real if bluntly wielded -- earlier in the day, Rock & Brews had a luncheon to benefit the Wounded Warrior program, and during the presentation, two dismembered soldiers with Purple Hearts were presented with a $25,000 check. Prior to the presentation, Simmons led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance. ""If you know it, say it with me. If you don't, shame on you,"" he intoned as American flags waved on television monitors. In line with Rock & Brews' concurrent opening at the Delta Terminal in nearby LAX, it's essentially and proudly an up-the-middle sports bar with pictures of The Who on the walls; despite being a collaboration between a rock legend and a couple of big-shot entrepreneurs, it doesn't clash with the sleepy, suburban surroundings. As the introductory three-minute video came to a close, Bob Seger's ""Main Street"" played, a likely allusion to the fact that Rock & Brews is actually located on Main Street in downtown El Segundo. So what the hell are we doing in El Segundo anyway? Not surprisingly, he's got words for his doubters: ""They're unqualified to snicker or do much else. They've never done anything. What are their qualifications? What I'm doing here proves to every small town in America that they are every bit as cool as LA and New York. El Segundo, great place to live. Small town America is what it's all about and that's where KISS got big."" Let it be known that he did insist we try the food (""there's no other way to describe it except that it rocks"") and stressed the family-friendliness of Rock & Brews -- ""You wanna bring your dog, your kids? Great! They can have a root beer float and you can choose from 100 craft beers. The brews are local from El Segundo and Van Nuys. We create jobs. This is anti-cool. Cool can go f*** itself."" Simmons connected the populism of his restaurant with everything from disco's inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame (""What an insult to the memory of Little Richard and Chuck Berry to have disco artists who don't write their own songs and play their own instruments. It's a sham to have Grandmaster Flash and Disco Bob and MC Criminal in there"") to Kurt Cobain's suicide (""I say this respectfully to him -- 'f*** off'"") to, well, pretty much any music made after 1990 other than Katy Perry (""I love her voice"") and Madonna (""a true rock star""). Rock & Brews itself resembles a less-tacky Hard Rock CafÃ©, and if we were to call the menu fare ""unpretentious,"" Simmons would likely be insulted that we used a four-syllable word. Though the 100 beers on tap appeared to be more of a draw than the food, servers milled about with soft pretzels, pizza, pulled pork, meatballs and fried calamari. Philosophically, this is food Simmons considers to be timeless the way ""jeans, your leather jacket, your T-shirt"" are. Rock & Brews boasts absolutely no pretense whatsoever that this is anything other than brand extension for Gene Simmons. Simmons doesn't fancy himself to be a restauranteur and certainly not a connoisseur. Rock & Brews is unabashedly American and run like a business by a businessman -- ""we'll have 50 in under 2 years and my goal is 500 is 5 years,"" Simmons said. ""Ask Starbucks -- if it's good, we'll have two or three on every corner. And my track record's pretty goddamn good."" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Given a cast of Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill, and the guiding hand of director and writer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""), perhaps there is no more appropriate title than simply ""Funny People."" Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow get together at the ""Funny People"" premiere in Hollywood. Which is saying something, since ""Funny People"" frequently treads into the darker realms of comedy. Sandler leads the cast as George Simmons, an A-list Hollywood comedian whose fame and fortune has brought him a beautiful mansion on the beach, lots of luck with the ladies and, as the audience soon discovers, a life of loneliness. Sandler is quick to point out that he and his character have little in common. ""I can't really say this guy is me; he's not living my life,"" says Sandler, who is married with two children. ""The movie star thing we have in common; we have a few mood swings in common. ... But the lifestyle and the attitude is not really me."" George's biggest problem isn't his desolation, however. He's been diagnosed with a leukemia-like terminal disease, prompting him to get back to his roots and do more stand-up comedy. Along the way, he hires struggling comedian Ira Wright, played by Rogen, to pen jokes for him and act as his personal assistant. Despite hurling an occasional insult at Ira, George learns to trust his new, eager-to-please sidekick. The feeling isn't always mutual. Ira is forced to adapt to his boss' constant mood swings, erratic behavior as he deals with the fear of dying and deep regret at losing Laura (Leslie Mann), the only woman he ever loved. However, Ira does earn a steady paycheck -- and gets a taste of show business. Rogen, who says he wouldn't be in comedy if he never saw Sandler's movies while he was growing up, says ""Funny People"" paints an accurate picture of the ups and downs of comedians who are just starting out. ""It's an incredibly realistic representation,"" Rogen says. ""Those scenes where you're backstage at the comedy club and you're all sitting around pitching jokes to each other. It's exactly like that."" Apatow, who performed stand-up comedy earlier in his career, says, ""It is an ode to stand-up. I've always been a crazy fan of stand-up comedians. Jonathan Winters ... Don Rickles, things like that."" Apatow, who knows he's taking a risk with ""Funny People's"" mix of light and darkness, made a wisecrack about his hopes for the film at the Los Angeles premiere. ""Well, I think there's 10 movies that are going to be up for best picture this year, and we definitely are shooting for No. 16,"" he says. The cast also took some risks, performing stand-up in front of live audiences for the film -- and, occasionally, watching their jokes fall flat. Hill says he had never done stand-up before and calls the experience ""terrifying."" ""It can be brutal out there,"" Rogen adds. Sandler, the most seasoned comedian by far, remembers his first days onstage and can relate. ""It's all about your last set,"" he recalls. ""If I did good Wednesday ... all day Thursday, I was in a good mood. ""Then Thursday night comes around and I go onstage and if I did bad, Friday was a miserable time for everyone.""","Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in Judd Apatow's ""Funny People""

"Malakal, South Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan forces have captured a disputed oil-rich area along the border with Sudan, escalating tensions between the two longtime rivals and threatening a return to war. Sudan claims the oil fields in the town of Heglig, which account for about half of the nation's oil production. A spokesman for South Sudan's military said Wednesday that his country's soldiers have been defending the territory from attacks by Sudanese forces for the past two days. South Sudan's military now occupies oil fields and other areas of Heglig, according to Philip Aguer, the spokesman. ""That is South Sudan,"" he said. ""Khartoum has refused to demarcate the border. We know where the border is."" Sudan also claims ownership of Heglig and lodged complaints with the United Nations Security Council and the African Union on Wednesday, urging them to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. Sudan's parliament approved ""general mobilization"" of the country's resources to support the military. It also voted to withdraw from negotiations with South Sudan that have been ongoing since the South declared independence last July. Aguer called the parliamentary decisions ""a public relations exercise"" and accused Sudan of carrying out attacks even during the peace talks. ""There was no negotiation as far as I am concerned,"" he said. ""The SPLA (South Sudan military) at the border were being bombed even when the politicians were talking."" Sudan has repeatedly bombed southern territory since independence, including the November attack of a refugee camp in the neighboring nation's Unity state. South Sudan fought a two-decade civil war against the government in Khartoum, which led to secession. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. The two countries have been locked in negotiations about how much the landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north. In late July, South Sudan halted oil production after accusing Sudan of ""stealing"" $815 million worth of its crude. Sudan said it confiscated the oil to make up for unpaid fees. The African Union-led negotiations also cover other outstanding issues since secession, including the status of citizens of both countries who find themselves living on either side of the world's newest international border. The fate of the Abyei region and other disputed border areas are also a point of contention. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was scheduled to travel to the southern capital of Juba earlier this month to meet with his counterpart Salva Kiir. The presidents were to sign agreements on citizenship and border demarcation, but Khartoum canceled the trip after fighting broke out along the border. South Sudan's sovereignty officially broke Africa's largest nation into two, the result of a referendum last year overwhelmingly approved by voters. The referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war pitting a government dominated by Arab Muslims in the north against black Christians and animists in the south. The war killed about 2 million people.","The oil-rich border area remains disputed between Sudan and South Sudan .

"Always last to be picked for the team? Couldn't catch a ball if your life depended on it? Got coordination skills that make you a laughing stock? Afghans playing Bukashi in Kabul . Maybe you've been picking the wrong sports: tennis, soccer, football and baseball don't suit everyone's talents. If you suspect you may be sporty but haven't found your niche, you should consider some lesser known competitions. Rock, paper, scissors . It's the sport anyone with hands can play: no particular level of fitness or years of training required. Rock, paper, scissors is a game most kids played in the school yard -- and it now has its own league. In 2007, the Bud Light USA Rock Paper Scissors League National Championship was broadcast on television, with a top prize of $50,000. The main skill is mental, say players, comparing it to poker where the ability to ""read"" your opponent and anticipate his next move is highly prized. But Matti Leshem, co-commissioner of the USA Rock Paper Scissors League, has said it's also important to be fit: ""There are different styles of play. It gets quite energetic. A lot of power goes into it. The mental drain of it has a toll on the body."" There are also injuries: ""People dislocate shoulders or sprain wrists."" Extreme ironing . Web site extremeironing.com calls it ""the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well pressed shirt."" Extreme Ironing takes the loathsome domestic task of ironing into ""extreme"" locations: cliff tops, rock faces, up trees, in crowed public places and underwater. Ironing boards, irons and creased clothes are the only equipment you'll need. Arm pads to prevent iron burns are optional. Organizers of a 2002 Extreme Ironing championship in Munich described it as ""a sport which combines the danger and the spirit of an extreme sport with boring housework you have to do. By Extreme Ironing the sportsman gets a great fitness and he is always looking smart."" Ironing greats need to not only master the tough environments but also show creativity and flair in their ironing skills, get all the creases out and do it in record time. Extreme Ironing has been a surprise hit on YouTube where competitors show off their skills on the beach, up trees and up a mountain. Go on -- experiment with Extreme Ironing and make Mom proud. Musical Whistling . This is a sport that requires a special sort of dexterity: your lips and breath. Sorting out the champions from the amateurs, the International Whistlers Convention held in North Carolina has categories in classical and popular tune whistling, either accompanied or solo. But there are strict rules: ""Medleys combining more than one song will not be allowed. Time should be as brief as possible and not longer than six minutes for classical selections, or four minutes for popular selections, or five minutes for hand whistling,"" state the guidelines. Winners are judged on performance, originality, ""embellishments"" and the quality of whistling. The good thing about this sport is that you can practices whilst doing other tasks: whistle while you walk, while you work, while you Extreme Iron ... Buzkashi . Oh golly -- this is one weird sport we won't be trying. Buzkashi is a Central Asian sport involving horses, animal carcasses and whips. Buzkashi has been likened to polo, but instead of a ball, the headless carcass of an animal -- usually a headless goat or calf -- is used. The aim is to grab it off the ground while riding and then get it clear of the other players and pitch it across a goal line or into a vat. Play can last for several days. It's important during the game that the carcass doesn't disintegrate, so the calf is normally beheaded, disemboweled, has its limbs cut off at the knees and is soaked in cold water for 24 hours before play to toughen it. Occasionally, sand is packed into the carcass to give it extra weight. Special horses are trained for the event so they don't trample the riders, should they be thrown, and gallop at speed towards the goal line when the rider collects the carcass.

"(CNN) -- A Washington state man wanted in the killings of his wife and daughter was believed to be holed up Friday evening in a fortified bunker about 25 miles east of Seattle, authorities said. SWAT and other teams deployed tear gas into the hillside structure in an effort to smoke out suspect Peter Keller, said Sgt. Cindi West of the King County Sheriff's Office. ""We do believe somebody is in there. We heard something going on, but nothing lately,"" West said. ""We can't send people in there because of safety."" The homemade bunker is outside North Bend near Rattlesnake Ridge Trail, according to the King County Sheriff's Office. Keller, 41, is not believed to have a previous criminal record. Investigators do not have a clear motive for the slayings, according to West. ""We gathered he had a doomsday attitude ... family and friends have indicated he thought the world was going to end at some point,"" West said. Some relatives have termed Keller a survivalist, she added. Keller was believed to be well armed. ""We know he in the past has had a number of rifles, scopes and handguns. He purchased some kind of bulletproof vest,"" West said. Clues to Keller's whereabouts came during the processing of the crime scene at his house, authorities said. Citizens also reported seeing Keller's pickup truck near the trailhead. ""This isn't a hole in the ground. This is a large built-up structure,"" Sheriff Steven D. Strachan said of the bunker. ""But hidden. It took some time to find it. In fact our tactical team smelled the wood smoke coming before they actually saw it."" Strachan said Keller's house nearby was set afire Sunday after the slayings, but it failed to spread beyond the kitchen. Authorities found a hard drive with photos, he told CNN Seattle affiliate KING. One photo was enhanced and it aided in the search for Keller, who authorities said had been building the bunker for at least eight years. ""We believe he has taken pictures from 2004 to the present day,"" said West. She said she did not know the precise size of the bunker, made partially of earth and logs. ""We believe it is very large,"" the spokeswoman said. ""He has had plenty of time to work on it."" The sheriff's office earlier this week obtained an arrest warrant for Keller, stipulating two counts of first-degree murder and first-degree arson. The bunker was found early Friday about 800 yards off the trail. It's possible the bunker has an escape hatch or door, officials said. The slaying victims were identified as Keller's wife, Lynnettee, and daughter, Kaylene, believed to be either 18 or 19. According to West, Keller works with a company that refurbishes and sells computers. SWAT and other teams weren't forcing the situation because of the possible danger involved of rushing inside. And Keller is likely to be well-supplied, officials said. ""There is no urgency. We have him contained,"" West said.","Suspect believed to have no previous criminal record .

"(CNN) -- The winners of the 2012 Webby Awards were announced on Tuesday, . Established in 1996, the Webby Awards are arguably the Internet's best-known honors. After starting small, the Webbys now hand out more than 100 awards each year. Many of each year's honorees tend to be celebrities, big companies or well-known online entities. Among this year's big winners are Pinterest (best social media app), photo-sharing app Instagram (breakout of the year), and the comedian Louis C.K., honored by the Webbys for creating ""a new precedent for distribution"" by releasing his comedy special through his own website. A raft of advertising and corporate website awards have also been added over the years. But the Internet being the Internet, there will always be lesser-known, innovative and downright quirky winners as well. Here's a look at five Webby Award winners we think are worth a closer look. Draw A Stickman (Best Use of Animation or Motion Graphics) Are you frustrated that your masterpieces on ""Draw Something"" can't come to life? Or maybe you're just nostalgic for ""Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings,"" the '70s animated feature in which the things Simon draws come true? Worry no more. ""Draw a Stickman"" is here to help. Available both as a website and a mobile app, the premise is simple. Draw a stick figure, or a more fleshed-out character if you have the drawing chops. Then click ""play"" on one of two episodes currently available and watch your drawing get animated through an adventure that will require you to help him, or her, along by drawing new items such as a key needed to unlock a box. When you're done, you can share the results via social media, browse a gallery of other users' drawings or even buy a T-shirt with your drawing on it. Counterspill (Activism website) Winner of judges' and People's Choice Webbys, Counterspill is a nonprofit site devoted to reporting information about natural disasters involving oil, coal and other energy companies. The site's scope is impressive. Not only does it track such recent events as the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant, but it also documents historical events dating all the way back to the 1940s. The site unabashedly has a political slant. It aims to counteract what it calls spin by energy companies and governments in the wake of disasters. (The companies and government agencies involved in disasters are deemed ""culprits."") Among the site's partners is Chris Paine, director of the acclaimed documentaries ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" and ""Revenge of the Electric Car."" Clouds 365 Project (Personal Blog) For artist Kelly DeLay, it started in 2009 as a personal challenge: Shoot a still image or video of clouds for 365 consecutive days as a way to ensure he did something creative every day. ""I wanted this practice of observation to be tied into the fabric of my life -- the habit of looking up and noticing the patterns and beauty of the clouds that envelop us every single day,"" he wrote. Three years and more than 1,000 images later, he's still going. His site has become not just a beautiful gallery (it's astounding how each day's formation looks different from the last) but a reminder to us all to tap into the creative spirit when we can. The Human Body (Mobile apps, Education & Reference) Whether you're a medical student or just a curious amateur anatomist, this iPad-only app gives as detailed a look at the inner workings of our bodies as you can imagine on a mobile device. It features over 270 high-resolution images that let users zoom in and out as well as a ""3D rotatable human body with selectable layers."" If that's not interactive enough, it also promises ""functions you can feel"" -- letting you grab your iPad to feel lungs breathe, a heart beat and even the movement of nerve impulses. The Creators Project (Music) Vice, in a partnership with Intel, launched The Creators Project as a way to support artists in music, visual arts, dance and other disciplines who use technology as part of their work. Now entering its third year, The Creators Project publishes a daily blog and hosts an online community of millions who come to either take part or see the art that's created through the project. It sponsors a content-creation studio and has partnered with public events like the Coachella music festival to highlight the work of its artists. Artists can apply to be part of the studio, or any user can nominate an artist they think is deserving.","The 2012 Webby Awards winners were announced Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- One million people registered for Apple's music-centric social network in the first 48 hours it became available in September. But some evidence indicates that Ping may be having trouble keeping their attention. However, a collaboration between Twitter and Apple could open a backdoor to a part of the corporate workforce that has been locked out of Ping during the crucial daytime hours. With Ping -- the social service that lives within Apple's iTunes program -- users can now post links to songs and albums to their Twitter accounts. When you find such a message in the Twitter.com stream, you can click the tweet to see a box showing details about that song from iTunes, along with a button for listening to a short snippet of the track. Twitter announced the changes on Thursday. The Ping features -- available to users in the 23 countries where the iTunes Store sells music -- is an extension of Twitter's site overhaul last month that added a similar preview function for photos and video, a Twitter spokeswoman said. A stroll around dozens of profiles in iTunes just after the announcement reveals a less-than-vibrant place. Many Ping pages had little recent activity, aside from profile notes about new music purchases, which can be set to post automatically. The initial surge in bands creating accounts and maintaining active profiles has slowed, reports say. (Apple declined to comment for this story.) In order to use Ping, you must first create an iTunes account, which requires a credit card. Apple says it has some 150 million credit cards on file, but that requirement still creates an obstacle for children who don't have credit cards of their own. Kids, aged 13 to 17, made up Facebook's fastest-growing demographic this summer, according to data from Inside Facebook, which tracks activity on the social network.

The program doesn't typically come packaged with corporate-issued machines. Companies frequently block workers from installing applications without prior approval.

"(CNN) -- It seemed a promising development, a team of investigators tearing up a basement in hopes of answering a three-decade-old question: What happened to Etan Patz? It was a tantalizing lead offering hope that investigators would solve the mystery -- at last -- of what happened to the 6-year-old boy who disappeared on his way to the school bus stop 33 years ago. There have been a series of such leads over the years in the case, which changed the nation's attitudes toward children's safety and helped launch the missing children's movement. First there was the drifter living in a drainage tunnel with pictures of boys who looked eerily similar to Etan. A rash of false leads that took investigators as far afield as Israel chasing look-alikes. Then, most recently, a cadaver dog picking up the scent of human remains in a basement near Etan's home. Each time, the result has been the same: sometimes a few answers, often more questions, and rarely anything resembling the full truth for Etan's parents, Stan and Julie Patz. The family has endured years of crank calls and far-fetched theories on the home telephone number they never changed in hope Etan might some day try to call. ""They exacted the biggest emotional cost, riding Stan and Julie on a steep vertical incline up the tracks, to plunge straight back down to hell every time,"" journalist Lisa Cohen writes in her definitive account of the case, ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive."" Such dramatic ups and downs have long been part-and-parcel of the investigation into Etan's disappearance. In the days and weeks after he went missing in May, 1979, police, the family and neighborhood volunteers worked tirelessly tracking down leads, according to Cohen. In the two weeks following Etan's disappearance, police put in more than 4,000 hours on the case, interviewing some 500 people, Cohen writes in her book. Police cruisers swarmed the neighborhood as volunteers plastered the area with 10,000 posters, according to Cohen's account. Then came the first letdown. The police officers who'd camped in the Patz home, answering phones and dispatching detectives to follow up on possible leads, packed up and left, the emergency phase of the response over. In their place, they left a legal pad next to the phone and instructions to log each call. What had been a stream of calls slowed to a trickle, but kept coming, with their stories of boys matching Etan's description seen in places near and far. None panned out. Three years later, in 1982, the roller-coaster would start its climb again with reports that a man, Juan Antonio Ramos, had swiped a boy's book bag and tried to lure him and another boy into the drainage tunnel where he was living. Police found photos of young boys among the man's possessions, and took them to Etan's parents to see if their son was one of them. ""Almost three years into their ordeal, the half-formed scab covering their private life and private pain was being picked off yet again to ooze fresh blood,"" Cohen wrote in her book. ""They greeted the news with the now familiar mix of trepidation tinged with the faint hope, one that could never be discounted, that new exposure could yield new information."" The case didn't pan out, at least initially, and Ramos vanished. Interest moved on to other reports, Cohen wrote in her book: A photo in Israel, another in Massachusetts. A cab driver who said he picked up the boy the morning of his disappearance. Like the other leads, nothing came of them. In 1988, the cycle began turning again. Investigators turned their attention back to Ramos after locating him in a Pennsylvania prison -- where he was serving time on a molestation conviction. They brought Ramos back to New York for questioning, and got a bombshell, Cohen writes. Ramos acknowledged picking up a boy he believed was Etan and bringing him back to his apartment for sex, according to Cohen. But he said the boy declined his advances, so he took him to the subway and waved goodbye. Three years later, in 1991, after helping secure another conviction against Ramos, federal authorities visited the Patz family again. They were there to deliver the news the family had long dreaded -- that investigators believed their son was dead and they believed Ramos was responsible, Cohen writes. ""The words were not earth-shattering; they weren't saying anything that twelve years into the case both parents didn't already know,"" Cohen writes in her book. ""But now for the first time law enforcement was sitting across the table, telling them that the weight of evidence supported their worst fears."" At the same time, the federal authorities said they'd come to the end of their journey, saying only New York state prosecutors could take the case to court. They never have. There have been more milestones since that day in 1991. In the summer of 2000, New York investigators examined evidence from the basement of the apartment building where Ramos once lived. In 2001, Stan Patz had his son declared legally dead, and in 2004, a judge found Ramos liable for Etan's death in a wrongful death civil lawsuit. But none of those milestones brought them closer to what the family has long said it wants, barring the return of their son: a criminal conviction. In 2010, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance reopened the investigation after his election, something he had promised to do during his campaign. The promise that authorities were closer to mounting a criminal case seemed alluringly close last week, when investigators flooded the neighborhood and began dismantling the basement where handyman Othniel Miller once had a workshop. Etan knew the man and had sometimes helped him with odd jobs before he disappeared, Cohen said in a Monday interview on CNN. Authorities had looked at the basement workshop years ago, but never tore up the place as they were doing last week, she noted. Investigators recently renewed their interest in Miller, 75, in part after interviewing him about his connection to the basement. During the interview, a source said he blurted out, ""What if the body was moved?"" About a month ago, a cadaver dog picked up the scent of human remains. Then investigators began to tear down drywall and cut through concrete in search of clues. ""It was a huge number of resources being thrown into this case,"" forensic scientist Lawrence Kobilinsky said Monday in an appearance on CNN. ""It shows you that this case is still alive in the minds, (of) not only the public, but certainly, of law enforcement."" Mike Huff, a retired police detective and cold-case investigator in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who now heads the International Association of Cold Case Investigators, said as he watched coverage of the case, the kinds of details that were emerging led him to believe investigators were confident they had finally come up with a solid line on hard physical evidence in the case. The big news came over the weekend, when it leaked out that investigators had recovered a chunk of concrete that appeared to be stained with blood. ""I thought, 'Man, this is going to be a slam dunk, they already know the answer to this story,'"" Huff said. Then, suddenly, once again, nothing. The blood wasn't blood, it turned out. No human remains had been found. Etan's family learned Sunday the search had come up empty. It's not clear where the investigation goes from here. Through his attorney and daughter, Miller has denied any role in Etan's disappearance. Cases as old as this one can be tough to crack, Huff said. ""The longer it gets away, the more you really have to have hopes and prayers for technology to come into it,"" he said. While investigators didn't get the answers they wanted -- again -- Huff says there's still some good to take out of the effort. ""It's a success that 33 years later, somebody is still looking at it,"" he said.","The 33-year-old Etan Patz case continues to stymie investigators .

"(CNN) -- In the glitz and glamor world of Formula One, image is everything. The leading teams such as Ferrari and McLaren have built formidable reputations off the back of on-track excellence. Another constructor with a similarly lofty reputation is Lotus, a team which has origins dating back to a car made by Briton Colin Chapman which first raced in 1948. Lotus went on to win six drivers' championships and seven constructors' titles before withdrawing from the elite division of motorsport in 1994 after entering administration. The opportunity to reintroduce such an historic name into F1 was one not be missed for a businessman looking to put a car on the track. And so it proved. Malaysian Tony Fernandes, the owner of Air Asia and English football team Queens Park Rangers, resurrected the name for the 2010 season with the CNN-sponsored Team Lotus. But the issue was complicated in 2011, when the Renault team announced a sponsorship deal which would see them renamed as Lotus. So how could a situation arise where two teams were competing under the same name? ""Last year we had the weird situation where two teams were calling themselves Lotus,"" associate editor of MotorSport magazine Ed Foster told CNN. ""Team Lotus had the naming rights to use the name 'Team Lotus'. And of course there was Lotus Renault which was the Renault team that was sponsored by Lotus the car company."" A lengthy legal battle ensued, the result of which saw Renault buy the Lotus name from Team Lotus who were subsequently rebranded as Caterham F1. But why did both constructors go to such extreme lengths to secure the Lotus name? ""It's a huge name in the history of the sport and they wanted to heighten their profile,"" explained Foster. ""If you've got a big name you'll attract the big sponsors. ""Even if Lotus wasn't at the front of the grid last year, they are still going to attract more sponsors than for example HRT. ""Nobody knows who HRT are outside of F1, however I can ask my mother and she knows who Lotus is and that's the big difference. They can attract the sponsors, they get the money in and from that they can build a stronger team."" Lotus have a rich history in F1, with a list of former drivers which includes British double world champion Jim Clark, Austrian 1970 title winner Jochen Rindt and legendary Brazilian racer Ayrton Senna. ""Certainly Lotus dominated F1 to such an extent in the 60s that it became recognised as the place to go to get a quick car,"" explained Chapman's son, Clive. ""My father had the reputation for designing fast cars."" Understandably, Renault, now Lotus, are delighted to have acquired their illustrious name. The two men who will be behind the wheel for Lotus in 2012 are 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen and Frenchman Romain Grosjean. ""We found a great partnership with a brand like Lotus which has a huge history in Formula 1,"" Lotus chairman Gerard Lopez said. ""It made a lot of sense for us to take advantage of that.""","Two Formula One teams have fought over the Lotus name in recent years .

"(CNN) -- The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up a NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky. Hours earlier, the Wildcats defeated Louisville in its own semifinal. They and the Jayhawks will play Monday night for the title at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. Under coach John Calipari, Kentucky posted a 32-2 record over the course of this season -- with its only losses coming at the hands of Indiana and Vanderbilt, the latter coming in the Southeastern Conference tourney. It entered the 68-team NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South bracket, and the favorite to win it all in the eyes of many pundits. The team was led by Anthony Davis, a freshman who was recently named the Associated Press's college basketball player of the year. But a win in Saturday's contest against Kentucky's in-state rival, Louisville, was hardly a given. The Cardinals, for one, had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino, who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky. Louisville entered the NCAAs with momentum after winning the Big East post-season tournament. The Cardinals battled Kentucky tight throughout Saturday's game, tying the score, 49-49, at one point early in the second half. But the Wildcats eventually pulled away, winning by a 69-61 margin. Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No. 2 seeds, having both defeated the top seeds in their brackets -- Syracuse and North Carolina, respectively -- during the Elite 8. The Jayhawks were paced by forward Thomas Robinson, this season's lone unanimous AP All-American pick. On the other side of the court was the Buckeyes' Jared Sullinger, who himself earned first-team honors for the second straight year. On Saturday night, Ohio State jumped ahead early, carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half. But Kansas stormed back after the intermission, notching the game up at 38-38 with 14 minutes left in the game. The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes. Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on, thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call, for a 64-62 victory.","NEW: Kansas narrowly defeats Ohio State, 64-62, to advance to the NCAA finals .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class action lawsuit Wednesday against the city of New York and several members of the New York Police Department, including Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, challenging the department's ""Operation Clean Halls"" program, the NYCLU announced. ""Operation Clean Halls has placed hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, mostly black and Latino, under siege in their own homes,"" said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman in a press release Wednesday. ""This aggressive assault on people's constitutional rights must be stopped."" The city-sponsored program offers police patrols in residential buildings in an attempt to prevent the use and sale of drugs, according to the official New York City website. ""Landlords can request that the police conduct patrols in the hallways and stairwells of their building to remove nonresidents who are loitering,"" the site states. ""By challenging uninvited individuals, police are providing a level of safety to tenants that residents of doormen buildings take for granted,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said in a press release responding to the lawsuit. Critics dispute the role of the program. The program, which has existed since 1991, is part of a citywide police policy of ""suspicionless"" stops and arrests that disproportionally affect communities of color, according to the NYCLU. The lawsuit says the NYPD program violates the U.S. and New York State Constitutions, New York common law and the federal Fair Housing Act, according to the court complaint provided by the NYCLU. ""The NYPD uses Clean Halls as a license to stop anybody, at any time, on suspicion of trespassing,"" NYCLU Senior Staff Attorney Alexis Karteron, lead attorney on the case, said in the press release. ""As a result, people who live in Clean Halls buildings are under constant threat of being stopped, frisked, harassed and even arrested by police officers. This type of activity has no place in a free society, and we're confident the courts will put a stop to it."" ""There's a lot that we don't know about the program. It's really shrouded in secrecy and that's one of the problems about it,"" said Jen Carnig, NYCLU director of communications. Enrollment in Operation Clean Halls, is widespread, with almost all private apartments in some areas of the Bronx and nearly 4,000 private buildings in Manhattan enrolled, the court complaint states. ""Landlords invite the police in to at least stop and talk to people who are uninvited into the building,"" Kelly told CNN affiliate NY1 on Wednesday. ""This is the level of safety that people have who live in buildings with doormen. I would suspect that probably the attorneys involved in this case live in buildings with doormen."" ""I believe the NYPD has a role to play in our community. But right now, they don't make us feel safe,"" Jacqueline Yates, one of the suit's plaintiffs, told the NYCLU. ""We feel under attack in our homes."" The New York Civil Liberties Union is joined by the LatinoJustice PRLDEF and The Bronx Defenders in representing the lawsuit's 13 plaintiffs. The lawsuit seeks a declaration of unlawful practices and injunction against the defendants, and in addition to several changes in policy, it aims to award damages as compensation to the named plaintiffs.","NYCLU files lawsuit against NYC and NYPD officers over apartment patrol tactics .

"Cartagena, Colombia (CNN) -- Police dressed in black burst through a door, opening fire and rushing toward a man crouched in the corner. ""We are the National Police,"" one officer says. ""Stay calm."" The men in black are members of an elite anti-terrorism unit of Colombia's National Police. And the recent hostage rescue simulation -- which used live ammunition and high-tech weapons -- was part of more than a year of training to prepare for the Summit of the Americas, which will draw 33 heads of state and government from across the Western Hemisphere to Cartagena, Colombia, this weekend. More than 7,600 police officers and thousands more troops are set to be deployed in the walled colonial city as part of stepped up security for the summit, which started Monday with a youth conference.

"(CNN) -- Armed renegade soldiers walked through Mali's damaged presidential palace on Thursday, hours after the troops' leaders claimed to have ousted the West African nation's democratically elected leader. Shell casings, bullet-ridden cars and shattered windows were evident in video from outside the palace, as well as at least one burned-out room inside. And there was no sign of or indication of what happened to President Amadou Toumani Toure, with the military group's apparent leader Capt. Amadou Sanogo saying little about him beyond that he was ""safe."" Still, within much of Mali on Thursday night, the situation appeared to be relatively calm as most people appeared to have abided by coup leaders' call for a nighttime curfew. Amadou Konare, a spokesman for the troops behind the apparent coup, asked citizens to return to their jobs Friday, though he gave no timetable as to when Mali's borders would reopen. Earlier Thursday, Konare was among a group of soldiers wearing fatigues who said on television that they had suspended the constitution and dissolved public institutions because of the government's handling of an insurgency. ""Considering the incapacity of the regime in effectively fighting against terrorism and restoring dignity to the Malian people, using its constitutional rights, the armed forces of Mali, along with other security forces, have decided to take on their responsibilities to put an end to this incompetent regime of President Amadou Toumani Toure,"" said Konare. Surgeons told an aid worker -- who asked to remain anonymous -- that 29 people who had been injured as a result of the recent unrest were in Bamako's main hospital, while another nine were in a medical facility in Kati, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the northwest. The worker, who is based in the nation's capital, said he couldn't detail how or how seriously these people were injured. It is unknown if anyone has been killed. As a precaution in case there's more violence, the Red Cross is on call -- with one team set up ready to retrieve any wounded people and another positioned to help in Bamako's main hospital should there be a staff shortage or other need for extra help -- the aid worker said. The uncertainty surrounding Toure, Mali's president, further complicated predictions as to what might happen next. A 1991 military coup led by Toure had ended a dictatorship in the landlocked West African nation. Toure became president in 2002, was re-elected in 2007 and was scheduled to step down in April, when elections were set to pick his successor. Hours before the latest coup's leaders appeared on television, Toure posted a message on the official government Twitter feed that he was writing from the palace to prove that he was still in charge. ""Deserters and other military personnel who do not want to go to the front are mutinied,"" he said late Wednesday. Yet the next day, Lynn Pascoe, the United Nation's Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, stated that ""clearly a coup d'eta has been carried out"" -- a development that drew sharp criticism from other nations like the United States and France, Mali's former colonial ruler. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said in a statement from Paris that his country ""condemns in the strongest terms the violent overthrow of constitutional order. It calls for restoration of the constitution and institutions, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and especially the person of President Amadou Toumani Toure."" Juppe said France has suspended all cooperation with the Malian government, but will continue supplying food aid and counterterrorism assistance. Nearly 4,500 French citizens are registered with the embassy in Bamako, France's Foreign Minstry said. In a statement from Henry Bellingham, its minister for Africa, Britain also criticized ""any actions which undermine democratic rule and the Malian constitution."" This sentiment was echoed by Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union, and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, who called for a peaceful resolution. The United States, furthermore, called for ""the immediate restoration of constitutional rule in Mali, including full civilian authority over the armed forces and respect for the country's democratic institutions and traditions."" Previously, U.S. officials had described Mali as ""one of the strongest democracies on the continent."" ""Our focus and our hope and expectation is that this military action can be quickly reversed, and we can get back to the issue of democratic governance in Mali, which we can all support,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, adding there are discussions but no decisions yet on whether Washington will suspend any or all of the roughly $140 million in aid that it sends annually to Mali's government. A delegation from the Economic Community of West African States was caught up in the chaos in the capital Thursday. Its director said his attempts to talk to both sides had been unsuccessful. Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula said in a Facebook post that he'd been holed up inside a hotel in Mali's capital, where he had been attending a regional peace and security meeting. ""Situation worsening. Curfew imposed. Airport closed. Heavier gunfire can be heard repeatedly,"" he wrote Thursday. A later statement, from his nation's foreign ministry, said that Kenya's government was in ""direct communication"" with Wetangula and others and working with ""the United Nations and other friendly countries"" to get him and others out of Mali. Konare, the spokesman for the soldiers who claim they've taken control, said Mali security forces have formed the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDRE) to work as a transitional government. He accused the government of not providing soldiers with the means to battle local Tuareg nomads, who have long called for the creation of an independent state and have risen up against the Malian government a number of times since the 1960s. The indigenous tribe are spread across Mali, Libya, Algeria, Niger and Burkina Faso. The latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in January, when the rebels began attacking towns in northern Mali. And it's been further energized by an influx of fighters who had been fighting on behalf of former Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. Pascoe, from the United Nations, said the return of 1,500 to 2,000 fighters from Libya ""clearly added much firepower and drive"" to the insurgency. The growing Tuareg insurgency has raised concerns in Washington, which sees Mali as an important ally against al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the sub-Saharan offshoot of the terrorist group. The ongoing violence between these rebels and security forces has compelled tens of thousands of Malians to flee into neighboring countries and created turmoil in Toure's administration. Conflict in the region has forced the United Nations to appeal for $35.6 million to address the growing humanitarian crisis as throngs of Malians flee into neighboring countries. The U.N. spokesman predicted that the coup would only worsen the security situation in northern Mali, and further empower the rebels. ""This kind of action could pose great difficulties against the effort in the north and ... can further (the insurgents') actions and what they are trying to do,"" Pascoe said. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Brian Walker, Stephanie Halasz, Alden Mahler Levine, Faith Karimi, Alanne Orjoux, Lillian Leposo and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: Renegade soldiers walk through the presidential palace, after their leaders claim coup .

"(CNN) -- Kerry Morgan was just 3 years old when she participated in her first clinical trial for type 1 diabetes prevention. She didn't have the disease, but her 7-year old sister did and there was concern that she might develop it, too. During the trial she was given one shot of insulin a day in the hope that it would stave off the disease, but a year later, she was officially diagnosed. ""I remember a lot of things changed."" Morgan said. ""I went from having juice every day and M&Ms to not having sugar at all. I remember getting shots every day, finger pricks, my parents had to hold me down."" School, she says was difficult. ""You had to let teachers know what was going on. You had a special relationship with the nurse because she had to check your blood sugar every day before going to lunch."" At 14 she entered a second trial, this one at the University of Virginia, for a continuous glucose monitoring system called The Navigator. It was at UVA that she first learned about the artificial pancreas. A high school senior at 18 now, she has participated in four clinical trials and two have involved artificial pancreas systems. ""It was awesome. I've never done anything quite like it before. For the two days that I was on the artificial pancreas I experienced normalcy. I wasn't checking myself every five seconds and giving myself insulin because it was doing it for me."" In type 1 diabetics, the pancreas makes very little or no insulin, a hormone that controls glucose levels, or the amount of sugar in your blood. Patients must constantly check their levels throughout the day, determine how much insulin they need to lower their blood sugar and administer the proper amount using a pump or syringe. Drops or spikes in blood sugar can be extremely dangerous. If the level is too low -- a condition called hypoglycemia -- patients can experience shakiness, confusion, trouble speaking, seizures, even coma and death. A level that is too high -- hyperglycemia -- can cause excessive thirst, frequent urination and cardiac arrhythmia. Left untreated, hyperglycemia can lead to a number of serious complications including vision loss and nerve damage. An artificial pancreas mimics the glucose regulating function of a healthy pancreas. The automated device features a sensor that's placed under the skin that measures blood sugar. Information from this continuous glucose monitor is sent to a receiver and an insulin pump delivers insulin in controlled amounts. A glucose meter calibrates the sensor. Sophisticated software checks the blood sugar in the body and automatically provides the correct dose of insulin needed at the right time. ""When you have diabetes, every second you're thinking about your blood sugar,"" says Morgan. ""You're wondering if you're high, if you're low, if you're OK, if you're giving yourself enough insulin, if you're not giving yourself enough insulin. With the artificial pancreas it takes that worry away because it's doing it for you. It lets you know if something's wrong. That way you're not always worrying about your blood sugar."" The device has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In June the agency issued a draft guidance seeking input from the industry and researchers on an early version of the artificial pancreas, called the low glucose suspend system. It's a backup for diabetics experiencing hypoglycemia. Patients still have to monitor their levels and give themselves insulin if necessary, but the low glucose suspend system temporarily reduces or stops the insulin flow in the event of an episode. There are two types: A reactive low glucose suspend system that stops insulin infusion when a predetermined level has been reached, and a predictive low glucose suspend system that anticipates a hypoglycemic event based on the current blood sugar level and how fast those levels are falling. Dr. Charles Zimliki chairs the FDA's Artificial Pancreas Critical Path Initiative and he is a type 1 diabetic. Testifying before a Senate committee in June, he said the FDA is committed to seeing the device come to market but is proceeding with caution. ""While the potential benefits are enormous, an artificial pancreas system is considered a significant-risk device, meaning it presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient. If not properly designed, use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk, because the device controls the administration of insulin without the oversight of health care professionals."" The FDA is expected to release new guidance for future generations of the artificial pancreas systems on December 1. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has been working closely with the FDA on the artificial pancreas. It says low glucose suspend systems have been in use in more than 40 countries for the last 2Â½ years and the process in the United States is taking much too long. ""Here in the U.S. we're now almost three years behind and the first study to test these systems is just going to launch in the next month, which means it's going to be another year or so before patients even have access,"" said Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president of treatment therapies for the foundation. ""What JDRF is advocating for is to ensure that people here in the U.S. have access to these tools in a timely manner."" The FDA says other countries have different regulatory systems in place that do not require the same safety and effectiveness data for a product of this level of risk. Tom Brobson, a 51-year-old Christmas tree farmer and the national director for donor relations at JDRF was diagnosed eight years ago with type 1 diabetes. ""I think they're getting hung up on better when good enough can do the job. You can't get better until it's out there being used. We know that technology isn't perfect, but what we're talking about are significant improvements and enhancements over what we have today that can significantly reduce the daily burden of living with this disease, improve quality of lives and save lives."" Brobson has been participating in artificial pancreas clinical trials at UVA since 2007. ""It's been awesome, fantastic, frankly everything I could ever imagine it to be and then some,"" he says. ""The open question for me was could a computer system using off-the-shelf technologies do a better job of controlling my blood sugar than I was already doing for myself and the answer turned out to be overwhelmingly yes."" Without it, Brobson says he has to spend every minute managing his diabetes. ""I have to be my own pancreas 24 hours a day. Last thing at night, first thing in the morning and often in the middle of the night. When the artificial pancreas took over, that was a real power moment. It kept me perfect from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. When the artificial pancreas took over moment to moment when it was actively assisting me in the management of my disease, it was a life changing moment and it was life changing because I didn't have to think about my diabetes every moment of the day."" Dr. Michelle Magee is an endocrinologist and director of the MedStar Diabetes Institute at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. ""The data from other countries showed that the system could be used safely and effectively. It's been somewhat disappointing that it has taken so long to get approval here."" She says the long awaited system offers hope to patients.

"(CNN) -- An Indiana man allegedly blackmailed teenaged boys into being his camera ""slaves"" by threatening to post their videos on gay porn websites, a criminal complaint said. Richard Leon Finkbiner, 39, admitted during an interrogation to victimizing at least 100 people, mostly boys 14 to 16 years old, an FBI agent said in a sworn affidavit made public Monday. ""You want to play this game, or you want to be a gay porn star?"" Finkbiner allegedly told one victim when he demanded that he perform sex acts during a video Skype call, the federal complaint said. Finkbiner, arrested at his Brazil, Indiana, home last Friday, is charged with sexual exploitation of children involving two 14-year-old victims identified in Michigan and Maryland, court documents said. It could take months to identify many of the victims seen in thousands of video files found on Finkbiner's computer and other digital devices, said Timothy Horty, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis. ""These victims go into chat rooms, develop a relationship and conversation with someone,"" Horty said. Finkbiner would then capture uncoerced video of the boys, who probably did not know they were talking to a 39-year-old man, he said. Finkbiner would then e-mail them a link to their own video with the threat to publish it on gay porn sites if they did not agree to become his ""cam slave."" ""I'll add your name and email so if anyone googles u they will see ur video,"" Finkbiner allegedly wrote to a Michigan teen in February. That teen complied, but after a second instance he ""broke down"" from stress, FBI Special Agent Ryan Barrett said. The boy ""became emotional and hysterical, and disclosed to his brother what was happening,"" Barrett said. The brother told their parents, who then contacted the Oakland County, Michigan, Sheriff's Department, he said. An investigator tracked the e-mail address and Skype account to Finkbiner in Indiana, the agent said. An investigator in Prince George's County, Maryland, was also on Finkbiner's trail for a November exchange involving a 14-year-old boy, the complaint said. When shown a photo of the Maryland teen during an interrogation, Finkbiner could not recall the boy specifically because he had ""coerced the production of video and images of so many people engaged in sexually explicit conduct that he could not readily recognize every individual,"" the agent said. A search of his e-mail revealed instances in which one boy begged Finkbiner to leave him alone: ""I'm only a kid and this is against the law so please stop doing this I beg you,"" the boy wrote. ""I wont get caught im a hacker I covered my tracks,"" Finkbiner allegedly replied. If convicted on the initial charges, Finkbiner faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. He is scheduled to appear before a federal judge in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Wednesday. ""Our advice is never friend an individual that you don't know personally,"" Horty said. ""Parents have to know who their children are communicating with on the Internet.""","The suspect admitted to victimizing at least 100 people, mostly teens, FBI says .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN)  -- Flavio Canto spent most of his teenage years training in judo, in hopes he would achieve Olympic gold. But today, the Brazilian athlete considers his defeat at the 2000 Olympic trials one of his greatest victories. More than 1,000 students are enrolled in judo athlete Flavio Canto's Reaction Institute. The loss led Canto -- who later won bronze at the 2004 Olympic Games -- back to his native Rio de Janeiro. Since then, he has helped thousands of young people from the city's toughest shanty towns find hope in the midst of hardship. ""I've never seen any place as beautiful as Rio de Janeiro, but it does have its dark side,"" said Canto, 34. ""There is violence all over."" Millions of poor families populate Brazil's favelas, or shanty towns, and roughly 60 percent of the country's homicides happen there, according to Brazil's Institute of Applied Economic Research. The favelas' vulnerable youth face two constant challenges, Canto said: falling victim to the violence or choosing to become a young perpetrator of it. ""It's the kids who have it toughest,"" said Canto. ""They are told every day, 'You're not going to advance. If you are born in the favela, you're going to die in the favela.' And that's an idea that we try to break."" Through his Instituto Reação (Reaction Institute), Canto empowers youths by providing free judo training and education programs. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . ""We have a very strong pull to attract the kids. They come here thinking they're going to learn to fight,"" said Canto. Once in the program, instead of fighting in the streets, youths ""learn to fight the proper way -- only in the dojo [judo arena].""  Watch Canto and his students in action in the dojo » . Although Canto has spent most of his adulthood mentoring favela kids, he said he did not always know how to help. But while volunteering in a government-sponsored judo training project in 2000, Canto said he realized that sports were a powerful tool to change people's lives. The project lost its sponsorship soon after, and Canto was the only one to continue training the children. He sought help from friends and family to sustain a judo training program for the favela youths. After he collected $3,000 through monthly pledges, the Reaction Institute was born. Every youngster in the institute must participate in judo and educational classes Monday through Saturday, year-round. Canto said the institute teaches the values of discipline, humility, courage and determination through judo -- Japanese for ""gentle way"" -- and applies them to other activities. Since 2000, Canto's institute has grown to four locations throughout Rio. More than 1,000 students are enrolled in the program, but Canto hopes to continue expanding to meet an ongoing need; there are 500 children on the waiting list in Rio's largest favela, Rocinha, alone. Diego Cardoso dos Santos, 21, credits Canto and his judo training for earning him a scholarship to attend a private university and for helping his 11-year-old brother, Joao Victor, heal.  Watch how Canto's program helps Victor and other favela youths » . Victor witnessed his father's murder when he was 6 years old and joined the institute a short time after. Today, he has more confidence and pride. ""I am learning more and more and developing myself,"" Victor said. ""My friends think that one day we can be like Flavio. He was [about] 13, a little bit bigger than me when he won with the black belt. It is incredible!"" Canto said the inspiration goes both ways. While teaching his students to fight for their dreams, they inspired him to continue pursuing his. In 2004, he earned an Olympic bronze medal in Athens, Greece. But for Canto, the long-awaited achievement wasn't just a personal victory. ""We won an Olympic medal in Athens,"" Canto stressed. ""They were there with me. If they didn't exist, the medal wouldn't exist."" But seeing his students excel both in judo and academics is the best reward, said Canto. ""We now have college graduates and national champions. I have some kids who will be ready for the 2012 Olympics,"" he said. ""They don't need to just follow the destiny everyone told them they would have. They can change it. They're the true heroes.""

"(CNN) -- India's cricket tour of Pakistan, scheduled for January and February next year, has been called off -- the Indian government have confirmed. India's current Test series against England has been played against a backdrop of tight security. The announcement that India would not travel came from sports minister MS Gill in parliament as relations between the neighboring countries continues to deteriorate following the Mumbai terror attacks. Indian Cricket Board officer Ratnakar Shetty confirmed they had been notified about the government's decision although he did not rule out the matches going ahead at a neutral venue. ""No decision has been made on playing Pakistan at a neutral venue,"" Shetty said. ""We have not planned an alternative tour as yet."" India were due to play three Tests, five one-dayers and a Twenty20 international in a tour starting mid-January. The tour, already in doubt due to the security situation in Pakistan, was put in further jeopardy by the terrorist attacks in Mumbai last month. Before the incidents in Mumbai, the Indian Cricket Board -- as is normally the case -- sent a letter to the government seeking permission to travel to Pakistan for the tour. The Ministry of External Affairs had by then already refused permission for a junior hockey team to travel to Pakistan due to safety concerns. Last week, Gill said he was against the tour going ahead. Several other former India cricketers including ex-skippers Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar and Sourav Ganguly had said India should not tour given the current circumstances between the two nations. Cricket board vice-president Rajiv Shukla confirmed: ""Due to the current political scenario and atmosphere in the country, the government has instructed us to call off the tour. ""We have always made clear that we will follow the government's decision on the tour. Keeping the policy decision in mind, the tour stands cancelled."" Relations between the two countries have become strained following the Mumbai terror attacks last month which claimed the lives of over 160 people. The Indian government has put pressure on Islamabad to take action against Pakistan-based militant groups it says were behind the devastating three-day attacks. Earlier this month, Pakistan's prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistani security forces had rounded up a number of militant figures, including Zarar Shah, a top operational commander in the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) group. The United States has listed LeT as a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. It is the third major cricket tour to Pakistan this year to be called off on security grounds. In March, Australia pulled out of their scheduled visit, while the International Cricket Council (ICC) postponed the Champions Trophy one-day tournament in September. Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman, Asif Sohail, said that Pakistan were yet to receive official notification of cancellation of the tour, Britain's Guardian newspaper said. ""We can only react after we have been officially informed,"" Sohail said. ""We have not yet received any official communication from the BCCI."" Meanwhile, the BBC has reported that the PCB has invited Sri Lanka to tour in India's place.","Indian Sports minister MS Gill confirms India will not tour Pakistan in 2009 .

"Washington (CNN) -- An appeal over singer Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" and brief partial nudity on national television has reached the Supreme Court, the latest free speech episode over indecent, if fleeting, images and words on the public airwaves. The Obama administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether record government fines against CBS should be allowed to stand. A federal appeals court last November ruled for the network and its affiliates, saying the Federal Communications Commission's sanctions were improper. The agency had punished the network with a $550,000 fine after the pop singer's breast was briefly exposed during a live halftime show with fellow entertainer Justin Timberlake at the 2004 Super Bowl. The Supreme Court is currently deciding a separate but related issue over whether FCC enforcement policies violate the free speech rights of broadcasters airing profanity and sexual content, both in live and scripted form. The Justice Department in its appeal over the Janet Jackson incident told the high court there is no ""fleeting images exemption from indecency enforcement"" and that the singer's act was ""shocking and pandering,"" airing ""during a prime-time broadcast of a sporting event that was marketed as family entertainment and contained no warning that it would include nudity."" But CBS countered that the government in recent decades has applied inconsistent rules to indecent words and images, punishing some instances and ignoring others. The three-judge Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals agreed, finding for a second time the FCC had acted ""arbitrarily and capriciously,"" since the commission did not give the media companies proper prior warning about subsequent changes in its enforcement policies. ""The balance of the evidence weighs heavily against the FCC's contention that its restrained enforcement policy for fleeting material extended only to fleeting words and not to fleeting images,"" wrote Judge Marjorie Rendell for the 2-1 majority. She said the agency rules changed suddenly, a month after the Jackson incident in Houston. ""An agency may not apply a policy to penalize conduct that occurred before the policy was announced,"" said the judge. CBS now has a month to formally reply in writing to the high court, It is expected to urge the justices to stay out of the case. The high court would not decide whether to accept the appeal for review until June or perhaps later this fall. If placed on the docket, oral arguments and a ruling would not likely happen until sometime next year. After viewer complaints and national media attention, the FCC said the Jackson incident was obscene. In addition to CBS Inc., 20 of its affiliates also were fined. Congress quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold, up to $325,000 per violation per network. And it said each local affiliate that aired such incidents also could be punished by the same amount. The FCC claimed the network had ""alarm bells"" something might have been up, suggesting Jackson and Timberlake may have planned ripping off the woman's bustier, exposing her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second. Family advocacy groups had blasted the appeals court's 2011 opinion. ""Today's ruling reaches the level of judicial stupidity and is a sucker-punch to families everywhere. In rendering an opinion it wishes to foist on the nation, the Third Circuit has chosen to ignore the law, the facts, Supreme Court precedent, the intent of the Congress and the will of the American people,"" said Parents Television Council President Tim Winter. ""How can nudity and a striptease in front of 90 million unsuspecting TV viewers not qualify as indecency?"" There was no immediate reaction from the CBS or the other networks to the FCC's appeal to the high court. The administration's request comes as the high court is preparing a separate ruling in coming weeks on larger constitutional issues surrounding programming content. The justices in 2009 narrowly upheld the authority of the FCC to punish networks for airing profanity. But they refused to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. It ruled at the time only on the government's enforcement power. Then in January, the justices revisited the issue and have been working behind the scenes on one of the most closely watched petitions this term. The government clampdown on obscene images and words began in 2003. The changes became known as the Golden Globes Rule, as it stemmed from singer Bono's acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC, in which he uttered the phrase ""really, really, f---ing brilliant."" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired live on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment, said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple."" A separate complaint against ABC involved ""NYPD Blue,"" a scripted police drama, and a complaint against CBS involved ""The Early Show,"" a news and interview program. Enforcement of the law, as well as fines and sanctions for the incidents, has been put on hold while the cases are being argued. The television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted. They worry, however, about unplanned, often spontaneous indecent or profane incidents at live events, such as awards shows and sporting events. Company officials say such programs are often on a five-second delay, and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language. But some indecent words can slip through, they admit, and they want to be protected from heavy government fines. Critics call that laughable. Winter, in a CNN interview, noted that CBS edited the F-word into a recent episode of ""Big Brother,"" a taped reality show, which he said had to go through multiple reviews, by multiple people in the media organization. The ""wardrobe malfunction"" case is FCC v. CBS Corp. (11-1240).","The Obama administration wants the Supreme Court to rule on FCC fines .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal has crashed out of the ATP World Tour Finals after suffering his second group-stage defeat in London on Thursday. Needing to beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to go through to Saturday's semifinals as Group B runner-up behind Roger Federer, the Spaniard went down 7-6 (7-2) 4-6 in pulsating clash with the sixth-ranked Frenchman. Tsonga is next likely to face unbeaten Spaniard David Ferrer, who plays Tomas Berdych in his last Group A match on Friday. Ferrer has already qualified, and most permutations will see him go through as group winner no matter the result of that match. Berdych will qualify ahead of world No. 1 Novak Djokovic if he wins in straight sets. Federer: Strike talk is 'nonsense' Djokovic can still make it if he wins in two sets against fellow Serbian Janko Tipsarevic -- who is standing in for the injured Andy Murray -- and Berdych loses a set. Federer had already qualified as Group B winner before beating Mardy Fish 6-1 3-6 6-3 in Thursday's opening match, handing the eighth-ranked American a third successive defeat in his debut at the tournament. Tsonga tested Federer in the tournament's opening match on Sunday before losing in three sets to the defending champion, who is seeking to win a record sixth title. Rihanna to Rafa: Tennis gets popstar makeover . The 26-year-old brushed off Fish in straight sets on Tuesday before Federer thrashed Nadal 6-3 6-0 to leave second place up for grabs. Tsonga, making his first finals appearance in three years, had a 2-6 record against Nadal but took full advantage of the 10-time grand slam champion's apparent end-of-season fatigue as his aggressive approach paid dividends. The Spaniard looked like he might save the match as he bounced back with familiar fist-pumping power in the second set, but Tsonga's booming serve and acrobatic ability kept him out front in the decider. He promptly celebrated with his trademark victory dance, having improved on his 2008 debut in Shanghai when he lost twice but beat Djokovic. Earlier that year Tsonga defeated Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open, then lost to Djokovic in the title match. Nadal ended his 2011 season with a 67-15 record, winning one grand slam but losing his top ranking to Djokovic as the 24-year-old triumphed in the other three.","Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beats world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in decisive Group B clash .

"(CNN) -- I thought it was absolutely fantastic, the enthusiasm of the people, the logistics. I like it even more because there has been so much doom-saying and criticism in the run-up to these games. There must be a few very frustrated marathon runners who could have set a new world record in the terribly polluted air of Beijing but decided not to compete, not to mention so many journalists that wished the games to end up in a disaster. The people in the cities hosting Olympic events and BOCOG deserve praise. The IOC, in my opinion, deserves even more praise for choosing Beijing and sticking to its decision despite all the criticism. Go China! Go! Laurentius Metaal GM Projects Western Way For Industrial Development Co. Ltd. Of course the show was without equal, for which congratulations are well deserved. HOWEVER, the spending of $40 billion in the face of abject rural poverty, the clandestine treatment of local gymnasts' ages, the lip-synching+re-editing of the opening ceremony and the shipping-off of near-octogenarian women to labor camp after filing an unwanted eyesore of a protest ""application"" as only a FEW examples, show that while we can admire China's cosmetic ability to show itself off, we MUST be wary of the beast within. Thank you for the greatest Olympics ever, China! Now, can we see some freedom for your people and some more balanced economic development? John Jakarta, Indonesia . I think that the International Olympic Committee made a tragic mistake when they awarded the Olympic games to the Chinese. The Chinese have a ... track record of human rights violations that only increased before and during the Olympics. It was disappointing that many media outlets covered so little of the atrocities that the Chinese government committed against their people. I realize that they had a commitment to cover the games, but so much more could have been shown concerning the loss that occurred for the entertainment of others. Homes were seized and demolished so the venues could be built. Michele McCullough . I think it was perhaps the best Olympics ever. China did an outstanding job of preparing and producing a very successful two weeks of competition on a world-class level. I would hate to be London and have to try even matching the spectacle or the opening and closing shows. Because of people power, which they used brilliantly, I think no other country will ever hold a candle to those two events. Mostly, I am happy for China. I think the world will view it differently despite issues in which we differ greatly. I am hopeful that the afterglow of its success will spill over into many other areas and bring a better future to its people. Wallace Rhodes . I don't know why the medal tracker is not done on a weighted point-based system. For example a Gold = 5, Silver = 3, and a Bronze = 1. This would eliminate the debate and allow gold to be valued higher and all medals to count for something. Cheers, Mike K . I think the games were great, but why shouldn't they be? With a country whose government can control everything and spend what it wants, everything should have been perfect. In a country with the the number of people that China has there should be an amazing number of gold ... perhaps even more. Thing about the number of people in China vs Canada. Percentage-wise China should have won a lot more. I'm glad that the games went well, but I don't think anyone should be at all surprised. Few countries have the number of people, the freedom for government control and spending that China has. It would be interesting to know what China could have done / would have done without government control. Dan Ingram Toronto . Participant age controversies and government ideologies aside, this could well have been the greatest Olympics of the modern age. With less pomp and ceremony and more art and talent, the Chinese have brought together both its people, its money, and its true concern for artistic beauty, and displayed to the world what it is capable of being. Now, if it would let its people figure out how to develop and illustrate their Olympic talents without the force and pressure of the whole weight of government, we could surely have some wonderful Olympic Champions. Thank you, Joel Shattles Lawrenceville, Georgia, U.S. A spectacular Olympics to be sure (however not the greatest cover of events on local TV in Bermuda... Thank goodness for my satellite dish !!) Only real complaint was that the scoring for boxing was a travesty ... Please scrap that system !! Donald MacPherson Bermuda . Without a doubt, China put on the most spectacular show on earth! However, the issue of many of China's gymnastic team not meeting age-requirement standards is of concern. Mention of this issue has been reported by CNN, and since no further commentary has been announced, I presume the issue is still under investigation. Evidence that under-age gymnasts were knowingly being trained for China's Olympic gymnastic team is well documented in Discovery Channel's series - Discovery Atlas - China. In that documentary is the story of Jin Yang, a 12-year-old girl from Beijing. Her intensive training, along with her performance in China's qualifying Olympic trial competition, was filmed. In her own words, Jin stated, 'I dream of the 2008 Olympics.' Jin Jang qualified after the first round, but was eliminated after the second one. Clearly, this is irrefutable evidence that China's Olympic coaches, etc., were attempting to create the most talented Olympic competitors irrespective of meeting age-requirement standards set by Olympic committee regulations. This evidence needs to be presented not only to the world at large, but submitted to the Olympic investigating committee. Sincerely, Sandra St John Sao Paulo, Brazil . Olympic Games; vulgar and shameful display of unrestrained commercialism. Luis in Mexico . I think they were great.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- An autopsy to determine why Rodney King was found dead in his swimming pool began Monday morning, but it will be several weeks before the findings are made public, a San Bernadino County, California, coroner's spokeswoman said Monday. King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead at his Rialto, California, home early Sunday, authorities and his fiancee said. He was 47. Rialto police received a 911 call from King's fiancee, Cynthia Kelly, about 5:25 a.m., Capt. Randy De Anda said. Responding officers found King at the bottom of the pool, removed him and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital, police said. Rodney King looks back without anger . A preliminary autopsy report will not be released, coroner spokeswoman Jody Miller said. The coroner will wait until a full report, based on the toxicology exam findings, is available in six to eight weeks, Miller said. There were no preliminary signs of foul play and no obvious injuries on King's body, De Anda said. Police are conducting a drowning investigation, he said. Kelly, who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, told police that King was an ""avid swimmer"" but that she was not, De Anda said. She said the two had just had a conversation and she went inside, but came back out after hearing a splash and saw him at the bottom of the pool. De Anda said he did not see any drug paraphernalia ""or anything that would indicate that Mr. King was intoxicated"" at the scene. Nearly a year after the rioting in Los Angeles, the four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges. Two were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison, and two were acquitted. King also sued the city of Los Angeles and was awarded $3.8 million in damages.

Amazon.com customers in Alexandria, Virginia, bought the most books, magazines and newspapers in the past year, making it the most well-read city in America on a per capita basis, according to rankings from the popular e-commerce website. Two other Virginia cities were in the top 20: Arlington ranked seventh and Richmond 20th. Titles from the romance category were the most popular among Alexandrians, Amazon said in a statement announcing its second annual list of Most Well-Read Cities. The second most well-read city with more than 100,000 residents was Cambridge, Massachusetts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Amazon customers in the home of Harvard and MIT bought the most books in the business and investing category. The list is full of university cities, like Berkeley, California, which came in third, with purchases of travel books at the top of customers' lists. Other academic hubs that made the cut are Ann Arbor, Michigan (No. 4), Boulder, Colorado (No. 5), Gainesville, Florida (No. 8) and Columbia, South Carolina (No. 15). The rankings were determined by compiling the number of books, magazines and newspapers bought by Amazon customers in both print and Kindle format since June 1, 2011, and dividing that number by the city's population to determine the number of units sold on a per-capita basis, Amazon said. The formula explains why some of the nation's largest cities, like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, did not make the list, while cities that don't normally appear on top-20 lists did.

"Los Cabos, Mexico (CNN) -- President Barack Obama received praise Monday from Mexico's president for the decision last week to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants. After the two leaders met one-on-one before the start of the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, President Felipe Calderon thanked Obama for what he called an ""unprecedented"" move in halting the deportations. ""We believe this is very just,"" Calderon said, according to an interpreter, adding: ""Thank you for the valor and courage that you had in implementing this action. I'm sure many, many families in the United States thank you as well."" Obama made no new comment on the election-year policy change announced Friday that prompted immediate praise from Latino leaders who have criticized Congress and the White House for inaction on immigration reform. Republicans have reacted with outrage, saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzz word among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority. In announcing the change in the White House Rose Garden, Obama said it will make immigration policy ""more fair, more efficient and more just."" ""This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix,"" Obama said to take on conservative criticism of the step. ""This is a temporary stopgap measure."" Noting children of illegal immigrants ""study in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag,"" Obama said, ""it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans."" Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. It also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits, Napolitano said, adding that participants must be in the United States now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. The change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, Napolitano said, adding it was ""well within the framework of existing laws."" The move addresses a major concern of the Hispanic community and mimics some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that has failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval. Obama has been criticized by Hispanic-American leaders for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency's history. Friday's policy change is expected to potentially affect 800,000 people, an administration official told CNN on background. Others put the figure at potentially more than 1 million people. Hispanics make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election. Democrats, however, rejected Republican claims that the move was political. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, noted that Obama repeatedly called for Congress to pass immigration reform legislation, including the DREAM Act. The president acted only after it became clear no progress would come in this Congress, Durbin said. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Mexican President Calderon calls halting deportations of young illegal immigrants ""just""

"Washington (CNN) -- A man traveling with his 4-year-old son claims he didn't know that the three stuffed animals his little boy put on a conveyor belt at T. F. Green International Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, contained parts that could be assembled into a loaded handgun, the Transportation Security Administration says. ""It appears to be the result of a domestic dispute,"" said Rhode Island Airport Police Chief Leo Messier. An investigation by the airport police, state police and FBI determined there was no threat at any time to air safety, Messier said. A TSA officer watched as a carry-on bag containing a stuffed teddy bear, a bunny rabbit and a Mickey Mouse toy went through a checkpoint X-ray machine Monday. The officer spotted the disassembled firearm components and ammunition concealed inside each of the stuffed animals, the TSA said. Officers notified the Rhode Island Airport Police and conducted a search of the bag. Inside the toys, officials say, they found the mainframe of a .40-caliber firearm, a magazine with two .40-caliber rounds, a firing pin and a slide. The TSA says law enforcement officers interviewed the man, who stated he was unaware that there were gun parts inside the toys. The items were confiscated and the father and son were allowed to continue their flight to Detroit. Law enforcement agents continue to investigate the incident. ""This is just another example that threats can appear anywhere, and this is why TSA officers take a closer look at everything,"" the agency said in a news release. ""It's also an example that shows that even though TSA has modified the screening process for children 12 and under, the security process is still just as effective.""","Gun parts were inside a teddy bear, a rabbit and a Mickey Mouse toy, the TSA says .

"(CNN) -- In addition to a disastrous drought and political violence, Somalia is facing a potentially devastating health crisis. The World Health Organization's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean said that at one hospital alone, more than 6,000 cases of cholera and diarrhea have been reported since January of this year. Banadir Hospital in Mogadishu is one of Somalia's largest, but its website warns that it has been ""flooded"" with recent cases of acute watery diarrhea, or AWD, a condition associated with cholera and unclean drinking water leading to malnutrition and fatal dehydration. CNN video taken Thursday at a Banadir Hospital's pediatric diarrhea center shows heart-wrenching images of emaciated babies and their worried parents. Many of the infants were receiving fluids through intravenous drips. A flyer distributed by the center emphasizes the importance of hydration, and encourages mothers to breastfeed as much as possible. But even with intensive hydration and medical care, many will not survive. In just the past week, four children under the age of 5 have died at Banadir Hospital, health agencies say. More than 190 other children were hospitalized there in the same period, along with nearly 100 adults. But it is children who bear the brunt of this condition: This year, 45% of AWD-related deaths have been among children under 2 years old, according to World Health Organization statistics. The organization has been building up its supplies and working on preventive activities in reaction to the ongoing conflict near Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. Its most recent statement warns that ""the increased influx of internal displaced people and the precarious living conditions are high risk for outbreaks, and the number of AWD cases is expected to rise significantly between now and October.""","One Somalia hospital has treated more than 6,000 cases of cholera and diarrhea this year .

"(CNN) -- Inside the Gahaya Links workshop on the outskirts of Kigali, Rwanda's capital, a group of women sit side by side against a brightly-painted wall. Using natural fibers and grasses, they pool their weaving skills to create exquisite hand-made baskets, inspired by the eastern African country's art and tradition. Seeing these women talking, laughing and working together, it's hard to imagine that many of them were once enemies, belonging to warring tribes during the 1994 Rwanda genocide. ""[It's] really amazing to see how a small piece of work, how culture can restore values in people, how healing comes through a small basket,"" says Janet Nkubana, co-founder of Gahaya Links, the company that has made Rwanda's hand-woven baskets internationally famous. ""And then people open up, forgive one another and get back together. They say hello, they interact, they visit, they share what they used to share before,"" adds Nkubana, a master weaver herself. See also: 'African women need a hand-up not hand-out' Women in Rwanda have been handcrafting baskets for centuries, using them as containers to carry food and transport goods or as decorations during weddings and baby christenings. Today, Gahaya Links' baskets have been coined ""peace baskets,"" an embodiment of reconciliation and healing in a country torn by conflict. ""If you just meet someone on the streets and go - you don't really heal from what you went through,"" says one of the women at the workshop. ""But through this kind of association where we meet everyday, spending all day together, it makes you understand one another and forgive one another."" An estimated 800,000 Tutsis and politically-moderate Hutus were murdered in just 100 days during the Rwanda genocide nearly two decades ago. After the violence ended, many Rwandan women whose husbands, fathers and sons were killed found themselves thrust into the unfamiliar role of being sole breadwinners for their families. At the same time, Rwandans who had fled the genocide and earlier internal conflicts started returning in droves from neighboring countries. One of them was Nkubana -- decades ago, she had fled to Uganda where she grew up in a refugee camp. Upon her return to the country, Nkubana opened a hotel with her elder sister in Kigali. Many traumatized women and children would often come to the hotel to beg for food. See also: Why Ida Odinga is not your average politician's wife . ""One thing that struck me one day was [that] after you give somebody food, they would be scared to come back,"" remembers Nkubana. ""A lady walked in with a basket and said, 'can you take this basket and give me something to eat.'"" That prompted Nkubana to start encouraging the distressed women to bring their woven baskets to the hotel so they could sell them to the hotel guests. ""We started organizing women and we started trying to make the baskets so fine so that they suit in the market,"" says Nkubana. ""And in that sense, they restored their dignity."" Nkubana's efforts to empower the underprivileged women of Rwanda cultivated to the creation of Gahaya Links -- the company started operations in 2004 with only 27 women. Today, it has over 4,500 artisans in more than 40 cooperatives across the country. Through Gahaya Links, Nkubana has taken the traditional basket from Rwanda to the shelves of high-end U.S. stores. Under the ""Africa Growth and Opportunity Act,"" which allows Nkubana's products duty-free entrance into the U.S. market, Gahaya Links sells its handicrafts in American department stores such as Macy's, Kate Spade, Anthropologie and Same Sky. The company has helped to break the cycle of poverty for thousands of rural families, by turning a traditional handicraft into a profit-making venture. ""Once you earn an income,"" says Nkubana, ""you are economically empowered. You are given a voice, you can argue your values, you can argue your point, you can argue your rights."" See also: Teaching 'reconciliation over revenge' At the same time, it has helped to improve the quality of life in the homes of the women . ""Where we have married couples, men are embracing it with dignity and appreciation that my wife is really working hard,"" says Nkubana. ""When you look at what women are doing, it is like what men used to do. Because now they earn an income, they provide for homes...It also reduces what we call the domestic violence. ""It is a pride for her and she feels respected, she feels dignified and then they feel that it has restored their value as mothers in the house.""","Gahaya Links helps Rwandan women make an income by crafting baskets .

"(CNN) -- A Texas man convicted of seeking now-deceased Yemeni-based cleric Anwar al-Awlaki's advice about raising money for jihadists has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, federal prosecutors announced Thursday. Barry Walter Bujol Jr., a 30-year-old Hempstead, Texas, resident and former student at Prairie View A&M University, had been convicted in November of attempting to provide material support to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as an aggravated identity theft charge. Prosecutors said he had been coordinating his plans with a man he thought was a recruiter for AQAP, but who in reality was a confidential source for law enforcement. Evidence revealed Bujol repeatedly told his contact, ""AQAP should attack the human beings essential to operate the UAV's instead of attacking the UAV's themselves"" and suggested targets including one in Texas, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Houston. Prosecutors said Bujol had been in e-mail communication with al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in September, and had asked his advice on how to raise money for the ""mujahideen"" without drawing police attntion. He also ""inquired about his duty as a Muslim to make 'violent jihad,' "" a statement from the U.S. attorney's office said. Bujol was arrested with a fraudulent ID card while trying to sneak into the port of Houston, where he planned to stow away aboard an Algerian-bound ship and make his way to Yemen to fight for al Qeda, prosecutors said. He acted as his own attorney in a non-jury trial, but did not present witnesses or testify on his own behalf. ""We do not take matters of potential national security lightly,"" United States Attorney Kenneth Magidson said. ""This case and its successful resolution represents (sic) our commitment to making our communities a safer place to live."" Police who searched his apartment found a home-made video on his laptop computer that included images of Osama bin Laden. In the video, which was entered into evidence, Bujol's voice is heard addressing his wife and saying he had left suddenly to pursue jihad and probably would not see her again until the afterlife.","Barry Bujol had been messaging an informant he thought was an al Qaeda recruiter .

"Below is an excerpt from HLN ""Morning Express"" anchor Robin Meade's new book, Morning Sunshine!: How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too published by Hachette Book Group.  The following  takes place when Robin was working as a weekend anchor in Chicago, Illinois. Robin Meade's book ""Morning Sunshine!: How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too"" hits shelves September 10. I looked down at the copy of the news story. My stomach clenched. My heart started palpitating. I think I held my breath without realizing it. The floor director gave me the cue, pointing at me as the camera came up on my face. I felt sweaty. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, the set seemed to fade into a gauzy haze. My breathing was jagged. The words came, but my voice was quivering so much it sounded like a kid singing into a big box fan on a humid summer day: ""Bray-ay-ay-ay-king new-ew-ew-ews tonigh-igh-ight."" My hands shook uncontrollably, and I was huffing and puffing as if I were running mile twenty five of the Chicago Marathon. These were not the controlled, measured tones of someone who had been doing this for a living for years. My heart pounded in my ears, and my face flushed. I was losing it, right there with who knows how many thousands of people watching. What the hell is happening? As I delivered the facts of the story, I didn't hear a thing that came out of my mouth. All I heard were my own thoughts. Oh, no, you're screwing up! Oh, no, your bosses are probably watching! You're going to get fired! How will you pay your mortgage? What will people think of you? And then, of course, Holy crapola, where is that sound bite? Can you see how the cause-and-effect relationship of my thoughts just engulfed me in doom and gloom? I couldn't keep my mind on the story. I totally slipped into imagining the future and the horrible repercussions of my screwup.  CNN's Virginia Cha talks to Robin about her on-air anxiety and her upcoming book » . Because I'm writing this today, you can tell that somehow I lived to see the sound bite that evening. The whole looking-like-I-was-hopped-up-on-six-energy-drinks episode lasted only seconds. But it seemed like an eternity. Now Josh, the I'm-going-to-be-a-reporter-someday crew member, and Michael, the I-really-want-to-be-a-rock-star prompter operator, were around me, wearing the same expression you'd have after witnessing a car wreck. ""Robin, are you okay? Do you need a glass of water?"" Josh's eyes were wide open, as if he really wanted to shout, ""Dude!"" He didn't know what to make of this. ""Yeah, please,"" I croaked. My mouth was cotton. I wished I had a trough to douse my head in instead of a tiny Dixie cup of water. ""Everything okay out there?"" the producer chimed in on my IFB, the earpiece through which the producer and director talk to anchors during the show without the folks at home hearing it. What to say, what to say? ""Oh, sorry about that. Wow, that was weird! I lost my breath or something."" I faked a half-laugh at the end of that statement for their benefit. When Josh handed me the glass of water, I was surprised to see my hands were still trembling. I noticed how incredibly weak I felt, and I noisily gulped down the water the way my dog does at his water bowl after he's been chasing squirrels for an hour. Get it together, Robin! Miraculously, by the time we came out of the video and I had to speak again, it was as if nothing had happened. Except for feeling wiped out, I was back to sounding authoritative and in control, even tilting my head and smirking sheepishly as if to say, You'll forgive me for that little freak-out I just had. The truth was, I was morbidly embarrassed -- the kind of embarrassed where you'd rather crawl under a rock than face people. It wasn't the kind of embarrassment you can laugh off, as I could so easily when I was in high school show choir. As the student body filed in for the Christmas assembly, I started jumping rope with a holiday garland. I was standing out on the gymnasium floor, and with each leap over the garland I felt a swish! After a few times, I realized the garland was catching my knee-length choir dress in the back and flicking the skirt hem waist-high, exposing my bum for the entire eighth grade seated behind me. And laugh I did! Wouldn't you know it? The school photographer caught the moment: there I am in the 1987 yearbook laughing with my mouth wide open, my eyes as big as saucers, and my hands behind me, having just pushed my skirt back down. I have no problem laughing at myself in situations like that. My point in telling you this embarrassing story is that you can see I don't have trouble laughing off most situations. But my job? That was another matter. No, I was not going to be able to shrug off the ""breathing problem,"" as I had called it, trying to minimize its impact, even though it had completely bamboozled me on the air. It was all I thought about after the show, driving down the darkened streets of Chicago's Streeterville to our condo, still gripped with humiliation. I felt as though every tourist lugging her shopping bags from the Magnificent Mile back to her hotel, every vagrant panhandling for handouts, and every pedestrian who called the city home knew I had just made a complete fool of myself. My brain should have been full of concussions, I was beating myself up so much. How badly was I cursing myself? I didn't care to stop for my usual Cheesecake Factory late-night treat, let's put it that way. My stomach was still in knots. I didn't turn my eyes to gawk at the car pumping the thump-thitty-thump-thump bass at the stoplight, and I barely noticed anything around me on the drive home. I couldn't even feign a smile for the friendly doorman as I entered our high-rise building. The ride to the thirty-seventh floor seemed to take forever. Every time the elevator halted and the door opened I held my breath, afraid the person joining me on the ride had seen the screwup and would ply me with questions. Tim met me at the door. He had seen the ""breathing problem"" on TV for himself. I learned later it bolted him upright from his viewing perch on the couch. ""Did you watch me?"" I asked, hoping he'd say, ""Oh, I sensed a little glitch on your part."" Instead he just nodded, and I saw the worried look on his face. He didn't say much. He was waiting for me to go first. I hesitated. Finally, in the kind of voice you'd use to soothe a colicky baby, he asked, ""Honey, what happened? Are you okay?"" I didn't know the answer.

"(CNN) -- I am extremely blessed. My unborn son, Claiborne, is due just before Father's Day this year. His pending birth motivated me to get an annual physical six months ago, a checkup I had avoided for three years. When my physician, Dr. Kenneth Kennedy, asked whether I wanted a prostate-specific antigen test, I agreed, despite the $150 out-of-pocket charge. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises against routine prostate cancer screenings. The debate over the necessity of these tests is ongoing in research labs and doctor's offices across America. Despite the controversy, a good friend of mine, who also happens to be a doctor, told me to always have my PSA levels screened after age 40. His belief is that there are still many men who are diagnosed in their 40s and that if executive health programs include the PSA test for men beginning at that age, then the test should be done, regardless of government guidelines and/or family history of cancer. Prostate cancer screening remains common . My PSA test results were higher than normal, not indicating certain cancer but suggesting the need for a biopsy, which I chose to do right away. It was an ordinary workday when I got a call from Dr. Haden Lafaye. I tried joking about his Hai Karate aftershave but was cut short: My biopsy results had come back positive for high-risk prostate cancer. I'm a 47-year-old husband and father of one -- with another on the way -- and the results came as a complete shock. I had no symptoms, and up until this point, I thought I was healthy as a horse. How was I going to tell my pregnant wife that I had prostate cancer? After tests, blood draws and CT scans, my urologist, Dr. Surena Matin, told me that my cancer was localized, and we scheduled my da Vinci Prostatectomy -- a minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer in which the surgeon uses a ""robot"" as the vehicle to remove the prostate. My incredible team of doctors diagnosed the cancer so early and did such an expert job removing my prostate that I didn't need any additional cancer treatment. No radiation. No hormone therapy. I was cancer-free. I was stunned. This Father's Day, I urge dads everywhere to schedule an annual checkup. The dads I know are always there for their families -- sometimes, at the expense of their own health. The men I know don't like talking about doctors and checkups, especially when it comes to an illness that can profoundly affect their masculinity. I'm hoping that by sharing my story, I can change perceptions about prostate cancer and reinforce the fact that we are all responsible for our own well-being. In my case, if I hadn't visited my doctor six months ago for an annual checkup, I believe that I would not have as many Father's Days to spend with my wonderful family and new son.","Father of one, with one on the way, urges dads to get a checkup .

"(CNN) -- One member of the Grammy award-winning group Ladysmith Black Mambazo garners praise for more than just his rhythm. iReporter Lulis Leal saluted singer Thulani Shabalala for his dedication in building the Umuzi Kababa Performing Arts Center in Umgababa, South Africa. ""His community performing arts center helps provide a safe haven to many high-risk neighborhood children with nowhere to go after school and nothing to do to occupy their time,"" she says. ""The center promotes traditional Zulu singing and dancing and gives children a sense of pride and inspiration for a better life."" This photographer, who's married to the musical group's manager, Mitch Goldstein, has known Shabalala for more than 20 years. The two filmed an iReport video to highlight Shabalala's efforts to empowering children in this small community with music and art. CNN spoke with Shabalala about his effort to create the center and his hope for the future. CNN: What inspired you to start building the Umuzi Kababa Performing Arts Center? Shabalala: In sing with the group, I saw a need. I saw the people who support our music and felt like we had to do something for the people. My father (Joseph Shabalala, founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo) has been trying to build a school for kids. He said it was going to be very easy for me since it's not too far from where I live. I saw the kids there. Some of them don't have money to go to school or even for food. I felt I should give back to the community. We have done some of the things for the community but I wanted this to be personally coming from me. CNN: How has the center evolved? Shabalala: I started working in 2009. The area had a broken house with no windows and no doors. There was nothing. I had to build the stage starting from scratch. So far, we have done a number of things. We've hosted workshops. We've done a month-long celebration for women and children. And we've had a ceremony with artists: Ladysmith Black Mambazo sang, and my brother's group sang as well. CNN: What has been the response from the community? Shabalala: Parents come and thank me. Kids are always around playing. CNN: How can others help? Shabalala: Through this work, we started a (non-governmental organization). If there are people who want to reach out and help the kids now, we are going to send children to go to school. We've already made a website for anyone who wants to help send kids to school. What are you doing to Impact Your World?

"(CNN) -- March 2012 will go down as the warmest March in the United States since record-keeping began in 1895, NOAA said Monday. In addition, the three-month period of January, February and March was the warmest first quarter ever recorded in the Lower 48 states. The average was 42 degrees Fahrenheit, a whopping 6 degrees above the long-term average. A staggering 15,292 warm temperature records were broken, (7,755 record highs and 7,517 record high overnight lows), according to Chris Vaccaro, spokesperson for NOAA. ""That's tremendously excessive. The scope and the scale of warmth was really unprecedented, Vaccaro said. A persistent weather pattern during the month of March led to 25 states east of the Rockies having their warmest March on record, NOAA said. That same pattern was responsible for cooler-than-average conditions in the West Coast states of Washington, Oregon and California, they said. The warm temperatures also contributed to conditions that were favorable for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. There were 223 preliminary tornado reports during March, a month that averages 80 tornadoes, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. The majority of these tornadoes occurred during a severe weather outbreak across the Ohio River Valley and Southeast in early March. The outbreak caused 40 deaths and total losses of $1.5 billion, making it the first billion-dollar disaster of 2012. Short-term weather patterns such as the one that affected the United States are poor indicators of global climate trends, however. Parts of the world, most notably Eastern Europe, experienced below-average to extreme cold temperatures this winter. CNN's Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","January-February-March also was warmest first quarter on record, NOAA reports .

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin's parents will ask the U.S. Justice Department to review a local Florida prosecutor's interactions with police investigating the teen's shooting death, the family's lawyer said. The Justice Department launched an investigation into Martin's death on March 19, but the family is now asking it to look for possible interference by State's Attorney Norm Wolfinger's office with Sanford, Florida, Police Detective Chris Serino, attorney Ben Crump said. The Martin family will send a formal request to the Justice Department Monday, Crump told CNN Sunday. Martin, 17, was fatally shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, after Zimmerman called police to report him as a ""suspicious"" person on the evening of February 26. Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk, according to an Orlando Sentinel report that was later confirmed by Sanford police. Police cited Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury, for not immediately arresting Zimmerman. Authorities have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there were no grounds, at the outset, to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, racially profiled the teen, who was black, and ignored a police dispatcher's directive not to follow him. The killing sparked nationwide protests, including a march Saturday by civil rights luminaries, carrying ""Justice for Trayvon"" signs in a marching to the Sanford police headquarters. The Sanford police department has come under intense scrutiny for its actions following the shooting, and protesters renewed their call for the firing of police Chief Bill Lee, who stepped aside temporarily this month amid criticism. The local prosecutor also stepped aside. Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special investigator to decide if Zimmerman should be charged, cleared or if the case should be sent to the grand jury. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Family wants the Justice Department to look for possible interference by state attorney .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- The Catholic Church in Ireland has launched an investigation into claims that a priest accidentally showed gay pornography pictures during a presentation to parents. The incident happened at a grade school in Pomeroy, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Parents said images were projected onto a screen during the meeting, held as part of preparations for First Holy Communion by schoolchildren. The leader of Ireland's Catholics, Cardinal Sean Brady, issued a statement Monday admitting that ""inappropriate imagery was inadvertently shown by a priest at the beginning of a PowerPoint presentation."" The statement went on the say the material ""was immediately removed from the screen"" and ""the priest has stated that he had no knowledge of the offending imagery."" The church reported the incident to police, but it appears a prosecution is not being considered. Brady's statement said: ""The archdiocese immediately sought the advice of the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) who indicated that, on the basis of the evidence available, no crime had been committed."" According to Brady: ""The priest is cooperating with an investigation of the matter on the part of the archdiocese."" Police spoke with CNN on Monday, saying: ""The incident has been reported to us, we have advised that no criminal offences have been disclosed at this time -- and anything else is a matter for the CCMS (Council for Catholic Maintained Schools) or the diocese."" However, parents say they were ""horrified"" by what they saw and want action to be taken. Parishioners planned a protest outside the local church Sunday, but the demonstration was called off when it emerged that the priest involved in the communion presentation, the Rev. Martin McVeigh, would not be present at Mass. In a statement, parents have questioned why the priest has not been suspended by the archdiocese pending its investigation. The latest controversy comes after a series of child sex abuse scandals involving Catholic Church clergy in Ireland. In March, the Vatican released a major report into the problem, begging forgiveness from victims. However, victims hit out at the report's finding that new safeguards are working.","Images were on screen at Northern Ireland grade school during presentation to parents .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- ""It's so empowering to see yourself as a machine."" Jennie Finch speaks gently from an overstuffed chair in the CNN newsroom. The camera is finally off, and although her heart-shaped face was made for TV, it's easy to see she's more comfortable now that she's not reciting lines in front of the blinking red light. ""When I was 12, I had a coach tell me I would never be a championship pitcher,"" Finch continues. ""That devastated me. I was crushed. And my dad drilled it in my head, you know, 'If you want it bad enough, and you're willing to make the sacrifices, you can do it. But first you have to believe in yourself.'"" Her coach was wrong. Finch, a two-time Olympic softball player, is arguably one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the sport. As a senior at the University of Arizona she set a NCAA record with 60 consecutive wins (hitting 50 home runs along the way). She then led Team USA to two world championships and two Olympic medals -- a gold in Athens in 2004 and a silver in Beijing. Finch became the face of fast-pitch softball as the sport's popularity grew in America and abroad. Her competitive nature aided her on the field; her polite optimism helped her off of it. Her love for hair ribbons and the color pink also made her a fan favorite. Finch showed it was cool to ""Throw Like a Girl,"" not so coincidentally the name of her new book. Her annual softball camps are now filled with girls who have mounds of dirt under their prettily painted fingernails. Finch retired from softball in 2010 at the ripe-old age of 29 to raise her son Ace, now 5 years old. She and her husband, professional baseball pitcher Casey Daigle, live on a farm in Sulphur, Louisiana. But that doesn't mean Finch has slowed down any. In November, four months after giving birth to son Diesel, she ran the New York City Marathon. Starting dead last, Finch passed 30,397 people on her way to the finish line, earning more than $30,000 for charity. ""There's nothing better than working up a good sweat,"" Finch says. ""I make time to keep active. I know how important it is to keep moving."" With baseball season right around the corner, CNN jumped at the chance to ask Finch more about how she stays fit, the future of competitive softball and why we don't watch professional women's sports. The following is an edited version of the interview: . Why is it important for young girls to get involved in sports? It's crucial. The statistics are incredible. Teen pregnancy rates drop. Grade point averages are, you know, higher. Suicide. Depression. It affects all of those. When you're involved in sports you just have that much great chance of being successful and living a healthy lifestyle. And I think learning things at a young age you can carry that with you forever. I know, for myself, there are lessons I learned that transcend into motherhood, into the business world, wherever I go: teamwork, leadership, discipline, sacrifice -- all those things carryover. Jennie Finch inspires Fit Nation triathlete . It's no secret that girls can be mean, especially in high school. Did you have to deal with that at all? Yeah, you know you're always going to have tough people to deal with. I think it's a matter of taking the high road.` You have to look yourself in the mirror at night. If you know that you've given your best and your heart is in the right place, that's all you can do. The truth will reveal itself. I've seen it over and over. Success finds those that truly work hard and that truly do have the right heart and the right mind. How did your dad walk that fine line between being supportive and being your coach? He was crazy, definitely. But you know, without that crazy father of mine, I would not be where I am today. My mom knew whether it was a good or bad workout because I was either in tears or happy after. But it was like he knew how far to push me and I don't think he ever went to the point where I resented the game for it. Ultimately he loved me. That's the most important part -- that unconditional love. ... It was never (like) I was afraid to make the mistake. It was always a matter of me working hard and working hard when no one's watching and doing the stuff that no one else wanted to do, making those ultimate sacrifices. As teenagers, we're instinctively lazy. You want to just hang with your friends, go to the mall. How did you get past that? Something my dad always said: ""God gave you this gift, and it's your responsibility to carry it out."" And I think my competitive nature. Growing up with two older brothers, losing at everything, I have this competitive fire [and] drive within me that helped carry me through a lot. When I look at teens today ... we're used to instant gratification with technology. Success doesn't come in an instant. It's the process; it's the journey. It's the hard work that it takes to get there. So I think that (you have to) try to enjoy the process and know that it's a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get you there. Baseball season is coming up. Who will you be rooting for? The Dodgers! I grew up a Dodgers fan. And then being married to a baseball player, kind of whatever team he's with. Now we kind of have a lot of friends that play so more individuals than teams but [I] always have to go for L.A. teams. You were obviously disappointed when the Olympics committee decided to cut softball from the games. Where is the sport going next? It's an uphill battle. Our work is cut out for us. Lucky for us, in the U.S. the college game is very popular and growing. But it's outside of the U.S. that I think the Olympic decision is going to hurt the most because these countries just kind of finally got their federations together and got the funding and had built these programs and without the Olympics their funding is lost so ... we're working hard to get it back in for 2012 now. So in the next year we'll be campaigning for the vote. You often hear that people don't watch women's professional sports. Why do you think that is? I think, you know, you have to appreciate the women's games for the women's games. Can we compare it to the men's? On some levels yes, on some levels no. And I think too, marketing is a lot, a huge part of it. Unfortunately there's not much PR or marketing in women's athletics. We've gotten a lot better but we still have more to accomplish and to keep breaking down those barriers. It's been great to see the college game picked up and the ratings be so successful. Because people are watching and there is an audience out there and that do enjoy it and the ratings prove that. You ran a marathon four months after having your second son. How did you do it? Mental toughness. So much of it is between your own ears and fighting that doubt. We will always have that doubt, but that's what keeps us on edge and keeps us working harder. Preparation builds the confidence to overcome that doubt, but I don't think you truly do ever overcome it, or I never did. Even up to mile 25 it was like, ""Can I go another mile?"" It's like, ""Yes, I can."" [It's] that internal battle that you have to keep fighting and winning. Tell us a bit about you stay healthy at home. I'm all about balance. Nothing extreme. I live in Louisiana so we eat; we're surrounded by way too much good food. So I kind of work out to eat. But like I said it's all about balance. It's not like I never have dessert, I just try to eat it in moderation and make my workouts so I can eat what I want and enjoy it. Having two little boys, it's easy to keep moving. A lot of times it's not going to the gym [and] getting in an hour of cardio. A lot of times it's just me being outside, playing with my boys, jumping on the trampoline. Whatever it takes to get me moving and my heart rate pumping. My workouts I like to mix it up. I have met an incredible running group that has helped me tremendously -- social time for me, fellowship and just an escape from everything. I put in workout DVDs, whether it's yoga, pilates, tae bo even -- my old school ones. I love getting outside with my boys. I lift weights every now and then. Do you have any advice for someone who's sitting at home right now, going, ""Yeah, OK, Jennie, but you're a natural athlete. How do I run a marathon?"" It's all about starting. You know, baby steps. It's not going to be about instant gratification that we want, that we're used to in this day and age. But it is about the process and the journey and just making those subtle changes. Parking a little further. Walking up the stairs. Those little things that can help and get you kick-started. I saw something recently that was like, as long as you're moving, you're better off than being on the couch. No matter what pace you're at. You're not going to get off the couch and be at some amazing fast pace or burn crazy amounts of calories but you have to start somewhere. ... Eventually you'll get there. We all have excuses but leave those excuses at the door. If you want it bad enough, go for it. Life's too short not to.","Jennie Finch is an Olympic softball player and one of the sport's greatest pitchers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Both political parties continued jockeying Sunday to position themselves as more deserving of the female vote, a battle that took on new life last week after a Democratic strategist questioned Ann Romney's validity in giving her husband advice on economic issues affecting women. The criticism from Hilary Rosen, also a CNN contributor, rekindled the national conversation on whether Republicans or Democrats are better equipped to improve economic conditions for women and gave Republicans a line of attack against Democrats. Polls show a majority of female voters favor President Barack Obama over presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner defended the Obama administration's record on job creation and accused Mitt Romney of leveling ""ridiculous"" accusations against the president's policies. He specifically pointed to Romney's claim that 92.3% of jobs lost in the country were among women. ""It's a ridiculous and deeply misleading look at the economy,"" Geithner said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Remember the recession and the crisis started at the beginning of 2008 before the president took office. It caused a huge amount of damage to men, to women, to families. And the damage lasted for a time, and you're still seeing the scars of that."" The 92.3% figure was batted back and forth to jab Obama in the latest skirmish in the war over women. Although the number is correct, when including non-farm-employed women from January 2009 -- when Obama took office -- to March 2012, women have gained 863,000 jobs since February 2010. The percentage also does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job-loss pie in the year leading up to Obama's inauguration. Geithner stressed the downturn ""hurt everybody,"" and unsurprisingly rallied behind the president's proposals, including the ""Buffett Rule,"" which he said is part of a comprehensive plan that will continue to improve the country's economic outlook. But Romney backers, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, argued that the former Massachusetts governor is armed with proposals that will not only court female voters, but also turn the economy around. McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, predicted Romney would win the female vote, despite the gender gap in current polling. ""I do believe that Ann Romney was right when she said the women she talks to and the women I talk to, traveling around my state, are interested in jobs and the economy,"" McCain said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""There's no doubt that a lot of women have been hurt very badly in this recession. And jobs and the economy is their No. 1 priority."" A recent poll from ABC News/Washington Post showed Obama leading Romney among women, 57% to 38%, despite his single-digit lead among all voters over the former Massachusetts governor in a hypothetical general-election matchup. Ann Romney, a mother of five, came to her own defense and the defense of her husband on Thursday after Rosen questioned her qualifications for advising her husband, given she had ""never worked a day in her life."" Rosen later apologized for her comments, but not before igniting a firestorm. Rosen responds to firestorm over Ann Romney comment . Rodgers, who was one of the women dispatched by the Romney campaign to capitalize on Rosen's comment last week, told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley that her candidate's policies will ""help women succeed in this country and all people in this country succeed."" ""President Obama's policies are the ones that are failing, Americans failing women,"" she added on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Opinion: Not another Mommy War . After calling Rosen's comments ""shocking and insulting,"" Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota returned to the Republican line, saying ""women have born the brunt of the failed economic policies under Barack Obama."" ""There's no question his economic policies have had a disproportionate negative impact on women and that's why I think women are going to be very upset with this current administration,"" the former presidential candidate said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The back-and-forth over female support is the latest Twitter- and cable-fed controversy to show the general election between Romney and Obama is already under way. Rosen: It's not personal, it's politics . On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus would not yet characterize Romney as the ""presumptive nominee"" out of respect for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who remain in the race. However, Romney's significant advantages on all fronts make it highly likely he will face Obama for the presidency. Newly into the second quarter of fund-raising, both Romney and Obama will travel in the coming week in hopes of aiding their campaign coffers. The president, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will all hold fund-raising events in the next week. Obama is scheduled to campaign in Michigan, while his wife will be in Washington, D.C., Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Biden will host events in Washington, D.C., Arizona and California. Romney, too, will attempt to bring in money through events in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Ann Romney is scheduled host a birthday-themed fund-raiser in New York on Tuesday, one day after she and her husband sit down for a joint interview with ABC News set to air Monday night.","Tim Geithner defends Obama's record on job creation .

"(CNN) -- Recent ballistic missile tests by India, Pakistan and North Korea -- which has ominously threatened to ""reduce to ashes"" the South Korean military ""in minutes"" -- are once again focusing the world's attention on the dangers of nuclear war. This concern was dramatically underscored in a new report released at the Nobel Peace Laureates Summit in Chicago. Titled ""Nuclear Famine: A Billion People at Risk"" (PDF),  the study shows that even a limited nuclear war, involving less than half of 1% of the world's nuclear arsenals, would cause climate disruption that could set off a global famine. The study, prepared by International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and its U.S. affiliate, Physicians for Social Responsibility, used a scenario of 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs exploded in a war between India and Pakistan. If there were such a war, the study estimated that 1 billion people, one-sixth of the human race, could starve over the following decade. Along with recent events, these findings require a fundamental change in our thinking about nuclear weapons. The study, in positing a war between India and Pakistan, shows the importance of understanding that smaller nuclear powers, not just the United States and Russia, pose a threat to the whole world. But the greater lesson concerns the forces of the larger nuclear powers. Each U.S. Trident submarine can destroy 100 cities and produce the global famine described in the study. The United States has 14 of them, a fleet of land-based nuclear missiles, and an arsenal of nuclear weapons that can be delivered by bombers. The Russians possess the same grotesque overkill capacity. Even the most ambitious arms reductions under discussion would leave the United States and Russia with 300 warheads each, most of them 10 to 30 times larger than a Hiroshima sized bomb. This would be a massive arsenal capable of producing the global famine scenario many, many times over. These arsenals are an archaic, but lethal, holdover from the Cold War. Their continued existence poses an ongoing threat to all humanity. Steps can and should be taken immediately to lessen this danger. Substantial numbers of these weapons remain on what The New York Times has described as ""hair-trigger alert."" They can be fired in 15 minutes or less and destroy cities a continent away 30 minutes later. This alert posture creates the needless danger of an accidental or unintended launch, and the United States and Russia have had many close calls, preparing to launch a nuclear strike at the other under the mistaken belief they were under attack. The most recent of these near-misses that we know about took place in January 1995, well after the end of the Cold War. The United States and Russia should stand down their nuclear arsenals so that it takes longer to launch their missiles, lessening the danger of an accidental war. U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladamir Putin can take this step on their own without negotiating a formal treaty. Beyond this, it is time to begin urgent talks aimed at reducing the U.S. and Russian arsenals as the next essential step toward multilateral negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention, a binding, verifiable, enforceable treaty that eliminates nuclear weapons altogether. As former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev observed on reviewing the new ""Nuclear Famine"" study: ""I am convinced that nuclear weapons must be abolished. Their use in a military conflict is unthinkable; using them to achieve political objectives is immoral. ""Over 25 years ago, President Ronald Reagan and I ended our summit meeting in Geneva with a joint statement that 'Nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,' and this new study underscores in stunning and disturbing detail why this is the case."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: India, Pakistan and North Korea missile tests bring up dangers of nuclear war .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""I feel that my life is worthless. I have lost my interest in talking to others, and in my studies too. I have also lost interest in being with a crowd of people. All I want is to sit all by myself. Is my problem an illness? Has it got any solution?"" - Letter from a male university student, 18, Nepal . ""Chatting"" on the road: SSMK reporters in action . This extract is just one example of the 1,500 letters and 400 e-mails that Binita Shrestha, 29, receives each month. As the host of Nepalese community radio show, ""Chatting with my Best Friend,"" Shrestha and her co-host, Binayak Aryal, provide a vital link to young people across the remote regions of the mountainous country. ""Chatting with my Best Friend,"" or ""Saathi Sanga Manka Kura"" (SSMK), launched in April 2001 with the mission to broadcast life skills to Nepalese youth and equip them with the knowledge and the confidence to make better-informed decisions. The lively hour-long show features drama, songs and light-hearted banter between its young hosts. But the focal point of the show -- and the reason for its popularity amongst its young and often isolated audience -- is the listeners' letters section, where Shrestha and Aryal give frank, unbiased advice on everything from teenage sex, HIV and drug use to careers and family matters. The team have handled letters from a girl whose father had raped her but whose mother wouldn't believe her; a boy whose HIV-positive girlfriend was pressuring him to marry her; a girl who had contracted a sexually transmitted disease and didn't know what to do; and girls facing sexual harassment on the streets. That's on top of the issues faced by many teens around the world: low self-esteem, lack of career opportunity, sexuality and self identity; plus the problems that have risen from the recent Nepalese conflict: enforced migration, the risk of landmines and dealing with disabilities. Some cases, like the one from the girl who was raped, require special attention. (She was advised to talk to her older sister and was put in touch with a local counseling center.) But the SSMK team are able to respond to most of their huge mailbag with templated letters and advice booklets, enabling the listener to make their own informed decision. The weekly show has six million listeners across Nepal -- a staggering 20 percent of the population and 50 percent of its 14-29-year-old target audience. Since launch, it has doubled in length, has its own spin-off careers show and has sired similar projects in Cambodia and Laos. And when the SSMK team hit the road, they are greeted like film stars by legions of avid fans. ""You don't ever feel lonely. Anywhere I go, I am surrounded by people,"" says Shrestha. With its peer-to-peer approach, ""Chatting with my Best Friend"" aims to lift some of the taboos surrounding sex, drugs and related issues like human trafficking. Unsurprisingly for a country whose population is traditionally both modest and reticent, the show received some resistance when it was first broadcast. But while those taboos aren't going away -- even Shrestha says she sometimes feels awkward listening to the show with her family -- ""Chatting with my Best Friend"" has opened up communication both amongst youth and across the age divide. And the show's combination of friendly chat backed up with clear information is working. One of the main achievements of ""Chatting with my Best Friend,"" according to its listeners, is that it has boosted their self-esteem. ""[The show] has helped thousands of Nepalese deprived of proper knowledge,"" writes one. ""Several of my problems got solved through your program,"" adds another. For the SSMK team, the show is no nine-to-five. The pressure is intense. When Shrestha leaves the office, her job follows her. People approach her on the street or when she's traveling, hoping that she can solve their problems. ""They really have expectations,"" she told CNN. It can get overwhelming. ""We can only give them comfort sometimes,"" she admitted. ""I feel very bad if the situation is very critical and I am not able to do anything. We are just radio producers: we can't have solutions for everything."" But their dedication brings a closeness that she treasures: ""The people that work on the show are like a family. We all know what we're working for,"" she said. That closeness has helped Nepalese youth to link up with each other, too. Some found it uncomfortable to listen to the show's subject matter with their families, and chose to listen with friends. That's resulted in a thousand listener groups springing up across Nepal whose members listen to the show together each week, hold special information events and raise awareness of HIV, safe sex and other personal issues within their communities. One remote village's group even organized the building of a link road to the main highway, two kilometers away. The SSMK model's success has spurred a sister project in Cambodia, ""We Can Do It!"" that launches this December, and a more modest project in Laos based within a secondary school. Ronni Goldfarb, founder and president of Equal Access, hopes that the future will bring more opportunities for collaboration to bring the SSMK model to new countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Goldfarb is keen to point out how cost effective community radio can be. In rural Nepal, where Internet access is limited and television and print are prohibitively expensive, radio can reach thousands of youngsters who would otherwise be isolated within their small villages. Equal Access does this for less than ten cents a year per listener. ""By 2020 the world's youth population will easily reach four billion,"" Goldfarb told CNN. ""Empowering youth -- tomorrow's leaders, parents and teachers -- with self-esteem, the confidence and skills to create a better life, and a supportive network of peers is one of the most powerful contributions Equal Access can make to future generations and to a more equitable world."" Back in Kathmandu, as half of Nepal's most famous youth radio duo, Shrestha's bright future has only begun. But she won't stay with SSMK forever. ""Even though I feel really young at heart, I know that in years to come I won't be young any more,"" she explained. And when that day comes, she and Aryal will pass on the SSMK baton to a new generation of presenters -- who will bring the SSMK brand of friendly, supportive and practical advice to a new generation of Nepalese youth. ...................................

"(CNN) -- European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht believes businesses need to be lean and mean if they're to ensure growth during the tough economic times engulfing the continent. De Gucht's comments come as the European Business Awards were handed out in Barcelona, highlighting some of the greatest achievements by companies despite the current climate. ""We cannot get out of this crisis without the businesses,"" says De Gucht. ""It's the companies who are performing the export and the trade, and who produce the products that we can market on the world marketplace."" Businesses up for awards this year ranged from Turkish mattress makers to a Parisian car firm. Their accomplishments have been recognized, whether they are new start ups or established companies, who've been around for decades. But regardless of how old they are, companies are being told to keep rejuvenating. De Gucht emphasizes the need for businesses to be innovative to guarantee they survive and thrive in troubled economic times. ""They should be confident and continue taking risks, measured risks, but you cannot do business without taking risks,"" he says. He also believes European companies need to look outside the continent for future growth, and points to China as a market which should be explored more. ""Ninety per cent of growth will be realized in the coming years outside of Europe, and China alone will be responsible for one third of that."" De Gucht recognizes the European Commission's role in helping companies trying to enter into the Chinese marketplace. The Commissioner acknowledges while there are plenty of opportunities in the Asian powerhouse there are also problems, citing intellectual property rights as one area of concern. He says the body is trying to create conditions to make it easier for business. ""We have a lot of problems in this market but we have to realize that it is one of the most promising in the world."" The EU itself has previously been criticized by the World Trade Organization for having too much red tape. De Gucht admits that is still the case but says the body is working on overcoming the issues. ""We certainly have deficiencies and we are in a difficult position due to the economic crisis."" But De Gucht warns the business world not to discount Europe. ""We are the biggest economy in the world and they will have to take us into account, even for the non-foreseeable future.""

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea test-fired a fourth short-range missile off its east coast Thursday, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's administration has become more aggressive in recent months. South Korea's Defense Ministry had earlier confirmed three launches, but could not immediately be reached about the fourth reported missile. The first three missiles were fired at 5:20 p.m., 6 p.m., and 7:50 p.m. local time from Sinsang-ni near the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, a ministry spokesman said. A U.S. official told CNN ""the missile firings come as no surprise."" ""The North has been carrying out provocative acts for some time,"" said the official, who did not want to be named for security reasons. ""North Korea needs to stop this type of activity and return to the process of bringing about a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."" A U.S. intelligence official confirmed the test firings and said there are ""no indications whatsoever"" of an impending long-range missile test. The intelligence official, who could also not be named for security reasons, said the launches came as no surprise because North Korea had issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a ""military firing exercise,"" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN. The North issued a similar warning before testing a long-range missile in April, but that warning indicated two potential danger areas more indicative of a long-range missile test. Thursday's reported test comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. Analyst Daniel Pinkston said the reported test might be training for a future test but it could also just be a routine military exercise. ""It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch,"" said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea. ""It's part of military training, but there seem to be no movements of troops or anything that would suggest preparations for military operations. ""So yes, people are watching it, the military is watching it here, but I don't think it's related to any plans or operations to attack anyone."" Russia had a low-key reaction to the reported test. Russian military experts are carefully studying the reports but the launches will not change the political situation, a spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry said. CNN's Jill Dougherty in Moscow, Russia and Charley Keyes in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report .","North Korea reportedly test fires four short-range missiles off its east coast .

"Indianapolis, Indiana (CNN) -- Richard Lugar's landslide loss in Tuesday's Indiana Republican primary isn't just a 36-year veteran getting tossed out of office before he wanted to go. It's also the latest blow to the political center in an increasingly polarized Senate. Indiana Senate race tighter after Lugar's defeat . Already, nearly half a dozen moderate senators in both parties are retiring this year. Some, such as Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine, made clear in her surprise announcement earlier this year she's leaving because she can no longer stand the partisanship and inability to get things done. Snowe retirement a blow to Senate's 'sensible center' Two years ago, several centrist Republicans were toppled by tea party-backed candidates. In the case of Lugar, his opponent, Richard Mourdock, argued successfully to Indiana GOP voters that Lugar, a moderate, too often supported President Barack Obama's agenda. Mourdock, who won with support from tea party-aligned groups from around the country, advocates confrontation over compromise. ""What I've said is, and what I continue to believe, certainly, is one side or the other must prevail, and I'm hoping this candidacy will help move the Republican Party forward to become a permanent majority,"" Mourdock told CNN on Election Day. In the face of his defeat, Lugar told CNN that ""people don't understand the legislative process."" To get things done, he said, you have to compromise. ""Some people say, well, we do understand it, and by golly, we're going to wait until we have majorities in both houses, the White House, where there's two years, four years, six years, but the country has to keep going in the meanwhile,"" Lugar said. As Lugar left his election night headquarters after giving his concession speech, the 80-year-old senator instructed campaign aides to distribute a statement that was quite extraordinary in the annals of politics. It was partly a detailed defense of his ill-fated and often maligned campaign strategy and partly a stark warning to both parties about the divisive state of American politics, starting with Mourdock. ""His embrace of an unrelenting partisan mindset is irreconcilable with my philosophy of governance and my experience of what brings results for Hoosiers in the Senate. In effect, what he has promised in this campaign is reflexive votes for a rejectionist orthodoxy and rigid opposition to the actions and proposals of the other party,"" Lugar wrote. He also said if Republicans continue to make it difficult for legislators to find compromise, ""we will be relegated to minority status. Parties don't succeed for long if they stop appealing to voters who may disagree with them on some issues."" Lugar's parting words: Part defense, part warning . But U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican swept into office on the tea party wave two years ago, suggested Lugar's harsh words for many in his party were mostly about his own personal loss. ""These elections are tough battles, and people probably have hard feelings when they don't win. But the fact of the matter is that people like me -- and I think also people like Richard Mourdock, people that actually had tea party support -- we love this country. We are so concerned about the fact that we are burdening our children, grandchildren with debt that is simply unsustainable,"" Johnson told CNN. Though most senators willing to cross party lines are either gone, or in the case of Sen. Orrin Hatch, moved enough toward the base of their party to stay alive, there are a few exceptions. Scott Brown is one. To win in Democratic Massachusetts, the Republican plays up crossing party lines, in this new ad called ""Independent."" It features a clip from CBS's ""60 Minutes"" describing Brown as ""unpredictably independent, and beholden to no one."" The problem for Lugar is he tried that in his Republican primary in the red state of Indiana. It may have worked in times gone by, but in 2012 politics, his argument that he reaches across the aisle was a negative for Lugar, something he lamented in the face of his landslide loss. ""We have been a factor in pulling people together so we reach decisions. The public as a whole may be unhappy with one party or the other, but they're very unhappy with the Congress as a whole for their inability to make decisions,"" Lugar said. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Richard Lugar's primary defeat is the latest blow to the political center in the U.S. Senate .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations Human Rights Council urged Sri Lanka Thursday to thoroughly investigate allegations of atrocities committed during the island nation's long and brutal civil war. The Geneva-based U.N. body adopted a U.S.-initiated resolution calling on the Sri Lankan government to ""initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans."" The measure was adopted in a 24-15 vote; eight nations abstained. Sri Lanka's 26-year war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels, otherwise known as the Tamil Tigers, ended three years ago when government forces declared victory. A U.N. report last year found credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both sides during the final stages of the fighting. The Sri Lankan government, however, rejected the findings as ""biased, baseless and unilateral."" Between September 2008 and May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into Vanni, an area of northern Sri Lanka where tens of thousands of civilians were killed, according to the U.N. report. Questions of accountability for the mass killings of civilians remain unanswered. ""There cannot be impunity for large-scale civilian casualties,"" Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. council, said last month. ""If governments cannot tell the truth about large-scale atrocities, whatever else they're doing that's positive can't eradicate the despair that will be there on the part of the victims,"" she said. ""If that despair isn't acknowledged or dealt with in some way by the government, it will sow seeds of future violence."" Last year's U.N. report was issued by a panel appointed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2010 as a way to address accountability in the Sri Lankan war. The panel's report last April gave credence to allegations of serious human rights violations by both government forces as well as the rebels that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Many civilians were killed in the final phases of the war because of government shelling, the U.N. report found. It said the government attacked no-fire zones after encouraging the civilian population to gather there. Those places included food distribution lines, front-line hospitals and Red Cross ships picking up the wounded. The Sri Lankan government continued to shell these areas in spite of knowing its impact from its own intelligence systems and notification from the United Nations and other international humanitarian agencies, the U.N. report said. U.N. investigators said the Sri Lankan government deprived people of humanitarian aid and deliberately underestimated the number of civilians who remained in the conflict zone. The report also blamed the Tamil Tigers, known as a terrorist group responsible for the assassinations of two world leaders -- Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993 and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. The U.N. report accused the rebels of forced labor, suicide attacks, using civilians as human shields, killing civilians attempting to flee, using military equipment in the proximity of civilians and recruiting children. Donahoe said it was imperative for Sri Lanka to reconcile its bloody past. ""I think this outcome is also important not only for the people of Sri Lanka, but for human rights generally and for the international human rights principle that when there are mass-scale civilian casualties and human rights violations, there must be some credible investigation and some form of accountability,"" she said. ""Without that element, there cannot be real reconciliation or lasting peace.""","The U.N. Human Rights Council urged Sri Lanka to probe alleged war crimes .

"Beijing (CNN) -- After a deal was hammered out by European Union leaders last week on a joint plan to help bail out Greece and bolster European banks, the world looked to China to help pick up the check. In a historical context, it's a remarkable turn of events for China, which inside a generation has rocketed from isolation and poverty to become the world's second largest economy behind the United States. But as Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived in Europe to meet with other G-20 leaders in Cannes, it became increasingly clear that Beijing wasn't coming into town wearing a white hat to rescue debt-ridden eurozone nations. Why is the EU turning to China? Simply put, Beijing has the money. The tumult in Greece is over austerity moves that would cut Greek services, reduce payback to Greek bondholders by as much 50% and bolster loans to help Athens in $178 billion deal. The end goal of these measures would leave Greece with debt equaling 120% of its total economic output by 2020. China, by contrast, is the largest holder of foreign currency reserves in the world with more than $3 trillion in its coffers and an economy whose annual growth rate hovers near 10%. European leaders are hoping Beijing will be a substantial contributor to the European Financial Stability Fund, which under the deal hammered out last week would increase from 440 billion euros to 1 trillion euros ($1.36 trillion). But Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters gathering in Cannes ahead of the summit that it was ""too soon"" for Beijing to say whether it would contribute to the fund. ""The fund has not established details of its investment options so we still can't talk about the issue of investing,"" he said. What's in it for China? The bloc of 17 nations united under the euro currency is China's largest trading partner, the destination for nearly 20% of Chinese goods exported in 2010; by comparison, 18% of Chinese exports were sent to the U.S, according to 2010 World Trade Organization figures. In July, eurozone trade to China surpassed the U.S. for the first time to become the EU's largest trading partner, according to Eurostat. So an unstable Europe would undoubtedly hurt the fortunes of exporters here. Still, any help would likely come with strings attached. Though U.S. lawmakers have led complaints that China unfairly manipulates the value of its currency, similar shouts have been heard from European officials. No doubt Beijing would like to see those calls silenced. Moreover, China wants the EU to give it market economy status, which would reduce the tariffs for Chinese products sold in the eurozone. China is scheduled to get market economy status by the World Trade Organization in 2016, and observers say it's likely the EU will wait until then. ""Since eruption of the global financial crisis and the debt crisis in Europe, China has offered help to Europe. For instance, China sent several delegations to Europe to purchase huge amounts of goods and services in 2009, aiming to boost Europe's economy. Since last year, China has purchased bonds of several European countries, trying to save nations deep in a debt crisis,"" a commentary in China's state-run Xinhua said last month arguing for market economy status. ""By contrast, it is a pity that the EU side still shows no sincerity on the issue of recognizing China's market economy status,"" it said. Why is China reluctant to help? There appears to be little domestic enthusiasm in China to run to the EU's aid. ""They keep pushing the anti-dumping thing and bullying China, and now we are helping them?"" one Beijing man told CNN, referring to allegations that China ""dumps"" products in markets with unfair pricing. ""I say we should not save them."" Chinese perceive their currency reserve as a nest egg built on the back of 30 years hard work building its economy, said Patrick Chovanec of Tsinghua University. ""It's a sensitive issue because Beijing can't be seen to be just investing this money willy-nilly,"" Chovanec said. ""They need to make a case that they're going to earn a reliable return."" Economist Andy Xie in Shanghai argues it's not in Beijing's ""political, economic or strategic interest"" to come to the EU's aid. While some have argued a handout would be a way for China to increase its ""soft power"" abroad, Xie thinks such a move would backfire. ""Look at Greece -- they complain their country is being taken over by German bankers,"" he said. ""How do you think they will feel if China steps in? The average person wouldn't look at this as aid, but as China coming in and taking us over."" And a slowdown in the EU would hurt China, it wouldn't raise the specter of widespread unemployment, he added. ""China's labor market is fully employed ... there are widespread shortages of manual labor. Any economic slowdown (from reduced EU demand) is not likely to see widespread unemployment."" Even more of a signal that Beijing will let the EU solve its own problems. How China can really help . Others say that China's real opportunity to help isn't through bailing out Europe, but investing in the EU and boosting domestic consumption of European products. ""What the Europeans lack isn't money, what they lack is growth,"" said Chovanec. ""China can play an important role in saving Europe but not in the way that most people think. Most people think the Europeans are coming to China hat in hand hoping for bailout funds. ""Really the way that China can help Europe is not by continuing to run surpluses and turn around to use the proceeds to lend it back to Europe to keep them on life support. ""The real way Chinese can help Europe is by using some of that money, the $3 trillion worth of reserves they've piled up to stimulate consumption ... and help create jobs, earnings and opportunity in Europe,"" Chovanec said. CNN's Alexis Lai contributed to this story .","EU leaders are hopeful China will assist in funding the European debt plan .

"(CNN) -- Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student who was found guilty of using a webcam to spy on and intimidate his gay roommate, has reported to a New Jersey jail Thursday where he will serve a 30-day sentence, according to Middlesex County Sheriff Mildred Scott. Ravi turned himself in to authorities, who then transported him to jail Thursday afternoon, Scott said. Is 30-day sentence fair? A day earlier, Ravi apologized for spying on his roommate, Tyler Clementi, with a webcam. ""I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010, and September 21, 2010,"" Ravi said in a statement Wednesday. Clementi, 18, killed himself by jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River after learning Ravi had secretly recorded his intimate encounter with another man. Ravi's court appearance Wednesday formalized his decision to head to jail, waiving his right not to serve jail time twice for the same crime, as prosecutors appeal his sentence. New Jersey prosecutors argue that Ravi's crimes warranted more than a 30-day jail term and called Superior Judge Glenn Berman's sentence ""insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state."" Berman defended the jail sentence Wednesday, CNN affiliate WABC reported. ""I can't find it in me to remand him to state prison that house people convicted of offenses such as murder, armed robbery and rape,"" Berman said. ""I don't believe that fits this case. I believe that he has to be punished and he will be."" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there is ""very little chance"" the sentence will be overturned on appeal. He noted that under New Jersey law, the judge had the flexibility to sentence Ravi to anything from zero to 10 years in prison. Ravi was handed a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. He also must pay more than $11,000 in restitution. ""I decided to accept and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It's the only way I can go on with my life,"" Ravi said in his statement. His attorney said he intends to begin community service after he serves his sentence and will start paying his fines in August.

"(CNN) -- A Lavaca County, Texas, grand jury did not return an indictment against a father who killed a man he found allegedly sexually abusing his daughter, officials said Tuesday at a press conference in Hallettsville, Texas. ""The substantial amount of evidence showed that the witness statements and the father's statement and what the father had observed was in fact what had happened that day,"" Lavaca County District Attorney Heather McMinn told reporters. The father, who will not be charged, is not being named by CNN to protect the identity of his daughter. The father called 911, and he and his family tried to ""save the life"" of alleged attacker Jesus Mora Flores ""despite what they had just witnessed,"" McMinn added. McMinn told CNN that Flores, 47, was not an acquaintance of the family. According to the Lavaca County Sheriff's Office, the father and his family had gathered for a horse shoeing last Saturday at their ranch where they keep horses and chickens. Ohio woman charged with prostituting daughter . There were seven people in attendance in total, including four members of the family, two acquaintances and a stranger to the family, who was the alleged molester. According to McMinn, the alleged abuser was a legal worker from Mexico. His 5-year-old daughter had gone off toward the barn, to feed the chickens, the child's grandfather told CNN affiliates KSAT and KPRC. Then her father heard screaming and ran. He found a man sexually abusing his daughter, according to Sheriff Micah Harmon. The father stopped the alleged abuser, and then pounded him repeatedly in the head, killing him, authorities said. On the recorded 911 call, the father can be heard crying, and telling the operator, ""I need an ambulance. This guy was raping my daughter and I beat him up. And I don't know ... I don't know what to do."" Later in the call, when the operator tells the caller, ""I'm working on it if you can hold on,"" the emotional father says, ""The guy's dying on me!"" McMinn also told CNN the child's grandfather and aunt both administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Neither officials nor the family's attorney, V'Anne Huser, took questions from reporters Tuesday but Huser said in light of the grand jury's decision, ""in our opinion, today, the story is over."" McMinn told CNN she had ""never seen a case this clear"" in her career. The incident occurred outside the town of Shiner, a community between Houston and San Antonio that has about 2,000 people within its city limits and another 1,500 or so on its outskirts, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

"(CNN) -- An accident in a tunnel at a construction project near Lake Mead in the Las Vegas area killed one worker and injured another on Monday, the agency operating the site said. The workers were constructing a mining operation underground when they were hit by a high-pressure release of grout, said Bronson Mack of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, a cooperative public agency formed in 1991 to manage the water resources in a region that includes Las Vegas. One worker suffered a fatal blow from the impact of the pressure release and died on the scene, Mack said. The other worker was taken to a hospital with unspecified injuries. No other workers remain in the tunnel at this time, according to Mack, and no one was exposed to harmful gases as a result of the accident. The fatal pressure release took place at a project known as Intake No. 3, which is under way near Lake Mead. The project is intended to give the authorities the ability to draw water from the Colorado River for the Las Vegas area and guard against water quality issues that are associated with continually dropping lake levels. The area is in the midst of moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. The regional agency has undertaken a $2.9 billion capital improvement initiative, stretched out over 15 years, to address the region's water needs.","A high-pressure release of grout strikes two workers at a construction site .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's former security chief is slamming the country's prime minister and defense minister for their handling of Iran, saying neither one inspires confidence. ""I don't trust a leadership that relies on messianic leadership,"" said Yuval Diskin, the former head of the Shin Bet, the country's internal security service, at a public conference Friday night in Israel. ""Our two messiahs from Caesaria and from the Akiorv Towers are not fit to stand at the helm of the government,"" Diskin said, referring to the respective residences of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak. His comments were widely reported in the Israeli media Saturday. Barak said while he welcomed Diskin's entry into politics, the comments are irresponsible. ""It is both embarrassing and saddening to see the weakening of judgment and responsibility and the low language a man who served the public for years was dragged into,"" said a statement from Barak's office. ""Diskin is acting in a petty, irresponsible manner motivated by personal frustration. He is harming the heritage of generations of Shin Bet heads and the operational norms of the organization."" A senior Israeli government official said that the comments lacked credibility because the domestic security focus of the Shin Bet made the organization a ""peripheral player"" when it comes to Iran. The same official, who declined to be named publicly due to the sensitivity of the issue, said Diskin's comments were ""both surprising and strange"" because he had worked under both Netanyahu and Barak, and sought to become Mossad director under their leadership. ""Are you saying these things because you didn't get the position?"" the official asked rhetorically, adding that Diskin's attack seemed more ""personal than policy."" Diskin, a widely respected former security official, also took the two Israeli leaders to task for mis-characterizing the possible effectiveness of a military strike against Iran and its nuclear program. He said the Israeli government presented ""a false view to the public on the Iranian bomb, as though acting against Iran would prevent a nuclear bomb. But attacking Iran will encourage them to develop a bomb all the faster."" It is not the first time a high-profile figure has criticized the Israeli government's handling of Iran. Meir Dagan, the former chief of Israel's spy agency, the Mossad, has been a frequent and vocal critic of talk about an Israel strike on Iran, famously calling it a ""stupid idea."" Israeli vice-premier and Likud party member Silvan Shalom told the Jerusalem Post that Diskin should not have spoken in public. ""I think that Diskin was wrong to say what he did, and that when he considers what he said he will realize that he was wrong,"" Shalom said. Diskin's blunt commentary follows controversial remarks by Israel's top general, who said Iran is led by ""very rational people"" and doesn't appear poised to build a nuclear bomb that would threaten his nation. Iran ""is going step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb,"" Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz told Israel's Haaretz newspaper in Wednesday editions. ""It hasn't yet decided whether to go the extra mile."" Those comments were in stark contrast to those of Netanyahu, who suggested to CNN that time is running out for Western sanctions on Iran to have a meaningful effect on Tehran's nuclear program. The sanctions ""are certainly taking a bite out of the Iranian economy,"" Netanyahu said in an interview broadcast Tuesday on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" But, he said, ""They haven't rolled back the Iranian program -- or even stopped it -- by one iota.""","NEW: Ehud Barak describes Yuval Diskin's comments as 'irresponsible'

"(CNN) -- With ticket sales closing in on $100 million, the surprise hit of the year is ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" a film about seven English retirees who travel to India to take up residence at the rundown Marigold Hotel, which, according to its misleading brochures, will provide them with inexpensive comfort in their remaining years. But what makes ""Marigold Hotel,"" which is directed by John Madden of ""Shakespeare in Love"" fame, far more interesting than its box-office success is how it has defied the patronizing reviews of critics --including those of The Times of India and The Telegraph in England -- who have categorized it as little more than entertainment for people in their 50s starring actors in their 70s. Indeed, how patronizing the critics have been is reflected in the fact that review after review, starting with ""Marigold Hotel"" stars, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench (both of whom are 77), has made a point of dwelling on the ages of the ensemble cast. The popularity of ""Marigold Hotel"" tells us that unlike the critics, today's audiences don't find the struggles of the old and middle-aged less worthy of their attention than those of the young. But the charm of the film isn't confined to its depiction of the elderly trying to make the most of the rest of their lives. At the heart of ""Marigold Hotel"" lies a compassion that contrasts starkly with the coldness the film's retirees experienced in the England they left behind. The youthful manager of the Marigold Hotel, played with comic brilliance by Dev Patel (the lead in ""Slumdog Millionaire""), may have misled his retirees about the quality of his hotel, but he has underplayed his own decency and enthusiasm. There is a long tradition in English literature of pointing up the failures of British society by contrasting life at home with life abroad. E. M. Forester's 1908 novel, ""A Room with a View,"" which in 1985 was successfully adapted for the screen, provided a searing critique of the stuffiness of Edwardian life by allowing its young heroine to find romance in Italy. ""Marigold Hotel,"" which is based on Deborah Moggach's 2004 novel, ""These Foolish Things,"" follows this same tradition, as it captures the English fascination with warm climates. In this case, however, the Forester novel with which ""Marigold Hotel"" has the most in common is his 1924 masterpiece, ""Passage to India."" In Forester's story it is the Indians, over whom the British then ruled, who show the greatest capacity for love and friendship. In ""Marigold Hotel,"" the English retirees find a gentleness in the city of Jaipur that was not present in their homeland. In contrast to the British of the 19th century, the retirees of ""Marigold Hotel"" are not out to extract fortunes from their new land. They are instead out to preserve dwindling incomes and make peace with their past. Not all of them succeed, but enough of them do to suggest modern India, even with its traffic jams and elephants and camels in the streets, is a land of opportunity: . Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a housekeeper who after years of service was fired from her job by the family she worked for, finds that in India she can get the hip replacement surgery she needs without waiting and, despite herself, she slowly loses the racial bigotry she brought with her. Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench), a widow whose husband has died, saddling her with debt that forces her to sell her home, gets employment helping out at an Indian call center and in the process frees herself from the condescending pity of her children. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson), a gay High Court judge, who left India full of shame when he brought his young Indian lover into disgrace, finds that he is welcomed back as an old friend. Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy), who has fled to India with his quarrelsome wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) because their daughter lost most of their savings in a failed start-up, realizes that he is better off when his wife leaves him and returns to England. The randy Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) and the even randier Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) learn that in India age is not the barrier it was in England to the sexual adventure they are seeking. Can these happy endings last? ""Marigold Hotel"" never provides a final answer just as it rarely allows tragedy to creep in. But the ""Marigold Hotel"" does not need to offer they-lived-happily-ever-after reassurance to succeed. It is enough that, thanks to their change in scenery, the film's central characters have refused to resign themselves to ending their lives in quiet despair. What in 1947 on the eve of independence India's first prime minister, Jawaharial Nehru, called his nation's ""Tryst with Destiny"" has become for the retirees of the ""Marigold Hotel"" a tryst with old age as a result of their new country and its people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Despite patronizing critics, ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is surprise hit movie of the year .

"(CNN) -- The Philippines Department of Tourism has a lot to boast about. The country has beautiful beaches, great scuba diving and a culture that is known for its hospitality. What it doesn't have is a lot of money for a global tourism campaign. Thankfully, the country's social media mad population is happy to help. In January, the government launched a campaign with the tagline ""It's More Fun in the Philippines,"" openly inviting the country's bloggers, tweeters and Facebook friends to come up with their own ads. ""We just opened another battlefront, which was the social media side and tapping into the fact that there are 27 million Filipinos on Facebook,"" says campaign creator David Guerrero. The response was resounding. Within hours #itsmorefuninthephilippines became the number one trending item on Twitter. Facebook pages filled with homemade ads popped up, exclaiming everything from ""Social Climbing, More Fun in the Philippines,"" to ""Angry Birds, More Fun in the Philippines."" Roland Benzon was one of many Filipinos who seized on the campaign with delight, creating his own Facebook album of ads. Within 24 hours, his work was shared by over 10,000 people. He says the democratic nature of the campaign inspired him. ""Usually it's top down,"" he says. ""The government does something and we just sit there passively reacting to it and voicing our opinions. Here it wasn't that way. We actually made the ads."" Read more: Why Philippines tourism is a tough sell . The use of crowd-sourcing did mean that not all the ads stuck to the positive messages the government hoped to convey. Ads sprung up with slogans like ""Poverty, More Fun in the Philippines,"" and ""Corruption, More Fun in the Philippines."" ""There is no way with a genuine people's campaign that you can control everything that people are going to say and everything is going to be the way you'd like it to be,"" says Guerrero. Still he feels the positive reception for the campaign has overwhelmed the negative. Tourism numbers to the Philippines are rising, though the country does have a long way to go. Fewer than four million people visited the country last year, compared with 19 million to Thailand and the industry has yet to become a tent pole for the broader economy. However visitor arrivals were up nearly 16% in the first two months of this year. One of the Philippines' greatest battles in attracting tourists will continue to be its poor infrastructure. Roads and airports across the country are in need of a major upgrade and tourists' complaints range from hassles with dishonest taxi drivers to less than savory toilets. The current government has said it is committed to upgrading the country's tourism infrastructure, allocating a chuck of money towards the cause in the 2012 budget. Those involved in the travel industry says such government support is necessary if the country wants to fully capitalize on the buzz from its tourism campaign. After all, it's one thing to promise people ""More Fun in the Philippines"" but another thing to deliver it.","The Philippines attracted around 4 million tourists last year .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Miss Universe organization announced Tuesday it is ending its ban on transgender contestants after coming under scrutiny recently when a Canadian competitor was told she would be disqualified because she was born male. Miss Universe officials insist the change is in spite of, not because of, legal threats from women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred made on behalf of contestant Jenna Talackova. ""We made the decision two days before we even heard that (Allred) was involved,"" pageant owner Donald Trump told CNN Monday. ""Had I known she was involved, maybe I wouldn't have made that decision because she's easy to beat."" Allred launched a blistering attack on Trump at a news conference a week ago, saying his pageant had no right to question Talackova's sexuality. ""She did not ask Mr. Trump to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male,"" Allred said. In a Twitter posting Monday, Trump called Allred a ""third rate lawyer"" who ""actually hurts Jenna."" ""Is Gloria a man or a woman????---- few men would know the answer to that one,"" Trump tweeted in a personal retort to Allred. Allred did not immediately respond to CNN's request for a response to Trump's attack. The Miss Universe Pageant announced last week that Talackova, 23, could compete provided ""she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions."" Allred had criticized that announcement, saying the conditions were ""ambigious."" Trump later said Talackova could compete without conditions, but stopped short of a permanent rule change. Miss Universe President Paula Shugart, in a statement released Tuesday, said the credit for lifting the ban should go to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), not Allred. ""The decision to include transgender women in our beauty competitions is a result of our ongoing discussions with GLAAD and not Jenna's legal representation, which if anything delayed the process,"" Shugart said. ""We have a long history of supporting equality for all women, and this was something we took very seriously."" Shugart joined GLAAD in a joint announcement Tuesday that the Miss Universe Organization ""is close to finalizing an official policy change that will allow women who are transgender to participate in its beauty competitions."" Discussions between the pageant and GLAAD began last month after news reports that Talackova had been disqualified from the Miss Canada Universe competition after winning a regional title, the joint statement said. The resulting change opens this fall's 2013 pageant season to transgender women, it said. ""For more than two weeks, the Miss Universe Organization and Mr. Trump made it clear to GLAAD that they were open to making a policy change to include women who are transgender,"" said GLAAD spokesman Herndon Graddick. ""We appreciate that (Trump) and his team responded swiftly and appropriately,"" Graddick said. Talackova, a 6-foot-1-inch blond Canadian, underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago. In a 2010 interview, she said she knew she was a girl at age 4. She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19. She won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for Canada's national title, but she was then told the Miss Canada Universe pageant in Toronto on May 19 was only open to ""naturally born females."" ""I am a woman,"" Talackova said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in Allred's conference room last week. ""I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust.""","The pageant group says the decision came before Gloria Allred made legal threats .

"(CNN) -- A Russian cargo ship reported to be carrying arms to Syria is turning back, Britain's top diplomat said Tuesday. ""I am pleased that the ship that was reported to be carrying arms to Syria has turned back apparently towards Russia,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the House of Commons. U.S. officials have said that the Russian operator Femco's cargo ship, MV Alaed, was headed for Syria with attack helicopters and munitions for the al-Assad regime from the port of Kaliningrad. The vessel had been off the north coast of Scotland, according to ship tracking data. Hague commented on a ship during questions about the fighting in Syria during a wide-ranging House of Commons question-and-answer session about foreign policy. He didn't name the vessel. Syrian opposition uniting to topple al-Assad . He mentioned the status of the ship when asked whether ""every peaceful diplomatic effort is being made to prevent the Syrian government from getting its hands on weapons that can be used against its own people."" Hague also cited a European Union arms embargo on Syria. ""We discourage anyone else from supplying arms to Syria,"" he said. ""We have had discussions with Russia about that specifically."" He answered a question about how to approach the issue of chemical weaponry in Syria. Hague said that such weapons are a concern and that he's ""confident that the international community"" would pursue any action to deal with the issue, but he wouldn't elaborate. The Standard Club, a UK marine insurer, said it has stopped coverage for the Alaed.

""We were made aware of the allegations that the Alaed was carrying munitions destined for Syria and have already informed the ship owner that their insurance cover ceased automatically in view of the nature of the voyage,"" the company told CNN on Monday. Femco declined to comment to CNN on Tuesday. The Alaed was proceeding southwest at a speed of 12 knots and was some 40 miles off the Scottish port of Thurso at 9 a.m. ET Monday. The data showed that it left Kaliningrad 10 days ago with a final destination of Vladivostok on July 24. On Friday, U.S. officials said they were tracking a Russian military cargo ship, the Nikolay Filchenov, also thought to be bound for Syria. U.S. intelligence believes the Russians are sending the ship to help fortify a Russian naval base in Syria as the situation in the country continues to spiral out of control, Pentagon officials told CNN on Friday. RIA Novosti, Russia's state-run news agency, denied the report Monday, citing a source in the Black Sea Fleet who said the Nikolay Filchenov remained docked at its base in Sevastopol. Syria has been engulfed in widespread unrest for more than 15 months. Thousands have died after a crackdown by the government of President Bashar al-Assad on peaceful protesters stoked an anti-regime uprising.

""At no stage have we been advocating a military intervention, but we do recognize the situation is so grave and deteriorating so quickly and such crimes are being committed, we cannot take any options off the table at the moment.""
