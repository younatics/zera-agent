And now comedienne Miranda Hart's father, David Hart Dyke, has opened up to relive the ordeal. He was the captain of the ship, which was shot down by Argentinian Skyhawk jets on 25 May, 1982 and sank to the bottom of the South Atlantic. Trauma: David Hart Dyke, the father of famous comedienne Miranda Hart (right) displays the facial scars sustained during the fire which sank the HMS Coventry . David, now 72, only just managed to survive the destruction of the destroyer, while 19 out of the crew of 300 died in the tragedy. Hart Dyke has now discussed all about the experience and relived how he was commanding the ship when radar screens showed that there were four Argentinian planes heading towards HMS Coventry. Ordeal: David Hart Dyke was the captain of the destroyer, which sank, killing 19 crewmembers, when Argentinian jets shot it down on 25 May, 1982, seen here with a 10-year-old Miranda and family . He knew when 'they were taking off from the runways in Argentina' but he soon lost track of them and had to face a tricky decision, which he still dwells on to this day. David told the Daily Express: 'Things happen quickly. On my left was the air warfare officer saying ""get the missile out"" and a chap on my right saying ""I think they are to the north-west"".' He eventually decided to not send out any Sea Harriers and opted to deploy missiles instead because he 'wasn't sure the Harriers would get there on time'. The ship was eventually hit by a bomb and as it sank Hart Dyke was the last to leave the destroyer, which had been deployed by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to help liberate the Falklands following Argentina's invasion. He recounts: 'It was black, with people on fire... I was momentarily stunned and came round seconds later... 'By the time I got up it was all happening. I walked down the ship's side - it was almost horizontal at that point'. David swam to the nearest raft and managed to survive. But while it was a terrifying ordeal which still has its place in history, his daughter Miranda, who was just 10 when her father was sent to command the Coventry during the conflict, doesn't remember it having much of an impact on her. The funnywoman and TV star insists 'the impact' was 'minimal' and she even just asked her mum for a flapjack when she was told about his lucky escape. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent HMS Coventry to try and liberate the Falklands after Argentina invaded, but the ship was sunk in 1982 . Dyke Hart has since released a book on his experience, Four Weeks In May, but he refuses to ever go and visit the Falklands. And while he will attend a 30th anniversary dinner to commemorate the disaster next Friday, he's adamant it will be his last. David now spends his time painting, gardening and playing tennis while he enjoys his eldest daughter's work on screen.","Comedienne's father captained ship which was sunk by Argentinian Skyhawk .

Marc Kirvin leaves Manchester Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to stealing the handbag of a woman knocked down and decapitated by a lorry . A sick sneak thief dubbed 'The Vulture' was jailed today for stealing a hit and run victim's handbag with £1,600 cash inside - as she lay decapitated in the road. Marc Kirvin, 46, picked up the bag from the ground and and made off with it just four minutes after 62-year-old Sawari Ashraf stepped into the path of a 40 tonne lorry. He later split the cash with a pal. Kirvin was arrested after police investigating the tragedy publicised CCTV pictures taken from a bus of him grabbing the black bag with gold clasp and also the dead woman's shoes. Officers acting on a tip off went to house to find a haul of cash on his mantlepiece. Kirvin told police he had been looking for work when they saw the bag and had taken the money because of 'greed' and added that he had planned to use the cash to take his wife on holiday. He said he had no idea Mrs Ashraf was lying dead in the road. Today Kirvin looked shocked as he was jailed for four months after he admitted theft at Manchester magistrates court. District judge Wendy Lloyd said: 'It is clear that when you ran into the road you had no idea that the bag and shoes belonged to the woman, however you knew the bag belonged to someone and its theft was bound to cause misery to someone . 'The fact is the bag and content would have been of sentimental value to the family of the deceased, since there were personal items inside.' Mrs Ashraf, a grandmother, died instantly when she was in collision with the articulated lorry as it was being driven through the rush hour. The ensuing impact at 9.54am on March 29 in Longsight, Manchester, propelled her handbag and shoes up to 130m from the rest of her body. The grisly nature of the incident led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick pictures of the gruesome scene and posting them on Twitter. Opportunist: Kirvin clutches the handbag containing £1,600 as he approaches one of the dead woman's shoes lying on the ground . Grasping: Kirvin reaches down for Mrs Ashraf's handbag, which was thrown some 130 metres from her body after she was hit by the lorry . Shameless: Marc Kirvin, 46, is seen on CCTV carrying the decapitated woman's shoes. A witness said a man calmly picked up the footwear and handbag - which where catapulted 100 yards from her body . But as police were called to the crash . scene, Kirvin, of Altrincham, who was travelling as a passenger in a . flat-back truck got out of the vehicle when he noticed the bag. Miss Jennifer Baines, prosecuting . said: 'Due to the impact, Mrs Ashraf's body was propelled 130 metres . down the road. Four minutes later we see Mr Kirvin diving in front of . the bus in order to pick up the handbag and shoes. 'The co-accused were unaware that her . body was 100m away from her belongings and around 130m away from the . initial point of collision.' Sarwari Ashraf, 62, was killed instantly on when she was struck by the lorry in Manchester . She said a significant aggravating . feature was that because he took the handbag, which had several . identification cards inside, it meant there was a delay in identifying . her body. This left her family waiting an agonising 12 hours to find out if their mother and grandmother had been taken from them. She added: 'She was of Islam faith and . it is extremely important that the body is buried within 24 hours. She . said it was only when crime stoppers received intelligence that police . were led to Kirvin's door step. 'He wasn't at home and when his wife . called him, it was at that point he tells her what he had done. In . interview he said he had seen a bag which looked like it had been driven . over many times. He identified the driver of the flat pack truck . Terence Gatter, 66. The CCTV shows that as they stopped at . the junction Mr Kirvin exited and proceeded to pick up the bag and . shoes, which had been in the middle of the junction. By this time the . victim had died from her injuries. A purse, disability badge, national insurance number, mobile phone, house keys and around £1,600 cash was inside the handbag. In a statement, Mrs Ashraf's family, . said the theft of the bag created a prolonged anguish and suffering to . them and they even had to change their loved-one's house locks. She read out a family statement saying: 'Our family cannot express the stress, anxiety, heart-ache and sadness this has caused.' In a statement, Kirvin's wife Alison . said he felt guilty taking the money and was going to spend the money on . their children at Christmas - but she said she had eventually persuaded . him to hand it in to the police, which he had planned to do. Search: Forensic officers searching a logistics lorry on a industrial park in Newton Heath, Manchester . Scene: Police Officers at the scene where the remains of a woman's body were found in the middle of the road . Kirvin told police he had been looking . for work when they saw the bag and had taken the money 'because of . greed' and he had planned to take his wife away on holiday, but knew she . would be suspicious. Gatter said they were driving along . and saw this bag in the road and simply deduced that a person had left . it on the roof of their car and drove off. Gatter initially denied splitting the . cash - even thought it was later found he had used it to pay for £400 . council tax and £118 car tax. He told police: 'I'm not like that, . neither is Marc. There's nothing in my house, I would not know about any . money. In mitigation, defence lawyer Kerry . Bell said her client had suffered health difficulties in the past, . including a stroke and being diagnosed with epilepsy, which led to attempt suicide several times. Miss Bell said her client was . co-operative with police and had handed over the money in his . possession. She urged the judge to look at it as simply a handbag theft. She added: 'He has seen a handbag on . the street and he has taken it. There was no knowledge of the accident, . he hadn't seen anything. There are no police officers in attendance. 'It was an opportunist offence, there . was no targeting. There has been a return of the money. It was . completely out of character for this man. Obviously he feels remorse and . has felt remorse from the outset.' 'Mr Kirvin cannot express in words how . much sorry and guilt he feels to the family of the lady. This is a man . that hasn't been in trouble for a long period of time. He has shown . remorse from the outset and fully co-operative from the outset. Sentencing of Gatter was adjourned until July 10. After the crash police arrested a . lorry driver, aged 40, on suspicion of causing death by careless driving . but he was freed on bail pending further inquiries.","Marc Kirvin, 46, grabbed shoes and handbag after woman was killed by lorry .

In . the days leading up to the 18th birthday party police had issued a . warning about potentially lethal 'pink ecstasy' tablets known as Dr . Death which were being circulated around Liverpool. Police are investigating Rose Farley's death after claims her drink was spiked at a party on Friday . Although . police are investigating the claims that Rose’s drink may have been . spiked they have stressed they are two separate inquiries. On . Thursday this week at the youngster’s funeral at St Mary’s Church in . West Derby, her parents Chris, 43, and Lyn, 38, issued a statement . describing their daughter as a 'bubbly, beautiful, vivacious and popular . young woman'. The statement added: 'The support for our family has been overwhelming and the love shown for Rose is so comforting. 'The . funeral gives us a chance to remember how she enriched so many lives.

Enjoy it while it lasts: A satellite image from Dundee University shows an almost completely cloudless Britain - but the conditions are not expected to last beyond the middle of this week . First the heatwave, now the downpour. Britain baked in glorious sunshine over the weekend, as this satellite image showed the entire UK basking in completely cloudless skies. But forecasters predicted that the unbroken blue skies across Britain were too good to last - for the South East at least. The Met Office today issued a severe weather warning for the area saying people can expect potential torrential rain and claps of thunder combined with a steamy top temperature of 28C. Cloud cover is also expected to sweep in by the end of the week thanks to a pattern of cool air coming in from Scotland. The rest of the country will be cooler than yesterday but dry, a Met Office forecaster said adding that the thundery weather will head to the Midlands and Northern Ireland tomorrow. Elsewhere it will be sunny but cloudy but further north it might be wise to pack a jumper as the temperature is set to plummet to 14C. It's due to be more unsettled on Wednesday across much of the country and cooler with temperatures in the low 20s for most parts. At least there's some good news for the upcoming Jubilee weekend: it's going to be dry for most places. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said weekend temperatures would be 'not too exciting' but 'pleasant enough'. He added there was a small chance of showers on the eastern side but most areas would remain dry. Today fields of gold shimmered in the Spring sunshine as the biggest buttercup meadows in the UK bloomed in the heat wave. The top temperatures were spread around the country, as Santon Downham in Suffolk experienced a sweltering 27.7C, as well as Sheffield. In early afternoon, parts of London were also basking in heat of 26.3C. A carpet of yellow is now covering the ancient plains in Hatfield Forest, Essex, thanks to days of warm sunny weather, which have made it a 'perfect year' for buttercups. Visitors have been flocking to see the spectacular sight as half a billion flowers fill 400 acres of natural pasture. 'It is a sea of yellow at the moment and the buttercups look amazing in the sunshine,' said Henry Bexley, countryside manager for the National Trust in Essex and South Suffolk. 'We have around half a billion buttercups here as the wood pasture provides the optimum growing conditions. 'We do not use pesticides or fertiliser, it’s a totally natural pasture which is what produces such a brilliant show of flowers. 'They are a sun-loving flower so the heat wave has brought them out in force and they are looking at their best this week.' He said the wet weather in April had helped the flowers to flourish on the plains and the high temperatures over the last week have brought on the golden spectacle. 'It’s the best time of the year to see the buttercups and we have had lots of visitors coming to see them,' he added. 'They look amazing, but sadly will only be around for another couple of weeks.' Golden wonder: In Upper Swaledale walkers were treated to meadows of wild buttercups filling the patchwork of fields in the North Yorkshire Dale .

Alan Turing, the Second World War codebreaker widely regarded as the father of modern computing, may not have committed suicide but died as a result of an accident, an academic has claimed. Evidence gathered after the death of the scientist from cyanide poisoning at the age of 41 in 1954 was 'overlooked' and he could have died as a result of inhaling the poison he used in amateur experiments rather than deliberately ingesting it, according to Professor Jack Copeland. Professor Copeland, director of the The Turing Archive for the History of Computing and author of a new biography of the academic, spoke as events took place around the country to celebrate the centenary of the under-appreciated scientific genius's birth. 'From the records I have been able to obtain, it seems to me very obvious that the inquest was conducted in a very superficial way,' he said. 'The coroner didn't really investigate the evidence at all, he just jumped to the conclusion that he committed suicide. 'He seems to have been very biased from the statements in newspapers at the time.' The coroner in Turing's death case ruled he committed suicide 'while the balance of his mind was disturbed', adding: 'In a man of his type, one never knows what his mental processes are going to do next.' Turing, who was gay, was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952. To avoid prison, he agreed to receive injections of oestrogen for a year, which were intended to reduce his libido in a process known as 'chemical castration.' Copeland, a Professor at the University of Canterbury Christchurch in New Zealand, will talk about Turing's death at an event in Oxford tonight. He said medical evidence suggested Turing died from inhaling cyanide rather than drinking or ingesting it. Tribute: An animated representation of an Enigma decoding machine appeared as the 'doodle' on Google's homepage, in honour of the computer scientist . He said police reported a strong smell of cyanide coming from Turing's lab, where he used it in amateur experiments. He called for the inquest to be re-opened. 'It would be a terrific thing to do. I think the nation owes it to Turing, in the Second World War he saved the nation.' Perhaps best known today for his part in breaking the German Enigma code, Turing was by that time already established as a mathematician of extraordinary capability. During his time at King's College, Cambridge, he devised the Turing Machine, a mathematical model that went on to become one of the cornerstones of computer science, aged just 22. Google's homepage 'doodle' is today an animated representation of an Enigma decoding machine, in honour of the computer scientist. And he trended worldwide on Twitter, with Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, writing: 'Happy 100th Birthday Alan Turing.' Former chess prodigy and world champion Garry Kasparov will attend a conference on Turing . In 2009, Mr Brown issued an apology for the treatment of Turing after he was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952. Mr Brown said at the time: 'The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely.' Today will see scientists and other Turing fans gather in Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge, among other places, to celebrate his work as part of Alan Turing Year. A spokeswoman for Alan Turing Year, a campaign to celebrate his work during the whole of 2012, said: 'Turing was godfather of computer science and (an) artificial intelligence pioneer, as well as someone who saved literally millions of lives through his codebreaking work.' Plaques in his honour will be erected in Cambridge, Manchester and at his childhood home, Baston Lodge in St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex. Dr James Grime, from Cambridge University's Millennium Maths Project, who regularly tours schools with an original Enigma machine, said: 'In its purest form, mathematics is the search for truth, and Turing was one of the most important contributors to this search. It's fantastic that his life is being celebrated.' Former chess prodigy and world champion Garry Kasparov is due to attend Manchester's Alan Turing Centenary Conference on Monday. A campaign led by Iain Stewart, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South, is seeking an official pardon for Turing's conviction and there is also a campaign to have him appear on the next issue of the £10 note. The campaign on the Government e-petition website, which had more than 17,500 signatories this afternoon, says: 'Alan Turing is a national hero. 'His contribution to computer science, and hence to the life of the nation and the world, is incalculable. The ripple-effect of his theories on modern life continues to grow, and may never stop.'","Alan Turing could have died by inhaling poison he used in experiments rather than deliberately ingesting it, professor suggests .

It's not all shaking hands and cutting ribbons for the Queen. The monarch is fond of a drink or two and, like her mother before her, she adores Dubonnet. The fortified wine with herbs and quinine was invented in 1846, the result of a competition by the French Government to find a way of encouraging French Legionnaires to drink bitter quinine by disguising it in alcohol. Meant as a punchy cure for malaria, it fast became the upper classes' aperitif of choice. The Queen Mother drank it every day - mixed three parts Dubonnet, seven parts gin, with a twist of lemon - and was even known to take a small bottle with her on journeys, 'just in case.' The Queen inherited her passion and enjoys a Dubonnet and gin every day before lunch, and reportedly one before bed too. Candid photos of her . taken in the grounds of Balmoral enjoying lunch al fresco reveal her little folly - a glass of deep orange . Dubonnet and gin by her side. But . times have changed since Queen Elizabeth was first charmed by Dubonnet. The burgeoning popularity of wine and flavourless, easy-to-mix spirits . like vodka have seen off traditional aperitifs, meaning the Monarch is . in the minority when she sips on her daily Dubonnet. Indeed, the drink had all but fallen off . the nation's bars for good - until now. With the Jubilee fast approaching, our . renewed passion for all things British is gaining pace by the minute. Couple that with our revitalised affection for the Royals and the natural charm and value of all things with heritage, and it's easy to see why Dubonnet is making a . comeback. Just the one: The Queen enjoying a Dubonnet and gin in the grounds of Balmoral . 'It's a celebration of all things British,' says Adam Davison, head barman of Kitchen Joel Antunes at Embassy Mayfair. 'It's really made a comeback for the Jubilee season. It's captured the attention of the next generation - I'm going to serve it this weekend at my sister Danielle's wedding. Like Aperol or a Negroni, it's the ideal aperitif.' At Embassy Mayfair, Dubonnet is given an update with new bedfellows like Pimm's, rum or vodka, or with its old friend gin. An intriguing ingredient, it gives classic cocktails oomph and modern mixes an air of accomplished elegance. Just in time for the Jubilee, Adam has reinvented Dubonnet drinks - proving that the Queen, and her mother, have impeccable taste.

Bank customers should be charged a monthly fee on current accounts even if they are in credit, according to a finance industry watchdog. Charges of £15 a month could be applied, allowing a fixed number of cash machine withdrawals, direct debits, standing orders and cheques. Any transactions beyond these caps would attract extra charges. The idea comes from Andrew Bailey, executive director of the Bank of England and the chief executive-elect of the Government's Prudential Regulatory Authority, set up to police the banks. Free banking: Andrew Bailey described it as a 'myth,' as it distorts the supply of banking services . He said up-front fees should form part of a radical shake-up of the current system in which the 'myth' of free banking is perpetuated. He suggested that the fees would replace a regime of  back-door charges which banks use to make money from ordinary customers. The fact that banks pay little or no interest on credit balances in current accounts amounts to a stealth charge . Decision makers: Andrew Bailey, right, is pushing for an end to free banking in Britain. Chancellor George Osborne, left, faces a tough decision over whether he approves of the suggested charges . Separately, customers are stung with high interest rates and penalty charges on credit cards, loans and mortgages. Mr Bailey suggested one benefit of the fees would be that banks would be less inclined to rip off customers through the mis-selling of products and  services such as payment protection insurance. Natwest Select Silver £8 . HSBC Advance £12.95 (£6 for 6 months) Barclays Current Plus £6.50 . Alliance & Leicester Premier 50 £10 . Santander 1,2,3 £2 . Lloyd'sTSB Silver £9.95 . Halifax Ultimate Reward £10 . * Monthly charges . In a speech to the Westminster Business Forum, he said it would be difficult for banks to introduce monthly charges 'without appearing to collude'. Consequently, he said, the Government or its agencies may need to take action. 'It may require intervention in the public interest, not least because it is a way to encourage greater competition,' he said. But Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie MP said: 'It's vital that George Osborne's new  regulator is on the side of ordinary savers, who trust the banks with their money and allow the banks to use their deposits to make a profit to cover the costs of their accounts.' Official customer body Consumer Focus said: 'What mustn't happen is that consumers end up with the worst of both worlds – paying for accounts but still enduring unfair charges, opaque products, mis-selling and poor customer service.' Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'It's a complete myth that banking is free now – consumers pay more than £9billion a year in fees and lost interest on their accounts. 'The idea that if banks charged more, they would stop trying to mis-sell other financial products is completely unfounded.'","Bank of England chief recommends £15 per month fees for current accounts .

"June Shannon and her daughter Alana Thompson, aka Honey Boo Boo, star in the reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo . June, known as the coupon queen, wants to get rid of the youngster's beloved playmate because it disturbs her daily beauty sleep . It was also revealed last week that the mother was arrested in 2008 for 'theft of child support payments' and contempt of court . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:27 EST, 20 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:30 EST, 20 August 2012 . Her 'redneck' parents may have been accused of child abuse in March but it seems the show must go on for young pageant star Honey Boo Boo. In the latest episode of her reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, the six-year-old is seen gushing over her pet pig named Glitzy. But sadly, the new clip for the upcoming episode, which airs on Wednesday night on TLC, shows her mother June telling the camera that she wants to remove her daughter's beloved playmate from their McIntyre, Georgia home. Scroll down for video . Best friends: Honey Boo Boo (left) and her pet pig Glitzy (right) are threatened to be torn apart in a new episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Her mother June is sick of the pig waking her up in the morning . Alana, who was the break-out star of the controversial reality series Toddlers & Tiaras, is seen petting her pig on her bed in the clip seen on Radaronline.com. She tells it: 'We're going to be the prettiest girls at the pageant and there's no way we can't win cause I've got me a pig, how about that?' The youngster, who is clearly besotted by her pet, then places a tiny tiara on the animal's head, calling Glitzy her 'baby'. June, who is known as the coupon queen and was arrested on January 3, 2008 for theft and contempt of court, is then shown telling the cameras how infuriated she is by the animal's early morning sounds. Beauty queen: Glitzy the pig (above) is labeled Alana's baby and the youngster is seen talking to it on her bed . Unimpressed: June, the little girl's mother, is seen telling the camera that she is sick of Glitzy's noises . She says: 'I think it's cute to see Glitzy and her play together but... hello! I'm asleep I ain't got time to feed you're a** but if I didn't, it would holler from 5:30am to 10 o'clock.' The mother-of-four, who was allegedly visited by child services in March of this year, is seen watching the pig as it squeals from inside the laundry. The look on the 33-year-old's face can only be described as disgust. A similarly unhappy expression was seen upon June's face when she posed for a mugshot in 2008. The mugshot surfaced last week as well as details of her arrest which took place in Henry County, Georgia. According to Starcasm, there are also additional court reports which show that she was the defendant in two child support cases around the same time, which may explain the theft charges, although it is not entirely clear. Class act: June Shannon, Honey Boo Boo's mother, was arrested in 2008 for theft and contempt of court. Her mug shot (above) just days after she and her husband Mike Thompson were accused of child abuse . It came just days after learning that child services made an unannounced visit to her and husband Mike Thompson's family home in March. The coupon queen was arrested in a location that is more than halfway to Atlanta when measured from her current home, suggesting that she may have been trying to escape police. The family were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer. A source told the magazine that authorities who made the visit 'found reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for June convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'. The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mr Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner. Controversy: The parents of pageant star Honey Boo Boo (front) were accused of child abuse according to a new report. June (behind the youngster) and Mike (to the right) and her three sisters, are shown . Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has has also showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using discount coupons. The source who spoke with The National Enquirer added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbors.' The initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It attracted 2.2million viewers. Although June sparked outrage back in January when she was seen on Toddlers & Tiaras feeding Alana 'Go Go Juice', a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull, the authorities visited the family after catching wind of an online video that showed Alana dancing for dollars in a bar. Secret weapon: The youngster, who was first seen on Toddlers & Tiaras, was fed 'Go Go Juice' by June. The mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull was offered to the little girl after she had consumed 15 packets of sugar . Crazy: Once she had consumed the Juice, she was seen spinning around on the floor, her energy heightened . Loud and proud: The pageant queen showed off her flabby belly on a previous episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. The child has been shown to feast on roadkill and ample sugary sweets on several occasions . The video, which can still be found on YouTube, was not filmed by the network however showed Alana in a darkened room, dancing atop of table as colored lights flash around her. June defended her daughter's actions by explaining that Alana had been dancing in a college bar, not a sleazy one. The 'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in . right now!' Beauty pageant insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. Lewd: June was seen in the debut episode of her new reality series, grinding up against a young man . Stealing the limelight: June (left) has arguably become more of a focus in the reality show than her beauty pageant star daughter (right). The pair were seen on CNN earlier this month promoting the new TLC show . Describing how . the drink made her feel, Alana said: 'Go Go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.' June has stolen much of the limelight away from her daughter in the new reality series. During its debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit. She has also been filmed taking her family to the supermarket to help her shop using discount coupons and take Alana to their local food auction, June's favourite weekly activity, in order to bid on what appeared to be sugary donuts. She has also admitted that she is obsessed with 'couponing', labeling it 'better than sex' in a teaser for tonight's new episode of the reality series. The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, continued: 'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction.'","June Shannon and her daughter Alana Thompson, aka Honey Boo Boo, star in the reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo .

Fearless Jhonathan Florez, 29, leapt from 37,265ft then flew like a bird reaching speeds of up to 100mph using a wing suit. Jhonathan's high altitude stunt smashed the record for the longest ever wing suit jump, clocking in at nine minutes and six seconds. Scroll down for video .

The Colombian born stuntman also claimed the record for greatest horizontal distance flown in a wing suit, covering 16.315 miles as he battled through temperatures of -45C. Jhonathan also bagged the record for the greatest absolute distance flown in a wing suit of 17.520 miles and the highest ever wingsuit jump. He admitted he planned to take a break from his daredevil stunts - because they terrify his wife. Jhonathan, who lives in Florida with wife Caci, 28, said: 'My wife is not to keen on me doing them.

He spent months training for his record breaking flight and had to wear oxygen masks to breath as he started so high up.

'You have to be strong enough to be able to manoeuvre your body and I was up their for a long time. 'I have been doing jumps for quite a long time but it can still be quite terrifying. This jump was particularly hard because I was up there for so long.' Jhonathan, who is originally from the Colombian city Medellin, made the record jump in an Apache XRW suit which costs £1,200. It is made from nylon and included a GPS tracking system and special thermals to protect from the extreme cold at high altitudes.

But Vikki Taylor found herself in a rather awkward position after her father-in-law was called to help when she went into labour. Stephen Wilson, 61, was called to step in when she gave birth in the hallway of her home and had to use the laces from his son Simon's trainers to help deliver the child. New born: Vikki Taylor Wilson pictured with her son Isaac, who was born on the back room floor with the help of her father in law Stephen Wilson, who used the lace from a trainer to cut the umbilical cord . Sudden: Baby Isaac was born on the hall floor after his mother Vikki had just four contractions . Mrs Taylor Wilson was alone at home when she went into labour but husband Simon feared he wouldn't be able to get to her in time and called his father to help. After four contractions, the baby arrived and Mr Wilson used laces from Simon's trainers to tie the umbilical chord before cutting it. Mrs Taylor Wilson, 28, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, said: 'I woke up in the morning with a bit of tummy ache and felt a bit groggy but thought nothing of it as I had been experiencing that throughout my pregnancy. 'My husband had gone to work so I was on my own. Just after 11am I had a shooting pain in my tummy and thought it could be a contraction. I rang Simon and said ""I think I am having the baby, you need to come home now""' 'He said he would, but he works 25 miles away in Hull, and called my father-in-law, Stephen Wilson, who lives about 10 minutes away to come and wait with me.'

Ms Wilson went upstairs to get dressed and had another contraction within two minutes. 'I thought ""that was quick"", but I managed to put on a pair of Scunthorpe United shorts and a t-shirt,' she said.

Baby Isaac was handed to her while Stephen went upstairs to get a towel to wrap the newborn in to keep him warm. Although Mrs Taylor Wilson and her father-in-law were thrown in at the deep end with the unexpected birth, he received step-by-step guidance on the phone from the ambulance service. 'She told him he needed to tie the cord to stop the blood supply and cut it,' said Ms Wilson . 'My husband had some new trainers nearby so Steve used the laces to tie the cord before he cut it. I was so glad he was there. I was in shock. The whole birth happened in 15 minutes. It didn’t feel real and it was like an out-of-body experience.' Mr Wilson, 61, a full-time carer to his wife, said the birth experience last month pushed him out of his comfort zone. 'When I arrived at the house all I could hear was screaming so I ran into the house to find Vikki on the floor,' he said. 'She said to me ‘I think the baby’s head is out’ so I told her to sit down and to push. After he was born I cleaned his mouth and rang the ambulance. She then talked me through how to cut the cord. 'I have never delivered a baby before but there was no time to think. Natural instinct was all I had. I stayed calm throughout and thankfully it was all over quickly.'

"PUBLISHED: . 18:26 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 25 October 2012 . A British tourist was banned from leaving Egypt after being mistaken for an international antiques smuggler who had the same name. Andrew May, 30, was held at gun point by armed security officers as he and girlfriend Julia Rowe, 28, waited to board a flight home from the resort of Hurghada. The confused couple had just checked into the airport at the end of their week-long break and were sitting in the departure lounge when they were arrested and threatened with jail on September 28. Home safely: Andrew May from Corby who was detained in Egypt, accused of smuggling Egyptian artifacts on his way back home from holiday . Eventually they learned that Egyptian authorities were looking for a man also named Andrew May who was suspected of smuggling hundreds of priceless artefacts out of the country. Speaking yesterday, Andrew, from Corby, Northamptonshire, said: 'I was the third Andrew May to be prevented from leaving Egypt. 'At the airport it was a nightmare. There were people shouting and we couldn’t understand what was going on. 'I kept telling myself that this was clearly a mistake and someone would sort it out soon. 'I was asked to sign papers stating that I’d agreed to stay in Egypt. Holiday nightmare: Mr May, 30, was held at gun point by armed security officers as he and girlfriend Julia Rowe, 28, waited to board a flight home from the resort of Hurghada . 'I was told it was either that or I would be taken to a prison in Cairo.' Remarkably, while they were being held in custody, fellow Brit, who was also Andrew May, 54, and his wife Angela, 52, met them and explained they too had been held in custody. The couple, who live in Cornwall, had also been kept in Egypt for two weeks after officers stopped them minutes before they were due to fly home from Luxor. Andrew added: 'While we were being held another Andrew May and his wife, from Cornwall, were brought to us to explain the situation. 'They had been kept in Egypt for two weeks and were in a terrible state. 'They were able to give me numbers for a lawyer and a contact at the British Embassy. 'They were going home but our ordeal was just beginning.' Relaxing break: Mr May had been holidaying in the resort of Hurghada before he ran into trouble at the airport . Andrew was forced to pay a lawyer £1,000 cash while the mix-up was resolved and says the ordeal has cost him £3,000 with additional hotel and travel bills. He said: 'It was terrible waiting each day to see if we could fly home. 'When we were eventually told we could return to Britain, Thomson charged my girlfriend and I £8 each for seats on a coach to Luxor where we caught a plane home. 'I’ll be writing letters to complain. It was a terrifying situation to be in. 'What if the same thing had happened to an elderly couple. 'Each day we waited and waited for clearance to go home, worrying and spending money we couldn’t afford. Our families back home were worried too.' A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the issue and we are liaising with the Egyptian authorities.' Earlier this month Andrew and Angela May were stopped from leaving Egypt for two weeks. They were forced to drive to Cairo and hire lawyers and an interpreter - with bills costing £2,500 on top of their £1,500 trip. Father-of-two Andrew, who is a fork-lift truck driver, said: 'It was bedlam when I went through passport control. 'They said, ‘There’s a no fly against your name’ - and took our luggage off the plane. 'Initially they said I was suspected of causing riots. 'Then it transpired they were looking for a man called Andrew May who has been stealing Egyptian artefacts. It was ridiculous.' Angela added: 'The first two weeks were fabulous. We did everything I dreamed of. But this spoilt it. 'I wondered where the hell it would go. There has been no apology.'","Andrew May, 30, was held at gun point by armed security officers as he and girlfriend Julia Rowe, 28, waited to board a flight home from Hurghada .

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson And James Hore . UPDATED: . 19:09 EST, 22 October 2011 . Winner: Jo Wheatley, who won the Great British Bake Off, told producers of the show that her husband was in jail . Jo Wheatley may have deserved her victory in this year’s Great British Bake Off but she was, in many ways, a most unlikely winner. Her cupcakes were deemed ‘sublime’ and her limoncello and white chocolate croquembouche ‘outstandingly delicious’, but such was Jo’s timid, unassuming nature that no one thought she would battle through to the final of the TV cooking show, let alone win it. Perhaps least of all  the executives at the BBC. While four-and-a- half million viewers cheered on the 42-year-old mother of three who ‘just wanted to do something for myself’, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the show’s producers were presented with a small problem. For the winner of The Great British Bake Off – a celebration of all things homely and innocent – is married to a man who is in prison for his part in a £60 million money-laundering operation. On April 20, 2010, at Southwark Crown Court, Richard Wheatley, 44, was sentenced to seven years after earlier pleading guilty to conspiracy with others to conceal, convert and transfer proceeds of crime. The money, alleged to have come from drug trafficking, was laundered through a money exchange. So Jo’s victory left the BBC with something of a dilemma. The Great British Bake Off was the surprise hit of the summer and ordinarily the  winner would be wheeled out for any number of interviews to promote it. One Corporation insider told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This was the second series and it has really taken off. The BBC is delighted. ‘The big thing now is branded television – programmes such as Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing which have a clear identity and lots of associated merchandise. ‘The Great British Bake Off is perfect for the BBC. They’re already planning series three. The ratings have been great and the cookery book that goes with the show went to number one in the non-fiction chart.’ But nearly three weeks after the final on October 4, Jo has been conspicuous by her absence. So was her husband throughout the series. In pre-recorded segments filmed at the family’s home in Essex, there  was no mention of Mr Wheatley. The couple’s three sons – Billy, 24, Jesse, 21, and Dylan, 16 – were filmed playing cricket in the garden and were interviewed around the scrubbed pine kitchen table. They also attended the garden party, celebrating the final, held in the grounds of Valentines Mansion and Gardens in Ilford, Essex, where the Bake Off was filmed. For Jo – a sweet, shy woman – it must have been enormously difficult knowing that her husband was in prison while she was on TV in front of millions, baking Battenberg cakes. Criminal: Richard Wheatley, husband of bake off winner Jo Wheatley, is a poker player known as 'The Bear' . He is now in jail over a £60m money laundering racket . And nor has it become any easier now the series is over. She hasn’t given any interviews, just one cookery demonstration in which she showed  a writer how to make her favourite cookies. Jo made a fleeting reference to her husband – the childhood sweetheart she married when she was 17 – admitting that he had been jailed for ‘fraud’ 18 months ago but she refused to go into any details. She said the TV show’s judges, Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, did not know about Wheatley’s conviction until after the final, but that she had been ‘honest with the producers from the start’. The show is made for the BBC by Love Productions, an independent company which also makes Famous, Rich And Homeless for BBC1. Jo said: ‘I didn’t want it to define  me. I didn’t want to use it as some  X Factor-style sob story.’ She then went on to reveal the secrets of her ‘cupcake cupboard’, an Aladdin’s cave of edible glitter and hundreds and thousands. Kept in the dark: Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry was not told about Richard Wheatley's conviction until after the final . This is the side of Jo that made her such a popular contestant. Engagingly girly, she didn’t show the same ruthlessness as other contestants. Like her cakes, she was pretty and delicate and often wreathed in pink. While waiting for the results of each task, she would suck her index finger like a little girl and dissolve into tears at the merest hint she had fallen short of Berry’s exacting standards. Which is what makes her husband’s story all the more surprising. A professional gambler, Wheatley is known as The Bear on the international poker circuit. It’s not hard to  see why, with his barrel chest and grizzled beard. Wheatley has enjoyed modest success, earning approximately £42,000 since 2006. His biggest win was £26,250 for  coming first in the £500 No Limit Hold’em tournament held at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London in 2008. Although it’s a substantial amount, it is certainly not enough to fund his glamorous lifestyle. On his Twitter account, last updated on May 3, 2010, Wheatley mentioned he had once played poker in the French resort of Deauville and spent a week gambling in Monaco, which he combined with a short stay at the exclusive Carlton Hotel in Cannes. On December 30, 2009, he said he would be staying at The Dorchester in London for the next few days. During his stay, he enjoyed a dinner at the hotel’s expensive Chinese restaurant, China Tang, a favourite haunt of celebrities and bankers. On New Year’s Eve he was at The Ivy, but did very little on New Year’s Day. ‘I have been in bed all day,’ he tweeted. ‘Thinking about getting up for dinner, maybe?’ It’s a far cry from the way Bake Off presents the Wheatleys’ home life: a chaotic but cosy domestic scene of muddy trainers and the endless piles of washing that come with three boys, all of whom like to give their mother marks out of ten for the family dinner, purposely teasing her with unfairly low scores. Jo clearly devoted her life to being a mother and a home-maker, but it would appear that Wheatley had other ambitions. Little is known about his trial, which began on February 28, 2010, and was not reported. Even his fellow poker players were unaware of his crime. On April 5 that year, Wheatley tweeted a player about a tournament, writing: ‘Wish I could have been there but mislaid my passport!’ In fact, he was on remand waiting to be sentenced. Successful: Presenters of the Great British Bake Off Sue Perkins, left, and Mel Giedroyc . In another tweet, on April 28,  he messaged writer and poker player  Victoria Coren, congratulating her on her performance during the European Poker Tour’s Grand Final in Monte Carlo. Eight days earlier he had been jailed by Judge Gregory Stone QC. There were four co-defendants in the case, all at least ten years younger than Wheatley. Charith Abeysinghe, 28, a Sri Lankan film director, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, was jailed for seven years. Kasun Maddumage, 26, who pleaded guilty to the same offence, was jailed for 18 months. Madhawa Arachchi, 34, and 30-year-old Thurkka Nanisagran denied conspiracy to steal. It is not known what happened to them. They seem strange company for Wheatley to keep, a man who lists golf and urban art as his hobbies  on his professional poker player profile. He also says his favourite movie is McVicar. The 1980 British drama, starring Roger Daltrey, dramatised the life of John McVicar, the Sixties armed robber-turned-writer who Scotland Yard named as Public Enemy No  1. The film told the story of his  criminal exploits and his eventual rehabilitation. Experts: The judges of the Great British Bake Off Mary Berry, right, and Paul Hollywood. Neither were told of Richard Wheatley's conviction . Whether Wheatley will follow a similar path remains to be seen but of one thing he can be sure. In her only interview, when asked if she would stand by him, Jo was unequivocal. ‘Of course,’ she said. ‘I’ve known him since I was 15 and I  love him.’ Nevertheless, Wheatley will be returning to a very different wife when he finishes his sentence which, Jo says, could be in two years. Having devoted her life to her sons, whom she calls her proudest achievements, Jo went on The Great British Bake Off to do something for herself. And as the winner she can now carve out a fulfilling career.Last year’s victor, Edd Kimber, went on to work with Raymond Blanc and has just released a bestselling book, The Boy Who Bakes. Jo already has a popular blog – Jo’s Blue Aga – and has set up a series of cookery workshops. Last Friday she appeared on the BBC’s One Show showing a food critic how to bake scones. A book deal is in the offing. It is a richly deserved success, particularly after the trials of the past 18 months which she admits have been ‘devastating’. And it must be an enormous relief to know Jo can provide the means to support her family. Her husband must be very proud of her. Last night Jo’s representative declined to comment on Wheatley’s conviction. Wheatley’s 69-year-old father,  Robert, lives in a Twenties semi-detached cottage in south-west Essex. Last night he was away on business. Wheatley’s stepmother, Karen, a pretty 44-year-old blonde, said: ‘I’m sorry, I don’t think I can say anything.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Joanne’s husband’s background bears no relevance to the programme. She does not have a criminal conviction and was selected in the same way as the other contributors who appeared. She is a talented baker and those talents have been recognised.’","Professional gambler known as The Bear was sentenced to seven years .

A male nude model has won more than £10,000 in damages after pursuing two sexual discrimination cases against his former bosses. Andrew Rogers, 62, had been life-modelling for art students at Weston college, Weston super Mare, Somerset, for 25 years when he was made redundant in July 2010. Mr Rogers suffers from the rare blood disorder Raynaud's disease and osteoporosis, but says he was able to continue with his work. After his redundancy, he and a female former colleague signed up to a modelling agency in an effort to continue working. However, while the woman was given fresh work by the college within two months, nothing was offered to Mr Rogers. In October 2010, he took the college to an employment tribunal in Bristol and was awarded £6,230 in compensation. The college was ordered to contribute £2,000 to his costs. The panel said: 'The college's actions in failing to consider him (Mr Rogers) for life modelling work because of his sex was distressing and has caused him considerable unhappiness.' Mr Rogers, of Moorland Road, Weston super Mare, Somerset, hoped to return to the college to resume work. But after signing up to another agency used by the college and discovering the hours were again being given to his former colleague, he claimed sexual discrimination for a second time. Again the panel found in his favour and he has now been awarded a further £5,000. The panel agreed that there was 'no obvious explanation' for the college to continue to fail to offer Mr Rogers work . The panel said: 'There is no obvious explanation for continuing to fail to offer Mr Rogers that work. 'Mr Rogers clearly suffered significant distress, anger, humiliation and anxiety as a result of the college's conduct, the more so since the college failed to address the previous finding.

He said: 'When I won the first tribunal, I thought they would have learned their lesson, but no changes were put in place. 'I wanted to go back but they did not offer me any work. It has really and truly affected me. 'I have been offered some other modelling work but turned it down. I think Weston College has destroyed my modelling career. It has caused me a great deal of anxiety. 'I have won two tribunals on sexual discrimination, and I think that is very concerning. There is something very wrong there.'

A church warden found dead in a bath by the vicar of the church where he volunteered had killed himself by taking a 'massive' sex drug overdose, an inquest heard. Dr Martin Rowe, 47, was found fully clothed in the bath by a concerned vicar who had gone to check on him after after he missed a Sunday service. Pathologist Sanjay Jogai, who carried out the post mortem, said Dr Rowe . had died from a 'massive' dose of erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. Dr Martin Rowe was a warden at St Mary's Church in Southampton, Hampshire (pictured) and according to friends had been affected by the death of his mother around two years ago . The warden took hundreds of times the normal dose and would have suffered . severe hypertension, causing him to collapse and die, the inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court heard. Police and paramedics found empty . packets of an impotence drug by his bedside and a significant stash of . the same prescription pills in his study. A large quantity of condoms, tubes of lubrication, disposable latex . gloves, canes and towels were also found in a spare room at his five-bed . home. Friends and colleagues today paid tribute to the bachelor, who was a warden at St Mary's Church in Southampton, Hampshire. Dr Martin Rowe, 47, was found fully clothed in the bath by Reverend Julian Davies (pictured) the rector at St Mary's Church in Southampton . They said he was a popular man who had been affected by the death of his mother around two years ago. The inquest heard that Dr Rowe, an academic and private tutor, had previously told neighbours he wanted to take his own life. The Reverend Julian Davies said Dr Rowe started to attend church around two years ago, following the death of his parents. He went on to become a deputy church warden and never missed a Sunday service. Mr Davies, who found the warden's body on March 21, said: 'He became quite well-known to the people at the church. 'People missed him and were sorry about the circumstances of his death. 'It was very tragic.' Deputy Coroner Gordon Denson recorded a verdict of suicide. Neighbour Nick Hannides said Dr Rowe, from Southampton, had been a very private but friendly man who 'kept himself to himself'. Dr Rowe had been a leading member of his old school's society, The Old Tauntonian's Association, for 25 years. Honorary secretary Bob Newell said Dr Rowe would be 'very sadly missed . for all the hard work and effort' he put into the society. Association president Ted Colenutt, who taught Dr Rowe and was a former . vice-principal at the school, said he had many friends and was a . 'sincere man'. He added: 'We were all stunned when we heard he had died. 'I think the death of his mother really upset him.' Dr Rowe worked as a private tutor for a number of agencies, offering . expertise in business studies, economics, English, history, politics and . public speaking. He had previously also run a car hire firm. Pathologist Sanjay Jogai, who carried out the post mortem, said Dr Rowe had died from a 'massive' dose of an Viagra-style erectile dysfunction drug (file photo) Viagra contains the ingredient sildenafil citrate, which works by relaxing muscles in the walls of blood vessels. However, the action that Viagra has on nerve activity of muscles in the penis may also increase sympathetic nerve activity (which makes blood vessels constrict). There have been several reports of heart attack, heart arrhythmia and even deaths that have been related to men who were using Viagra. Men with unstable cardiovascular disease - including a history of heart attack - should not use the drug. Anyone seeking a treatment for erectile dysfunction with Viagra needs to obtain a prescription from a doctor who has a complete knowledge of their health history and any medications they may be taking. The inquest found that Dr Rowe suffered severe hypertension - high blood pressure - as a result of his overdose. Blood pressure measures how strongly blood presses against the walls of your arteries (large blood vessels) as it is pumped around your body by your heart. If this pressure is too high, it puts a strain on your arteries and your heart, which makes it more likely that you will suffer a heart attack (as well as a stroke or kidney disease). It is not known whether Dr Rowe was given the pills on prescription. The NHS spends around £58million a year handing out more than 17million repeat prescriptions for impotence drugs. Currently, only men with conditions such as prostate cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis or kidney failure that are known to reduce their sex drive are eligible to get them for free.","Condoms, lubricant, disposable latex gloves, canes and towels found at Dr Martin Rowe's house .

Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai's wife has confessed to killing British businessman Neil Heywood to stop him revealing she illegally moved billions of dollars abroad, it was claimed today. Authorities believe Gu Kailai transferred $6 billion (£3.85 billion) to accounts under the names of relatives and friends in the U.S., Britain and other countries to hide undeclared income she had been receiving since the early 1990s. Heywood helped 53-year-old Gu - said to be his mistress - open the accounts and exchange currencies, the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported, citing Communist Party sources. Victim and suspect: British businessman Neil Heywood and Gu Kailai the wife of a top Communist Party official . Gu was under investigation for her financial dealings last November when Heywood was found dead in a hotel in Chonqing, the central Chinese city where her husband, Bo, was the Communist Party chief. At the time, officials under the control of Bo said Heywood died from a drinking binge and quickly cremated his body. Now it is believed he may have been poisoned. Gu and Heywood were reported to have had an affair and shared a £250,000 flat in Bournemouth when she she had set up a business in nearby Poole in 2001. Mr Heywood was even spotted pinching her bottom as they walked up stairs, it was claimed. Gu was detained because she . was 'highly suspected' of killing Heywood following a row over an . unspecified financial conflict, according to official reports. A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, is . also being held. Chinese legal system experts say it would be rare for . someone of her stature not to be tried after being publicly named as a . suspect. Bo was ousted from his position in the Communist Party’s Politburo last  April following allegations of corruption and rumours of his wife’s involvement in Heywood’s death. Twist: Gu Kailai (left) with Patrick Devillers (right). Devillers is her former business partner and has been arrested in Cambodia . Gu, who is being questioned by government officials in northern China, allegedly gave a detailed description of how she committed the murder and admitted taking bribes. The Asahi also reports that Gu confessed to receiving money from several companies 'on the back of her husband’s power.' An interim report circulated among senior party officials, said Gu admitted to the murder because she felt 'driven into a corner' by the investigation into her finances, the newspaper reports. It comes in the same week that a French former business partner of Gu's was arrested in Cambodia. Architect . Patrick Devillers, 51, was detained last week in the capital Phnom Penh . in the latest twist to the biggest political scandal to hit China in . years. Arrested: French architect Patrick Devillers's home in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh . Cambodian government spokesman Khieu . Kanharith said China had requested Devillers' arrest because of possible . involvement heywood's murder. Kanharith gave no details of Devillers' alleged involvement, however, and said Cambodia was deciding whether to extradite him. He also said they would not do so unless China provided more evidence. He said Cambodia could hold Devillers for up to 60 days . The arrest was the latest twist in the scandal of Bo Xilai, who  has an estimated wealth of $135 million, according to the investment giant Bloomberg. Murky dealings: Mrs Gu with husband Bo Xilai, the purged Communist leader of Chongqinq, and their son Bo Guagua . His downfall came after his former . police chief fled to a U.S. consulate and revealed suspicions that Bo's . wife was involved in Heywood's suspicious death. Authorities are allegedly investigating whether he knew about his wife’s actions. They have also reportedly detained 'dozens of people' associated with the millionaire -  'including his chauffeurs, close aides and secretaries'. News . reports have said that Devillers was closely linked to Bo, Gu and . Heywood. It is not clear if he is accused of any crimes in China or . elsewhere. Phnom Penh . police chief General Touch Naruth confirmed Devillers' arrest. He said . he has been arrested 'with the co-operation of China'. He added: 'We are considering whether to send him to France or China. China has demanded he be sent to China.' Calls to the Chinese Foreign Ministry rang unanswered last  night. Scene: Neil Heywood was killed at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing last November . Devillers, an architect, had helped Bo rebuild the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian when Bo was the city's mayor in the 1990s, The New York Times reported last month. The Frenchman and Gu were partners in setting up a company in Britain in 2000 to select European architects for Chinese projects. Both gave the same address of an apartment in the English city of Bournemouth, the newspaper said. It cited an unidentified friend of Devillers as saying the architect left China in 2005 and has been living in Cambodia more or less continuously for about six years. Devillers' father Michael, 73, expressed his 'shock' at learning of his son's arrest. From his home in Rainans, Burgundy, the semi-retired property developer said he appeared 'calm' 10 days ago. He added: 'He had no idea he was in danger of being arrested, as he had intended to come to France for a trip over the summer. 'My aim is to have him repatriated in France. I will be speaking with a French consular contact in Cambodia and I intend to fly to Cambodia as soon as possible.' He also revealed, as reported in the Telegraph, that his son was attracted to Gu and 'wanted to have a relationship with her'. He added: 'My opinion is that he was ensnared in a web of manipulation by this woman.' Eric Bosc, deputy to the French Foreign Ministry's spokesman, said Devillers was arrested on June 13 and the French consul has daily visits with him but that the reason for his arrest remains unclear. 'We have told local authorities that we are attentive that no follow-up of any kind be engaged without a clearly established judicial basis,' said Bosc, who deals with French in difficulty around the world. 'We have asked Cambodian authorities for clarification about the motives of his arrest.' Speaking by phone, he made no link to China, saying that only 'he is detained by a sovereign country'.",Gu Kailai gives investigators detailed description of the killing .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:08 EST, 25 July 2011 . Evil: Anders Breivik details in his manifesto that he intended to use poison bullets during his killing spree . Anders Breivik could have used ‘chemically enhanced’ ammunition to ensure every shot was deadly, police believe. In his disturbing ‘manifesto’ he talked of plans to put liquid nicotine in his bullets. If the blast did not kill victims outright, the nicotine would go on to poison them. It was already known that Breivik used ‘dum-dum’ bullets during his killing spree – the expanding round has a hollow point which leaves a large exit wound after causing horrific wounds. In his 1,500-page manifesto he wrote late last year: ‘I’ve now ordered 50ml – 99 per cent pure liquid nicotine from a Chinese online supplier. ‘3-4 drops will be injected in hollow point rifle bullets which will effectively turn it into a lethal chemical weapon. ‘I specifically instructed the Chinese supplier to send the package by courier to my company name, with extra wrapping and chemical labelling.’ According to scientists a fatal dose of pure nicotine is only one or two drops. A police source in Oslo told the Daily Mail: ‘We still have to find out whether he did use the nicotine, and toxicology tests on the victims will give us the answer. ‘But his planning appears so meticulous . that we fear he may have used the chemicals in this way. We would not . put anything past this man.’ Police sources have revealed that . Breivik owned a number of weapons – including a pump action shotgun, . bolt rifle and his favourite gun – the Ruger Mini 14. Favourite: This Ruger Mini 14 was Breivik's weapon of choice, while he also owned guns including a pump action shotgun and bolt rifle . He wrote: ‘With sight equipment mounted on your assault rifle you will successfully manage to acquire and neutralise multiple targets in a minimum amount of time.’ Lethal: Dum-dum bullet are more deadly than normal ammunition as they leave a larger exit wound . The chief surgeon at a hospital treating victims of Norway's camp . massacre said the killer used the special bullets designed to disintegrate . inside the body and cause maximum internal damage. Dr . Colin Poole, head of surgery at Ringriket Hospital in Honefoss north . west of Oslo, said surgeons treating 16 gunshot victims have recovered . no full bullets. He said: . 'These bullets more or less exploded inside the body. These bullets . inflicted internal damage that's absolutely horrible.' Ballistics . experts say so-called dum-dum bullets also are lighter in weight and . can be fired with greater accuracy over varying distances. They commonly are used by air marshals on aeroplanes and hunters of small animals. Poole, . a surgeon for 26 years at the hospital, said the bullets were . 'hyper-fragmentable' and produced confusing pictures on X-rays. 'It's . caused us all kinds of extra problems in dealing with the wounds they . cause, with very strange trajectories. The effect they cause inside the . body is like a thousand pin pricks.'","Killer talked in manifesto of using liquid nicotine in ammunition .

Marie Tillman kept the letter hidden at the bottom of a bedroom drawer where it lay untouched through his first two tours in Iraq. He was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004. When she received the news of her 27-year-old husband's death, she went looking for the letter that she had hoped never to open. Scroll down for video . Forever love: Pat and Marie Tillman were together from high school until his death in 2004 while serving in Afghanistan . Her book about the couple's 11-year relationship from high school sweethearts to his untimely death The Letter: My Journey Through Love, Loss, & Life is out on Tuesday. Hero: Pat Tillman gave up his NFL career to serve in U.S. Army. He was killed at the age of 27 in 2004 . The handwritten pages were in a familiar scrawl from her husband, whom she began dating during their senior year of high school in San Jose, California. It read: 'It’s difficult to summarize 10 years . together, my love for you, my hopes for your future, and pretend to be . dead all at the same time . . . I simply cannot put all this into words. I’m not ready, willing or able.' The book tells how 'painfully shy' Marie first noticed that the high school football player had a crush on . her when he fell silent when she was around. It tells the story of their love . affair through the notes that the NFL star wrote his wife from the . moment they met as teenagers, according to the New York Post. Letter writing became central to their relationship early on after Pat Tillman was placed in juvenile detention for a month following an arrest for a teenage fight. 'Hi dude,' he started a letter at the time. 'I am glad I got a chance to see you. Actually glad is really not the word, but the less I think about it the easier it is.' The couple remained together when they attended different colleges - she went to the University of California and he took a football scholarship at Arizona State - and letter writing became even more important to them. When they graduated in 1998, Marie went to join Tillman in Arizona where he had been drafted to the NFL as a safety for the Cardinals. However following 9/11, she explained that there was a shift in how he viewed the world and felt it was his duty to serve his country. He gave up his NFL career - and a $3.6million football contract - to become an Army Ranger. The couple moved to a base near Seattle and married soon afterwards. The two decided to put off having children after he enlisted and planned to start a family when he was finished service. When Mr Tillman was deployed just two months later, the letters began coming thick and fast. New beginnings: Marie, who has since remarried, posted this picture of her son on Twitter saying, 'Welcome to the world Mac Shenton!' In one he wrote: 'I know this isn’t the life you dream to live... And I know at times you’ll feel alone... I know we have each other and I love you.' The letters contain detailed plans that Mr Tillman had for the couple's future and his fear at the decision to leave his wife alone while he served in Iraq and later Afghanistan. His also wrote about the difficulty of war and the challenges that soldiers faced on the frontline. It’s difficult to summarize 10 years . together, my love for you, my hopes for your future, and pretend to be . dead all at the same time . . . I simply cannot put all this into words. I’m not ready, willing or able. Pat Tillman's final letter to wife Marie . Marie keeps the letters in a shoebox at the bottom of her wardrobe. Mrs Tillman, who was only 27 at the time of her husband's death, spent years grieving and reread the letters so many times that she has committed them to memory. Although she keeps most of her late husband's final letter a secret, she does reveal one important paragraph - where he tells her in the event of his death that she must move on with her life. Last year, Mrs Tillman, now 35, met Joe Shenton, a divorced father-of-three. After a whirlwind romance, the couple wed in September 2011. Mrs Tillman told how the investment bank director did not just see her as the widow of an American war hero. ‘We had this instant connection. I felt like he just saw me,’ she said. Soon the couple were ‘talking on the phone for two to three hours every night – we just fell in love,’ the 39-year-old added. Mrs Tillman, who gave birth to son Mac Patrick in January, lives in Chicago and continues to work for veterans through the Pat Tillman Foundation.",Tillman left his NFL career to serve his country following 9/11 .

A mother who developed cervical cancer and was left infertile after her smear test results were misread twice has been awarded £50,000 compensation. Claire Millward, 37, had two smear tests where pre-cancerous cells were present. However, she wasn't called for follow-up appointments on either occasion. Mrs Millward continued for the next four years thinking she was healthy but was horrified to be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2009. By this stage it was too late to save her womb and she had to have a radical hysterectomy. Claire Millward, pictured with her son Jamie. She went for regular smear tests but developed cervical cancer after they were misread . The life-saving surgery was a success, but left the mother-of-one unable to have any more children. Northampton General Hospital has now admitted that the smear tests were not read properly and an independent medical expert said Claire’s cancer could have been prevented. Claire, a letting agent, said: 'If they had spotted the cancer earlier I would not have lost my womb and could have more children now. 'We wanted a big family and we were actually trying for another child when the cancer came. 'Basically the negligence of some people has had a dramatic effect on my life. I want to ensure that no-one else has to go through this.' Mrs Millward, who lives with her husband Carl, 43, and son Jamie, eight, in Northampton, had two smear tests at Northampton General Hospital in 2003 and 2005. The first test showed borderline changes, the second should have been read as abnormal and both should have resulted in follow-up appointments. Claire had another smear test in 2008 that again came back negative, but she felt something was wrong. She had been told by the hospital she couldn't have another until September 2009, but got one at her doctors in February. Mrs Millward, who wanted a bigger family, was awarded £50,000 compensation after she had to have a hysterectomy . Luckily doctors caught her cervical cancer in time to save her life, but Claire had to endure an emergency radical hysterectomy, including lymph node removal, in March 2009 leaving her infertile. She said: 'I burst into tears when I found out I had cancer. 'But the most scary thought ever is what could have happened if I had not asked for another test. I don’t know what made me push for a test so much, but I am so glad I did. 'The independent medical expert said if I had waited until September to have treatement I would have been dead as the tumours were growing.' An independent cytopathologist who reviewed Claire’s case said if the abnormal cells had been picked up on her 2003 or 2005 scans she could have been treated with a cone biopsey and she would have kept her womb. Claire’s solicitor Neil Clayton, from Harvey Ingram, said: 'Claire’s 2003 smear showed borderline changes and should have resulted in a colposcopy referral for a detailed investigation. 'Her 2005 smear result was abnormal, again showing glandular neoplasia, and Claire should have had an urgent colposcopy referal. 'Our independent cytopathologist said they should have done a cone biopsey to remove the abnormal, pre-cancerous, cells if the tests had been read correctly. 'If they had read the results right in first place she would not have gone on to develop the cancer and avoided the hysterectomy.' A spokesman for Northampton General Hospital said they were truly sorry for their errors . He added: 'The lesson for hospitals is to be very careful to keep on top of results and ensure there are regular audits.' Northampton General Hospital have now sent Claire a letter of apology and reviewed its policy. A hospital spokesman said: 'We accept that, regrettably, those smears were incorrectly reported and that this may have contributed to a delayed diagnosis of glandular neoplasia (abnormalities of glandular cells). 'We are truly sorry for those errors. We carry out thousands of cervical smear tests annually, and we would like to reassure all our patients that this is a most exceptional case. 'We are determined to learn from it and we have reviewed our procedures to ensure there is no recurrence of the failings experienced by Mrs Millward.'","Mrs Millward insisted on another smear test seven months earlier than her appointment, saving her own life according to a medical expert ."

Royal Mail have launched an inquiry into dog attacks as figures revealed that postal workers are bitten around 4,000 times every year. Almost 400 staff have been forced to take time off work in the last year after being savaged by animals while doing their round. In total, workers have been attacked 24,000 times since 2006, official figures revealed. Dog attacks: Royal Mail staff were attacked 4,000 times on their rounds last year (file picture) An independent inquiry into the problem was announced yesterday by Royal Mail chairman Donald Brydon. They will make recommendations on how to stop the attacks which are happening at a rate of 11 per day. Mr Brydon said: 'It is an offence to . decency that good people should suffer these attacks when carrying out . their daily jobs and serving the public.' Royal Mail halted deliveries to a whole street after a tiny terrier 'growled' at postmen. The owners of the Yorkshire Terrier (pictured), called Peggy, insisted she has never hurt anyone. Patrick Joyce, from Northampton, said: 'The house is full of kids and she would never harm them. She's just a harmless little thing.' However, alleged 'repeated attacks' on a postal worker were enough to prompt Royal Mail to stop deliveries to the road in December 2010. In a letter delivered to all the street's residents, delivery manager Jim Evelyn said: 'Because of the dog's behaviour, your postman believes your mail cannot be delivered safely and in the circumstances I have instructed him not to deliver mail to your address.' Angry homeowners said they were forced to go on a 14-mile round journey to collect their mail or pay a 'small charge' to have it delivered to an alternative address. Although the Joyce family insisted their pet was harmless, a neighbour disagreed. 'She looks cute but she's got that glint of evil in her eye - she terrifies people,' she said. Dave Joyce, national safety officer of the Communication Workers Union, which has been campaigning for measures to tackle dangerous dogs, said: 'This is a very positive and welcome development at a key moment and will definitely raise the profile of the issue and influence the public and political debate and strengthen the case for change which is overwhelming and must not be further delayed.' The inquiry will be led by former high court judge Sir Gordon Langley and will study the number of attacks, which are running at between 3,500 and 4,000 a year. Devon postwoman Patricia Prew was forced to take six weeks off work after being attacked by an golden retriever as she entered the front garden of a house in Budleigh Salterton. She said: 'It just grabbed hold of me and pulled me . down and then it bit me so deeply that it took a chunk of my muscle . from that part of my arm.' In August 2011, Andrew Berge suffered . severe damage to his left-hand ring finger and tendon when a dog bit him . in south west London. 'As I posted an item through the letterbox, a dog bit and held on for four to five minutes,' he said. The Royal Mail has spent over £100,000 on campaigns and equipment to try to reduce the risk of injury, including a device to put letters through doors to protect fingers. Around 4,100 working days have been lost in the last year costing Royal Mail around £400,000, they claimed. Unions claim many dog bites go unreported and the actual number is closer to 6,000 every year. The Communication Workers Union said it received an assurance from Prime Minister David Cameron almost two years ago that he supported its campaign for tougher laws against dangerous dogs, but changes have not been made.","Workers attacked 24,000 times since 2006 .

During the war, Charles Green protected Britain from the  menace of Nazi U-boats and  the threat of German invasion. At 16, he lied about his age to join the Royal Marines, serving mainly on the Shetland Islands and around the Scapa Flow naval base in the Orkney Islands, where he defended the country’s ships and shores. But it was the toughness he needed as a Marine that finally cost him his life at the hands of two callous thugs – and then led to him helping to secure their convictions from beyond the grave. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT . Brave: Minutes after the raid on May 2 last year, Mr Green dialled 999 and refused an ambulance but police arrived and an officer took his statement on a helmet-mounted camera . Mr Green, 87, was fatally injured when he defiantly refused to give his bank details to two men who broke into his house in May last year. Despite suffering bleeding to the brain and a broken hip – injuries which would contribute to him dying a month later – he managed to give police a full account of the attack. The interview was filmed using a camera mounted in one of the officers’ helmets. This week footage from that interview helped send his killers to jail. It was the first time that an interview with a victim who later died, filmed with a helmet-mounted camera, has been played to a jury to help secure a conviction. Thugs: Tragic Charles Green suffered bleeding on . the brain and a broken hip after he bravely refused to hand over his . bank card to intruders Danny Keeble (left), 26, and Peter Marston . (right), 24 . Mr Green, who had heart disease, was attacked by Danny Keeble, 26, and Peter Marston, 24, when they burgled his home in Oswestry, Shropshire, in May last year. The thugs forced him into a headlock and threatened to beat him if he didn’t hand over his bank card and PIN. The great-grandfather, who was divorced and had lived alone for ten years, refused. He then suffered serious injuries when Keeble knocked him to the floor and sat on top of him while Marston ransacked his bungalow. The pair couldn’t find any valuables, so fled taking only a passport, savings book and other papers. After the burglary, Mr Green, a retired accountant, managed to dial 999 and officers interviewed him using the head-cam. He was taken to hospital but died of a heart attack four weeks later. Beyond the grave: Mr Green told officers that one person held him down while another searched the bungalow - proving both men entered the property . Mr Green told police: 'They hit me and put a lock on me, a wrestling lock, they were sitting on top of me' Last testament: Mr Green was taken to hospital after officers called an ambulance but he died of a heart attack four weeks later . At Stafford Crown Court on Thursday, Keeble, of no fixed address, and Marston, from Stafford, were each jailed for 15 years after being found guilty of manslaughter. Speaking with a bandage wrapped around his bleeding head, Mr Green described when the attack took place and how one person held him down while another searched the bungalow proving both men entered the property. Although disorientated, he managed to provide the police with crucial information. A recording of the 999 call made by Mr Green was also played to the jury. Handsome hero: Mr Green served as a Royal Marine in World War Two when he was just 16, left. After the case, crown prosecutor Stephen Bacon said the video evidence was critical because Mr Green was too unwell to give police a full statement in the weeks before he died. Head-cams have been worn by police since 2007. ‘A key part of the evidence was a voice from beyond the grave,’ he said. ‘The head-cam clarified the key points of what happened and the force used on him.’ Yesterday, Mr Green’s eldest son Terry, 61, paid tribute to his ‘courageous’ father. ‘He didn’t talk about the war much but I know he was a Marine and he saw action,’ he said.","Charles Green suffered bleeding on the brain and a broken hip after he bravely refused to hand over his bank card .

Cleared: Daniel Pytlarz outside Southwark Crown Court yesterday with his wife Urszula Nowozenivk . A masseur to the stars told of his relief yesterday after being dramatically cleared of sexually assaulting 18 women including a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney. Daniel Pytlarz, whose clients included Nancy Dell’Olio, Sir Paul’s daughter Mary, and members of the Saudi royal family, clasped his hands over his heart as the jury of six men and six women unanimously rejected charges that he had preyed on women at his upmarket spa. Outside court he embraced his wife, Urszula Nowozeniuk, who had supported him throughout his arrest and trial after telling friends in their native Poland that she believed the charges were ‘completely insane’. His solicitor said the couple were . ‘relieved’ at the outcome. She added: ‘Mr Pytlarz has always maintained . his innocence and is pleased to have at last been vindicated.’ Miss Nowozeniuk, who would have been . only yards away when the alleged offences took place, said: ‘I have . never had any doubts in his professionalism or his work. ‘I’ve never, never seen anything that gave me even the smallest concern that something wasn’t right.’ Mr Pytlarz, 35, was said to have . intimately touched the women as he massaged them at the Violet Clinic . Body and Skincare Spa in St John’s Wood, North London. The first allegation was made by a . former employee of Sir Paul in December 2009 as she visited the clinic . the day before he was due to give a massage to the ex-Beatle. The case . was dropped after the woman declined to pursue it, but two years later . he was re-arrested after new allegations were made. Police subsequently sent a letter to . all his female clients, and he was eventually charged with 21 offences . of alleged sexual assault against 18 women. Prosecutors claimed his . victims included a teenage girl who visited the clinic for a 17th . birthday treat, a music producer and two lawyers. Relief: Mr Pytlarz with his wife and solicitor Beverley Hamblin. He bowed to the jury before leaving the dock after his five-week trial . But Mr Pytlarz was cleared after . telling Southwark Crown Court how he would have been ‘insane’ to have . assaulted the women as his wife, who co-owned the spa, worked in a . nearby room. A string of clients testified in the . masseur’s favour and he was described by some as providing the ‘perfect’ service. His neighbour, Auschwitz survivor Ronald Leaton, called him ‘a . moral pillar in the community’. Arm in arm: The couple head home . Jurors also heard that he was said to . have a ‘magic touch’ and other clients believed he had ‘healing hands.’ Friends and even his ex-wife in his homeland told the Daily Mail they . never believed the charges. Mr Pytlarz, who speaks three languages . and is the son of a Polish army officer, was known by friends and . family as a ‘golden boy’ who charmed people wherever he went. In 2002 he took a job at a five-star hotel in Warsaw, where he met Arkadiusz Weremczuk, a flamboyant Polish fashion designer. The pair struck up a friendship and . the designer invited Mr Pytlarz to travel to England to be a personal . aide to his partner, Oxford University professor Michael Gearin-Tosh, . who had terminal cancer. Mr Pytlarz returned to Warsaw in 2003 where he . met Aneta Sierpinksa, whom he married following a whirlwind romance . lasting two months. She described him as a ‘perfect . gentleman’ who swept her off her feet with his elegant manners and the . stories of his glamorous life mixing with A-list stars that he met . through his work. She said: ‘He was a real smooth talker and told me . about how many stars he knew. He said he was close to Christina Aguilera . and other celebrities. ‘He was determined to get into that . celebrity world. He felt he was a nobody and he wanted to be a somebody. He had a hunger to be close to stars. I think he saw giving massages as . getting as close as he could to famous people.’ The couple split after only four . months, but she said: ‘Daniel never did anything to make me think he . could hurt or abuse a woman. He was a very caring man.’ The month after his first marriage . ended, Mr Pytlarz met Miss Nowozeniuk, who was then a law student. He . also began working at the Busy Body beauty salon in central London, . where the owner, Su Koe, said he often boasted about the celebrities he . knew. She said: ‘He said he knew Graham Norton. On another occasion he went to a charity event where he said he met Cherie Blair.’ She said he hoped that Miss Dell’Olio . would let him give a massage to then England football manager, Sven . Goran Eriksson, in the hope of becoming the masseur to the England . football team. Claims dismissed: One of Mr Pytlarz's accusers was a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney (pictured here with wife Nancy) who alleged the masseur touched her intimately during an appointment . After the death of his parents in . 2006, Mr Pytlarz settled permanently in London, where Miss Nowozeniuk . joined him after completing her degree. In 2008 they bought the Violet . Clinic spa and built up a client list of around 800. After they married in 2010, Mr Pytlarz said: ‘I love Urszula so much, I would give her my life, everything.’ By DAILY MAIL REPORTER .

Support: Miss Nowozeniuk leaving Southwark Crown Court during the trial, which she attended every day after giving evidence defending her husband . It  was described as the ‘Groundhog  Day’ trial. The evidence given against Daniel Pytlarz by 18 women was so similar that the case was likened to the Hollywood movie in which a man lives the same day over and over again. But the same could also be said of the string of happy female clients who queued up to speak in the masseur’s favour at Southwark Crown Court, eventually leading to him being cleared yesterday. Many of the women who appeared for the prosecution were middle-class professionals who had paid only £26 for their treatments thanks to a cut-price website voucher which offered ‘a unique massage combining ancient and modern techniques’ at his clinic. A treat that would usually cost £110 promised that Mr Pytlarz would leave them ‘relaxed, rejuvenated, full of life and raring to go’. But the women would go on to claim at the trial that the relaxing massages had a sinister undertone. One, who bought the massage for herself and a friend as a birthday treat, claimed Mr Pytlarz went too far and told the court: ‘I felt a kind of shock that this was happening. It was just wrong. I was petrified.’ She added: ‘I just felt I should get out of there as quickly as possible.’ A 17-year-old girl, whose mother had bought her a massage voucher as a birthday gift, said she was left ‘really confused’ after an all-over body scrub. Another patient, a married businesswoman in her fifties, said she could hardly believe the masseur would be ‘interested’ in her because had a ‘beautiful’ young  wife upstairs. But Eleanor Laws, QC, defending, claimed that at least five of the 18 witnesses had given accounts that had ‘grown with the telling’. She argued the evidence given in court by those women was different from the accounts they had originally given to the police. Others had not reported any form of  sexual assault until they were contacted  by detectives investigating Mr Pytlarz,  she said. ‘This is a man who has worked extremely hard, and the two things that mattered most to him were his wife and getting on in his work,’ she said. An opinion which yesterday the jurors were more than happy to accept.","Daniel Pytlarz, 35, was accused of preying on women at his upmarket spa .

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Terminally-ill Australian Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, has become an internet sensation after accidentally posting a heartbreaking and inspirational farewell message to the world on YouTube. Shaun, who has been told by doctors he does not have long left to live after his body rejected a SECOND heart transplant, was only trying to post his tragic goodbye speech to his friends on Facebook but due to a glitch had to put it on YouTube and woke up to find it had more than 10,000 views. The Video, in which he shows no signs of self pity - instead encouraging watchers to seize the day and make the most of their lives - has now been viewed more than 1.3million times. In his three-minute long 'My Final Goodbye' clip, after choking back tears, Shaun says: 'I won't be here as long as I thought, but I want to say that it's been an awesome ride and I have no regrets. 'Live life to the fullest because you never know what's going to happen.' The video has inspired such a wave of emotion in his homeland that Shaun has spent his final weeks living out his dreams by appearing in Neighbours, meeting his favourite Aussie Rules football player, writing his memoirs - and even finding love. Shaun's girlfriend is a fellow heart patient he started a relationship with three weeks ago but has been friends with for seven years. 'The hardest thing for me is leaving her, knowing that I won't get to marry her,' he told the Herald Sun in Australia. 'To have kids together. To grow old together. That is what makes sad. He added: ' I want to have fun. I want to enjoy my life. The way I look at it is I didn't get to decide his. These are the cards I have been dealt. I just have to roll with the punches. 'I have had two heart transplants and a stent put in. I have had ten more years than I should have because of that. I want to go outwith a bang.' His father Cameron admits the circumstances surrounding Shaun's death have left him bursting with pride at his boy's bravery - but utterly devastated he will have to bury his beloved son. Cameron told the Herald Sun: 'I just pray that it's quick. I don't want him to suffer. No parent should have to bury their child. But he's just loving life and wants us to do the same. He doesn't want us to cry for him. 'I've become angry with the world, I question why this beautiful person should be taken way from me, from his family and from the world.

Headline acts performing at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games will sing over pre-recorded backing tracks. Organisers have defended the move, claiming the British weather and the shape of the Olympic stadium mean it's 'not possible for the music in all the shows to be live'. But it is likely to infuriate fans who have paid up to £2,000 to watch a star-studded line-up rumoured to include The Rolling Stones, Coldplay, The Who and Adele.

Acts like Coldplay will be forced to perform to backing tracks at opening and closing ceremonies .

The line-ups for the opening ceremony on July 27 and the Olympics' farewell on August 12 are a closely guarded secret. But they are expected to feature a who's who of British music. Organisers have dubbed the shows a celebration of the best Britain has to offer, 'from Elgar to Adele.' And there are expected to be starring roles for rock veterans The Rolling Stones and The Who, as well as Coldplay. In February, creative director Kim Gavin insisted there would be an emphasis on live performance. He said: 'The intention isn't to go out there and do a mime show.' But organisers have been forced to concede all backing music will have to be laid down in the studio beforehand. Plans for an all-live show were hampered by concerns about the unpredictability of the British weather, as well as technical issues with the shape and size of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. Organisers want to create a surround sound effect, but the bowl shape of the venue meant they were left with microphone feedback during sound tests. A spokesman for organisers Locog . insisted: 'Due to the complexity involved, it's just not possible for . the music in all the shows to be live.

The London cable car which will fly Olympic spectators over the Thames will open before the end of this month, Transport for London said today. Transport chiefs have also revealed the pricing structure for the Emirates Air Line - saying it will cost some spectators as much as £16 to buy tickets for the 1.1km river crossing on the £50m cable car. Transport for London said the cable car will open to the public at midday on June 28 - almost a month before the start of the Olympics themselves on July 27. The Emirates Airline seen against the backdrop of the Gherkin, one of London's most famous landmarks . Cabins are tested high above the O2 arenas, formerly the Millennium Dome, and the River Thames in London . During the test drives the gondolas were filled with workers to see how the system would cope with passengers . The month-long period before the Olympics will see transport bosses recoup as much as possible of the rumoured £50m cost of the Emirates Air Line. A 'frequent flyer' ticket for the cable car costs £16, while a one-off, single adult journey costs £4.30 for those who don't have an Oyster Card. The cost of a single ride for non-Londoners and tourists, most of whom won't have Oyster travel cards, equates to around £1 per minute for the five-minute ride from Greenwich to the Royal Docks. The Emirates Air Line will link between the 02 Arena in Greenwich and the ExCel exhibition centre, carrying 2,500 people an hour. The frequent flyer ticket gives tourists 10 journeys at the cost of £16. A single, adult, pay-as-you-go fare with an Oyster Card will cost £3.20, while a cash ticket for those aged 15 or under will cost £2.20 and the fare will be £1.60 for those using Oyster cards. The cables run high above the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf giving the passengers excellent views of the City . Shuttles: The 34 gondolas will be able to take 2,500 passengers an hour . Riders will also be able to make a . non-stop round trip on the cable car, with views of the City, Canary . Wharf, the Thames Barrier and the Olympic Park, at a cost of £6.40 with . Oyster. TfL say passengers with a Travelcard . or other Oyster cards (including Freedom Passes) will be able to fly for . the same fare but will need to buy a boarding pass from ticket offices . or vending machines at either end of the route. It was feared that the network would . be not be finished in time for the start of the Games on July 27 but an . application for final approval has been received by Transport Secretary . Justine Greening. It means that spectators will be able to use the cable cars to travel between two of the Games venues - the 02 Arena on the south bank of the Thames and the ExCel exhibition centre in east London. The Emirates-sponsored transport will be the first urban cable car system of its kind in the UK. The gondolas, which will travel 160 feet above the river, are due to be an eye-catching feature, but are also seen as a vital cross-Thames link in east London and part of the drive to regenerate the local economy. There will be 34 gondolas carrying 2,500 passengers an hour across the river between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in just five minutes. Workers sit in gondolas as they perform tests on the new cable car link across the River Thames in London earlier today . The gondolas link the Greenwich Peninsula to the Royal Docks . Mayor Boris Johnson previously said of the Emirates Air Line: 'Gliding serenely through the air across the Thames will provide a truly sublime, bird's eye view of our wonderful city. 'This innovative airborne travel link will be a vital component in the ongoing renaissance of a vibrant easterly quarter of the Capital, providing a much-needed river crossing.' The consortium to build and operate the cable car was led by Mace, whose past projects include the London Eye and the Shard Tower in London. The cost of the cable car was originally estimated at around £25m and it was intended to be funded entirely by private investors. But, despite a 10-year sponsorship deal with the Dubai-based airline Emirates worth £36m, public money was needed to make up the shortfall. London now joins cities including Barcelona, Cologne, Hong Kong, Lisbon, New York and Singapore which all operate cable car systems.","Emirates Air Line to open to public at midday on June 28 .

The stepfather of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers has admitted plotting to steal £1.1million in gold and silver bullion. David Chatwood, 57, took part in an international conspiracy to snatch the precious metal bars in Belgium. He was arrested last year at the home he shares with the two celebrities and their mother Sue Wells in Brentwood, Essex. Chatwood stood in the dock of the Old Bailey to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to steal bullion between June 1 and October 14, 2011. Chatwood appeared in court alongside Brian Mulcahy, 46, John Corley, 52, Stanley Rose, 74, Matthew Middleton, 41, Kayracos Nicolas, 30, Andreas Nicolas, 50, Sheron Mancini, 52, Gary Cummings, 50, and David Gale, 55. Bullion lorry driver Mulcahy, Chatwood, Rose and Gale all pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to steal. The precious metal was said to be the property of Swiss company Metalor. Mulcahay was discovered by police locked in his vehicle in Belgium on October 4 after ringing his employers to say he had been robbed. Chatwood was seen to contact some of the other accused conspirators four days later at a Harvester restaurant in Dartford, Kent. Nine days after the robbery, most of the bullion was discovered in an apartment and a hotel room in Antwerp which had been rented by Rose, the court heard. Judge Peter Rook told the men: 'This is a very serious matter and a custodial sentence is inevitable.'

"Henry's spectacular 40ft . aquarium would spiral all the way from a swimming pool, bar and cinema . in the basement to the master bedroom . By . David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 02:46 EST, 11 May 2012 . It is hard to imagine something as soothing as a fish tank leading to anything except relaxation. But football star Thierry Henry’s dream of owning a 40ft-high, four-storey home for his fish has left him in hot water with his famous neighbour, Tom Conti. The problem is that the ex-Arsenal striker’s plan involves demolishing his £6million North London house and   building a taller property to incorporate the massive aquarium. Celebrity battle: Footballer Thierry Henry, left has been urged by neighbour Tom Conti, right, . to move out of his £6 million London home rather than demolish it for a . larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank . Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just buy one somewhere else?' Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition . Conti is so annoyed by the prospect of months of construction work that he questioned why Henry did not just move somewhere else instead. The 70-year-old actor, best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months. ‘There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance. ‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’ Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’ Thierry Henry's new house plan has angered his neighbour . The row in leafy, normally liberal Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry, 34, applied for planning permission. Made up of four separate containers, one for each storey of the house, his  proposed £250,000 tank would take 5,500 gallons of water to fill, house 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen  Ireland look like tiddlers. Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007 and the footballer now plays for the New York Red Bulls in the US. The French footballer – who fronted . the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a . long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks. Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and . Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks. Ireland has reportedly spent more . than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a . shark tank under his kitchen floor. It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish. One tank designer, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are . looking for status symbols and showpieces.’ But he is understood to be keen to maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His new home would also include a swimming pool and gym. Conti, who appears in summer Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises, lives with his actress wife Kara, 67, in a six-bedroom Edwardian property whose garden backs on to Henry’s home. When they bought the house in 1985 it was divided into flats and they turned it into a family home. Built in 1902, it includes a small ballroom and minstrels’ gallery. Councillors were meeting last night to discuss Henry’s application, which planning officials have recommended they grant. Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home. ‘Its interior spaces are cramped, deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu Evans, the agents acting on his behalf. The house’s original architect, Sir Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British Architects, opposes Henry’s application. He says the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’. Conti told the council in a letter: ‘The existing dwelling overlooks our house and garden, particularly in winter, but was thoughtfully designed with few windows. ‘A taller building with windows facing our property would be a great intrusion of privacy.’ In total, eight neighbours have urged planners to kick Henry’s proposal into touch. One expressed concern that ‘a property that was built 13 years ago, in decent condition, is being demolished to create another eyesore in the conservation area’. Influential civic group the Heath and Hampstead Society also called for the application to be thrown out, saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’.","Shirley Valentine actor .

"Low-cut 'Forever' dress by London-based label Issa is a popular choice in the Middleton family . By . Lara Gould and Tom Goodenough . PUBLISHED: . 08:31 EST, 20 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:39 EST, 20 May 2012 . It is not unusual for sisters to look to each other for fashion tips and advice about what to wear. And from the looks of her outfit at a friend's wedding, Pippa Middleton has been listening closely to the words of her older sister. Royal watchers might have noticed an air of familiarity in Pippa's fashionable choice that she wore yesterday to the Scottish wedding of close friend Camilla Hook to Indian Ocean tsunami survivor Sam Holland, the actor grandson of Oscar-winning film director Lord Attenborough. A (slight) variation on a theme: Pippa Middleton followed in the footsteps of her sister Kate by wearing an almost identical version of the dress first modeled by Kate at the announcement of her engagement to Prince William at Clarence House, in 2010 . After all, it was almost identical to the dress worn by Kate Middleton on the day she announced her engagement to Prince William in November 2010. Apart from the colour of the outfit - red in Pippa's case, and blue in Kate's - there was no difference at all between the two dresses, which were variations of the low-cut silk jersey ‘Forever’ dress by Issa. And there was little change, too, in Pippa's ability to turn heads at her friend's wedding - a year after she did the same at her sister’s very public ceremony to Prince William. Now it seems Pippa Middleton is making a habit of upstaging brides on their big day. The bride, who had taken wedding planning advice from party planner Pippa, arrived in an elegant off-the-shoulder floor-length lace dress with full satin skirt and carrying a posy of cream roses, at the parish church in the village of Aberlady – 15 miles from Edinburgh. But as she made her way into the church all eyes – and indeed cameras – were on the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister. Kate Middleton will have approved of her sister Pippa's choice of outfit at a friend's wedding in Aberlady, near Edinburgh . She turned heads in the low-cut raspberry-coloured outfit. The body-skimming dress, which showcased single Pippa’s enviable figure and world-famous derriere, was accessorised with a matching fascinator with net veil and black clutch bag and set off with a pair of black heels. Inside the church Miss Middleton, who arrived with a female friend and one of the young bridesmaids, gave a reading reciting the lyrics from singer Bob Dylan’s Forever Young as part of the service, which included three hymns and a song from the church choir. Other guests included Freddie Mellor, the son of former Conservative Cabinet Minister David Mellor. Freddie, a friend of the groom since their time at Charterhouse public school in Surrey, was one of five best men. Close friends: Pippa Middleton and bride Camilla Hook met on an exclusive cookery course in 2002 . Big day: Guests gather outside the church where Miss Middleton recited Bob Dylan lyrics as a tribute to her friend of ten years . Pippa makes her way through the churchyard (left) and leads guests inside for the service (right) After the service Miss Middleton, 28, and other guests gathered to throw petals over the newlyweds to the strains of a lone piper, before being driven off in an Audi as others were ferried to the reception at the bride’s family home by coach. Miss Middleton and Miss Hook, also 28, have been friends since 2002 when they met on an exclusive £3,600- a-month cookery course in Frome, Somerset, after leaving school. Miss Hook, who lives in Clapham, South London, met her fiance when they were students at Durham University. Their wedding follows tragedy for Mr Holland, 27, who lost members from three generations of his family in the tsunami in 2004. He and his father, shipbroker Michael Holland, survived the Boxing Day disaster after travelling inland from their holiday home in Thailand to play golf. Mr Holland’s mother Jane, 49 – Lord Attenborough’s eldest daughter – was killed, as were his sister Lucy, 15, and his paternal grandmother, also called Jane, 81. His second sister, Alice, now 24, was seriously injured but survived and was there to support her brother on his big day yesterday, giving a reading during the  45-minute service. Mr Holland has spoken of how his future wife helped him cope with the loss, saying: ‘Camilla has been a great source of comfort to me over the years. We’re very happy.’ Showered with petals: Newlyweds Camilla Hook and Sam Holland leave the church before making their way to the reception at the nearby Hook family home .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:10 EST, 15 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:45 EST, 15 June 2012 . Calculating: Dr Edward Erin plotted his former lover's death while behind bars and was today jailed for a further two years . A doctor caught plotting revenge after he was jailed for trying to poison his pregnant mistress was today locked up for an additional two years. Edward Erin asked former cellmate Joe Mallia to kill Bella Prowse and their baby. He also asked him to steal Bella’s mobile phone and send a text - falsely confessing that she had made up court evidence against the doctor. Erin, 46, hoped the message would destroy secretary Bella’s credibility as a witness and see him freed on appeal. But Mr Mallia alerted a newspaper to the plot after he was let out of jail in May 2010. An investigative reporter arranged for him to secretly tape the jailed doctor during a visit to high-security Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight. The reporter then handed the damning film to police. Now Erin, of Watford, Hertfordshire, has been given an additional two years in jail after being convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice by a jury at Portsmouth Crown Court. In the 55-minute video, Erin dictated the message he wanted sent to Bella’s boss from her mobile. He told Mr Mallia: 'You say ""I can’t live with my life any more. I set Ed up, I put the drugs in the drinks. Ed was the best ever. He’s done nothing wrong but I have lied to the police and the court and I can’t get busted because of my baby. What should I do?"".' Erin thought Bella’s boss would alert police to the text and it would lead to his release from jail. But the plan was never carried out. Sentencing judge Richard Price today told Erin: 'The plot was never carried out because Malia went to the Press. 'The Press gave Malia a covert recording device which he brought with him on a visit to you in prison. Victim: Bella Prowse was to be 'killed' by her former lover's cellmate - but the plot quickly unravelled . 'There he recorded what I can only describe as the clearest possible admission of guilt on your part. 'Despite that, despite being apparent to everyone that this is what you had done - it is on the video - you nevertheless chose to plead not guilty. 'If the plot had succeeded, the course of justice would have been perverted and your perfectly innocent victim could have been made to look like a liar and perjurer. 'Some would describe the plot as amateurish and cack-handed, with very little chance of success.' David Bentley, defending, said: 'This is a very serious offence and he recognises that. 'He is someone who has clearly fallen from a significant position in society to where he is now and his situation is not going to get any better. 'It has been a distressing time for him. 'His wife is still very much standing by him and he has two young children who visit as often as they can. 'He has suffered threats and abuse as a result of press coverage of the trial and his time in prison will not be easy. 'Although this was a serious offence, when one looks at the mechanics of what was proven, it was not probably the most sophisticated of plans.' Mr Mallia had told the court Erin recruited him while they were in London’s Belmarsh Prison. He said: 'Erin said if Bella was killed he’d be freed and not struck off the General Medical Council. 'He wanted me to do it and kill her baby. 'He knew I was getting out of jail soon and told me if I did it I would never have any financial worries. 'I never intended to kill her and was just stringing him along.' Married father-of-two Erin - a chest and allergy specialist - was jailed for six years in 2009. The new sentence will run consecutively. He was convicted of trying to drug Bella - who was pregnant with his son - to induce a miscarriage after she rejected his pleas to have an abortion. Bella rumbled that Erin was trying to spike her drinks, including putting arthritis drug Methotrexate in her coffee. Erin - who was set to be freed this year - was caught in the operation led by The Sun reporter Brian Flynn.","Edward Erin asked his former cellmate to kill his lover Bella Prowse and their baby .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 09:31 EST, 24 October 2011 . Death Row: Hank Skinner was convicted in 1995 of killing his live-in girlfriend Twila Busby and her two adult sons, Randy Busby and Elwin Caler in 1993 . A triple murderer on death row - due to be executed in two-and-a-half weeks - is facing a race against time to prove his innocence. Henry Watkins 'Hank' Skinner - convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her two adult sons in Pampa, Texas, on New Year's Eve 1993 - claims there is untested DNA evidence that could exonerate him. The DNA in question went untested during the original trial because Skinner's lawyer believed it could actually incriminate him. But Skinner, 49, says this was a decision that he never agreed to - and is now waiting to hear if it can be tested before he is put to death on November 9. A hearing today could allow the testing - which may ultimately prove his innocence or guilt. Skinner was convicted in 1995 of killing his live-in girlfriend Twila Busby, 40, and her two adult sons, Randy Busby, 20, and Elwin Caler, 22, in 1993. About three hours after their bodies were discovered, police found Skinner hiding in a closet in the home of a woman he knew. Tests showed that blood of at least two victims was on him, and authorities said a trail of blood led police from the bodies to his hiding place a few blocks away. Skinner has acknowledged being inside the house where the killings took place. But he has argued his innocence from the start, saying that he was too inebriated from drinking vodka and taking codeine to overpower the trio. He has claimed it was Twila Busby's now-deceased uncle Robert Donnell who carried out the murders. On Death Row: Hank Skinner is being held at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville . DNA evidence presented at his trial showed his blood was at the scene. But not all the DNA was tested. A rape kit, biological material from . his girlfriend's fingernails, sweat from a man’s jacket resembling one . that another potential suspect often wore, a bloody towel and knives . were all missed. Going against his lawyer's wishes, . Skinner has repeatedly asked the state to release the evidence for . testing, but Texas courts have repeatedly rejected his pleas. They said that, as a convicted man, he did not have the right for it to be tested. But in 2010, less than an hour before he was scheduled to be executed, and after he had eaten his last meal, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed his killing, . It said he could pursue a civil rights claim to obtain the DNA testing, and sent the case back to the federal district court to decide whether Skinner is entitled to additional DNA testing. His lawyers will today ask federal Magistrate Judge Clinton Averitte in Amarillo to force prosecutors to turn over the knives and clothing that were never tested for DNA. A decision could be expected soon, but it could be too late for Skinner, who is held at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville. Although one of his . lawyers has said he believes the new execution date is 'an effort to put . pressure on the court to act quickly'. The decision to schedule his execution, rather than wait until the outcome of the ruling that could eventually prove his innocence, has angered civil rights activist Mary Shaw. She said: 'What are they afraid of - the possibility that Skinner's conviction might be proven wrong? 'Killing a prisoner, apparently, is more important to them than killing the right prisoner. Killing a prisoner, apparently, is more important to them than true justice.' Skinner's case has echoes of Texas death row prisoner Cameron Todd Willingham who was executed in 1994 for an alleged arson that claimed the lives of his three daughters in 1991. A later forensic review of the case led to the conclusion that 'a finding of arson could not be sustained.'","Hank Skinner faces execution on November 9 .

Tory ministers have held meetings with Google an average of once a month since the General Election. The revelation of the extraordinarily close relationship increases concerns that the internet giant has the ear of the Government on a host of sensitive topics. Official records show that David Cameron has met Google executives three times and Chancellor George Osborne four times. Culture minister Ed Vaizey has met the firm no fewer than seven times while his Culture Secretary boss Jeremy Hunt – currently under pressure over his links to another media giant, News Corp – has held four meetings. The Tories' close relationship with Google goes back to David Cameron's first months as party leader. In 2006 and 2007, he spoke to the annual Google Zeitgeist conference (above) George Osborne has met Google executives four times; Culture minister Ed Vaizey (centre) has met them no fewer than seven times; and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt - currently under pressure over his links to another media giant, News Corp - has held four meetings with the web giant . In total, there have been at least 23 meetings between Conservative ministers and Google since June 2010. The links are so strong that in recent years at least three senior figures have moved between the Tories  and Google. Links with media giants are a highly  sensitive topic for the Tories. The current section of the Leveson inquiry into Press standards is focusing on the painfully close ties between Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp and the Conservatives. Revelations have included the toe-curling text messages between the Prime Minister and the company’s former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks. In addition, a series of emails have lifted the lid on the close relationship between News Corp’s top lobbyist and Mr Hunt’s department during the company’s abortive attempt to take over satellite broadcaster BSkyB in 2011. Labour has also accused the Conservatives of going soft on online porn because of its close relationships with firms such as Google. Last month a Google executive caused outrage when she said it was the fault of parents if their children saw adult content online. The executive in question was Naomi Gummer, who until recently was Mr Hunt’s political adviser. Google was approached by the Tories to store patients’ records after the failure of Labour’s health IT scheme. And it has been repeatedly criticised for paying tax on less than a quarter of its UK income. In 2010 it generated £2.1billion here but locates its international operations in Ireland, where it can take advantage of the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate. Along with many other media companies, Google is anxiously awaiting the Government’s long-delayed Green Paper for its proposed Communications Bill which will have major implications for digital media in the UK. Google has been repeatedly criticised for paying tax on less than a quarter of its UK income. In 2010 it generated £2.1bn here but locates its international operations in Ireland (above), where it can take advantage of the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate . Last night Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said: ‘Of course it is important for ministers to listen to business, but a meeting with Google every month does look like the sort of privileged access that small businesses can only dream of. ‘Ministers must disclose what they discussed. Did they challenge Google over their repellent tax avoidance, which was uncovered by the Daily Mail?’ The record of meetings, obtained from research into departmental websites, shows other Tory ministers to have met Google are further education minister John Hayes, universities minister David Willetts, policy minister Oliver Letwin and business minister Baroness Wilcox. Two Lib Dems – Business Secretary Vince Cable and Ed Davey, then an employment minister – have met the firm. The close relationship goes back to Mr Cameron’s first months as party leader. In 2006 and 2007, he spoke to the annual Google Zeitgeist conference. On the second occasion, Google picked up the bill for hotels and flights between London, San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Last night a spokesman for Google said: ‘It’s absolutely right that governments speak with companies about issues that affect their citizens. Links with media giants are a highly sensitive topic for the Tories. Leveson Inquiry revelations have included the toe-curling text messages between the PM and News Corps' former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks (above) ‘The British Government makes the list of those meetings publicly available – including the Daily Mail’s 34 meetings over the same period.’ Last night a Tory source said the Government was working with internet firms to install higher-speed broadband, to crack down on online porn, and to draw up a major Green Paper on communications, and that it was wrong to say Google had any special access because of Mr Cameron’s relationship with Steve Hilton. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘All these meetings have been properly declared and it is normal for relevant ministers to meet with a company of this size.’ Steve Hilton and Rachel Whetstone have been linked to Mr Cameron since 1992 . First it was Murdoch, now Tories 'get too close to Google' The number of meetings between Tory ministers and Google executives raises questions because of David Cameron’s close relationship with his oldest political friend Steve Hilton and his wife Rachel Whetstone. Mr Hilton was until recently the Prime Minister’s most trusted adviser in Number 10, and Miss Whetstone is global head of communications at Google HQ in California. The three met in 1992 when they worked together on John Major’s successful election campaign. Mr Cameron then became a Whitehall special adviser, alongside Miss Whetstone, while Mr Hilton set up his own consultancy firm. The three became lynchpins of the ‘Notting Hill Set’. Mr Hilton even became godfather to David and Samantha Cameron’s late son Ivan, and the PM is godfather to the Hiltons’ second son. It was Steve Hilton who persuaded Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership in 2005 after Michael Howard – for whom Rachel Whetstone was by this time working as chief of staff – stepped down. Mr Howard’s resignation prompted Miss Whetstone to join the private sector, and she got a communications job at Google. Mr Cameron took on Mr Hilton, who had been working for advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi, as chief strategic policy adviser, where he became known for his ‘blue sky thinking’ and came up with the idea of the Big Society. But questions soon grew over whether Mr Hilton’s wife’s position at Google was giving the internet giant too much influence on Conservative policy. Mr Cameron addressed the firm’s annual conference twice, in 2006 and 2007. Around this time he began to talk about encouraging patients to store their medical records with companies such as Google. The then Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb, now a minister in the Coalition Government, said: ‘It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth that there are repeated references to Google, given the closeness of Team Cameron to that organisation, and it leaves concerns about commercial advantage.’ Mr Hilton moved with Team Cameron to Number 10 on the formation of the Coalition. Many of his policies were described as ‘bonkers’ by colleagues, and angered senior Lib Dems as well as civil servants. He wanted to slash protections for workers to help business, advocated ignoring EU laws and most recently called for the welfare budget to be slashed by a further £25billion. The arch-Thatcherite also wanted to sack two in three civil servants, and urged ministers to fly with ‘upstart’ Virgin rather than ‘fat cat’ British Airways. The shaven-headed son of Hungarian immigrants stood out in Number 10 as a result of his propensity to walk around shoeless and in a T-shirt, a get-up which caused Barack Obama to call him a ‘beach bum’. Mr Cameron and Mr Hilton spoke every Sunday and one insider said they were so close that he was the only person who could get the PM to change a policy within minutes. While Mr Hilton is an outsider in high society, Miss Whetstone had a privileged upbringing more akin to Mr Cameron’s. However, the relationship was not helped in the early 2000s by rumours of an affair with Viscount Astor, Samantha’s stepfather, before she got together with Mr Hilton. In March it was announced that Mr Hilton was to take up an academic post at Stanford University in California to be near his wife. He plans to return next year. Rachel Whetstone is not the only senior Tory official to have links to Google. Naomi Gummer, daughter of Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour Lord Chadlington, worked with Miss Whetstone in Google’s public policy division and is still an executive there. She was previously an adviser to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Amy Fisher, Caroline Spelman’s special adviser since last year, did a stint at Google as a press officer with Miss Whetstone.","David Cameron has met web giant three times; George Osborne, four times .

"By . Jonathan Petre . PUBLISHED: . 18:12 EST, 7 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:16 EST, 8 April 2012 . A protester sparked fury yesterday by deliberately swimming into the paths of the crews in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. Environmental campaigner Trenton Oldfield was hauled from the water and arrested on public order offences after his actions halted the prestigious event for half an hour. Last night, the president of the Oxford University Boat Club angrily told Oldfield via Twitter: ‘My team went through seven months of hell. This was the culmination of our careers and you took it from us.’ The university crews were almost neck-and-neck when they were forced to stop after the blades of the Oxford team’s oars narrowly missed Oldfield. A police officer said later: ‘They nearly took his head off.’ Shock: Oxford crew members gape in disbelief after Trenton Oldfield dives beneath their oars and re-emerges from the Thames feet from the boat . Incredibly, it was not the only drama to affect the 158th boat race. After the event restarted – the first time a restart has been required for 11 years – an Oxford oar snapped when blades from the two teams tangled, allowing Cambridge to cruise to victory. Then, at the finish line, a member of the Oxford crew collapsed in the boat and had to be taken to hospital. The crews had set off normally enough at Putney Bridge, South-West London, a little after the scheduled start time of 2.15pm. More than nine minutes into the race – . halfway along the four-and-a-quarter-mile course, near Hammersmith . Bridge – former Olympic rower and race official Sir Matthew Pinsent . spotted Oldfield in the water. Wearing a wetsuit, the bearded Australian . had plunged into the Thames at the SurreyBend stage of the race, apparently in a protest to highlight his unorthodox political views. Critical seconds: As the Oxford rowers approach Oldfield only cox Zoe de Toledo sees the danger . Closing in: Rowers react to their cox's shouted warning. A police officer said the team 'nearly took his head off' Close shave: Oldfield ducks under the surface to avoid the oars before re-emerging on the other side . Witness Jonathan Finlan, an art dealer of Hyde Park, London, said: ‘I think he must have got there early and stayed lurking in the water, because we never saw him swim out from the riverbank.’ As the boats approached, Oldfield ducked under the water to avoid the oars. Oxford crew member William Zeng used Twitter to send the protester a series of emotional messages after the race. Mr Zeng, a doctorate student at Oriel College, tweeted: ‘When I missed your head with my blade I knew only that you were a swimmer, and if you say you are a protester then no matter what you say your cause may be, your action speaks too loudly for me to hear you. ‘I know exactly what you were protesting. You were protesting the right of 17 young men and onewoman to compete fairly and honorably, to demonstrate their hard work and desire in a proud tradition. ‘You were protesting their right to devote years of their lives, their friendships, and their souls to the fair pursuits of the joys and the hardships of sport. You, who would make a mockery of their dedication and their courage, are a mockery of a man.’ Exhaustion: Oxford's Alexander Woods is splashed with water by team-mate William Zheng after collapsing at the finish line . Another blow: Medics and the Oxford rowing team aid their bowman Alex Woods after he collapsed at the end of the race. He did not lose consciousness and is said to be in a stable condition . Frustratingly for Oxford, they were enjoying a marginal advantage when race umpire John Garrettbrought the event to a standstill. As Oldfield resurfaced, smiling broadly, he was picked up by a police boat. Once on dry land, he was led away off Chiswick pier, wrapped in a red blanket. Onlookers booed and shouted ‘Take him to the Tower!’ and ‘Is that David Walliams?’ – a reference to the comedian who swam the Thames last year for charity. Bitter defeat: Oxford's Alex Davidson is comforted after losing the 158th annual Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race on the river Thames at Mortlake, west London . Police later said Oldfield was being . detained at a West London police station on suspicion of a Section 5 . public order offence, namely behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm . or distress. Describing the drama, Cambridge rower . Steve Dudek said: ‘I saw a head. I looked over and thought they had . lost a guy [out of Oxford’s boat]. Our cox immediately said, “Stop!” ’ Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo was also forced to take drastic action – quickly alerting her crew to thedanger ahead. Remorseless: Oldfield beams as he is picked up by a police boat and led away off Chiswick pier . Explaining the decision to interrupt the race, Sir Matthew said the swimmer had risked serious injury. ‘It’s not ideal but what could we do? We could not have carried on,’ he said. In the other incidents, the blade of Oxford’s German rower Dr Hanno Wienhausen broke after thecrews’ oars clashed. The Oxford crew member who collapsed was Dr Alexander Woods. The 27-year-old Pembroke College medical student was lifted from his seat by medics. Apparently suffering from exhaustion, he was conscious, but was taken to hospital. He was said to bein a stable condition. At the end of the race, a clearly upset Ms Toledo appealed for the race to be rerun because there was too much wash on the course after the postponement. Her appeal was turned down by the umpire. The 2012 race is the first to be disrupted by a swimmer. The last time it had to be restarted was in2001 when there was a clash of blades and an oar was lost. In further reaction, television presenter Richard Madeley tweeted: ‘God, the monumental ego and selfishness of the swimmer who screwed the Boat Race. Imagine sharing living space with someone like that.’ The quick-witted Oxford cox at the centre of yesterday’s drama appeared in the Oscar-winning film The Social Network. Zoe de Toledo alerted her crew to the presence of protester Trenton Oldfield when he was just yards from their oars. Footage appeared to show Zoe calling out to the rowers, who were unable to see the man in the Thames. She played the role of a cox in the 2010 film, which portrayed the early life of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard University peers, including the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron. Quick thinker: Zoe de Toledo looks dejected after the race. Her shouted warning ensured the Oxford rowers did not hit Oldfield . The twins, who won a multi-million-pound court settlement after claiming Zuckerberg stole their idea for his social networking site, were part of the defeated Oxford crew in 2010. Zoe, who is studying for an MSc in criminal justice at Oxford, was the only woman in yesterday’s chaotic race. Film role: The Oxford team member played a cox in 2010's The Social Network . Talking last week about her role, the . 24-year-old, who lives with her fiance in Henley-on-Thames, said: ‘I was . rowing with [Henley’s] Leander Club at the time and we got word that . they needed extras for a rowing sequence. 'We filmed on the final day of the . Henley Royal Regatta and then spent six or seven days at Dorney Lake in . Buckinghamshire doing close-ups. ‘The director David Fincher was trying different things. He was attaching boats together with metal girders and putting cameras here, there and everywhere. It was really interesting and we got paid a little bit as well, which was nice.’ Between takes, Zoe sat chatting with Armie Hammer and Josh Pence, who played the Winklevoss twins. ‘They did a really good job and were good fun. They would tell us stories about their experiences and we would tell them about our lives.’ The filming, which took place in July 2009, evoked fond memories for Zoe. Her grandfather is Oscar-winning sound mixer Simon Kaye, and she spent much of her childhood visiting film sets. ‘I was used to all the waiting around and sudden panic when something is about to happen. I haven’t ruled out going into the film industry.’ Zoe was educated at fee-paying St Paul’s Girls’ School in London, where she first took up rowing. Last year she coxed Britain’s women’s eight team, who finished fourth in the European Rowing Championships. She also won a gold medal at the 2009 World under-23 Championships and a bronze in the 2005 World Junior Championships.","Environmental campaigner Trenton Oldfield pulled from the water and arrested after deliberately swimming into the path of the Oxford crew .

Evil: Kevin Clifford pictured outside Leicester Crown Court before he was jailed for 16 years for the brutal assault on his son Gary Clifford . An evil father who beat his son while he was hanging upside down from a forklift truck, before welding him into a cage has been jailed for 16 years. Gary Clifford, 29, was left with a broken arm, two broken legs, a fractured foot and hundreds of cuts and bruises after his father and uncle tortured him - believing he had stolen jewellery from his step-mother. Leicester Crown Court heard how Gary’s father, Kevin Clifford, 51, uncle, Patrick Clifford, and a third man, John Cope, 47, had beaten Gary within an inch of his life and dumped him outside a pub. Sentencing Kevin to 16 years behind bars for GBH and false imprisonment, Judge Ebraham Mooncey called him an 'evil man' and said he couldn’t understand how a father could inflict such horrendous injuries on his own son. The court heard that Kevin Clifford lured his son to a workshop at the back of his home, with the offer of work, to carry out the barbaric punishment. During the attack his son was welded into the cage, had brake fluid sprayed into his face and was threatened with being set on fire. Prosecutor James Thomas said the assault was 'horrendous, amounting to torture'. The victim was subjected to the horrific and prolonged attack after he was suspected of stealing gold jewellery from his stepmother, Kevin Clifford’s wife, in April last year. The court was told father Kevin knew Cope was looking for Gary following a fall-out and recruited him, and his own brother, Patrick, 44, to help with the horrendous attack. Barbaric: The tiny cage in which Gary Clifford was welded into by his dad after he was beaten within an inch of his life . Gary of Derbyshire suffered multiple broken bones and lash marks having been relentlessly beaten with a baseball bat, a pipe and an industrial hose. Cope has turned up after Gary was welded into the cage and a jury heard that when he was taken out, Cope laughed as he smashed Gary’s kneecaps into several pieces. He too was handed 16 years in jail for false imprisonment and GBH. Jailed: John Cope was recruited by Kevin Clifford to join in the horrific attack because he had fallen out with him in the past. He too was jailed for 16 years . Mr Clifford was also battered in the face by his hammer-wielding uncle, who was jailed for 12 years after he admitting false imprisonment and inflicting grievous bodily harm. Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: 'Experienced ambulance officers said the injuries were the most extreme they’d ever seen. 'You don’t often hear of someone being hung upside down from a forklift truck and caged. He had a sack put over his head and a cable around his neck. 'Patrick and Kevin Clifford gave him a beating as he hung upside down and he received many injuries, from the waist to his head, at the hands of his father. 'It was a systematic beating of the most vile kind. 'The father of the victim stood calmly in court when he gave evidence, telling lie upon lie to the jury, saying he wasn’t involved in this enterprise.''It’s hard to fathom how a father, his own flesh and blood, could to something like this. 'I watched you giving evidence and I take the view you’re an evil man and you shouldn’t have done that to your son, whatever he’d done. 'The victim was subjected to gratuitous degradation.'Kevin Clifford and Cope had denied the charges, claiming they played no part in the violence but were both convicted after trial . Detective Chief Inspector Neil Castle said: 'This could easily have been a murder investigation. This young man has been through a horrendous ordeal and I hope today’s verdict goes some way to bringing closure on this chapter of his life.'Speaking after the trial Gary Clifford said: 'This incident has changed my life. It was absolutely horrendous and at the time I was wishing I could die. The pain was so unreal.

It was reported last week that she has been increasingly going out in public undetected because she is said to have put on so much weight she is virtually unrecognizable. She's back: Sporting short, blonde hair and glasses, Anthony is almost unrecognizable on the October YouTube diary she filmed.

Facing . judge again: Casey Anthony (left, in a recent racy Facebook . snap) is being sued for defamation by Zenaida Gonzalez (right), who shares the . name with a fake kidnapper made up by Anthony .

A source told RadarOnline: 'Casey absolutely flipped out when she found out that private investigators hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, discovered where she was. 'The private investigators were . attempting to serve Casey with a subpoena to appear at the trial, which . is expected to begin in January. Casey had been venturing out at night . and the investigators had been tipped off by people who had seen her. 'Casey is a smart girl and quickly . determined that she had been found and refused to leave the house or . accept service of the subpoena. The P.I.s weren't stalking her or doing . any surveillance, they just wanted to serve her and move on. 'Casey was extremely upset that she had been found because she had settled into a routine and felt safe in South Florida. 'Casey's lawyer advised her that she . needed to move though and they worked together over the past two weeks . to move yet again. She is hopeful this will be the final move before her . probation ends, at which time, she doesn't have to stay in Florida.' It was reported last week that she is . planning on moving to Costa Rica when her probation is over. She is . currently embroiled in a legal battle with Gonzalez after she told . police that a woman with a name similar kidnapped Caylee. Ms Gonzalez's attorney Jeff Dill told . RadarOnline: 'We had been trying for months to serve her and we were . finally able to get it done this week after a lot of legal wrangling . because Casey wouldn't accept the subpoena at the location she has been . hiding out in. 'Our client is thrilled that Ms Anthony has now been formally served and it's a successful start in the proceedings.' Gone: Anthony's toddler daughter Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008 . After her dramatic acquittal, Anthony . spent months in hiding where she reportedly just sits indoors on the . computer while comfort eating - and so has piled on the pounds. But a source has revealed that this . new look - including a 'puffy face' - has apparently given her fresh . courage as she has been leaving her home regularly. 'Casey has been venturing out on a much more frequent basis recently because she is almost unrecognisable,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.'

'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added. It . comes after a source told People magazine that Casey remains unemployed . and has little money, while probation reports show she recently stopped . attending counseling sessions. However, she has apparently started . speaking to her estranged mother Cindy in a bid to get their . relationship back on track, although she does not speak to her father. Anthony . is also said to be 'annoyed' about having to take the stand again at . the Orange County courthouse in January after her attorneys accepted a . defamation subpoena. She is being sued by Zenaida . Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter Anthony initially told police had kidnapped her daughter. Anthony admitted . fabricating that story.

Florida after her probation ends in August but this new court order . means she will have to stay. The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.' But despite being vilified by the public after going into hiding, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity. In October she appeared in a video . diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes . for herself', although failed to mention Caylee. It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning. However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself. Anthony is being sued by Zenaida . Gonzalez, who shares the name of 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony . initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating . that story. It later emerged that Anthony, whose . acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, . did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a . nanny. Now Miss . Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due . to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was . found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008. After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool. It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release. Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter.

Two young children of a lesbian couple will receive thousands of pounds in NHS compensation after the death of their sperm donor father who was also the nephew one of the women. Carlton Ashman, four, and his sister Sarah, six, were secretly fathered by 20-year-old Charlie Lowden, who died after hospital doctors failed to spot a lethal blood clot. Mr Lowden’s aunt, also called Sarah Ashman, 42, is the civil partner of Claire Ashman, 31, who became the biological mother of the children after his donated sperm helped her fall pregnant. Family: Sarah Ashman, right, whose now deceased nephew donated sperm so that her civil partner Claire Ashman, left, could give birth to children Carlton, six, and Sarah, four . The adult trio kept the truth a closely-guarded secret between themselves until Mr Lowden’s death forced his aunt to make an emotional confession about the true identities of the children to her sister Lynn Lowden, the victim’s mother. Mrs Lowden and her husband, Charles Lowden, believe six doctors at Wansbeck General Hospital in Ashington, Northumberland, made errors in his care by dismissing his symptoms and ignoring vital test results. The couple, from nearby Bedlington, immediately launched legal action against Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. The trust has now admitted liability over . his death and agreed to pay out £85,000 in compensation following a . settlement in the medical negligence case. Children Carlton and Sarah have each had £35,000 put into a trust fund and will receive the money once they turn 18. Mrs . Lowden will also get an additional £6,255 due to ongoing health . problems, including depression. The remainder will go into her son’s . estate. Father: Sperm donor Charlie Lowden tragically died at the age of 20 after doctors failed to detect a blood clot . Today, Sarah Ashman senior said: ‘My kids aren’t going to see their dad ever again and nothing has happened to the doctors. ‘It’s absolutely disgusting. It’s not about the money at all. My kids look up to the sky every day and talk to their dad. ‘He should be here with them. He played a big part in their lives. ‘We would all go out for Sunday lunch together. We would take them to the park together. ‘They are the spitting double of him too. We are over the moon for what he did for us. He gave me and Claire a family and I’ll never forget him for that. I would give up everything to have him back.’ Mr Lowden became seriously ill ten days after undergoing a routine hernia operation at Hexham General Hospital in November 2009. He was rushed into Wansbeck General Hospital suffering from severe chest and back pain and was vomiting blood on December 8, with a letter from his GP stating his symptoms were indicative of a post-operative clot. But doctors at the Ashington-based hospital ruled out the fatal condition despite abnormal test results, which included an X-ray showing a shadow on his right lung. Instead, they diagnosed him with a suspected viral chest infection and discharged him the next day. Mr Lowden later collapsed at his home in Bedlington and died on December 9, when the clot, which had formed in his left leg, travelled through his veins and into his heart, causing a cardiac arrest. Charlie also left a sister Ruth, 16, and brother Jonathan, 21. It was only then that the family learned that he had been the father to little Carlton and Sarah. His parents, who learned they were biological grandparents as well as aunt and uncle to Carlton and Sarah, were shocked but overjoyed to make the discovery the youngsters had been conceived with their son’s help. Mrs Lowden said: ‘Even though it wasn’t done in the most conventional of ways, he still would have been in their lives and at some point, [the children] would have been told about him. It was never going to be a secret kept forever.’ Speaking about the settlement, she saide: ‘For us, it’s never been about the money. No amount of money in the world can mend a broken heart. Close: Charlie Lowden with his aunt . Sarah Ashman, who kept his sperm donation secret until after his death . ‘Until we get an apology and something is done about what they did, we will not walk away from this.’ His parents had hoped that the NHS trust would specifically acknowledge the children. Mrs Lowden added: ‘We didn’t want to accept their offer because, at first, they refused to acknowledge the kids. ‘We even offered to provide DNA samples if they had wanted. ‘We told them we would accept an offer, if they recognised them, which they have now done. ‘But I feel like it’s an insult to my son’s memory because, more than two years on, we have still not had an apology for what happened, which would have gone a long way if they had have done that at the beginning.’ A spokeswoman for Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We are deeply saddened by the death of Mr Lowden and wish to again express our sympathies to his family at this difficult time. ‘Whilst a settlement has been made, we recognise it will not compensate the family for their loss. ‘We have implemented the recommendations made by the coroner and have put the necessary measures in place to minimise the chance of a similar case happening again.’","Charlie Lowden helped his aunt's civil partner conceive by donating sperm .

Beer belly: That muffin-top could actually help regulate the immune system and provide a first line of defence against infection and viruses . The fatty membrane in the belly, called the omentum, has never seemed to serve much of a purpose. But now the research by scientists in Chicago has shown it can be a health benefit - and their discovery could lead to the development of new drugs for organ transplant patients with auto-immune diseases such as Lupus and Crohn’s disease. The omentum lines the abdominal cavity, covering most abdominal organs, and is where fat tissue is stored. The research team found that cells from this membrane can differentiate into lung-type cells and bone cells. The discovery could be vital in stopping transplant patients' bodies rejecting new organs . They now believe the omentum may be assist tissue healing and regeneration. 'We now have evidence that the omentum is not just fat sitting in the belly,' said Dr Makio Iwashima, from the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. The team also found that the cells can suppress the immune system's response to an infectious agent.

Most people reach for the sun hat and lotion during the summer months, but one young boy has such sensitive skin he has to be covered in Factor 50 cream every day. Alexander Dewar, four, has albinism, which means he has very little pigment in his skin, hair and eyes making him extremely susceptible to skin cancers. He must stay away from the sun as much as possible but when his parents Isla, 34, and Craig, 40, do take him out they have to cover him in factor 50 sun block. Alexander Dewar with parents, Isla and Craig. Mrs Dewar said she found it hard to deal with attention from strangers . Alexander wears glasses because he is partially sighted and suffers from involuntary eye movement and photophobia. The family home in Kelty, Fife, Scotland, is also fitted out with dark blinds to keep out the light and their car has tinted windows. Mrs Dewar said that when Alexander was born she was shocked, as unlike his older siblings Matthew, 9, and Bethany, 6, his hair was white, his skin was pale and his violet eyes were tightly shut. She said: 'He didn't open his eyes for the first three or four days and we were worried that he was blind. 'My other two children were born with dark hair, we had no idea we had the albinism gene. It was quite a shock because nobody else in the family had it and it was a steep learning curve.' Isla said that initially doctors failed to recognise the condition and only diagnosed albinism four months after he was born. She said: 'I didn't know anything about albinism. I knew he was different but I didn't know what it was then. The only place I could find out was the internet.' Alexander only managed to open his eyes outside when he was seven months old and even then only when wearing dark sunglasses. Mrs Dewar said: 'We got him some wraparound sunglasses and it was a really exciting day to see him open his eyes. 'He wears a big hat when he's outside and can only see his feet, he'll never be able to drive a car but he has enough vision to get around. 'Because he's got no melanin, the way his eyes are connected to his brain is quite different, which has an impact on what he sees as well.' Neither of Alexander's siblings Matthew and Bethany have albinism . Protection: Alexander must always wear factor 50 as he is susceptible to skin cancers . Mrs Dewar said one of the hardest things about the condition was dealing with others comments. She said: 'What I've learnt is most people are just curious and my response is to be positive. He does get people looking at him but its more me and my husband who are bothered - he can't see them very well! 'He's not fussy about people asking him because he doesn't want to be different. We've taught him to be patient and kind about it, but it will get harder as he gets older. 'We're educating his brother and sister, because they hear people talking about him and don't really know what to say. 'My eldest son gets very upset and doesn't want people saying things about his wee brother.' Alexander will start Kelty primary in August and the school have been adapting lighting and putting up UV shields for him. The family are looking at white stick training and guide dogs for Alexander and are thinking of sending him to Edinburgh Royal Blind School when he's older. Mrs Dewar said that her only hope for the future is that Alexander gets to live a meaningful life as possible, doing something he wants to do. She added: 'I just want him to be able to go where he wants to and do what he wants to. 'It's just a bit of extra work to get him there, at the end of the day he could have something far worse.

Questions: Dianne Abbott, the shadow health minister, asked whether teenage girls should be given breast reduction operations . Hundreds of teenage girls have had breast reduction operations on the NHS, figures have revealed. The procedure has been branded a waste of taxpayers' money as they are usually requested for cosmetic reasons. Over the last six years, 647 girls aged 15 to 18 have had the surgery carried out on the NHS. The total cost to the taxpayer is around £3.2million - with each operation costing £5,000. Official NHS guidance says the operation can be carried out if women suffer psychological distress, backache, neck pain or poor posture. During the procedure surgeons remove, fat, glandular tissue and skin before re-shaping the breasts. The nipples also have to be repositioned. The operation cannot be carried out for purely cosmetic reasons under NHS rules. Official figures revealed that 359 women aged in their 70s also had the operation carried out between 2006 and 2011, The Sun reported. In total, 21,328 women had breast reduction surgery carried out by the NHS over the period.

The doctors explained it was unclear . what effect chemotherapy could have on her unborn child or how . significant a strain a pregnancy could be on her already weakened body. With a tumour the size of a small football in her chest Mrs Crowder began eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy. She said: 'I had scan after scan to check on the . baby and even though everything looked fine it wasn’t until she was . born and I saw her that I could believe she’d be okay'. Remarkably Sidney Rose, now four, was safely delivered by c-section at 34 weeks. Her arrival was made even more special as Mrs Crowder and her husband Nick endured two tragedies trying to become parents. Their first daughter Alice, was stillborn, and then Mrs Crowder miscarried twins. Sidney Rose was finally conceived with the help of fertility drug Chlomid and she fell pregnant at the end of 2007. Mrs Crowder lost three babies before she fell pregnant with Sidney (pictured now) but noticed that she was feeling unwell. Doctors diagnosed her with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and she thought she was going to die . However, she said she had begun to notice that she was feeling unwell. She said: 'In hindsight I hadn’t been well since my birthday in . August with chest infections and coughs and itchy skin. 'By the time I was pregnant it was worse. I looked terrible and felt terrible. I was sick of being sick. I am a trained nurse and it did go through my mind that something else was going on with my body.' She was admitted to Aintree Hospital and underwent a battery of tests before the news about the Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, cancer of the lymphatic system, was confirmed. Mrs Crowder said: 'I thought, I can deal with the cancer . but I cannot lose another baby. I just knew I would do whatever it took . to get that child into the world. The rest was in God’s hands.' She added: 'When she arrived she had more hair . than me and was perfect. After nine months of fighting for her it was . amazing to hear her cry. I just lay there and thought, ‘my work is . done’'. But the delivery took its toll. Having . lost a lot of blood Mrs Crowder underwent an emergency full body scan which . discovered the cancer had travelled around her body and she . subsequently underwent more rounds of intensive chemotherapy. She also had a bone marrow transplant at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. 'That was when I felt truly scared. I . remember looking out at the hospital car park from my isolation room and . thinking: is this the last thing I’ll see before I die?’' But the treatment - she also underwent radiotherapy - was successful and she has been in remission for 30 months. Meanwhile, her daughter has grown and continues to be a source of hope and pride. She said: 'At times it feels as if it’s happened to someone else and I have to pinch myself to remember it’s all been real. 'But if one person reads this and it gives them hope, whether they’re fighting cancer or trying to have children, then I have done my job.'","Lyndsey Crowder was delighted when she fell pregnant but was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma weeks later .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 21 October 2011 . A rare Royal Naval uniform worn by a British survivor of the Battle of Trafalgar has been unearthed after spending decades in the attic of one of the sailor's descendants. William Hicks became famous for his gripping account of Trafalgar which told how, as a 17-year-old midshipman on HMS Conqueror, he helped British forces crush France and Spain in 1805 to end the threat of an invasion by Napoleon. Now a uniform worn by Hicks several years later when he reached the rank of lieutenant has been unearthed in a plastic bag in an attic, after being handed down through his family for 200 years. It went on display today at the National Maritime Museum in London on the anniversary of the battle off the Spanish coast. The museum also displays the uniform worn by Admiral Nelson that momentous day when he was shot and killed by a French sniper. The smart uniform belonging to Lieutenant William Hicks, from around 1812, is an important find for military historians as it is believed no other lieutenant uniform of that era is left in existence. The smart blue uniform belonging to William Hicks, from around 1812, is an important find for military historians as it is believed no other lieutenant uniform of that era is left in existence. Until now they had to rely solely on descriptions of what uniforms at the time looked like. It was passed down to Hicks's great granddaughter Carolyn Hammond, who was not aware of its significance and had kept the uniform in a plastic bag in the attic. The Battle of Trafalgar on October 21, 1805, remains one of the greatest triumphs in British naval history . A fleet of 27 ships led by Horatio . Nelson on HMS Victory defeated 33 French and Spanish ships off the . south-west coast of Spain, near Cape Trafalgar. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost 22 ships, without a single British vessel being sunk. The decisive British victory . confirmed the country's naval supremacy, as over 3,300 French and . Spanish were killed, over 2,500 wounded and 8,000 captured. By comparison, historical records show that just 1,666 British naval officers were killed or wounded. Nelson was famously killed in the . battle, while his French counterpart, Admiral Villeneuve, was captured . along with the French flagship Bucentaure. Hicks was only 17 when he served as a midshipman in the Battle of Trafalgar. In a vivid account of the naval battle, published in The Times shortly afterwards, he tells how a shipmate's blood gushed into his shoes as the brutal battle raged on October 21, 1805. He wrote: 'I had a merciful escape in the fight with the (Spanish ship) Santissima Trinidad. 'I saw a grape shot which struck a canister case. I took it up and put it in my pocket. 'Turning round I saw the first lieutenant and sixth lieutenant lying close by me. I ran to them, saying, ""I hope you're not seriously hurt"", and lifting Mr Lloyd's head the blood gushed into my shoes. Both were dead.' Hicks was aide-de-camp to Sir Israel . Pellew, commander of HMS Conqueror, the British ship which battled with . the French flagship Bucentaure at Trafalgar. His . account continued: 'We engaged her single-handed for half an hour, and . she struck to us; after her colours were hauled down two guns from her . starboard quarter began to play on us. 'Sir Israel Pellew, thinking that . they were disposed to renew the fight, ordered the guns which could bear . on her foremast to knock it away, and her masts were cut away.' Experts . at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, where the uniform will . now be displayed, believe it stayed in such good condition because Hicks left the Navy soon after and it did not suffer too much wear and tear. His . letters, preserved by his family, reveal that the carnage . he witnessed as a young man at Trafalgar made a deep and lasting . impact. The fact that he kept his uniform also suggests that the experience stayed with him. Hicks's . great granddaughter, Carolyn Hammond, said: 'Succeeding generations of . the Hicks family have cherished these family treasures, and when a . chance encounter with members of the 1805 Club at the unveiling of a . Trafalgar Way plaque led to the discovery that William's uniform was of . national rather than just family significance the current generation of . the family were delighted to donate it to the National Maritime Museum, . knowing that it would then be professionally cared for, and that . William's story would reach a wider audience.' She . added: 'It was just hanging in a plastic bag. When the curator arrived . she said, 'We'd better be careful how we treat it', and I thought, 'Oh . help!'' Lieutenant Hicks' uniform went on display today at the National Maritime Museum in London on the anniversary of the battle off the Spanish coast. The museum also displays the uniform worn by Admiral Nelson (pictured) that momentous day when he was shot and killed by a French sniper.","Served as midshipman, aged 17, in decisive battle off Spanish coast .

They are already under pressure dealing with disgruntled passengers who have queued for hours at immigration, but now Border Force officers will face daily checks on their uniform, hair and fingernails before starting work. Internal emails to staff state that those who fail the appearance checklist can be sent home or moved off the public-facing immigration desks. The news has exasperated, already-stressed border control staff and one of them penned an anonymous poem, posted on a Heathrow staff noticeboard, with a line saying 'The people won’t mind three hour queues, if they can see our shiny shoes.' Staff room protest: The news has exasperated, border control staff - one of them penned an anonymous poem, posted on a Heathrow staff noticeboard . The new rules, revealed by The Daily Telegraph, will not be well . received from disgruntled passengers either - last week it was revealed . that passengers were storming past border guards at Britain's airports . in frustration at lengthy queues at passport control. The fiasco has become increasingly embarrassing in the run-up to the Olympics, prompting fears that Britain will become a laughing stock as half-a-million spectators arrive here from around the world. Passengers . not only face lengthy delays getting into the country at Heathrow but . also other ports including Stansted and Coquelles, . the Eurotunnel terminal in northern France. Changes: Brian Moore, the Border Force's new chief, has ordered a new uniform for his staff . In March, one instruction stated high uniform standards also applied to personal appearance. 'In particular, hair should be clean, neat and tidy. Extreme hairstyles and conspicuously unnatural colours are unacceptable. 'In addition, all members of staff . with long hair should ensure their hair is tied up (i.e. off the collar . and in a bun or similar style so it cannot be easily grabbed) when they . are on duty,' reported The Daily Telegraph. Lucy Moreton, deputy general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, was shocked by the implications the new rules held. 'This is just the latest in a series of incidents akin to re-arranging the deckchairs on the titanic.  It simply does not matter whether staff have clean hair. 'What does matter is getting what staff we have onto the front line in a timely manner and making best use of them whilst they are there.  If their shoes are not shiny I really don’t think anyone will mind. A . loss of 10 or 15 minutes may not seem much; but 12 officers in 15 . minutes could clear over 100 passengers between them,' she added. Although a uniform policy was already set by the previous government - managers at ports of entry across the country were not required to perform regimented checks and there was a more relaxed approach. Close scrutiny: Before being allowed to start their shift, Border Force officers, who have been dealing with three hours queues at immigration will now face daily checks on their uniform, hair and fingernails before starting work . But when Brian Moore, joined in March as interim head of the Border Force, staff noticed the rules became more strict. Mr Moore, the former chief constable of . Wiltshire, has already commissioned a new Border Force £2.5million universal uniform . which will be worn by all levels of staff - the previous uniform was only introduced three years ago. A . Home Office spokesman defended the policy. He told the newspaper: . 'Turning up to work smart does not take resource away from border . control.' Meanwhile there . were fresh concerns today over safety at Heathrow airport after it was . revealed that staff had stopped screening passengers for drugs and guns . because they were so under-staffed.

The source described an incident last week involving two Pakistani students accredited to work on the Olympic site. He felt they posed a risk - but they were cleared without being searched. He blamed the downgrade in security on cutbacks and political pressure to reduce waiting times for passengers arriving at the airport. A Home Office spokesman insisted the government was 'committed to maintaining border security,' adding that 'our staff... continue to target drugs and illegal weapons'.","Border Force officers sent home if not up to standard .

As this man cycled along a country lane, his leisurely pace apparently infuriated one driver so much that she abandoned her car and ran after him. In a video posted on YouTube, the red-haired woman can be seen trying to push the man over, kicking his bicycle and shouting and pointing at him. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: The angry woman can be seen raising her leg to kick the cyclist during the YouTube clip . Quite what he had done to provoke such a reaction is not clear, but one YouTube user suggested the man was a fox-hunting supporter who deliberately held up traffic near Bibury, Gloucestershire, to delay anti-hunt campaigners. Officers say they do not know why the fracas took place, but revealed they were looking at the possibility it was caused because of their opposing views on hunting. It is understood that hunt meetings regularly take place on Saturday in that area during the hunting season, which typically runs from November to the spring. A spokeswoman for Gloucestershire Police said: 'Until we have spoken to both parties involved we can’t speculate as to why this altercation took place, however, whether it is connected to members of a hunt or hunt supporters and anti-hunt protestors is one line of enquiry.'

A secret East German-style rescue package is being cooked up by Germany as the eurozone's 'engine-room' desperately bids to save the single currency. German chancellor Angela Merkel is preparing a six-point plan that aims to revive Greece in the same way East Germany was developed after the fall of Communism. Der Spiegel reports that it will see ailing countries transformed through privatisations, soft investment rules and the relaxation of employment laws. Hit: France, led by Francois Hollande (left), and Germany, led by Angela Merkel (right) are usually known as the engine-room of the eurozone, but are now also suffering from the economic slowdown . The European Union will be presented with the plan, including a proposal for a European privatisation agency or fund, in the next few weeks. It is likely to provoke outrage in Greece because of it's 'behave more like the Germans' message. It is modelled on the 'trust agency' Treuhandanstalt, created in 1990 by the People’s Chamber of East Germany to sell off 8,500 state enterprises. Merkel also wants to create special economic zones that will tempt foreign investors with tax relief and reduced regulation. The employment market would also be restructured along German lines, with a job protection loosened. The leaking of the plans comes as it was revealed France and Germany, dubbed the eurozone's engine-room, is now being hit by Europe's economic slowdown. Worry: The news that Germany and France is also suffering from the economic slowdown gives added urgency to the region's struggle to keep Greece's debt crisis from tearing the single currency apart . So far, the 17-nation bloc's downturn has been confined mainly to its periphery - with Greece, Portugal and Ireland all seeking bailouts. But an index measuring broad economic activity across the monetary union in May showed its weakest outcome since mid-2009, during the global financial crisis. It has given added urgency to the region's struggle to keep Greece's debt crisis from tearing the single currency apart. Greece's general election on June 17 has turned into a referendum on whether Athens should continue with an austerity drive that is the price of continued fiscal support from its euro partners. Greece's anti-bailout leftist SYRIZA party is maintaining a lead ahead of the elections, according to an opinion poll yesterday. Greece held elections on May 6 but that vote left parliament divided evenly between groups of parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a €130billion rescue agreed with lenders in March. The Public Issue/Skai TV poll showed SYRIZA leading with 30 per cent of the vote, four points ahead of the conservative New Democracy party, which is backing the bailout. If repeated on June 17, this would fall short of enabling SYRIZA to govern alone but give it a decisive role in forming a new government. Greece's deficit means that without the EU/IMF money, which would stop flowing if Athens were to tear up the agreement on reforms, it would not be able to pay salaries and would have to leave the eurozone and start printing its own currency. 'Regardless of the turmoil and the debate that's going on in these crucial countries, it would seem that for the time being, people want to stick with the euro,' said John Wright, senior vice president of global public affairs at Ipsos. Yesterday's composite PMI indicated core nations such as Germany and France were also being caught up in the downturn. This was as they made contingency plans to deal with financial and economic turmoil in the event Greece quits the euro. Italy, which could be on the front line of speculative attacks on euro markets if Greece went back to the drachma, put a brave face on the situation, saying the most probable outcome was still that Greece would remain in the euro zone. 'Anything can happen, but I think the most probable outcome is the one which is most positive for Greece and for all of us,' Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti told Italian TV. He said Greece's eurozone partners had been wrong to insist on overly rapid reforms and fiscal adjustment, and he did not expect it would be long before European countries were ready to introduce common euro zone bonds. 'Italy is very much in favour of the creation of euro bonds when the time is right, and we do not expect it to be too far off,' Monti told an earlier news conference. At least half of eurozone governments, as well as banks and large companies, are making contingency plans in case Greece decides to quit the euro. Despite Monti's comments, his deputy economy minister said Rome was ready for such a possibility. And European markets are currently stable. The FTSE-100 is 0.05 per cent up at 5,352.93; France's CAC 40 is 0.41 per cent up at 3,050.58; and Germany's DAX is 0.43 per cent at 6,343.35. It came as yesterday the euro crashed to a 22-month low as the European economy took another dramatic turn for the worse. Figures showed the biggest slump in private sector business across Europe this month for nearly three years. The dire news sent the euro tumbling against the dollar to $1.25 – its lowest level since July 2010. Against the pound it was worth little more than 80p. Figures from financial research group Markit showed the eurozone economy sank deeper into the mire this month. In Germany, the private sector was in decline for the first time in six months while in France the slump was the steepest for just over three years. Common euro bonds, which would allow weaker nations like Greece to borrow with the collective backing of the bloc, have been placed back on the agenda as Greece's possible exit looms larger. And the topic has seemingly split France and Germany. France's election on May 6 of a Socialist president, Francois Hollande, has changed the tone of the debate on euro bonds. He urged a reluctant German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders at talks on Wednesday to consider recourse to euro bonds among other measures. Merkel, seen as an architect of the austerity prescription for Greece, now looks increasingly vulnerable on the eurozone crisis. Other European leaders have rallied around Hollande's call for a new emphasis on growth alongside debt-cutting. Surprise: Meanwhile, away from the eurozone crisis, French President Francois Hollande made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan today . Trip: Hollande visited some of the French troops he wanted to pull out later this year . On euro bonds, Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SDP) and Greens have taken a similar line to Hollande. But there were signs yesterday they might instead accept a compromise plan to mutualise only a proportion of members' sovereign debts. This would involve mutualising the debts of euro zone countries beyond 60 percent of GDP. The euro crisis has also thrown a spotlight on the vulnerability of commercial banks to a full-blown crisis of confidence in the single currency, especially in the indebted countries of southern Europe, such as Spain. Spain is considering creating a single nationalised bank out of its failed lenders, including problem lender Bankia, if the state cannot find buyers for state-rescued banks, a senior Economy Ministry source said. Bankia, which was part-nationalised just two weeks ago, is also to ask Madrid for £12billion in bailout cash. Meanwhile, away from the eurozone crisis, French President Francois Hollande made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan today. He visited some of the French troops he wants to pull out later this year and meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai, whom he saw briefly last week in Chicago. Hollande, making a whirl of foreign trips since his May 15 inauguration, is accelerating the withdrawal of the roughly 3,400 French troops still stationed in Afghanistan to the end of this year, two years ahead of the NATO timetable. His office said he would pledge to keep to a long-term cooperation treaty signed with Kabul earlier this year. Hollande's new withdrawal timetable is at odds with NATO partners adhering to a plan to hand over command of all combat missions to Afghan forces by the middle of 2013 and withdraw most of the 130,000 foreign troops there by the end of 2014.","Aims to revive Greece in same way as East Germany after Communism .

Sweet guitarist Andy Scott has been landed with a £50,000 bill after suing an Austrian for damages for selling one of the Seventies glam rock band's CDs on eBay for less than £1. Dietmar Huber from Nüziders in Vorarlberg, western Austria, was shocked when he received a letter from a German lawyer accusing him of breaching the British group's copyright. He said he was 'flabbergasted' when he got a bill for €2,000 from Mr Scott after selling the album for one euro (about 80p). Sweet FA: Andy Scott, the guitarist with glam rock band The Sweet (shown here in an old promotional shot), has been landed with a £50,000 bill after suing an Austrian for damages for putting one of the group's CDs on eBay . Mr Huber added: 'When I refused [he] took me to court filing an injunction stopping me from selling the used CD and demanding €36,000 in compensation.' The original claim was that the . album, called The Legend Lives On,  was not genuine and had been downloaded off the internet. But later, after it had been proved that it was authentic, Mr Scott then claimed he owned copyright on the name and that Mr Huber did not have the . right to sell the CD because that infringed his rights. He was not . getting any money and had not authorised the sale and . therefore it was illegal, he claimed. Mr Scott took the case all the way to the Austrian OGH high court. Now, after a five-year legal battle, the OGH has ruled in favour of the man from Vorarlberg, saying no crime was committed. Shocked: Dietmar Huber was 'flabbergasted' when he received a letter from a German lawyer accusing him of breaching British group Sweet's copyright . Paul Rusching, spokesman for the Austrian Consumer Protection Association, said: 'It means that in future Mr Huber and indeed any private CD seller can do such sales without any fear of legal consequences.' The bill for the court hearing as well as Mr Huber's legal costs will now have to be paid by the band. Mr Scott, who turned up in person for the hearing, gave the court a London address. Speaking after the court ruling, Wolfgang Maier, the German lawyer for Scott, said: 'The end result according to the final court of appeal is that copyright and intellectual property protection in Austria is far short of what it should be.' Formed in 1968, Sweet - also known as The Sweet - had hits with songs including Funny Funny (1971) and Blockbuster, which spent five weeks at number one in 1973. Hell Raiser, The Ballroom Blitz and Teenage Rampage all got to number two in the charts in 1973. They had their last top ten hit in 1978 with Love is Like Oxygen. The following year their Scottish lead singer Brian Connolly left the band to go solo and Sweet split up in 1981. Since the 1980s, guitarist Scott, Connolly and bassist Steve Priest have played with different line-ups of Sweet. Connolly died in 1997 and drummer Mick Tucker in 2002, but Scott and Priest still perform in alternate versions of the group. Not so funny funny: Dietmar Huber was able to prove he had legally purchased the CD and that it was not a pirated copy .","Austrian man was 'flabbergasted' when he received bill for €2,000 and legal letter accusing him of breaching musician's copyright .

Yesterday she was pictured in a . hospital with more than 300 stitches in her body, 90 of them in her face . and head while and about 50 more on her hands. Her head was shaved and . her face was swollen. Jennifer's 17-year-old sister . Jozianne, sitting in the lobby of the hospital, recounted the scene in . their home just after the blast struck. Jennifer was on the floor bleeding . while Jozianne said she was thrown by the power of the blast and landed . under a China cabinet where she suffered minor injuries. 'As I opened my eyes I saw that much . of the apartment was turned upside down,' she told reporters. 'I stood . up and started shouting ""Jenny, Jenny"" but no one answered. 'Then I found her next to a couch and . covered with debris that fell from the ceiling,' said Jozianne, who had . a bandage on her left brow from a glass injury. 'I screamed for help but no one . answered,' said Jozianne, wearing a cross around her neck. 'I carried . her and kept talking to her. I did not want her to go unconscious. She . was holding me saying: “Help me”.' Hope: Mrs Shedid, kisses her daughter Jennifer, who was seriously injured during the car bomb attack . Their father Richard was climbing the stairs to the apartment on his way . back from buying bread for the family when the car bomb struck on . Friday afternoon less than 20 meters away, shaking doors and shattering . his home. He grabbed his bleeding daughter from the arms of her older sister Jozianne and rushed her downstairs. 'As I carried her down the stairs, she was trembling and telling me, . ""Please dad rescue me"",' the father told The Associated Press on Monday. 'As we were in the ambulance, she was better but losing lots of blood,' said her father. The blast, which hit the Shedids' narrow residential street in Beirut's . predominantly Christian neighbourhood of Achrafieh, targeted Brigadier . General Wissam al-Hassan, a top intelligence official who was one of the . most powerful opponents of Syria in Lebanon. He was killed along with his bodyguard and a female civilian - a mother . of three. It has sparked angry accusations from Syria's opponents in . Lebanon that Damascus was behind the bombings. Jennifer was one of the dozens wounded in the blast. At her bedside: Richard Shedid (right), the father of Jennifer, visits his daughter in intensive care in Beirut . Helping hand: Jozianne (right), 17, the sister of Jennifer Shedid, is aided by her cousin Rita (left) in Beirut . On Monday, as she lay in her hospital bed she smiled faintly, even . managing to blow kisses to visiting reporters, calling out 'hi, hi.' Antoine Younan, the doctor leading the team treating Jennifer, showed . reporters on Monday a picture of the girl when she arrived at the . hospital. 'Her body was riddled with glass wounds,' he said. Younan said Jennifer is in stable condition. The veins of her right hands, severely damaged by the glass, are healing and she moved her fingers for the first time on Monday. She underwent operations to remove the shards repair her veins and stitch her wounds. Jennifer's mother Nisrin was at work on the other side of the city in the commercial neighbourhood of Hamra when she received a message on her phone about an explosion in her neighbourhood Achrafieh. She jumped into a taxi, but had to get out about a mile away because cars were kept away from the scene to clear the roads for ambulances. Caring: Nisrin Shedid (left), the mother of Shedid, visits her daughter's bedside in intensive care in Beirut . The mobile phone network was overloaded and she could not get through to her husband or children. But she did receive a call from her daughter's school that let her know she had arrived home in her school bus. She ran toward her apartment. ‘I wanted to be with the children so that they would not be afraid,’ she said. When she arrived at her street, security forces prevented her from reaching the building because the area was cordoned off for an investigation of the car bomb. Then she saw something that made her collapse. ‘As I looked at the street, I saw Jennifer's shoes covered with blood,’ Nisrin said. ‘I bit my tongue and fainted.’ She was treated by a paramedic. When she asked him about her daughters, he took her to Jozianne. ‘When I saw the blood on Jozianne's clothes, I knew that Jennifer's injuries were serious,’ Nisrin said. She then received a call from the hospital where Jennifer was being treated and headed over. A few hours after she arrived, Jennifer was taken out of the operating room and she saw her daughter wearing a green hospital gown. ‘I looked at her. My heart broke,’ the mother told journalists outside the Intensive Care Unit where Jennifer has been since Friday. Jennifer, a top student in her 5th grade class, loves drawing and taking pictures with the mobile phones of her parents and sister. She is no fan of science or maths but loves reading and sports. Her favourite cartoon is Tom and Jerry. On Sundays, she goes with her Maronite Christian family to church for prayers. On Monday, Jennifer opened her eyes from the latest operation and started communicating for the first time. ‘My happiness today is beyond explanation,’ said her mother Nisrin.","Blast happened last Friday outside Jennifer Shedid's apartment in Beirut .

It is hailed as the future of mobile phones – but the superfast 4G service will cost at least £5 a month extra, despite evidence the network is cheaper to run. Users will also have to fork out hundreds of pounds for a smartphone that can use the system, such as Apple’s iPhone 5 or Nokia’s Lumia 920. Britain’s first 4G network is being launched by EE in London and nine other cities next week. Superfast: Users will have to spend hundreds of pounds on a smartphone such as the iPhone 5 (left) and Nokia's Lumia 920 (right) if they want access to the 4G network . The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than the current 3G network. But the technology is so powerful that it burns through smartphone battery life, meaning handsets need to be recharged more often. EE customers who upgrade to 4G packages will pay anything from £36 to £56 a month based on the amount of data downloads they sign up for. This is some £5 a month more than they would have paid under their existing deals for a similar package. On top of that, customers must buy a . new handset – which could cost anything from £110 to £270 extra, . depending on their monthly subscription and subsidy available under . their contract. The 4G . technology makes it possible to squeeze more data into a smaller slice . of the airwaves, which makes it cheaper to transmit vast amounts of . information compared with 3G. Consequently, 4G actually costs less to . run on a day-to-day basis. The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to suft the web five times faster than the current 3G network . But EE – an amalgamation of the Orange and T-Mobile networks – insists its decision to charge more is justified. Spokesman David Nieberg said: ‘There is a small premium that customers will pay for using a superfast network, one that is five times faster than 3G. In all other markets around the world, consumers are paying a premium to access 4G. ‘We think what is effectively a £5 premium is incredibly competitive.’ EE effectively has a monopoly over the 4G technology until its rivals can launch services in the second half of next year. EE justified the higher cost by saying it is investing huge sums in setting up the 4G network. A spokesman said: ‘We have been, and continue, to invest £1.5bn over the three years – that’s £1.4m per day – to create a new digital backbone for Britain.’ The firm confirmed that 4G does drain batteries, however it said handset manufacturers are partly negating this through developing bigger batteries and more efficient software.","Users will also have to spend hundreds on new handsets .

Education Secretary Michael Gove is facing calls for every child to be taught the national anthem at school. Tory MP Nicholas Soames, grandson of wartime PM Winston Churchill, wants learning the words of God Save The Queen to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum. And TV presenter and Liberal Democrat peer Floella Benjamin has called for pupils to sing the anthem at the start of each day. Scroll down for video . Schoolchildren should learn the words of the national anthem as part of the national curriculum, Tory MP Nicholas Soames said . This summer some Olympic athletes faced criticism for not singing the anthem and England football manager Roy Hodgson ordered his players to learn the words for the Euro 2012 tournament. Mr Soames said learning the words was a vital part of being British, and if the government was serious about encouraging a sense of citizenship the national anthem should be on the curriculum. He told MailOnline: ‘Now we live in such a diverse society I think it is very important that all schoolchildren in Great Britain are taught the national anthem. ‘I am absolutely amazed that they are . not. I think people would be surprised if they knew that people who . live in this country do not know the words of the anthem. ‘It is extraordinary that the . government bangs on about citizenship and then be completely ambivalent . about whether or not people know the national anthem.' Tory MP Nicholas Soames said if children were to learn about British citizenship and history they should also be taught the words to the national anthem. HIs grandfather was Word War Two Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Mr Soames added: ‘I think it should be compulsory. Maybe at the end of term and on special occasions. ‘As one cannot rely on parents to teach anyone anything these days, it is something schools should do.’ God save our gracious Queen!Long live our noble Queen!God save the Queen!Send her victorious,Happy and glorious,Long to reign over us,God save the Queen. Thy choicest gifts in storeOn her be pleased to pour,Long may she reign.May she defend our laws,And ever give us cause,To sing with heart and voice,God save the Queen. He tabled a parliamentary question asking the Department for Education to adopt a ‘policy that children in all schools in England are taught the National Anthem’. But education minister Liz Truss replied: ‘It is a matter for individual schools to decide whether to teach pupils the National Anthem.’ Now Mr Soames  plans to raise the matter personally with Mr Gove, ‘because I don’t think it is good enough’. He added: ‘I can see some bolshie left wing headteacher refusing to teach the national anthem to their children. ‘I just think we do now live in a very diverse nation and our unwritten constitution and everything that goes with it – the church, the crown, the law – if we are going to teach that which we must if people are going to love the country, they should know the national anthem.’ A source close to Mr Gove said: 'Michael thinks this is a fantastic idea and supports what Nicholas is saying ultimately this is up to local schools to decide.' Earlier this year Baroness Benjamin used a debate in the House of Lords to suggest the anthem should be sung at the start of each school day. Winners of the Men's Four Final Alex Gregory, Peter Reed, Tom James and Andrew Triggs Hodge were among the Team GB athletes who sang the national anthem after winning a gold medal . England manager Roy Hodgson told his players they had to sing the National Anthem during the Euro 2012 tournament . The former Play School presenter told peers: ‘I loved my school days. Starting back in Trinidad, where I was born, we sang the national anthem at the beginning of each school day. ‘It gave me a sense of national pride, which has served me well. ‘Seeing young children waving their union jacks with pride during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, it occurred to me that perhaps we should start each school day with the singing of our national anthem so that they have a sense of national pride embedded in their psyche-because the feeling of being proud of who you are is the best confidence booster, which in turn helps with learning.’ In June Mr Hodgson asked England's players to sing the National Anthem in unison in one of his first initiatives as manager. Former players said it was the first time they could remember the whole team singing together at the start of a match. During the London Olympic and Paralympic Games some of the most emotional scenes came when the anthem was played when Team GB athletes were presented with gold medals. Angered by the sight of some sportsmen and women not joining in, newspaper columnist Piers Morgan pledged to donate £1,000  to Great Ormond Street Hospital every time a British winner sang the national anthem in their medals ceremony.","Education Secretary Michael Gove insists it is up to schools to choose whether to teach God Save The Queen .

'Shaken beyond belief': Sarah Newton, who was made deputy chairman of the Tory party last month, said she had always thought of osteoporosis as an 'old woman's disease' A rising star of the Conservative Party has spoken of her shock at being diagnosed with osteoporosis after falling outside the Houses of Parliament and breaking her hip. Sarah Newton, who was made deputy chairman of the party last month, said she was ‘shaken beyond belief’ at learning she had developed – at 51 – what she had always thought of as an ‘old woman’s disease’. Her surprise was compounded when doctors revealed that the likely culprit  was a chronic shortage of vitamin D, caused by a lack of sunlight. After her accident in May, Mrs Newton, a mother of three, spent almost four months in a wheelchair and on crutches. After a brief period of recuperation she  managed to continue working and attend key debates in the Commons. She has decided to speak out for the first time to mark World Osteoporosis Day and to encourage other women to take simple steps to protect their health. Osteoporosis, or brittle bone disease, is a hidden condition that many don’t realise they have until it is well advanced. Half of all women and one in five men over 50 will at some point suffer a fracture because of poor bone health. Three million have been diagnosed with the disease, which is often the cause of the so-called ‘dowager’s hump’ in the elderly. However an increasing number of younger men and women in their 20s and 30s are also developing osteoporosis due to poor diet or eating disorders. Last year the Duchess of Cornwall wrote a moving first-hand account of the deaths of her mother and grandmother to the disease exclusively for the Daily Mail to raise awareness of the condition. Mrs Newton, who won her seat of Truro and Falmouth at the 2010 election, vividly recalls reading the Duchess’s front page article, not realising that she had the disease herself. ‘I always thought, as many people do, of osteoporosis as an old woman’s disease. ‘I just wouldn’t have thought it would affect a busy, fairly healthy working mum like me,’ she said. Mrs Newton, who has been married to husband Alan for 25 years and has three children aged 22, 20 and 15, was rushing to a meeting outside Parliament when she tripped on the pavement and fell. When a cup of tea and couple of painkillers didn’t stop the pain she went to St Thomas’s Hospital where doctors found she had broken her hip. ‘Thankfully the doctors there were very switched on and realised that something must be badly wrong for a woman of my age to suffer such a catastrophic break, simply by tripping on the pavement,’ she said. Soon afterwards she was diagnosed as having osteoporosis and was told her body was chronically short of vitamin D, essential for building healthy bones and absorbed into the body through sunlight. ‘The irony that, as a very fair skinned woman, I had been slapping Factor 50 sun cream over myself for years to prevent skin cancer but had probably caused my body to develop something equally serious, was horrifying,’ she said. Since her diagnosis Mrs Newton has been taking vitamin D and calcium supplements and will be seeing a consultant to discuss other options this month. ‘Although I was terribly shocked at the time, I feel that what happened really has been a blessing as I could have gone on for years and years with my bones getting weaker and weaker. At least now I have the chance to do something about it.’ For information and advice about osteoporosis, contact the National Osteoporosis Society on nos.org.uk. The charity also runs a helpline 0845 4500230, open 9am-5pm Monday to Friday.","Sarah Newton was diagnosed after falling outside the Houses of Parliament .

Britain's over-50s lost an average of £60,000 during the worst of the credit crunch, a study from a leading think-tank reveals today. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the richest 20 per cent of the over-50s saw an average of £162,500 wiped off their assets. The loss is a combination of the fall in the value of their home and the drop in the value of their investments, such as tax-free Isas and  their shareholdings. Impact: The richest 20 per cent of over 50s have seen an average £162,000 wiped off their assets thanks to economic downturn, while the average lost was nearly £60,000 . The IFS report says: ‘The impact on this age group may be of particular concern because they are unlikely to be able to make up the losses  later in life.’ The IFS looked at the impact on personal finances of households in England that contained at least one over-50 between May 2007 and March 2009, the height of the credit crunch. These households lost an average of £59,992, equal to 10 per cent of their assets, with £26,666 knocked off  their investments and £33,359 off  the value of their home. The richest families lost a total of £162,465 – £86,217 of their investments and £75,585 from the value of their home. Innocent: Dr Ros Altmann said that the over 50s were victims of financial problems caused by irresponsible borrowing and lending . Dr Ros Altmann, of old age specialists Saga, said: ‘The over-50s are innocent victims of the financial problems caused by irresponsible borrowing and lending by others. ‘Middle-class pension savers are finding that the income they were expecting will not materialise, due to falls in the value of their investments or rises in the costs of buying annuities. Many are faced with the stark choice of selling their home to release some money to live on, or continuing to work to make ends meet.’ A separate report out today has found that many older people expect they ‘will never retire’. Rural investment firm NFU Mutual estimates that 1.4million people  aged over 64 are still working – and that four in ten said they will work until they drop. Steven Meredith, a pension specialist at NFU Mutual, said: ‘For growing numbers of people, retirement  might not be one option they can afford to take. ‘At the root of this problem is a mismatch between expectation and reality. More people need to make financial provisions for their retirement to bridge this gap.’ The IFS said millions of people aged between 50 and State pension age have a poor, or non-existent, pension. It found 41 per cent will retire on less than two-thirds of their salary on retirement. It is only when other sources of income, such as inheritances and other savings, are taken into account that the number drops to just 10 per cent. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘The good news is more of us are living longer. ‘This means people are going to have to work beyond the traditional retirement age if they are to afford a good quality of life in retirement, and that’s why the state pension age will rise over the coming years for men and for women.’","Richest 20 per cent of over-50s lost £162,500 .

Schools must not bar children from their sixth forms just because they are badly behaved, the local government ombudsman has ruled. They are prohibited from ‘taking account of a pupil’s past behaviour’ when allocating places on A-level courses even if they fear disruption. This is despite Education Secretary Michael Gove urging schools to clamp down on classroom troublemakers. Push: Education Secretary Michael Gove has urged schools to clamp down on classroom troublemakers . The problems facing head teachers trying to take a hard line against indiscipline have come to light just months after the new school admissions code came into effect in February. The Latymer School, a top-performing mixed grammar in Edmonton, North London, was yesterday accused of ‘maladministration causing injustice’ after refusing to allow a pupil to join its sixth form because of an incident of poor behaviour. It was told by the ombudsman to ‘immediately’ admit the former Year 11 pupil. It is understood the boy was temporarily excluded for a ‘minor indiscretion’. The ombudsman said that because the teenager had ‘satisfied the academic requirements to join the sixth form, he should have been admitted’. Claim: The Latymer School in Edmonton, North London, was accused of 'maladministration causing injustice' after refusing to allow a pupil to join its sixth form because of an incident of poor behaviour .

Head teacher Mark Garbett wrote to the boy’s father on April 26 to notify him about the fixed-term exclusion.

His explanation baffled his rescuers because the incident had occurred at 4.30 in the morning. While he was in the skip, he said, he realised it was suddenly being lifted up and he, along with piles of rubbish, was dumped into the rear of the compactor truck.

Checks carried out to assess people being moved onto a new benefit revealed thousands were able to carry out at least some work. The Department for Work and Pensions said new claims for the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) showed that 54 per cent of people assessed could do some work, while 46 per cent were eligible for the benefit. The figures, for the quarter to February, also showed that one in four of those assessed were put in a group given unconditional support as they were too ill or disabled to work. Those found fit for work will be helped through initiatives like the Work Programme to find a job. ESA replaced Incapacity Benefit in 2008. Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘We know that many people with disabilities or health conditions want to work and that the old Incapacity Benefit system simply wrote them off to a lifetime on benefits. ‘We are determined to carry on improving the assessment so those who are too unwell to work get the financial support they need, while those who can work get the help they need to get a job. ‘With annual independent reviews and by working with medical experts and charities, we have substantially improved the Work Capability Assessment process, which is resulting in a fairer system.’","Incapacity Benefit is being replaced by Employment and Support Allowance .

The Queen arrived for Royal Ascot today amid all the pomp and pageantry expected at the first day of the world-famous race meet. As befits Royal tradition dating back 300 years to when Queen Anne founded the Royal Ascot in 1711, the monarch, accompanied by Prince Philip in the horse-drawn royal carriage, led a procession from from Windsor Castle to the Berkshire race course this afternoon. The Queen, whose choice of hat colour is always the subject of frenzied bets, looked immaculate as ever in a powder blue dress and coat by Stewart Parvin. The colour would have come to no surprise to Royal fashion watchers, who recently found that the Queen last year chose to wear blue on 29 per cent of her public engagements - three times as often as she wore any other colour. Her trimmed hat, by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, matched the fabric of her coat perfectly, and on her lapel she wore an impressive diamond and aquamarine brooch. Prince Philip, who has recovered well . from the nasty bladder infection that saw him admitted to hospital . following the Jubilee weekend celebrations, sat beside his wife for the . short journey.

In her element: The Queen has seen 63 of her horses win at Ascot over the years. RIGHT, Prince Philip accompanied his wife to the meet today . The Queen was greeted by cheers and applause as she arrived at the course, and shouts of God save the Queen rang out around the parade ground as she entered in the royal carriage. The royal couple waved at the crowds as they made their way down the racecourse, many racegoers giving three cheers for the Queen as the carriage went past. Umbrellas had been stowed away in each carriage, but despite a few clouds in the sky, the sun shone on the royals. The Queen and Philip were joined by the Viscount Ullswater and Lord Vestey. The Duchess of Cornwall, following in the second carriage with the Prince of Wales, wore a stone-coloured dress and coat by Anna Valentine, a Philip Treacy hat and gold Jimmy Choo shoes. One cheeky racegoer shouted out: 'Charlie!' as the carriage went by, causing the Prince of Wales to turn around with a smile and wave. Princess Eugenie, riding in the third carriage, cut a sophisticated figure in a teal dress with black lace shoulder detail and a fishtail skirt, a remake of a vintage dress made for her by Christine Atkinson. Family affair: The Queen was joined by Camilla, in metallic-trimmed beige coat, and Eugenie, in teal dress, for today's meet .

'As I reflect on the last 60 years, . much has changed for our world and of course for Ascot racecourse. However, one constant is that each year the eyes of all those who love . horseracing are upon these beautiful surroundings during this special . week in June.

'I would like to thank you for the . welcome my family and I have always received at Royal Ascot and to wish . you all a most enjoyable day.' The Queen, an avid racing fan, moved from the parade ground to the Royal Box to watch the day's action. Royal Ascot has honoured the Queen by re-naming a race to mark the monarch's 60-year reign. The Diamond, formerly Golden, Jubilee Stakes, will be run on Saturday - the last day of the five-day sporting event.

She has owned 63 Ascot winners so far, 20 of them winning at Royal Ascot. Off to place a bet: Thousands of racegoers are expected to flood through the gates of the Berkshire course today . Little Bridge ridden by Zac Purton wins the Kings Stand Stakes during day one of the 2012 Royal Ascot meeting . For the many visitors, Royal Ascot is . more than a sporting occasion; it is also a social and fashion event . for the 300,000 spectators who will flock to the Berkshire racecourse . this week. This year . organisers have raised the bar in the sartorial stakes by tightening and . clarifying the dress code at the annual summer event, including . imposing a ban on fascinators in the royal enclosure. The move comes amid criticisms of . sartorial standards which have been loosely enforced in recent years, . but help will be on hand from a team of specially trained 'dress code . assistants'. A selection of waistcoats, ties, pashminas and other items will be available at the turnstiles for those who need them. In the royal enclosure, fascinators - which are often favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge - are no longer deemed acceptable. Women . will also be expected to wear skirts or dresses of 'modest length' which fall just above the knee or longer. This clarifies previous . guidance which stated miniskirts were 'considered unsuitable'. Strapless, . off the shoulder, halter neck, spaghetti straps and dresses with a . strap of less than one inch (2.5cm) are not permitted and midriffs must . be covered. For men, black . or grey morning dress with a waistcoat and tie are now compulsory in . this area of the course and cravats will not be allowed. A black or grey . top hat and black shoes must also be worn. In . the grandstand, which is open to the public and subject to less . stringent rules, a hat or fascinator will be compulsory for women. For . men, a suit and tie will now be imperative. Royal Ascot's Ladies' Day, held this year on Thursday, will see outlandish and incredible hats worn by female race goers. The . racecourse is also staging an exhibition titled 60 Years of Royal Ascot . during the Reign of Her Majesty the Queen, which will be on display for . the duration of the meeting. Johnny . Weatherby, the Queen's representative at Ascot, said: 'Royal Ascot has a . long standing and privileged affiliation with the Queen, whose first . winner at the event was in 1953 with Choir Boy who landed the Royal Hunt . Cup. 'The Queen has owned . no fewer than 63 Ascot winners, 20 of them at the royal meeting, and . it's always a great thrill for everyone when the royal colours are . successful.

The London 2012 Games ended up £377million under budget, new figures showed today. The overall cost of the Games is forecast to come in at £8.921billion from a budget of £9.298billion. But this was still much higher than the original £2.4billion cost forecast when the bid was won in 2005. The original budget for the London 2012 Games was £2.4billion, but rose to more than £9billion . Today the government hailed the underspend as 'prudent'. Sports minister Hugh Robertson said: 'The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA (Olympic Delivery Authority) and Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games), has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future.' Attempts to claw back millions from security firm G4s for its failure to provide thousands of guards just weeks before the Games started are still ongoing. Mr Robertson said: 'There are projected savings of at least £377 million so the predictions that I made this summer that we could bring this project in at under £9 billion has almost certainly been met. 'Locog also have to conclude, and we have to sign off, the negotiations with G4S over the size of the amount of money that will be paid back to the public purse - so if you were to add to that £377 million, anything that will not be used but is held against outstanding work and anything that might come back from G4S, it is entirely reasonable to expect that figure to rise.' The Aquatics Centre on the Olympic Park will eventually be opened to the public . The Olympic Delivery Authority's construction and transport programme came in £47million below the previous estimated figure . Some £103million of contingency is being held to cover the remaining risks in the programme. These include the retrofit of the Olympic Village to get it ready for use when it reopens after the Games. There are also around 2,000 contracts with the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), the Olympic builders and London 2012 which still have to be closed out. In addition, £480million of uncommitted contingency still remains within the budget.The ODA's construction and transport programme has come in at £6.714billion, according to the estimates. This is a drop of £47 million on the previous estimated figure. The savings made by the ODA are now at £1.032 billion. ODA chief executive Dennis Hone said: 'We are pleased to report even more savings made through careful stewardship of public money. We are now entering the final phase of the ODA's work, transforming the Olympic Village into thousands of new homes and building a community that will become established, grow and mature in the decades ahead - a London 2012 legacy for generations to come.'","Ministers hail figures as proof of a 'prudent' Games .

Scheme: Igor Borodin has pleaded guilty to buying fake airbags from China and selling them on eBay . A car mechanic has pleaded guilty to trafficking thousands of counterfeit airbags in deals that made him more than $1.4 million dollars in a year. Igor Borodin, who co-owns an auto shop in Charlotte, North Carolina, allegedly bought an estimated 7,000 fake airbags from China and sold them on eBay between February 2011 and May 2012. One of the airbags sold by Borodin through eBay was independently tested and failed to inflate properly, court records showed, the Charlotte Observer reported. The plea comes just two weeks after the U.S. government warned that 'tens of thousands' of drivers who have had airbags replaced in the last three years could be affected by this sort of scheme. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the fake airbags might not deploy in an accident or could explode, sending metal shrapnel into the vehicle's passenger cabin. 'My office will not allow fake airbags to endanger the safety of the drivers in our communities,' U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins said as she announced Borodin's guilty pleas. 'Airbags that do not meet the quality and safety standards of the automobile manufacturers pose a serious threat to human life because they fail to work when they are needed the most – during a car accident.' As well as trafficking charges, which carries a 10-year prison sentence and a $2 million fine, Borodin faces a delivering hazardous charge, punishable by five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Fears: Borodin allegedly sold more than 7,000 fake airbags that failed to inflate properly (file picture) The charge comes after he failed to display the 'hazardous material warnings' on the airbags when they were transported from China to the U.S., as it legally required, court documents states. Transporting airbags, which are classed as dangerous goods, without the warnings pose a safety risk to anyone transporting and handling them, federal prosecutors said, the Observer reported. Authorities first investigated Borodin in 2011 when a federal investigation into the sale of the fake airbags in Tennessee found he was involved, court documents said. They intercepted airbags before taking 20 more after he changed his address. They later searched his home and found 1,514 fake airbags with thousands of dollars in cash, authorities said. Scene: Borodin was identified as a co-owner of Krugger Auto, where police found fake airbags . They also found 99 of the airbags at his auto shop, Krugger Auto, where he was part owner. Borodin remains in the Mecklenburg County jail, where he has been since his arrest in August. It comes after the government warnings against the airbags, which NHTSA testing has shown don't inflate or fail to inflate properly. In at least . one case, a counterfeit bag fired shards of metal shrapnel on impact, . the agency said. No . deaths or injuries have been tied to the counterfeit bags, it added. NHTSA . compiled a list of dozens of vehicle makes and models for which . counterfeit air bags may be available, but the agency cautioned that the . full scope of the problem is not yet clear. Warning: At a press conference in Washington earlier this month, David Strickland from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warned against the spread of counterfeit airbags . Frightening: At the press conference, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton warned the fake airbags can also explode, sending metal shrapnel into the passenger cabin . If a car is . on the list and has had its air bags replaced during the past three . years by a repair shop other than a new car dealership, NHTSA is asking . owners to bring the vehicle into a dealership to be inspected at their . own expense to determine whether the replaced air bags are counterfeit. Fees . for checking out air bags could run $100 or more, industry officials . said. Some types of cars have as many as eight air bags. The counterfeit bags typically have been . made to look like air bags made by automakers and usually include a . manufacturer's logo.

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 24 November 2011 . No X-ray needed here: Corinne Theile poses in her bikini at LAX in protest of TSA security checks . It’s been a year since Californian holidaymaker Corinne Theile first stripped down to her bikini at Los Angeles International Airport in protest of ‘invasive’ security screening. And to mark the anniversary, the 32-year-old returned to the airport in a two-piece once more, declaring that she’ll continue to do so even when she’s 80. Corinne, dubbed the ‘Bikini Girl’, has worn her swimsuit on seven flights over the past 12 months in dispute of TSA full body scanners. Miss Theile believes that the scanners release low levels of radiation and she said yesterday: ‘If I’m 80 and I can go through security in a bikini, I’ll do it.’ Instead of using TSA (Transportation Security Administration) security checks, which include the use of backscatter X-ray and millimetre wave detection, Corinne would rather wear her bikini so security officers can see she has nothing to hide. The enhanced X-ray screening procedures were brought into effect at all U.S. airports in November last year to allow security officers to detect both metal and non-metal weapons hidden in passengers’ clothing. TSA officials said the heightened security measures were introduced in reaction to the ‘underwear bomber’ who smuggled plastic explosives onto a flight leaving Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport en route to the U.S. in 2009. But when the new security checks were brought in last year, many Americans were left furious at the rigid rules. Corinne told local media outside LAX last November: ‘I feel like the TSA is making travellers feel uncomfortable, and I feel like we can have security measures that don’t make people feel uncomfortable. ‘Every time I go through security I always say, ‘’I don’t even know why I got dressed this morning.’’ I end up taking off belts, jewellery and everything else off anyway. Strip check: Corinne Theile arrived at LAX in a warm winter coat and boots before stripping down to her swimsuit . Nothing to declare: The 32-year-old smiled as she made her way through security in the bikini . ‘I don’t want to do a body scan and I’m hoping by wearing a bikini they will see everything they need to see and we can avoid a pat-down, as well.’ And joining Corinne in her protest last November at airports around the U.S. were a small group of fellow passengers who stripped down to their underwear to demonstrate their opinions. One male passenger, named only as Jimmy, arrived at Salt Lake City Airport in a pair of Speedos with body paint written on his back that spelled out the words: ‘Screw Big Sis’. And an aspiring porn-star filmed herself stripping to her underwear at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and told TSA officials that she was ‘going to enjoy this experience as much as I can instead of being scared and humiliated like the TSA wants me to be.’ Committed to her cause: The bikini girl said at LAX: 'If I'm 80 and I can go through security in a bikini, I'll do it' Covered up: Corinne speaks to an airport security guard as her belongings are checked by the officer . A TSA spokesperson said at the time that the agency, which works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, must balance people’s demands for privacy with the need to protect passengers from terror threats. While New York Mayor Michael Boomberg urged travellers to get over their outrage about the body scanners and patdowns saying it is necessary in the ‘dangerous world we life in.’ He said: ‘We have to stop all this shilly-shallying and understand if you want to be safe on air planes we have to make sure that we keep you safe.’ Flashback: Last year Corinne (pictured) claimed she was hoping that by baring nearly all, she could avoid having to endure a pat-down by TSA officials .

"Double amputee smashed his personal best to qualify for London 2011 . Oscar Pistorius had his legs amputated when he was 11 months old . Now runs on carbon-fibre prosthetic running blades . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:31 EST, 21 July 2011 . After a long battle to compete with able-bodied athletes, South African double amputee Oscar Pistorius has qualified for the 2012 London Olympics and next month's world championships by smashing his 400m personal best. Pistorious, known as 'Blade Runner' because he runs on carbon fibre prosthetic running blades, recorded a new personal best of 45.07 seconds for the 400m race in Lignano, Italy yesterday.Pistorius, 24, who had both legs amputated when he was just 11-months-old because of a congenital disorder, said: 'It was like a dream race. Chasing his dream: Oscar Pistorius races to his personal best of 45.07 seconds in Lignano, Italy . Going to Olympics: The South African, seen after his wining race, has now qualified to compete with able-bodied athletes . 'I just have not been able to sleep. I must have 300 messages congratulating me. 'I am sure tomorrow when I wake up it (the accomplishment) is going to hit me. It is really humbling to know I have gotten so much support from everyone.' The winning performance means Pistorius has made history to become the first amputee sprinter to qualify for the world championships, which begin on August 27 in Daegu, South Korea. A multiple Paralympic gold medalist, the South African had sought for years to compete in the world championships and Olympics. Speeding ahead: After a long battle, Oscar Pistorius has been allowed to compete with able-bodied athletes and has now qualified for next month's world championships . Oscar Pistorius was born with congenital absence of the fibula in both legs. When he was 11 months old, his legs were amputated halfway between his . knees and ankles. Congenital absence of the fibula is a . congenital disorder where in one or both legs there is a fibrous band . instead of the fibula. The result tends to be a short deformed leg, an absence of part of the ankle joint, and what is left is unstable and the foot has a deformity, or an absence of part of the foot. Sometimes the foot can be brought into normal function; sometimes it must be amputated. Pistorius's new time would have earned him fifth place in the men's 400m final in the 2008 Olympics and the runner was overwhelmed at his achievement. 'With 180 metres out, I just decided to set out for the end, and I really ran a very comfortable last 100 metres,' he said. 'It is kind of strange because I broke my personal best by half a second, which is ridiculous.' Pistorius was born with a congenital absence of the fibula - the calf bone. The Court of Arbitration for Sport gave him a chance to compete with able-bodied athletes in May 2008, when it ruled in his favour after a long legal battle with the International Association of Athletics Federations over the use of his running blades, which the IAAF said gave him an unfair advantage. In January 2008 the IAAF claimed that Pistorious's blades . required him to use 25 per cent less energy than his rivals to run at the same . speed. But the determined athlete argued that he was running at a disadvantage, with less blood in his body and no calf muscles, and Cas ruled he could compete with his blades. But after the CAS decision, he failed to record a time inside the Olympic qualifying mark and missed the Beijing Games, although he won the 100m, 200m and 400m at the Beijing Paralympics. The CAS stressed that any . advancements in the prosthetic-limb technology used by Pistorius could . be contested by the IAAF again.

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 04:12 EST, 3 February 2012 . The family of a young Florida man who was killed in a car crash last year has been left ‘devastated' by their loss, their lawyer said. Lili and William Wilson are seeking an unspecified amount of compensation from International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, 48 after he was accused of drunk driving in the February 2010 accident. Last fall, he adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins, who is now entitled to up to a third of his biological children's massive trust fund. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Newest family member: John Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall . Goodman’s attorney Daniel Bachi issued a statement saying that the . adoption of his girlfriend was intended to help the Trust for his . biological children, Harriet and John, Jr. He wrote: ‘The adoption of Ms Hutchins should have no effect on the . civil proceedings as none of the assets belong to Mr Goodman.’ According to Mr Bachi, Goodman’s assets are worth more than $300million. Scott Wilson, a 23-year-old graduate of the University of Central Florida, was killed in 2010 . ‘The legal adoption of Ms Hutchins does not change that in any way. Ms . Hutchins has no obligation whatsoever to give John B. Goodman a dime.’ Another contract between the two states that at least 95 per cent of the trust will ‘ultimately’ go to Harriet and John Jr. He stressed that there is nothing illegal about the adoption. The Wilsons’ lawyer Christian Searcy claims that Goodman still has a . high degree of control over his children’s trust, court papers show. Goodman is being sued by Wilson’s parents for wrongful death. According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal. Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported. ‘My reaction was that it was both awful and brilliant,’ Belray Beach adoption attorney Charlotte Danciu told CBS12.com. The adoption papers state that Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. Goodman and Ms Hutchins began dating in 2009, according to her testimony. The Wilsons’ attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman is attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. ‘It cannot go unrecognised that (Goodman) chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper. Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court ‘into a legal twilight zone.’ The trial: John Goodman's lawyer said in court that the adoption has nothing to do with his pending criminal trial . Wreckage: Goodman is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter after police reports show he ran a stop sign and slammed into Scott Wilson's Hyundai, right . Ms Danciu agreed. ‘Unless you intend to create the parent-child relationship, you are violating the letter of the law,’ she told CBS12.com. Arrested: John Goodman faces a criminal trial in March for the DUI death of Wilson . Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer. He had been driving his Hyundai home . to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times . when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign. Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned. Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show. He will be criminally tried March 6, facing charges of DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. He could spend up to 30 years in prison if found guilty, the Palm Beach Post reports. The civil trial will be some weeks later on March 27. Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told myfoxorlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. ‘It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Goodman’s father was the late Harold Goodman, who built a fortune from a heating and air conditioning manufacturing business. His family sold the business in 2004 for a reported $1.4 billion. He converted his father’s horse farm into a polo ranch and later began building his empire. His club became a magnate for the rich and famous, entertaining the likes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sylvester Stallone, and Charlton Heston. Even Madonna was spotted at the club, attending an International Polo Club match in 2009. Goodman’s wealth is a point of a heated dispute. The Palm Beach New Times questioned the heir’s true assets, quoting Mr Wilson’s lawyer. Attorney Chris Searcy said Goodman is much richer than his financial documents show. He is seeking punitive damages that will ‘sting (Goodman) badly without bankrupting him,’ Mr Searcy told the New Times. Celebrity hot spot: John Goodman and Hilary Duff, left, pose with an elephant At International Polo Club annual Polo Ball black-tie gala in 2007 . According to the website, Mr Searcy thinks Goodman’s wealth is buried in numerous trusts and companies, and is as ‘sophisticated’ a method as he’s ever seen. The financial battle has been closely tied to the wrongful death suit. In 2002, the mogul sold his Wellington estate to his children’s trust fund for $3.8million, according to the New Times. But he only rents it for $2,000 per month. According to an August 2011 report by the Palm Beach Post, his two children have more than $200 million in their trust funds. Mr Searcy suspects he has full control over those trusts. Mr Searcy also said in court that Goodman has an airplane, yacht, polo ponies, and an unspecified amount of his father’s $1.4billion fortune from Goodman Manufacturing.

In a 2006 document, Goodman claimed one of his trusts was worth more than $100 million. Mr Searcy pointed out that Goodman claimed in 2011 that trust was only worth $6.9 million. The Wilsons have already settled privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had been drinking in February 2010. They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated. Lifestyles of the rich and famous: Goodman owns the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida . The bartenders deposed that Goodman wasn’t noticeably drunk. Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage. In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children. Jeanne T. Tate, a fellow of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years. She told MailOnline that while nothing illegal was done when John Goodman adopted his girlfriend, she’s seen many cases where adoption ‘is used for purposes other than what you’d traditionally think it was intended.’ In Florida, adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions. She explained: ‘A lot of the traditional adoption statutes- including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you’re adopting an adult, with less government intrusion being the goal.’ She said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter. Under Florida law, they do have to give notice of the adoption, though Ms Tate notes that parental consent is not required. ‘The court may not have been aware of many things,’ she said, ‘including that there was a pending wrongful death suit, or that she was a girlfriend.’ When asked if is now legal for Goodman to have sex with his daughter, Ms Tate responded: ‘That’s a good question. I’m not a criminal lawyer, but it’s a solid question to wonder about.’ She said that because they’re both adults and not biologically related, the question’s answer is murky. ‘Creepy,’ she said,’ but I don’t know if that’s illegal.’ Attorney Wayne Richter told MailOnline that under Florida law, the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie, such as aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. Ms Tate said that should Goodman wish to marry Ms Hutchins after the criminal case, it would be a difficult endeavour. The statute, she said, is permanent in the eyes of the law. ‘Even for fraud of duress, you have to bring the challenges in front of the court.’ In Florida, all adoption papers are sealed and cannot be viewed by reporters or third parties. ‘A court could order the file open,’ Ms Tate said,’ but it is difficult to do’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities. Ms Hutchins could in theory, with the consent of Goodman, be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him, Ms Tate said.During Goodman’s civil case, Ms Tate said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee (Ms Hutchins). She added: ‘There’s nothing illegal, per se, about adopting your girlfriend.’ Watch the video here: .","John Goodman, 48, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last October; couple began dating in 2009 .

Then Barbara came out and . said that he had fallen asleep. At that point Ruby slipped inside and . closed the door. ‘She managed to wake up the sleeping prime minister. She did it all herself – he is of a certain age.’ Miss Conceicao’s claims came as Berlusconi’s trial for allegedly having sex with Mahroug resumed in Milan. In Italy, the age of consent is 14, . but paying for sex with a woman below the age of 18 is seen as underage . prostitution and punishable by up to three years in prison. Prosecutors . claim that Berlusconi, 75, gave a string of women cash, jewellery and . cars to attend his parties. Miss Conceicao added: ‘All the girls . who were paid went with him. Those that stayed the night got 5,000 euros . or maybe more, the others who didn’t stay got at the most 1,000 or . 2,000 euros.' She also claimed that two ‘very . famous’ names were among Berlusconi’s favourite women and she was . willing to testify about them when she gives evidence at the trial later . this month. Miss Conceicao said she had been due . to testify last month but was unable to do so because she was in Brazil, . adding that Berlusconi had called her and made a veiled threat about . her evidence. She said: ‘Berlusconi called me and he . spoke with me. He said, “When there is a storm at sea you never throw . anybody overboard.” I think it was his way of telling me not to tell the . truth. I’m scared something will happen to me.’ Her claims were dismissed by Berlusconi’s lawyers as ‘completely unfounded’. Star witnesses:  Footballer Christiano Ronaldo and actor George Clooney are among dozens of witnesses due to give evidence at the trial . A witness at the trial yesterday said women invited to bunga bunga parties called the former premier ‘Betty’. Another guest Barbara Faggioli said . they used the codename in case their telephones were being wiretapped. The word ‘shoes’ was used for money. Wearing a diamond necklace that . Berlusconi had given her for her birthday, Miss Faggioli said: . ‘Berlusconi always gave me help as if he were my father’, adding that he . paid the rent on her Milan apartment and gave her money if she needed . it. ‘It’s just the way he is, he is very gentlemanly,’ she said, denying the gifts and money were in exchange for sex. Outside court, Miss Faggioli said Miss Conceicao’s claims were ‘all b******s’. Berlusconi has . insisted that nothing untoward happened at his parties and that they . were merely convivial evenings of 'fine food and music' and Miss El . Mahroug, who is also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, also says nothing . happened between them. Prosecutors say that at the time of the parties Miss El Mahroug was only 17 years old and although in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying for sex with a woman below the age of 18 is seen as under age prostitution and it is punishable by up to three years in prison. The trial has been going on for a year and has already heard from several witnesses who described how women would dress as nuns and police officers before stripping off while performing seductive pole dances for Berlusconi and two of his cronies at the parties which took place between 2009 and 2010. Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had Karima freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. The trial continues and is not expected to finish until the autumn with dozens of witnesses due to testify including George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.","Berlusconi, 75, is accused of having sex with prostitute Karima El Mahroug, when she was just 17 years old .

Politics is often described as showbusiness for ugly people - but few MPs have taken the saying to heart as much as Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. He has secretly commissioned private polling at a cost of thousands of pounds to find out how voters are reacting to him and his economic policies. Embarrassingly, Labour Party sources say the polling results show that Mr Balls is still seen as a turn-off by many, both politically and personally. A spokesman for Mr Balls denied claims about the results - but refused to give any more details of what the polling had uncovered. So The Mail on Sunday commissioned its own survey - and it showed that Mr Balls is seen as 'uninspiring, untrustworthy and unlikeable'. And despite the double-dip recession, the public have more faith in the economic policies of David Cameron and George Osborne than those of Mr Balls and Ed Miliband, albeit by a tiny margin. The Survation survey clearly indicates that Mr Balls must admit his role in making a mess of the UK's economy as a senior member of the Labour Government of Gordon Brown. Four in ten people said Labour must accept more responsibility for the recession, against one in four who disagreed. The Tory lead is all the more surprising given that calls by Mr Miliband and Mr Balls for Government policy to focus more on fostering economic growth have been echoed by international leaders. But it is Mr Balls's personal ratings that are most worrying for him. A total of 44 per cent say he is an opportunist, with only 19 per cent describing him as principled. Nearly one in two say that he is not charismatic, against 13 per cent who think he is. And 48 per cent say he is not likeable, compared with 17 per cent who believe he is. Opposition: Calls by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls for Government policy to focus more on fostering economic growth have been echoed by international leaders . The results are almost identical when voters are asked if they can trust Mr Balls. The Tories have fallen to a 14-point deficit behind Labour, according to an opinion poll released today. The survey, carried out by pollsters Angus Reid for The Sunday Express, puts Labour on 43 per cent, with David Cameron's party on 29 per cent. The Tories' coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats are on just 9 per cent, the same as Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party. Labour's lead over the Tories is the biggest since December 2002, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister and Iain Duncan Smith led the Conservative Party. And almost one in two say they have no idea what his policies are, compared with one in five who say they do. Asked who they trusted to lead Britain out of recession, 29 per cent of those polled chose Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, with 28 per cent favouring Mr Miliband and Mr Balls. Despite losing to Ed Miliband in the Labour leadership contest in 2010, Mr Balls remains fiercely ambitious and has made considerable efforts to soften his political bruiser image in recent months. He admitted to crying while watching the BBC's Antiques Roadshow and has talked about his love of cooking. Only last week he tweeted: 'Did a v good prune & armagnac sponge pudding this evening from the excellent Dan Lepard baking book Short And Sweet.' Mr Balls's office refused to confirm reports that the private polling is being carried out by the Labour pollster Deborah Mattinson, who performed the same role for Mr Balls's mentor, Mr Brown, with largely the same negative results. The disclosure comes amid growing concern in Labour's high command at its failure to win more public support for its economic policies. Several senior Labour figures used a recent Shadow Cabinet meeting to complain at the party's failure to win more backing for its attack on the Coalition's 'austerity Britain' approach. The move was seen as a coded attack on Mr Balls. Denied: Labour claim people are losing faith with Chancellor George Osborne . One Shadow Minister told The Mail on Sunday: 'When the economy is in a mess and George Osborne is widely seen as arrogant and lightweight, Labour should be doing much better. 'On most issues we are way ahead of the Tories, but we struggle on the economy. Ed Balls must take responsibility for that.' Mr Balls's spokesman said last night: 'Every political party does private research and polling. But given how important the economy is as an issue, Ed's office has raised funds in order that the Labour Party can do extra research on the economy.' He declined to say where the money had come from or how much the polling had cost. Later, Labour Party sources denied the private polling was bad news for the Shadow Chancellor. One said: 'Our research shows that, with the economy pushed into a double-dip recession, people are increasingly losing faith with David Cameron and George Osborne's economic strategy. 'Clearly, we still have a long way to go to regain economic trust, but we are making good progress and people are starting to open their ears to Labour's call for a plan for jobs and growth as part of a balanced plan to get the deficit down.' Survation interviewed 500 people online on Friday.","Survey shows public has more faith in economic policies of David Cameron and George Osborne than those of Ed Miliband and Ed Balls .

Barack Obama launched  an  outspoken attack on  austerity measures last night, warning they risk dragging the world economy into a new ‘downward spiral’. The US President blamed Europe for economic problems in his  country and warned that immediate action is required to solve the eurozone crisis. But in an intervention that will alarm the Treasury, Mr Obama declared that cuts are preventing economic growth which could prompt an upturn. Under fire: Barack Obama has launched an outspoken attack on austerity measures such as those introduced by David Cameron . His remarks are a sideswipe at those, like David Cameron, who have urged austerity measures. ‘Even as European countries with large debt burdens carry out necessary fiscal reforms, they’ve also got to promote economic growth and job creation,’ said the President. ‘As some countries have discovered, it’s a lot harder to rein in deficits and debt if your economy is not growing.’ Britain plunged into a  double-dip recession this year and the Chancellor George Osborne has admitted that cuts will continue for two years after the 2015 general election. But the Treasury insists that the Coalition will stick to its plans or risk the cost of government debt rising, which would send mortgage rates soaring. President Obama delivered his hard-hitting attack, warning austerity is ‘a problem’ when countries ‘resort to a strategy of “let’s cut more”’. This leads to ‘government lay-offs and reductions in spending’ at a time ‘when an economy is still weak and a recovery is still fragile’. He added: ‘If you’re doing all those things at the same time as consumers are pulling back and there is generally weak demand then you get on a downward spiral where everybody is pulling back. ‘That weakens demand and it further crimps the desire of companies to hire more  people. And that’s the pattern that Europe is in danger of  getting into.’ Mr Obama said it was  ‘a positive thing’ that debate  in Europe has turned towards growth. Praised: Mr Obama singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande for 'worknig to put in place a growth agenda . He singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel and new French President Francois Hollande for ‘working to put in place a growth agenda alongside responsible fiscal plans’. No such praise, however,  was offered to Mr Cameron. Amid signs that Mr Obama fears the European economic downturn could cost him  re-election in November, he said it ‘matters to us, because Europe is our largest economic trading partner’. Labelled 'delusional': Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker claims Britain will still one day join the eurozone despite its current economic woes . He added: ‘If there’s less demand for our products in places like Paris or Madrid, it could mean less business  in places like Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.’ Mr Obama called for ‘specific steps’ that European leaders ‘can take right now to prevent the situation from getting worse’ including injecting capital into weak banks. The President spoke out as sources revealed that Spain is expected to ask today for a new eurozone bailout. A crisis meeting in Brussels is expected to thrash out the terms of a deal which will pump £80billion into ailing Spanish banks. The agreement is expected to see funds handed out from the eurozone bailout fund, meaning British taxpayers do not have to contribute. It is likely to be finally signed off on June 21, when auditors report on the state of Spanish bank finances. ‘It is more a question of how, not whether there will be a bailout,’ said one Brussels source. Yesterday, the head of Cyprus’s second largest bank warned that his country will also need a bailout to prop up institutions badly exposed to Greek debt. The people of Greece, meanwhile, were warned by Mr Obama that they would  face ‘further hardship’ if their country left the euro.","Obama singles out German Chancellor and French president for praise over economic policy .

A British father has been offered the chance of a life-saving kidney from a distant cousin in America - after he wrote about his plight on Facebook. Andy Williamson, 44, has polycystic kidney disease and has been undergoing dialysis every day for the last year as he waits for a new donor organ. He began documenting his illness on the popular social networking site and was stunned when he received a message from a distant cousin who lives in America. Amazing offer: John Williamson (left) has come forward as a potential kidney donor for his distant cousin Andy, pictured with his daughter Dora aged 2 and his wife Suzy . John Williamson - who has only met Andy on two occasions - wrote offer to be a live donor for his cousin. When Andy accepted, the advertising account manager took a holiday from his job and flew to the UK to undergo tests to see whether his kidney is suitable. John, 41, and Andy, a father-of-one, now face an anxious wait to see whether the transplant can go ahead - and so far doctors say it is looking promising. Grateful Andy, a musician who lives in Ashburton, Devon, with wife Suzy, 42 and daughter Doro, two, said he was 'amazed' at the generousity of his cousin. He said: 'We don’t actually know each other that well, having grown up on different sides of the Atlantic, but we became friends on Facebook a couple of years ago. 'John saw that I was in need of a new kidney, and offered to be a living donor. 'It’s one of those things where it’s difficult to find the words. It’s a mixture of gratitude and just thankfulness that he’s come forward to help. 'I know from my previous transplant the difference it makes to me having a healthy working kidney, it’s just indescribable.' Family matters: American cousin John is 3rd from left (in yellow) while Andy is on his right. Andy's dad Ron is standing with baby on back, while John's day is standing far right . A collect of Andy with his daughter Dora. John said seeing photos of them on Facebook prompted him to try and help . John’s dad also called John was brother of Andy’s father Ron. They were two of four brothers who grew up in Glasgow, Scotland. In the early 1960s, John got married to Marie who said a condition of their marriage was to move abroad to get away from her mother. So John and Marie moved to Canada where Andy’s cousin, John, who was one of four children, was born in 1970. The cousins first met when Andy, then aged 11, and his family went to stay in Canada with John, then aged nine, and his family in 1979. John later moved to America with his family in 1981 where he has stayed ever since. The pair did not have any contact for more than 20 years until 2003, when they met at Andy’s uncle and John’s father’s second wedding - but the pair only spoke briefly. Around two years ago they befriended each other on Facebook and used the social networking site to send messages and view each other’s photographs. Andy’s condition is a hereditary disease which his mother, who also went on dialysis, suffered from.He was diagnosed at 21 but only started showing symptoms in his 30s and finally went on dialysis at 38. Andy (left) with John: Doctors are checking whether John is physically and psychologically suitable . Andy was on daily dialysis for 18 months before a kidney donor came forward in August 2007. However, that kidney failed last year and he is now back on dialysis. He started using a new phone app called Four Square for his iPhone in December which allows users to check-in to visited places. Andy said he was playing around with the app while at hospital one day which alerted his Facebook friends, including his cousin John, that he was on dialysis again. He then continued to use the social networking website to update friends and family on his condition. Just a month later in January, Andy received an unexpected message from his cousin - offering him one of his kidneys. Andy said: 'It was completely out of the blue. We hadn’t been in close contact over the years.' John said he was moved to offer his kidney to Andy after seeing photographs of his cousin with daughter Doro. The father-of-five and grandfather-of-two said: 'Seeing Andy’s situation online, and seeing pictures of him with his daughter Doro, I felt moved, and there was a little voice in my head that said, ‘you should do this’. 'Having very young daughters at home as well, I understand how much energy it takes to have young children in the house and how difficult that must be for Andy. 'By monitoring Andy’s situation - seeing his updates and seeing him check into certain health clinics during his dialysis - and then seeing pictures of his daughter, I felt a connection between the two and it was just a feeling in me that told me it was something I should do. 'In the grand scheme of things it doesn’t feel like a sacrifice. There are very few opportunities in life to do something meaningful for somebody else. 'I wanted to do something not just for Andy, who has a compromised standard of life, but for Doro as well.' Family tree: The Williamson brothers, (L-R) John (American John's father) James, Bill and Ron (Andy's father) grew up in Glasgow . John, from Michigan, flew into the UK on June 24 and returned to America on June 30. He underwent tests at Southmead Hospital in Bristol to check that his kidney is suitable. The process is overseen by Kay Hamilton, one of the living donor transplant co-ordinators at Southmead Hospital’s Renal Unit. She said: 'It’s a really rigorous investigation process and the donor’s safety is of the highest priority to us. 'If anything is found to be unsuitable, whether psychologically or physically, then we stop the whole process. We’d love to give a kidney transplant to everyone who needs one, but not at any anyone else’s expense.'","Andy had only seen his American cousin twice before John offered to donate his kidney as a living donor .

A bus driver who bludgeoned a young British student to death in Poland last year has begged for leniency because he 'had a wife and family to care for'. The battered body of Kate Zaks, 21, an art student at the University of Kent, was found lying in a mud-filled ditch close to a railway track in a remote suburb of Krakow last July. A post mortem revealed she had drowned after being struck over the head several times with a hard object.

"By . Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 10:00 EST, 23 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 24 May 2012 . Europe was facing the prospect of a devastating financial crisis last night, as Greece teetered on the brink of a chaotic exit from the single currency. Stock markets across Europe plunged after the mighty Bundesbank warned that it would be better to let Greece leave the euro than give its crippled economy any more cash. At an emergency summit in Brussels last night, David Cameron pleaded with dithering European leaders to end the ‘fudge’ over the euro crisis. New order? French President Francois Hollande (left) and Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (right) are among leaders to be told to prepare contingency plans in case Greece quits the single currency . The Prime Minister told an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels there was no point discussing plans to kickstart economic growth unless they acted ‘decisively’ to shore up the ailing single currency. In a separate blow it emerged that all eurozone countries have been ordered to draw up contingency plans for a Greek exit. The Bundesbank warnings sparked panic on stock markets, with £35billion wiped off the FTSE 100. Italy’s stock market fell 3.7 per cent, while Spain’s dropped 3.2 per cent. The euro also fell to a two-year low against the dollar. Warning: Officials said the instruction was agreed on Monday by a teleconference of the Eurogroup Working Group (EWG) - experts who work on behalf of the bloc's finance ministers . Behind closed doors in Brussels, Mr Cameron warned fellow EU leaders that ‘contagion’ from a Greek exit could destabilise the European economy for years. ‘We need a plan to deal with contagion,’ he said. But Mr Cameron’s words appeared to have gone unheeded last night as German Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted that Germany was preparing to cut Greece loose unless it agrees to stick to the tough terms of last year’s bailout deal. Last night’s summit dinner broke up without any clear agreement on Greece. The six-hour session was dominated by discussions on economic growth, with less than an hour dedicated to the Greek crisis. France insisted on pushing ahead with controversial proposals for a tax on financial transactions, which experts warn will hit the City of London. Mr Cameron described the proposal as a ‘bad idea’ and pledged to ‘fight it all the way’. After the talks, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said he wanted Greece ‘to remain in the euro area’. He said: ‘We had an in-depth discussion on the latest developments in the euro area  during which we also reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard its financial stability and integrity.’ Earlier in the evening Mrs Merkel rejected calls  for the introduction of so-called Eurobonds to ease the debt crisis. The German Chancellor said the idea, which would effectively see Germany underwrite the eurozone’s vast debts, was illegal under EU law and was ‘not a contribution to stimulating growth’. Her stance is a major blow to France’s new socialist President Francois Hollande who had insisted that Eurobonds were on the agenda of last night’s summit. But it is also a snub to Mr Cameron, who had earlier told MPs that the German stance was ‘changing to an extent’. The Prime Minister said Eurobonds ‘must’ be part of the solution, and suggested that ‘large fiscal transfers’ to struggling eurozone countries would also be needed. Riots: Greece has been hit by bouts of civil disorder in recent months . Speaking in the Commons he appealed to EU leaders to act now. He said: ‘I don’t believe we can afford to allow this issue to be endlessly fudged or put off.’ But he warned it was becoming ‘ever more urgent’  to draw up contingency plans for a possible Greek exit,  adding: ‘Frankly, it’s not in our power about whether Greece will decide to stay in the  eurozone or out of the eurozone, we have to prepare for every eventuality however  difficult that might be.’ Spain cannot continue much longer with its current high borrowing rates, its prime minister warned today as he urged a joint European response to keep the region's debt problems from getting worse. Mariano Rajoy and newly elected French President Francois Hollande also stressed their commitment to keeping Greece in the euro despite its political uncertainty. He said: 'Europe has to come up with an answer. It is a must, because we cannot go on like this for a long time, with large differences when it comes to financing ourselves. 'And it is because of these differences that the policies that we Europeans believe in, such as controlling government spending and reforms to encourage growth, ultimately have no effect.' 'So I am going to talk about liquidity, financing and debt sustainability. For me it is the most important thing today. There are a lot of important things but this is the most urgent one.' Earlier the Bundesbank sparked market panic by suggesting the fallout from a Greek exit would be ‘considerable but manageable’. Germany’s powerful central bank said allowing Greece to backslide on agreed austerity measures would ‘damage confidence’ in other weakened eurozone states and could ‘call into question’ the future of the entire single currency. The Bundesbank described the situation in Greece as ‘extremely worrying’. But it said Greece would have to ‘bear the consequences’ if it reneged on the terms of the bail-out deal. And the former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos added to the grim backdrop by suggesting Athens was also making preparations to leave the euro. He said: ‘The risk of Greece leaving the euro is real and it depends effectively on whether the Greek people will support the continued implementation of the economic programme.’ In the Commons yesterday Mr Cameron insisted he was a ‘genuine eurosceptic’. He told MPs: ‘I’ve always been a genuine eurosceptic, sceptical about the euro, that’s why I didn’t want to join it, but we have to recognise what is now in this country’s interests, which is for the eurozone to sort out its difficulties.’ In a speech in Berlin today Mr Clegg is expected to expose Coalition tensions over the issue, by taking a swipe at those on the Tory benches who are urging Greece to quit the euro.","German Bundesbank says it would be better for Greece to leave .

One thousand millionaires are expected to be created today as Facebook sells its shares for the first time. In one of the biggest ever Wall Street flotations, the social networking site will sell 421million shares at up to £24 a share. A successful sale will see the company’s value soar to about £64billion – bigger than the combined worth of Ford and Boeing. Scroll down for video analysis . Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook at university eight years ago, is likely to become one of the world's richest men . Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook at university eight years ago, is likely to become one of the world’s richest men. His 28 per cent stake in the company could net him as much as £18billion. Hundreds of other Facebook staff and those who invested in the company during its infancy will become millionaires. A smattering of the 100 London-based staff may also become millionaires. Among them will almost certainly be Joanna Shields, the vice-president and managing director of Facebook’s Europe, Middle East and Asia division. The 49-year-old executive, who lives in London with her husband, Formula 1 team boss Andy Stevenson, will be one  of the biggest British-based beneficiaries of the share sale. Facebook was planning to sell  337million shares but increased that figure to 421million because of huge demand. Despite the interest in the stock, some analysts are uncertain as to how long Facebook can maintain its rapid growth. Joanna Shields, managing director of Facebook's Europe, Middle East and Asia division will be one of the biggest British-based beneficiaries of the share sale . Some advertisers are starting to wonder if the site is actually worth the money. They are particularly concerned about the number of users who are accessing Facebook on their smartphones whose screens are too small for advertisements to be effective. On Tuesday the carmaker  General Motors, which is America’s third largest advertiser, decided to pull all its ads from the site, claiming no one was clicking on them. Analysts predict that other advertisers may reach the same conclusion. Richard Hunter, from the City stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, believes the shares will perform well in the short term, but then face an uncertain future. Mr Hunter said: ‘It is then down to the company to convince  analysts and investors that the confidence was well founded and that Facebook will be mentioned in the same breath as the likes  of Apple and Google in the years to come. ‘Ten years ago, there was no such thing as Facebook, or the iPhone or the iPad. ‘In the meantime some of the “next big things” have come and gone, such as MySpace. ‘Perhaps the only certainty is that the companies which remain are those which have been able to adapt, adjust, innovate and remain incredibly popular on a huge scale.’ He added: ‘That is a major consideration for potential Facebook investors.’ City spread betting firm Spreadex said Facebook shares could increase in value by more than  40 per cent after the first day. The website’s revenue last year was £2.3billion, up from £96million in 2007 – an almost 25-fold increase in just four years.",Mark Zuckerberg's stake in the company could net him £18billion .

Facebook's chief operating officer joked about the company's disastrous public offering during a speech to Harvard Business School students. Sheryl Sandberg, 42, asked the class yesterday to click on the social network's advertisements now that the company had gone public. In the 22-minute speech, where she offered advice based on her career success, the executive quipped: 'We’re public now. So can you click on an ad or two while you’re there?' Scroll down for video . Words of wisdom: Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg made light of the company's woes during a speech to Harvard Business School in Allston, Massachusetts . Ms Sandberg also advised the students to keep in touch via the social network during the presentation in Allston, Massachusetts. The former head of the U.S. Treasury's stake in Facebook is set to make her a billionaire. She explained to this year's Harvard class that although she had been offered jobs elsewhere, she went to work at Facebook because 'if you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don’t ask what seat. You just get on.' The former head of the U.S. Treasury graduated from HBS 17 years ago and advised students not to climb the corporate ladder but to 'build their skills'. Facebook's top underwriter said yesterday that it was prepared to pay back investors who were burned when they bought shares. The share price sat at $32.30 today down around 15 per cent from its initial public offering. Amid a flurry of lawsuits over Facebook's IPO, Morgan Stanley announced in a memo on Wednesday that it is reviewing Facebook trades and would adjust prices for some retail customers who overpaid. Trouble ahead: Ms Sandberg and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rings the Nasdaq's opening bell for the company's initial public offering . The IPO mishaps have sparked numerous lawsuits against Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq stock exchange and Facebook itself by shareholders who claimed they hid the social networking company's weakened growth forecasts just before it went public. The allegations raised questions about whether top investors profited at the expense of smaller buyers. Meanwhile, Facebook is in talks with the New York Stock Exchange to move its stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market after the botched IPO on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The insider spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook's much-anticipated IPO was delayed by a half-hour on Friday because of technical glitches on the Nasdaq. Zucked: Mark Zuckerberg saved $174 million by cashing out tens of millions of shares of Facebook stock early Friday when the price was above $38 a share . After pricing at $38, Facebook's stock closed up 23 cents on Friday and has been down since. Decline: The Facebook stock closed up $1 on Wednesday at $32, still down nearly 16 per cent from the IPO price . NYSE declined to comment. A Nasdaq spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment. The news came as even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dumped his own shares in the company, making $1.13billion as the stock nosedived, according to company filings. Shareholders filed a lawsuit yesterday against Facebook and the banks behind the company's stock, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Additionally, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have begun looking into the matter. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has also launched an inquiry and the state of Massachusetts has subpenaed Morgan Stanley, demanding answers. The House Financial Services Committee said that it was also gathering information for their own review. Facebook's stock was still down at least 15 per cent Thursday from the price of its initial public offering almost a week ago. However, a new analysis said the stock could fall to as low as $9.59. That's a far cry from the $37.58 that Zuckerberg fetched for 30.2 million shares he unloaded on Friday. By the end of trading on Tuesday however the price had dropped to $31 meaning Zuckerberg saved himself a cool $174 million by getting out early. The 28-year-old still holds a vast amount of Facebook stock but his decision to sell off so much will leave investors wondering about his confidence in the company. The drop is based around the realization that Facebook might not be growing as quickly as initially thought. And the company's second-quarter growth will likely fall short of expectations as fewer new users join the social networking giant. Shareholders filed a lawsuit alleging that Zuckerberg, Facebook and the banks that backed the Initial Public Offering, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, knew this information, but weren't forthcoming with it. On Tuesday, Reuters revealed that the banks' analysts downgraded their estimates about the future earnings of the company while they were rolling out the IPO. Business Insider called the move 'unprecedented.' Furthermore, the website reported that the banks revealed to privileged major investors that the share price was likely to tank, but left smaller stock buyers in the dark about this information. The Securities and Exchange commission is investigating these allegations and the state of Massachusetts has filed a subpoena demanding Morgan Stanley release information about the IPO. Zuckerberg’s plans to sell were revealed in documents filed in advance of the IPO on Friday, but the problems that have happened since cast them in a new light. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel also announced his plans early too but his return was beyond anything he could have hoped for. He wrote Zuckerberg a cheque for $500,000 in 2004 but has offloaded 16.8 million shares for the tidy profit of $633 million. Among the others to cash out was Mark Pincus, the chief executive of online gaming company Zynga. Big returns: Peter Thiel (left), the co-founder of PayPal, earned $633 million for an initial investment of $500,000. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus gave Zuckerberg a check for $40,000 in 2004 and cashed in $38 million in stock . Eight years ago he gave Facebook a cheque for $40,000 but now has sold $38 million worth of stock. Venture capitalists Accel Partners, which handed over $12.7million back in 2005, sold $1.9billion of stock but retained $5.8billion. Whilst the big players were making a fortune however, small investors have seen their attempts to get in on the Facebook bubble fall flat. As of close of trading on Tuesday shares were a staggering 18 per cent below what they had been at the opening on Friday. At one point they had slumped 31 per cent from the $45 peak hit shortly after they started trading. But according to analysts StarMine this could not be the end of it and the slide could carry on until stocks are just $9.59 each. It has examined estimates from Wall Street experts and concluded that Facebook is currently vastly overpriced, though its forecasts do tend to be gloomier than others. Eddy Elfenbein, editor at finance website Crossing Wall Street, said: ‘Facebook right now is going for far more than what it's worth, it's like buying $1 for $1.98, it just doesn't make sense at this price. ‘Just from basic modelling the stock should be around $17 to $20, and that is with a lot of variables. Cleaning up: Facebook's IPO has caused a mess that is currently being investigated by the Senate Banking Committee, two regulatory agencies and the state of Massachusetts . ‘I would call that an ideal price. I would be interested in buying and I think that is a good deal for investors.’ Among those who did not cash out on Friday when Facebook shares were trading at $38 each was the company’s former president Sean Parker. His stock is still worth over $2billion but the price slump meant his fortune decreased by a staggering $300million. In a sign of how feeling is changing against Facebook, some commentators have begun comparing its activities to the most reckless behaviour of Wall Street banks. They have also coined the word ‘Zucked’, which means to get shafted on the sale of Facebook shares. These major sell-offs comes as new allegations are emerging the the over-hyped Facebook stock sale may have been rigged against small, every-day buyers. Two separates lawsuits have been filed against the company and the banks that organized the IPO, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, alleging the executives knew second-quarter revenue would not meet expectations as Facebook's growth slows. Business Insider says this information was shared with the banks by a Facebook insider. As Zuckerberg went on his pre-IPO roadshow, touting his company, the banks downgraded their revenue projections for Facebook. This information could have reduced the value of Facebook's initial stock offering. In turn, this could have decreased the amount of money Zuckerberg and his early investors made when they dumped tens of millions of Facebook shares on Friday as trading opened. However, the banks failed to widely disclose the downgrade, the lawsuits say. Business Insider says they told only large, institutional investors so they would know to stay away from Facebook stock on the first day of trading. Facebook denies the allegations in the lawsuit and said it will 'vigorously defense itself.' Morgan Stanley says it followed the same procedure it would for any IPO.

Thousands of London bus workers have voted to go on strike in a row over extra payments for working during the Olympic Games. Members of the Unite union backed . industrial action by more than nine to one, raising the prospect of . crippling walkouts during the Games, which start in the capital next . month. The union wants a payment of £500 for . each of the 20,000 bus workers it represents in London, pointing out . that other transport employees are being paid a premium for being on . duty during the event. Protest: London bus drivers demonstrate outside . the offices of Transport for London last month. They have now voted in favour of strike action . The union will decide in the coming days whether to name strike dates following the ballot result. Unite has previously warned that . 'strike action could take place up to and during the Olympic Games', . which last from July 27 to August 12.

Transport for London (TfL) said the . union was demanding a £500 'bonus' for each of the 24,000 bus drivers in . London for working during the London 2012 Games. But TfL maintains bus drivers are . employed by private companies and that their pay and conditions are a . matter for those private companies. 'Reprehensible': Bus drivers want an extra £500 pounds each for . working during the games - arguing they will have to cope with an extra . 800,000 passengers . Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director . of surface transport, said: 'I am not surprised that 70 per cent of . London's bus drivers did not vote for strike action. That is because . about 70 per cent of London's local bus services are not affected by the . Olympic Games. 'The whole country is really entering . into the spirit of the Games and the overwhelming responsible majority . are pulling out all the stops to make it a huge success. 'Only Unite appears to want to exploit . it by adding a further multi-million pound burden to the hard-pressed . farepayers and taxpayers of London. 'We are really disappointed that the Unite leadership is encouraging its members to take this unnecessary strike action. 'Unite has already negotiated binding . deals for pay and conditions with each of the London bus companies for . this year and those companies are keeping their end of the deal. 'Attempting to tear up those . agreements and get a new one with less than 50 days to go before the . Games is completely reprehensible and out-of-step with every other . provider of services in this city this summer.' Loggerheads: But Transport for London says it is . up to the 21 private companies that run bus services across London as . they set staff pay . Unite said it was giving the bus . companies a final opportunity to consider the 'landslide' ballot result . before announcing possible strike dates early next week. The union said bus workers were the . only London transport employees not receiving an award for their extra . effort during the Olympic Games. At least 800,000 extra passengers are predicted to use London's buses during the Olympics, said Unite. Regional officer Peter Kavanagh, said: 'There are only seven weeks until the Olympics and the whole world is watching London. 'It's a disgrace that London's mayor, Boris Johnson, and the bus companies have allowed this dispute to get this far. 'Our members are only asking for an . extra £17 a day which will just about buy you a pint of beer and a . portion of fish and chips at the Olympics. 'Our members want the Games to be a success but their patience has run out. 'We have given Transport for London . and the bus operators almost a year to resolve this issue. Every single . London transport worker in London will receive a reward to recognise . their major contribution to this historic occasion except for London's . bus workers. 'It is time for TfL and the bus companies to consider this landslide vote in favour of strike action and resolve this dispute. 'This dispute could be brought to an . end now if the bus companies and TfL have the will to provide the . relatively small amount of money compared to the billions being spent on . the Games.'

Two more children have been left scarred for life after unprovoked dog attacks. Nine-year-old Harry Dennard was left screaming in pain after a Rottweiler tore into his arm and left a gash as 'wide as an open book'. Rebecca . Learmouth, six, was left clutching her bleeding face after a dog ripped into her. The attack marks the third serious attack on a young child in Britain since the start of the month. Two-year-old Keiron Guess was left needing seven hours of surgery to rebuild his face after being savaged by a neighbour's Staffordshire bull terrier on June 3. In young Harry's case he will not see the dog's owners brought to justice because the attack happened at his friend's house, rather than a public place. He had knocked at  a friend’s door in Mottingham, south London, when the dog ran out of the house and lunged at him. After the attack, the owners chose to have the animal put down, but police said they were powerless to take any other action. The legal loophole in the Dangerous Dogs Act  has enraged Harry's mother, Louise Clark, who rushed to his side following the attack on May 30. Harry suffered a massive gash in his arm, wounds to the chest and needed to spend a weekend at St Thomas’s Hospital in London following a two-hour operation to remove infected tissue. Ms Clark, a 32-year-old care assistant, said: 'The police said it was not a dangerous dog because it bit Harry on (the owner’s) property, which I think is ridiculous. 'The owners were very upset and apologised. They were distraught. But it should not have taken Harry to get bit (for it to be destroyed). It could have been prevented. 'It was a bomb waiting to happen. They should have destroyed it a long time ago.' Scars: Harry suffered injuries to his right arm following the attack in Mottingham, south London . Nine-year-old Harry Dennard endured a two-hour operation at St Thomas' Hospital in London to remove infected tissue following the dog attack . Describing the attack, she said: 'There was a seven to nine inch gash in his arm. It was like a book had opened on his arm. The dog was shaking to kill. 'It was biting Harry for at least 30 seconds. He was screaming and crying his eyes out in pain. I heard the screaming and rushed over there. 'Thankfully Harry didn’t fall over, otherwise the dog would have ripped his throat out and killed him. He wouldn’t be here now.' She added: 'He’s quite wary of dogs now. I’m thinking of getting him counselling to help rebuild his confidence. He’s having nightmares and wakes up in the night. 'This has been the most horrific time of my life - watching your child go into theatre. He’s so small, but he was so brave.' Rebecca Learmouth, six, was left needing surgery after she was mauled by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier while playing with friends near her home in Byker, North Tyneside . The owners of the Rottweiler declined to comment. In a separate incident Rebecca was playing with friends near her home in Byker, Newcastle, when she spotted a man with a pair of dogs and asked if she could stroke them. She was warned not to touch the male Staffordshire bull terrier, so instead stroked the other dog, a female. But the male, which was on a lead, suddenly turned round and launched its jaws into her face. A neighbour found Rebecca and rushed her back home. Her mother Louise Cavanagh, who has reported the incident to police, told The Sun: 'I never thought there could be so much blood - it was all over the floor. She could have lost an eye."" Rebecca was taken to hospital and treated for wounds around her eye, nose, cheek and mouth. Earlier this month, two-year-old Kieron Guess was attacked by a Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog in Swindon. Keiron lives with his mum Stacey, 22, . father Anthony, 23, and his brother Mckenzie, aged four, in a home . backing on to a property where the dog lived. Again its owner will not face criminal charges because the attack on Keiron took place on private property.

After being rushed to hospital, he was warned he would die if he didn't give up his diet of junk food . With the help of his cousin, who gave him a strict diet plan and taught him to swim, he has lost 14st . By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 09:38 EST, 30 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 30 May 2012 . An obese man who was given weeks to live because of his 28st size has lost half his body weight after his cousin helped him turn his life around. For decades Raymond Upshall, 55, feasted on fry-ups and takeaways, while snacking on biscuits, chocolates and fizzy drinks. He became nicknamed the 'honey monster' because of his large size and had to give up work after his knees gave in. Doctors told him he was endangering his life with his unhealthy ways but he didn't know how to change his diet. It was only after a number of health scares in which he was rushed to hospital that he began to realise the gravity of his situation. Wake-up call: Raymond Upshall lost 14st after being warned he would die if he didn't change his unhealthy lifestyle . Raymond from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I used to eat . everything - I had no limits. I loved all the wrong foods like . chocolates, crisps, toffee and cakes. I would take them to bed with me. 'I would eat a full English breakfast . every day, go to the chippy at lunchtime and have the same at night - . I’d never get sick of it. I had always eaten like that. I didn’t have the knowledge, nobody told me any different.' His GP warned him that his weight had sent his cholesterol and blood pressure 'through the roof' meaning his organs could fail within weeks if he carried on as he was. It was at this point that his cousin, Veronica Yorke, stepped in to save the day - and, Raymond says, saved his life. She taught Raymond about healthy eating and devised a strict diet plan for him. She also taught him how to swim so he could exercise. Support: Veronica Yorke helped her cousin lose weight by giving him a diet plan and teaching him to swim so he could exercise . Veronica said: 'I remember the . doctor shouting at him, telling him to lose weight. It was only after he . lost the weight he told us Raymond could have died within weeks. 'I worked with Raymond and became his carer two years ago. I got him a job at the Reebok centre, where I also worked and I just took him under my wing.' She added: 'I have a friend who is a . dietician and another who is a heart technician - so with their help I . managed to come up with a low-fat plan which would ensure Raymond would . lose the weight. I also taught him to swim - we started . off with floats but now he can now swim around 26 lengths. He still goes . once a week. It’s been hard work for both of us, but I’m sure proud of . him.' Raymond said he piled on the weight when his mother died on Christmas Day in 1997. He said: 'I have always been big - since I can remember. But when my mum died I felt really depressed, so I would eat to make me feel better. I was 28 stone from my forties. I couldn’t understand what foods were healthy and what foods were fattening. 'I found it difficult to move around and I could only walk about four or five steps before I would struggle and gasp for breath. All the taxi drivers in town called me the Honey Monster - I just laughed it off.' Half the size he was: Raymond now weighs 13st, left, after giving up the diet of junk food that led to him weighing 28st . Raymond, who used to work as a cleaner and kitchen porter, had to give up work because his knees gave in. He said: 'The doctor said I couldn’t go for surgery unless I lost nine stone. I was also told that my cholesterol and blood pressure were through the roof. I had tried to lose weight before, but I always failed.' Who are you calling the Honey Monster? Raymond has banished his old nickname thanks to his weightloss . Raymond began to suffer from dizzy spells and panic attacks and was rushed into hospital five times. A few weeks later he found out he had Cellutosis - which is a painful infection underneath the skin. Veronica, 57, explains: 'He was referred to Royal Bolton Hospital and it was there he was told he had to lose the weight. His knees just couldn’t take it - the surgeon said his knees were the worst he’d seen.'Raymond’s typical daily diet now consists of two Shredded Wheat with skimmed milk and toast for breakfast, turkey salad for lunch and a low-fat chicken hotpot for dinner, with yoghurt for pudding. He said: 'I found the diet really difficult at first, I was so hungry. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I felt like giving up a few times, but Veronica kept me going. If I gained a pound, I would have to put a pound coin in a jar. 'She got rid of all the bad foods in the house, so I wouldn’t even be tempted.'

A girl of two escaped death by a millimetre when she fell on to a  pencil which lodged in her brain. A startling X-ray shows the pencil penetrating Wren Bowell’s right eye and continuing one-and-a-half inches inside her head. Neurosurgeons operated for four hours to save her life, removing a section of her skull to take the pencil out. They said that, astonishingly, the point of the pencil had not gone into her eyeball but had skirted the top of it, passing between the eyeball and the socket. Scroll down for video . Warning: Graphic image below . Scan: Neurosurgeons operated on Wren for four hours to save her life after removing a section of skill . Remarkable: Wren, pictured with her mother Michelle, emerged unscathed with no brain damage and no ill-effects on her eye-sight after the pencil just missed two major blood vessels in her head . It also missed three major blood vessels, one by only a millimetre. Just a fraction further and it could have proved fatal. Remarkably, she emerged unscathed with no brain damage and no ill effects on her eyesight. Wren had been drawing in her bedroom . and was running to show the pictures to her parents Martyn and Michelle . when she tripped over a stairgate and the pencil she was holding went . into her brain. Mr Bowell, 34, a model maker, said: ‘A . broken bone would be bad enough, but something happening to the eye, . head or brain is one of the worst things that could possibly go wrong. ‘Fortunately my wife, who is a nursery nurse, kept a level head and realised not to try to get the pencil out.’ Lodged: A scan showing the pencil lodged in Wren's brain after she tripped and fell on to it . An ambulance took Wren from her home . in Peasedown St John, Bath, to the city’s Royal United Hospital.

All . better: Wren Bowell with her parents Martyn and Michelle. The toddler . had to spend three weeks in hospital with her family at her bedside .

She was incredibly lucky as she came out . fortunately with no major bleeding. ‘It just skirted the top of the eye . and that it didn’t damage the eyeball itself was very fortunate. She was . very lucky not to have suffered any permanent damage.’ Mr Pople said he had seen this type of . injury about three times in 16 years as a consultant neurosurgeon. ‘I . have also known of a case, which I did not deal with myself, that was . fatal,’ he said. ‘And another, which was not fatal but caused a lot of . damage because it hit the blood vessel.’ He said that as well as removing part . of Wren’s skull, it was also necessary to ensure no flecks from the . pencil had remained inside the brain by using an antibiotic wash. Wren’s father said: ‘They then put her skull back together with plastic plates and screws which will biodegrade.’ After the operation Wren spent three . weeks in Frenchay with her family around her and was allowed home on . April 4. She had to take anti-seizure drugs as a precaution but has been . fine. Mr Bowell, who has signed up for a . first aid course since the accident, is to take part in a sponsored . cycle ride to raise money for more toys for Frenchay’s children’s unit. ‘I can’t thank the neurosurgeons enough for what they did and this is a way of giving a little bit back,’ he said. ‘The toys and games provided by the . play team at Frenchay provided a distraction for Wren on a daily basis . for those three and a half weeks.

The first NHS hospital to be run entirely by a private firm has slashed waiting times and drastically improved patient care. Hinchingbrooke, a struggling trust in Cambridgeshire,  was taken over in February. But NHS figures show that since the company, Circle, stepped in to save the debt-ridden hospital from closure, it has gone from being among the worst-performing trusts in the region to one of the best. Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire will be run by Circle for 10 years under a £1billion contract . Its accident and emergency unit is currently ranked first out of 46 NHS trusts in the Midlands and East Anglia region in terms of waiting times. Before the takeover it was consistently near the bottom and many patients were forced to wait longer than four hours. It now also ranks fifth in terms of the proportion of patients with suspected cancer having tests within two weeks. Previously it was one of the area’s worst performers and had missed its target every month since June 2010. Health care assistants work in the stroke ward at Hinchingbrooke Hospital. Circle chief executive claims patient care has improved . The hospital also claims to have . reduced paperwork so nurses spend more time with patients – 62 per cent . of their working day, up from 50 per cent – and has even hired a . Michelin-starred chef to improve hospital food. However, Circle’s chief executive Ali Parsa admitted the hospital may not meet its savings target for this year. Under the arrangement, which was overseen by the Government, Circle must ensure Hinchingbrooke saves £10million by next March, and £230million over the next ten years. Mr Parsa said although it was ‘broadly’ on course to meet these targets, the immediate priority was improving patient care. He said he had changed the hospital’s management style, explaining: ‘You let the doctors and nurses and the healthcare professionals – who know the patient best and who know their services best – take charge.’ The hospital – which serves 160,000 patients near Huntingdon – is being closely monitored by the Government. If deemed a success, other failing NHS trusts may follow suit. But unions say that it is early days – . and warn that the only way the hospital can save the vast sums of money . required is by laying off staff. Ali Parsa said the hospital was on course to balance its books by next year . Karen Jennings, assistant general secretary at Unison, said: ‘The staff at Hinchingbrooke Hospital have worked enormously hard to turn around what not too long ago was a failing hospital, and for this they should be rightly congratulated. 'However, these early clinical successes should not be used by Circle to whitewash persisting financial problems.’ Before the takeover, the hospital had amassed debts of nearly £40million brought about by decades of poor management, failed private finance schemes and lack of funding from the NHS.",The company that runs Hinchingbrooke Hospital is 'co-owned' by its workers and clinicians .

Karen Matthews was released from prison yesterday after serving just half of an eight-year sentence for kidnapping her daughter. Matthews, 36, was nicknamed ‘Britain’s worst mother’ after she hatched a plot to abduct Shannon, then aged nine, in February 2008 in an elaborate attempt to claim a £50,000 reward. The mother of seven was freed from Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire and taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire. She now has ambitions to appear on the tacky Jeremy Kyle Show. Sources said Matthews was given a full makeover including a new hairstyle before her release to prevent her being recognised in the street, and she will now live under an assumed name. Unlike Maxine Carr, who was jailed after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, she has not been given a new identity including a new National Insurance number and passport. Such a move would have cost the taxpayer £250,000 and required Matthews to keep her real identity a secret. It is not known if Matthews requested a new identity. But officials were so concerned that she would jeopardise it and her safety by failing to keep it a secret that they ruled it out. Matthews will use the assumed name when she comes into contact with people in a social setting, but when she is dealing with officialdom she will use her real name and rely on client and patient confidentiality to protect her identity. She will be supported in this by probation officers. Victim: Shannon Matthews was only nine-years-old when she was abducted, drugged and tied up, just a mile from her home where she was held for 24 days . Matthews, whose children are now in . care, will remain on licence for the rest of her sentence. During that . time she must observe strict rules or face being returned to jail. Last night, as she was warned to stay . away from her former home on a rundown estate, it was revealed that she . hopes to take part in the Jeremy Kyle Show on ITV1. The programme, in which people argue . about their tangled love lives and other problems in front of a baying . studio audience, has previously been likened to ‘bear-baiting’. Boarded up: The home of Karen Matthews in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was the focal point for the 3-week hunt for Shannon . A former friend, Natalie Brown, who . was with Matthews when she admitted her part in the kidnap plot, said: . ‘As far as I’m aware, from what’s been said, Karen still believes she . didn’t do anything wrong. ‘She wants to do a lie detector test . to prove that she didn’t do anything wrong and that there were other . people involved, but she won’t tell us who.’ Susan Howgate, a cousin of Matthews, . said: ‘She wants to do this lie-detector and go on Jeremy Kyle. And . she’s saying other people are involved.’ Accomplice: Michael Donovan kept Shannon stuffed in the drawer of a divan bed at his home for 24 days . Miss Howgate added: ‘I don’t want . nothing to do with her no more because she’s ruined our lives and the . rest of the family. So if I ever see her out on the streets, I’ll never . speak to her.’ After her release, Matthews was taken . to a safe house where probation officers will monitor her around the . clock over the coming days. A source said: ‘She won’t be allowed . out on her own and won’t be allowed to sign on like other offenders. She’ll be held in secure conditions to make sure that she does not come . to any harm.’ Matthews and her accomplice, Michael Donovan, 44, sparked a £3.2million police hunt when they kidnapped Shannon from her home. A tearful Matthews made TV appeals . pleading with her daughter’s abductor to set her free and hundreds of . local peoplehelped search for the girl. Shannon was found by police 24 days . later in Donovan’s flat a mile away, hidden in a compartment under a . bed. Donovan, who was also jailed for eight years, was released last . week.

But now the world’s oldest original Mini, that was found in a duty barn covered i chicken feathers, has sold for more than £40,000. The ‘classic’ motor was the eighth to be made when it rolled off the production line in 1959. But it had fallen into a decrepit state after it being bought by its last owner in 1986 and is in need of major restoration. Rusty: The grey paint work on the Mini is still visible in place, but the car is still far from roadworthy . Despite its condition, the Austin Mini Se7en De Luxe Saloon generated huge interest when it came up for auction last month. The car sold at an acution by Bonhams at The Royal Airforce Museum in London yesterday for £40,250 - nearly three times its pre-sale . estimate of between £12,000 and £15,000. The price is also an 8,000 per cent . increase on the £497 the car cost new in 1959, and more than double the . cost of a new Mini today. It was bought by a UK-based Mini enthusiast. Interior: The basic design is a far cry from modern luxuries such as air conditioning and electric windows . John Polson, from Bonhams, said: 'This . is a wonderful opportunity to buy the car and restore it. It is the . oldest unrestored Mini. 'Collectors love the fact it has had . very little done to it since it was built. It was the eight to be . produced and is the fourth oldest that survives. 'The Mini is one of the most important cars of the 20th century. They have always been collectable. 'Some collectors would want to return . her to new, but others would just like to get her going again and keep . her in the original condition.' The basic car has a 848cc engine that has done a grand total of 30,000 miles but now doesn’t work. Workings: The Mini was designed in the 1950s at a time of fuel shortages and its engine is just 848cc . It has never been touched apart from a few running repairs during its life and is the oldest unrestored Mini in existance. Through the rust it is possible to . glimpse the original Farina grey paintwork, and it retains the original . registration plate: XLL 27. The interior is basic, but has all the original features including its only dashboard instrument - a speedometer. It was built in July 1959 at Longbridge, Warwickshire, three months before the model went into full production. It was then sent to Car Mart Limited in Colchester, Essex, where it was first sold. The vehicle was bought by a David Gallimore in 1986 from a Gladys Hobro of Aldwick, Bognor Regis, in West Sussex. Mr Gallimore kept it in a garage in Chichester, West Sussex, until last year. At the same sale a Pontiac convertible . car owned by Rolling Stone Keith Richards while the band were based in . the south of France for tax reasons, sold for £37,950 pounds. Glory: Despite its run down condition the Mini retains many of the features that made it such an influential car . It is thought that only three Minis earlier than this one exist today, but they have all been restored over the years. One is at the British Heritage Motor Centre Museum in Warwickshire, and the other two are in private collections in Japan. In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. Its design came about because the Suez Crisis meant that the country was short of petrol, and smaller cars were required.","The Mini first rolled off the production line in 1959 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:40 EST, 15 November 2011 . Five teenagers have been convicted of stabbing a 15-year-old boy to death when they ambushed him outside school in a gang feud. Zac Olumegbon, a member of the TN1 gang - 'Trust No One' - was chased and then stabbed through the heart just yards from his school gates in the revenge attack in South London in July last year. As Olumegbon, whose street name was 'Little Zac' walked into school at 8.45am four members of the Guns and Shanks (GAS) gang, two then aged 15 and two aged 16, leapt from a waiting car and stabbed him four times, twice in the chest and once each in the neck and buttocks. Teachers from Park Campus School in West Norwood raced to the scene but could not save him as the five escaped in a stolen Nissan Almera car. Victim: Zac Olumegbon, 15 was stabbed to death by members of the GAS gang at the gates of Park Campus School in West Norwood, south London, in July 2010 . Mourners lay flowers at the gates of Park Campus School in West Norwood, south London, in the days following Zac's death . The day before he was murdered Zac had spoken at a conference on youth crime. Gang . members Helder ‘Mad H’ Demorais, 17, Ricardo ‘Maggi’ Giddings, 17, . Jamal 'J-Kid’ Moore, 17, and Kyle ‘Clickz’ Kinghorn, who was 18 . yesterday, were found guilty of murder and face life sentences. Shaquille Haughton, aged 16, burst into tears and put his head on a prison officer's shoulder as he was cleared of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. All five defendants are . from south London and will be sentenced on December 21. As the guilty verdicts were read out there was crying from the public gallery. At . the Old Bailey, Judge Giles Forrester lifted a ban on reporting the . identities of the gang, who were aged 15-17 at the time of the attack. Describing the day of Zac's murder, prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'Before he was able to start his school day he found himself hounded down and killed by these five defendants, armed as they were with at least two knives. 'As he ran from them he was separated from his school friends, chased, caught and stabbed to death. Getaway car: This stolen green Nissan Almera was found in Stockwell, south London, soon after the attack . 'Given the knives and the . determination with which his attackers acted, once caught there was . likely to be only one outcome - that he would receive really serious and . plainly life threatening injuries, just as was intended, just as . occurred. 'Another young schoolboy was also . stabbed with a knife immediately outside the school. He was lucky, he . survived and in the event did not suffer the fatal injuries that Zac.' The youths were armed with at least . two knives and had deliberately been driven to the school to attack Zac, . jurors heard, likely in a revenge for an attack on a GAS gang member. The murder was the climax of a south . London gang rivalry between TN1 from Tulse Hill and the GAS gang from . the Angel Town Estate in Brixton. Two weeks earlier, in mid June, a GAS . gang member had been stabbed by a TN1 gang rival when Zac was 'present . if not at the stabbing then certainly shortly beforehand.' Another young boy was injured in the confrontation but all the signs were that Zac was the ‘prime target’, said Mr Brown. He . added: ‘The reality of the events that were to lead to Zac’s death is . that it had its origin in the dreadful but certain fact of rivalry . between young gangs. Zac's mother described him as a loveable character who brought 'so much laughter and light' to the family . ‘Needless posturing that on occasion led to violence and occasion serious violence and death. ‘It was a tragic and terrible waste of a young life.’ Mr . Brown said the defendants were members of the GAS gang from Brixton, . while Zac was associated with the rival TN1 (Trust No-One) gang from . Tulse Hill. ‘Zac was a member of it and was known as Little Zac,’ said Mr Brown. His mother Shakira told the court of the pain of losing her youngest child. In a statement to the court, she said: ‘The scene that confronted me when I reached the school is indescribable. ‘Even though Zac was young, he touched many lives.’ ‘This is our life sentence. It feels like the 15 years I spent raising my son and all the hopes and dreams I had have been in vain. ‘I never thought I would bury any of my children, let alone my baby boy. ‘He was snatched away in such a cruel and heartless way.’ She said Zac had attended a conference which was helping him turn his life around. She said the day before his death Zac had spoken at a conference about youth crime and she noticed a change in him and he was 'finally making a change and hoping to become an inspiration' for others. ‘He told me he wanted to help young people facing the same problems,’ said Mrs Olumegbon. The youths will also be sentenced for wounding another schoolboy in the attack.","Zac Olumegbon was ambushed outside Park Campus School in South London last summer .

Householders who regularly dump rubbish in their own garden will be guilty of a criminal offence and hit with a hefty fine. The penalty will also apply to anyone who leaves an old sofa or fridge in their garden, or has mountains of pizza boxes or takeaway cartons lying around. They will receive an on-the-spot fine of up to £100 or be taken to court – where the maximum fine would be £2,500. The new Community Protection Notice is a key part of new anti-yob laws unveiled by Theresa May today. Theresa May addresses delegates at the Association of Chief Police Officers annual conference in Manchester today . Ministers want to stop irresponsible homeowners or tenants from blighting whole streets or neighbourhoods by turning their front garden into a ‘dumping ground’. The powers will apply to privately owned homes as well as council houses. Officials will target only those guilty of ‘persistent, unreasonable behaviour’. They will be given a warning and told to clear the rubbish away. If they ignore the notice, they will then be guilty of a crime. Officials do not want to target law-abiding householders who are forced to have rubbish in their gardens at certain times of the week because of the complicated recycling policies introduced by many councils. And the law will be worded to protect homeowners from over-zealous council officials patrolling the streets looking to make money by issuing on-the-spot fines. The Home Secretary walks around the St George's Estate in Hulme, Manchester, with (left to right) Inspector Nail Pawson of Greater Manchester Police, resident Steve Norman and PCSO Paul Egan before her speech today . Residents have been given penalty notices for putting their rubbish out on the wrong day or for not shutting their dustbin lid properly under existing ‘bin laws’. But the new rules will apply only to repeat offenders. They will be given a fixed period of time to clean up their garden before any fine is issued. Today’s antisocial behaviour White Paper also sounds the death knell for Labour’s flagship Anti-Social Behaviour Order, which is to be scrapped. There will be a bonfire of Labour’s anti-lout legislation – with 19 powers reduced to only six. The Community Protection Notice could be issued to an individual or responsible person within a business, such as a takeaway shop. It will also give police – and not just town halls – the power to deal with noisy neighbours in the middle of the night. Eyesore: Ministers want to stop irresponsible homeowners or tenants from blighting whole streets or neighbourhoods by turning their front garden into a 'dumping ground' Officials say examples of where it could be used include: . Breach of any requirement in the notice, without reasonable excuse, would be a criminal offence, subject to a Fixed Penalty Notice or prosecution. Speaking after meeting residents in Hulme, Manchester, she added: 'I want to see the police dealing with anti-social behaviour when it happens and when people are reporting it.' But victims were saying that time and time again nothing was happening, she said. 'What we've seen over the years is too many people having their lives blighted by anti-social behaviour. 'The community trigger will give people, either individuals or local communities, the opportunity to say the point has come where the police are required to do something, look into it, investigate, find out what's happening and take action.' She went on: 'What we will see is anti-social behaviour being taken seriously and being dealt with. 'What we're doing is giving people the confidence that when they call the police something will be done.' Ministers are determined to get a grip on low-level thuggish behaviour. The Asbos were routinely breached by thugs, who quickly considered having one of the orders to be a ‘badge of honour’. They were also given out in some bizarre circumstances. A woman who tried to kill herself four times by jumping off bridges was banned from loitering on bridges, going on to railway lines or entering multi-storey car parks unaccompanied. And an 88-year-old man from Merseyside was banned from swearing or making sarcastic remarks. Asbos will be replaced by Crime Prevention Injunctions, which officials say will be easier and faster to impose. Unlike the Asbo, the injunction would not require a magistrate to be certain that the defendant had acted in an antisocial manner. It would instead be secured against a lower burden of proof. 'Three strikes and you're out': New legislation will compel police to act on complaints against yobs, in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the tragic case of Fiona Pilkington, left, who killed herself and her disabled daughter Francecca, right, after sustained harassment by youngsters, despite repeat appeals to the police . ■ Drivers joined the war on litter louts yesterday by demanding tough punishments for those who throw rubbish from their vehicles. A poll by the AA found that almost 90 per cent of motorists are angered by litterbugs in cars, and two-thirds want offenders to be punished with points on their licence, a large fine or even a community sentence. This week hundreds of AA members will begin a string of litter-picks across the country, adding to the widespread support for the Daily Mail’s Spring Clean For The Queen campaign to encourage people to help clean up their communities ahead of the jubilee. More than 300 AA staff have volunteered to pick litter in areas including Basingstoke, Cardiff and Newcastle, and the AA sent out a million letters to members last weekend encouraging them to take part. Over the next fortnight, they will conduct an hour’s tidy-up of their neighbourhood’s pavements, paths and parks as part of the AA Streetwatch programme. The organisation has also put up a prize of £1,000 for the best idea for reducing rubbish on the streets. Those who breach the orders would be deemed in contempt of court and face penalties including jail. It would be made available to a broader range of agencies. When sentenced in court, those found guilty of antisocial behaviour could also be issued with a new Criminal Behaviour Order, which would force prolific offenders to attend courses to change their ways. The White Paper will also include a ‘three strikes and you’re out’ crackdown on yobs which will compel police to act if they receive three complaints from one individual about antisocial behaviour. The ‘community trigger’ will also apply if five different households lodge the same complaint. The legislation is designed to prevent a repeat of the tragic case of Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her 18-year-old disabled daughter Francecca after sustained harassment by youngsters. She dialled 999 33 times over ten years to complain but police failed to act, classing her case as a ‘low priority’. A new Directions Power will give police the power to move on troublemakers without having to first designate a specific ‘dispersal zone’ in advance. But a victims' group said the new measures still did not go far enough. The plans to enable residents to force police to take action over anti-social behaviour after three separate incidents or five complaints is still insufficient. Victims deserve to be taken seriously as soon as they make a report to police,Victim Support said. Javed Khan, the group's chief executive, said: 'We hope that the new criminal behaviour order will deliver the rapid response for victims that is needed. 'But just dishing out the orders won't be enough. 'If the Government really wants to put victims first, tough enforcement and follow-up will be required, to avoid making the CBO an empty sanction.'","Theresa May unveils new anti-yob laws to replace Labour's Asbos .

The Olympic Torch today crossed into the Republic of Ireland in a move designed to symbolise progress made by the peace process. And while decision to take the relay into a country that is not actually playing host to the Games was met with a few raised eyebrows, a few more questions would have been asked when the honour of carrying the flame was handed to two of Ireland's less illustrious celebrities. Singing twins Jedward - famed more for their haircuts and bad dancing than their voices - were chosen to be among the torchbearers for the prestigious event. And with their long spikey-blond quiffs the boisterous pair bore more than a passing resemblance to the iconic torch itself. Their inclusion comes after Olympic bosses were criticised for allowing The Voice’s American judge Will.i.am carry the torch.

Its journey towards lighting the flame at the London 2012 Games will then continue into the afternoon through Ballyronan, Magherafelt and Ballymena. The parade is scheduled to end in Moorfields at around 3pm. The brothers lined up alongside the country's sporting legends such as jockey Ruby Walsh, footballer Paul McGrath, and Olympic-winning runners Ronnie Delany and Sonia O'Sullivan for the prestigious event. In all 41 torchbearers made the historic journey through the city, with thousands of people lining the streets to watch. X Factor stars Jedward - formerly known as long-distance runners John and Edward Grimes - were greeted with cheers as they made their way down O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, and past some of the city's most famous landmarks. John said: 'It's such a great experience being here. It was such an honour to carry the Olympic Torch in the relay.

TV adventurer Ben Fogle has admitted he feels 'scared' as he prepares for his most punishing challenge yet - swimming across the Atlantic Ocean. The presenter said he will battle feelings of 'solitude and loneliness' when he spends up to 12 hours a day in the water, swimming the equivalent of the Channel, to make it in his target of 100 days. He will also face the risks of icebergs and sharks during his epic 3,000-mile journey from the U.S. to Cornwall, which will dwarf the gruelling achievement of comic David Walliams who swam much of the Thames last year. Fogle was joined by wife Marina and their two children, two-year-old Ludo and one-year-old Iona, for the launch of his challenge at the Serpentine lake in London's Hyde Park, the venue for the Open Water Swim at the Olympic Games. The 38-year-old said: 'It's something I've always dreamed of doing but I never knew if it was possible or not. 'It's a massive challenge, easily the biggest thing I've ever done. I'm not a particularly competent or confident swimmer but I love the ocean and I love a big challenge. It genuinely is into the realm of the unknown. 'It does scare me because I really don't know what is going to happen. Only one person has done this but that is what attracted me towards this. 'I do need adventure. Some people don't quite understand that but it's the only thing I'm good at, spending long times pushing myself mentally and physically. Taking the plunge: The TV daredevil practises his front crawl in the London lake where this summer's Olympic open water swim event will be held . Water babies: A wetsuit-clad Fogle hoists his two-year-son Ludo on to his shoulders while wife Marina carries their daughter Iona, one . 'Solitude and loneliness will be the biggest obstacles. Psychologically it will be very hard. Then of course there is the physical damage on the shoulders and the arms, salt burn, icebergs, sharks - all of those things are factors as well.' Fogle's previous escapades have included rowing across the Atlantic with friend and Olympic star James Cracknell, as well as racing to the South Pole, which led to him suffering frostbite to his nose. The TV daredevil has also competed in the Marathon Des Sables and has swum from San Francisco to Alcatraz. Gruelling: Fogle will swim for a punishing 12 hours a day, sleeping on a support boat manned by volunteers . He will undergo a tough training schedule over the coming months in preparation for his Atlantic swim in 2013. Only one other person has completed the ocean swim, and Fogle will be accompanied by a support yacht for sleeping and eating. He will log his starting and stopping points each day to ensure he swims the full distance. His journey will also aid homeless charity Centrepoint as he gives several young homeless volunteers the skills and opportunities to work on the project as both his short support team and yacht crew. His body will also carry sensors to allow scientists from the University of Southampton to do research into temperatures, currents and marine organisms. And he will work with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Plastic Oceans Foundation to use the trip to highlight the fragile state of the seas. Fogle - who first found fame as a participant in the BBC series Castaway in which he lived on the island of Taransay - said: 'You get out of life what you put in and the greatest achievements come from the biggest challenges. 'If I can complete it, it will be the culmination of a childhood dream and the completion of an Atlantic circle that began in the North Atlantic in 2000 where I spent the year on Taransay. 'Having rowed east to west, I will complete the circle by swimming west to east back home to Cornwall.' Seyi Obakin, chief executive of Centrepoint - which works with 1,200 young people each year - said: 'Being part of Ben's team and entrusted with new responsibilities will be life-changing for the young people who join him. 'It will inspire them to face challenges of their own, including finding a job and moving on to independent living.' Coming through: The 28-year-old dodges some of the Serpentine's resident waterfowl as he kicks off months of preparation . Louise Heaps, head of marine at WWF-UK, said: 'Our seas are under severe pressure from overfishing as well as unsustainable and poorly planned development, and WWF is proud to support our ambassador Ben's challenge to raise awareness around the issues affecting our seas and to highlight the pressing need to safeguard the future of these and other marine species and the diverse ecosystems that support them.' Fogle - who was a torch bearer on the first day of the Olympic torch relay across the UK - added: 'I hope the swim will continue to inspire people to push their boundaries, to aspire and to achieve. 'I hope that it captures the imagination, reminding us that adventures can still be had.'Fogle said the ocean was inseparably linked to his life and career. Completing the circle: Fogle (right) with Olympic rowing gold medalist James Cracknell during their row across the Atlantic in 2006. Seven years on, he will swim back the other way . He said: 'My career started in the Atlantic Ocean in the Outer Hebrides when we were marooned for a year and it then took another turn when I rowed the Atlantic with James Cracknell. 'I think for an island nation we've lost our affinity to the ocean and I want to recreate that.' Fogle has already travelled to the Azores in the North Atlantic to train and will also do some of his training swimming in the Solent, off the coast of Hampshire. The exact starting point and date of the swim will be dependent on the weather and ocean conditions.",Presenter aims to complete journey from the U.S. to Cornwall in 100 days .

Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez’s cancer battle has 'entered its end stage', it was reported today. Chavez, 57, is not expected to live more than a few months at most, according to Spanish newspaper ABC. The South American leader is now taking an opiate '100 times stronger than morphine' to relieve the severe pain of the aggressive cancer which has spread to his bones and the side effects of the chemotherapy and radiation. The drugs are so potent that 'at any moment his body will not be able to tolerate them', according to doctors treating him. Chavez is seeking re-election for a third time and registered his candidacy last Friday at the National Electoral Council. He already has a comfortable lead in the country’s polls. But sources within the president’s cancer team believe it is doubtful he will live to see the results on October 7. The medical report, seen by the Spanish newspaper, revealed that Chavez is also suffering from rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancerous tumour of the muscles attached to the bones, with metastasis. As well as the painkiller fentanyl, medical specialists have also prescribed 'bisphosphonate to combat the metastasis' and 'corticosteroids to alleviate the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy'. Praying: Hugo Chavez during his visit to Brazil where he was blessed by a priest . But the treatment is aimed at combating the spread of the cancer, not eradicating it, according to the report. The dire prognosis comes weeks after Chavez said he was making a 'progressive recovery' after undergoing cancer treatment in Cuba. His chemo followed an operation in February to have a second malignant tumour removed. The first tumor was extracted last June, also in Cuba, where the president’s cancer was first detected when he fell ill during an official visit. Two months ago Chavez called on God to spare his life in an emotional speech to the Catholic community. Chavez cried and his voice broke in the televised speech made in his home of Barinas, in front of his parents and other relatives. He has not released any details about the nature of the disease, saying only that it was in his pelvic region. He recently claimed the US may be infecting left-wing Latin American leaders with cancer after the presidents of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina were struck down with the disease.","Venezuelan president taking cocktail of drugs .

Changing faces: The photos serve as evidence of how the 44-year-old's excessive tanning habit, right, has affected her skin over the past two decades . It even appears that her face is a . few shades lighter than her body - a stark contrast to the deep tan she . sports now years over twenty later. The New Jersey woman is dubbed 'tanning mom' for allegedly taking her five-year-old daughter to a tanning salon. Krentcil, who became the target of . public ridicule for her unnatural complexion and wild media appearances, . was due in state Superior Court yesterday. But the hearing was cancelled, because . the Essex County Prosecutor's office referred the case to a New Jersey . grand jury instead. She is believed to pay $99 a month for unlimited access to the sunbed booths. Today she was pictured in a car outside her home today holding the $29.95 'Tanorexic' mom doll. Color chart: Mrs Krentcil sported a tan . back in her high school yearbook photo as well . Ringing endorsement: Patricia Krentcil, is seen leaving her home this morning holding the $29.95 'Tanorexic' mom doll . Krentcil told New York’s Daily News . that some days she tans more than others likening her extreme tanning . habit to drinking coffee: 'Do you drink coffee? Some days you don’t. Same thing.' The saga began when the teacher of . Krentcil's fair-skinned, red-haired daughter Anna noticed serious burns . on the 5-year-old's body. However, Krentcil has always denied that she took Anna into a booth. 'I would never, ever put my daughter in a tanning booth,' she told a TMZ reporter. 'Any mother who makes an accusation about me is not a mother because I’m a great mother - I would never do that to my child.' Pictures emerged on earlier this month of Anna, . along with her brother Addison, in the arms of their father Rich . Krentcil at their Nutley, New Jersey home. In court: Patricia Krentcil appeared at her arraignment last month because she was charged with child endangerment for allegedly taking her 5-year-old daughter tanning . Disturbing: Krentcil is showing no signs of slowing down with her tanning habits despite facing child endangerment charges for taking her daughter into a booth . Mr . Krentcil, a 47-year-old trader, stood up for his wife in spite of the . fact that neighbors have said she went tanning while pregnant with Anna. 'They’re making her out to be a monster,' he told The Daily News. 'She just likes it. She’s not a crazy maniac where she has to tan every day.' Krentcil . said that while she did take her daughter Anna to the tanning salon, . the little girl never got in the booth and was only there waiting for . her mother to finish her session. She argues that Anna got her sunburn . from playing in the yard and not breaking the law. Doctors say tanning . booths, which emit UV radiation, are known carcinogens. Pale family: Anna, 5, is seen being held by her father Rich Krentcil, and shown with her brother Addison , as the children are still living at home with their mother in spite of the charges . Krentcil's daughter apparently received enough of the radiation to burn her skin and leave her with painful damage, police say. Her attorney, John Caruso, disagrees, . as he said that Krentcil will be exonerated, because the evidence will . show the child never entered the booth. 'Forget . about the presumption of innocence; my client is 150 per cent innocent,' Caruso said. 'She loves that child more than her whole life. She would . never, ever allow her child to go inside a tanning bed.' Mother and daughter: The difference in hue of Krentcil (left) and Anna (right) is blatantly obvious . Shocked: Krentcil (left) and her daughter Anna (right) have been 'shaken up' by the attention from the arrest . The child is still living at home . with her mother, Caruso told Municipal Court Judge Roslyn Holmes-Grant, . though he said the state's child welfare agency is monitoring the . family. Mugshot: Krentcil clearly went tanning after her arrest (seen here) as she is darker in recent images . Krentcil said she loves tanning and . has visited salons for many years but would not do anything to . jeopardize her daughter's health. 'Never in my life would I endanger my . child by putting her in a tanning booth. I'm not dumb,' she said before . her scheduled hearing. Outside court, she called herself 'a wonderful . mother.' The Bergen County Record . reports that employees the tanning salon in Nutley, New Jersey, didn't . realize Krentcil had brought her daughter into the stand-up tanning . booth. State law prohibits children under 14 from using tanning booths. Anyone under 18 must have parental permission. The . incident was reported when a teacher at Anna's school overheard Anna . telling a friend that she went to the tanning salon with her mom, and . then the teacher pieced that together with Anna's noticeable sunburn. 'I tan, she doesn't tan,' Krentcil said, stating the obvious. With . her skin reminiscent of the outlandish character Magda from the 1998 . comedy There's Something About Mary, it is very clear that Krentcil has . been to more than one tanning session in her time. Fighting for her case: Krentcil (left) says that it was all a misunderstanding and that she did not take her daughter in the booth but only in the room while she herself was tanning . Trip to the salon: Krentcil argues the girl was in the room but not in the actual booth . Even . given the timing of her mugshot - taken on April 24 - and her Today Show . interview - which aired on May 2 - the difference in her skin tone makes . it clear that her legal scuffle didn't stop her from making a stop at . the tanning salon in the meantime. Krentcil says her daughter did not break any . laws by going in the room with her but not in the actual tanning booth. 'It's called a tanning booth and a tanning room,' she said. The legal situation has taken a toll on both Krentcil and Anna. 'It's traumatizing for a little girl who did nothing wrong but got a little sunburn,' Krentcil told Today. Police arrested Krentcil on April 24. She took the child to the tanning salon the week before, authorities say. The charge was upgraded to a felony and Krentcil was released after posting $25,000 bail. Dr . Stephanie Badalamenti, a dermatologist, told the station tanning booths . can increase the risk of developing melanoma, a deadly form of skin . cancer, by 75 percent.

Garden feud: Joan Rowe, 74, destroyed her neighbours' trees and shrubs during a six year battle over who owned a path, a court heard . The greenery hanging over a path at the bottom of her neighbours’ garden made Joan Rowe see red. So the 74-year-old, who claimed  the 3ft-wide strip of land was part of her property, decided on direct action. She went on a three-month hacking . spree with an electric saw and shears, chopping down plants in the . middle of the night and hacking at an apple tree. After trying to persuade Rowe to stop, . her long-suffering neighbours, Anthony and Sophie Cook, reported her to . police to protect what they believed was their property. Yesterday, Rowe was ordered to end to . her campaign after a judge backed the Cooks and placed her under an . indefinite restraining order. The feud began after the pensioner . insisted the path at the bottom of the Cooks’ garden was actually part . of her land, which adjoins it. She claimed to have pruned trees and . shrubs there long before 2004, when the Cooks moved next door to her . bungalow in Rusholme, Manchester. However, they maintained that the path was theirs and politely asked her to stop pruning and mutilating their plants and trees. Instead, her raids on their foliage . escalated. In all, she made more than 12 attacks on their property . between August and November last year, at one point even hacking down . bamboo at 4am. Manchester Magistrates’ Court heard she also installed CCTV cameras overlooking the path. The Cooks claimed she shouted at them . and deliberately played loud music while they were outside to spoil . their enjoyment of the garden. Rowe said she was legally entitled to . cut the shrubs and trees because they were encroaching on the path, . which she said was hers. Damage: Tree branches which Joan Lowe cut off during her campaign of harassment against the Cook family . But the Cooks showed the court Land Registry documents that confirmed the path was theirs. They told how she had damaged several plants as well as a fence. Mr Cook told the court: ‘I went through every kind of emotion. ‘I was angry, upset, I was hurt. I couldn’t believe anyone was acting in that way.’ Wrecked: A tree which has been attacked by a chainsaw in Anthony and Sophie Cook's garden . Mrs Cook added: ‘She was very aggressive. She would never listen to us. ‘We wanted to find a resolution to the . problem, to find out why she continued to come into our garden and . destroy it, and find a situation where we could all live peacefully . without interference. ‘We would like her to leave us alone. We would like to live our lives privately, with a private garden. ‘We want to go into our gardens . without fear of being shouted at, or spied on, or to have music played . loudly, without being watched, just as any other people would do.’ Rowe . claimed she had a letter from 2007 proving her ownership of the path, . but she was unable to produce it in court. Speaking of the Cooks, she said: ‘I . did always prune the silver birch. When they came here it was a . different ball game. I was told to get off it [the path]. I don’t want . to talk to them. ‘I told them I’m loath to have . anything to do with them.’ Rowe denied one charge of harassment but was . found guilty by District Judge Khalid Qureshi. She was given a restraining order . preventing her from going in her neighbours’ garden or having contact . with them. Rowe was also ordered to remove the CCTV and was told to pay . £500 court costs.

But all that could be about to change following the arrival of a fake tan which can be applied at home, but keeps skin golden for as long as three weeks. The pHenomenal tanning mousse claims to be the first home tan which looks as good and lasts for longer than a professional salon spray. Scroll down for video . Fans: Kelly Brook and Holly Valance are said to be among the celebrities impressed by the new fake tan . Costing £37.50 for 200ml, more than 77,000 bottles have been sold at Boots since its launch four weeks ago. And it has also won a celebrity following, with actress Kelly Brook, model Yasmin Le Bon and singer Holly Valance among its customers. The tan contains a secret formulation of natural ingredients which works with dihydroxyacetone (DHA), the main ingredient in fake tans which reacts with melanin in the skin to colour it, and makes the tan last longer. Tanning: pHenomenal tanning mousse is said to give the skin a golden glow for up to three weeks . The mousse dries almost instantly and is . odourless, so users avoid the sticky skin and sickly sweet smell of . traditional fake tans. Alyson Hogg, founder and chief executive of creators Vita Liberata, said: ‘It took us 14 months, but the tan we have come up with is the safest, most organic tan on the market. ‘Women also love it because it lasts four times longer than normal. Those women who get five days out of a fake tan will find that they enjoy looking bronzed for almost three weeks with pHenomenal. It dries in seconds and doesn’t smell of anything – women don’t even realise they have got it on.’ Scientists have recently clashed over the safety of DHA, a naturally occurring chemical found in sugar which is used in all fake tans, after a US study linked it to cancer. Mrs Hogg added: ‘The studies linking fake tan to cancer are a red herring. There is no evidence to show DHA causes cancer. We believe our formulas are the safest on the market.’ VIDEO: Watchmodel Katie Larmour using the pHenomenal tanning mousse...","Tanning mousse claims to keep skin golden brown for three weeks .

A dentist suffered a near fatal stroke after performing a particularly gruelling tooth extraction. Sporty Andy Davies, 33, managed to admit himself to hospital in Birmingham after falling ill in November 2011. His stroke was so severe he experienced 'locked-in' syndrome and was unable to lift a limb, speak or breathe without a ventilator. His only way of communicating was through his eyelids. Hopeful: Today Andy's condition is stable and he is gradually and slowly regaining strength and movement . Mr Davies's mother Barbara, from Liverpool, said Andy believed the extraction was probably to blame. He began to suffer from headaches and neck pain before eventually admitting himself to hospital where it was discovered he'd torn an artery in his neck causing a bleed on his brain stem . Doctors at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth hospital fought to save Mr Davies's life after the stroke. He was then put into an induced coma by medical staff to allow his body to cope with the massive trauma he suffered last November. Doctors caring for him have been amazed at his recovery from a bleed that could have easily killed him. Mr Davies - who qualified at Birmingham and has a practice in the city - was unable to move at all for around 10 weeks until life began to flicker back into his hands and legs. Today Andy’s condition is stable and he . is gradually and slowly regaining strength and movement, learning to . sit, stand, walk and talk again. The family are also hopeful he will . soon have sufficient strength to feed himself again. He is currently being cared for at rehabilitation centre called Moseley Hall, in Birmingham, although his funding is due to run out in the next few months. Mrs Davies, 27, said: 'My husband is an extraordinary man. He has achieved so much in his career and helped so many people. 'He has offered support to ex-offenders, drug users and single mums through his involvement with our church. 'Despite the poor prognosis offered by doctors after the stroke, I am confident Andy will make a recovery. This is a story of hope.' Mr Davies was a keen climber and skier before his stroke . Andy, who had been a keen climber and skier, has been able to return to his home in Bourneville a couple of times. Last weekend he stayed overnight at home and was able to attend a friend’s wedding. His mother Barbara added: 'The stroke was horrific and this has been a terrible ordeal for all the family. 'I would like to thank all the hospital staff who have helped Andy.' Andy qualified at Birmingham University in 2002, becoming the first dyslexic to qualify as a UK dentist. Since then he has worked for the NHS in general dental practice in Birmingham  where he met Emma. And the pair were married in 2008. Mr Davies was the first dyslexic to qualify as a UK dentist. He hopes one day to return to work . Emma, a teacher said: 'We were told that if Andy survived he would be left with ‘Locked in Syndrome’ which would leave him unable to communicate or move with no prospect of any independent life. We were told to prepare for the worst and that people didn’t recover form such situations.' She added: 'No one is quite sure what caused the stroke although Andy thinks the trigger was the tooth extraction which may have damaged the artery and caused it to split later.' The couple are both Christians and Emma believes the power of prayer and the help of doctors has aided Andy’s remarkable recovery. Emma said: 'We believe God answered our prayers when Andy was initially given no hope.' Andy's mother said: 'He is now able to sit on the edge of a bed for three and a half minutes; when he first came to Moseley he could only sit for 30 seconds. 'His standing has also improved. Just ten weeks ago he started out using a standing frame, which mechanically raised him into a standing position and held him there. 'Now Andy no longer needs a hoist and can push himself up and briefly hold it there with the assistance of therapists, who help with the process.' Emma said: 'Thousands of people round the world have been following Andy’s blog and have been praying for him. He’s come a long way since those dark days in November but there’s still a lot work to be done. We are hopeful that he will walk unaided again and we pray that he may one day go back to work.'

David Langton-Gilks, who is just 16, said he has accepted he is 'stuffed' following a five year battle against the disease.

David Langton-Gilks has decided he wants no more treatment after being told his brain tumour is terminal . Scroll down for video . His parents, Sacha and Toby, took him to hospital where scans showed the cancer had returned and spread from his brain down his spine. Doctors told the family the condition was now terminal and David and his parents decided not to prolong David’s pain and suffering by giving him more chemotherapy or radiation. The teenager may have just weeks left to live and is focusing on making it to his school leavers prom on June 28. David said: 'I’ve relapsed several times - but now I’m kind of stuffed. But hey, you can’t win them all.' David, from Fontmell Magna, in Dorset, hasn’t been able to go to school for the past month because his short-term memory is so badly affected by the tumour. He also relies on 15 tablets a day to help with the pain. His mother has launched an awareness campaign to highlight the importance of detecting brain tumours in children at an early stage.

Although David displayed the symptoms of the disease when he was 11, they were not simultaneous and it took five-and-half weeks to get a diagnosis. Had it been detected sooner, the tumour would have been around half the size it was and David would have stood a much better chance of survival. The symptoms of the Medulloblastoma brain tumour include vomiting, headaches, and unusual eye movements.

Male corrections officers at one Alabama prison have repeatedly abused and even raped their female inmates, according to a shocking new report. According to Alabama civil rights organisation the Equal Justice Initiative, sexual assault at Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka is ‘commonplace.’ More than 50 women stepped forward to report abuse, and several even became pregnant as a result of rape. Frequent abuse: Women inmates at an Alabama state prison said they were frequently subjected to sexual assault and rape . Reputation: Tutwiler Prison in Alabama was named the most dangerous women's prison by the Department of Justice in 2007 . The report, which was filed today with the Department of Justice, claims that male guards at the prison engaged in this abhorrent behaviours for years; the study cites incidents which occurred between 2009 and 2011. EJI said that after interviewing 50 inmates, they found ‘frequent and severe officer-on-inmate sexual violence’ that ran the gamut – from forcing women to perform sex acts in exchange for banned goods, to rape by a male corrections officer while another guard keeps lookout. EJI Executive Director Bryan Stevenson said that even when these crimes were confirmed, prison staffers received little punishment. ‘In the last two years, the person who received the harshest sentence was a man who got six months in jail,’ he told msnbc.com. He said that was punishment for raping a woman who became pregnant. DNA tests later proved the baby was his. Oppressed: According to the report, women at Tutwiler are punished for reporting the crimes, called a liar by the warden, and placed in solitary cells with reduced privileges . Mr Stevenson said that women at Tutwiler are punished for reporting the crimes, called a liar by the warden, and placed in solitary cells with reduced privileges. Alabama Corrections Commissioner Kim Thomas said in a statement that the issue was a ‘matter of grave concern to me.’ Almost 1 in every 10 former state or local prisoners reported being sexually victimized at least once by an inmate or facility staff member in prison, according to a study released earlier this month by the Justice Department. The findings, reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the first-ever National Former Prisoners Survey, may indicate a greater problem with sexual victimization than previously thought. Surveyors found that 9.6 percent of former inmates said they were sexually victimized in jails, prisons and halfway houses. A somewhat similar survey of still-imprisoned convicts done by the same agency in 2008-09 found that only 4.4 per cent of state and federal inmates said they were sexually victimized. She continued: ‘From the beginning of my watch, I have made it very clear to my staff that custodial sexual misconduct will not be tolerated and is an especially egregious offence to me. ‘We take every action possible to prevent it from happening, and if it does, we undertake prompt corrective employee discipline and pursue criminal prosecution where applicable.’ Mr Stevenson blamed the Alabama Department of Corrections for under-reporting the sexual crimes. Former Tutwiler inmate Stefanie Hibbett told CNN: ‘It’s an on-going thing, a daily thing. You see women raped and beaten, and nothing is ever done.’ Hibbett herself claims she was victim to sexual assault. Though she told the warden about the November 2010 assault, nothing was ever done. A civil suit which was filed last August was later dismissed by a judge. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment, but said it is reviewing the allegations. Tutwiler holds more than 700 inmates and in 2007 was identified as the most dangerous women’s prison in the nation, according to the Department of Justice. It ranks 11th out of 146 prisons nationwide where federal authorities investigated sexual assault, according to EJI. Mr Stevenson said his non-profit began looking into Tutwiler last year after the civil rights group was hired to represent a woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted.","Report released by civil rights group Equal Justice Initiative claims women at Tutwiler Prison for Women subjected to frequent sexual abuse .

Delayed: New mother Rachel Rodger gave birth to Luke, aged three weeks, in a hospital car park after a police road block delayed her journey . A mother was forced to give birth in a dark hospital car park after her dash to the labour ward was delayed by two police road blocks. Rachel Rodger and her husband Jason had to stop and answer officers’ questions at one of the roadblocks despite the expectant woman being in the advanced stages of labour. When the couple finally made it to Perth Royal Infirmary at around 4am, Mrs Rodger did not have time to go inside as she started giving birth to son Luke when she got out of the car. The 26-year-old said: ‘My husband ran to press the intercom and asked for the midwife to come down. My legs gave way, I was on my knees on the tarmac and the baby’s head came. ‘I was screaming and panicking. Thankfully I had a towel with me because I was worried he was going to drop on to the tarmac.’ Last night the new mother, who lives in Coupar Angus, Perthshire, told how their trip to hospital had been held up by the Tayside Police roadblocks. They had been set up in the early hours of May 13 following a break-in at a shop in Scone, Perthshire. All vehicles on the surrounding roads were stopped and their occupants questioned. Mrs Rodger had already been in the hospital a few hours earlier but was sent home because staff did not feel the birth was likely that night. However, in the early hours she was painfully aware that the arrival was imminent. When the couple set off from home they expected the journey to take half an hour. Mrs Rodger, who works for a coach firm, said they first had to wait until police had stopped talking to the occupants of a car in front. Her husband told officers at the outset that they were hurrying to the hospital but they insisted on asking all of their questions. She added: ‘When we got to Scone, we got stopped and my husband shouted out to the police officers that I was in labour. ‘They still stopped us and asked lots of details like my name, address, date of birth and place of birth. ‘They then asked what our purpose for being on the road was, even though I was clearly in labour – why else would we be on the road at four in the morning?’ On entering Perth, they came to a second roadblock, but this time police recognised the urgency of the situation and they were allowed through. Unhappy: Rachel Rodger said she was very frightened about the safety of her baby during the birth . Help on hand: A midwife from Perth Royal Infirmary helped Mrs Rodger give birth in the hospital car park . Mrs Rodger said: ‘We did get an apology from the police but I don’t think it was much of an apology. ‘I was panicking and having to stop myself from pushing. I had had a child before and I knew what was coming. When we got to the hospital and I stood up from the car, I just couldn’t go any further.’ A midwife alerted by Mr Rodger helped to deliver her baby in the car park. Mrs Rodger said: ‘They had to cut the cord in the dark, I was very frightened. Afterwards I realised people in the houses round about must have all been looking out of their windows wondering what was going on and why I was screaming. ‘I was terrified being on my own in the dark, it wasn’t nice. We are so lucky everything is okay but what if there had been any complications? What if the baby’s cord had been wrapped around its head?’ Mrs Rodger’s mother, Isobel Hindmarch, later wrote to Tayside Police to complain, telling them the delay could have had tragic consequences if there had been complications with the birth. The trained nurse said: ‘I’m very angry about what my daughter went through. Every second counts if you’re expecting a speedy delivery. ‘It should have been clear to the officer at Scone that Rachel needed to be waved through immediately.’ Responding to Mrs Hindmarch’s complaint, Inspector Ian Martin, of Tayside Police’s community policing division, apologised for the incident. He said: ‘It is a matter of great regret that our actions, intended to affect the arrest of those responsible for a break-in to a premises in Scone, resulted in a delay in your daughter getting to Perth Royal Infirmary. ‘I offer my apologies if the delay in being stopped at the road block impacted on  subsequent events and for any anxiety or distress caused to your daughter.’","Rachel Rodger and husband were forced to wait in queue of cars while officers questioned each driver .

The ‘boomerang generation’ is growing as soaring numbers of young adults return home to live with their parents. Three million have moved out of the family home for university or work – only to move back in again when independent living becomes too much of a hardship. The numbers have swelled over the past 15 years as rising property prices and a stagnant jobs market make living with mum and dad more appealing to those in their 20s and 30s. According to an analysis from the Office for National Statistics, nearly two million men and more than a million women aged between 20 and 35 live with their parents. The number of adults who return to the family home after living elsewhere – known as ‘boomerang children’ – has risen by a fifth since 1997, with most attracted by the low cost of living. One in three men aged 20 to 35 is still living with their parents, the ONS said. Its report went on: ‘There are a number of reasons that might account for this growth in numbers living with parents, but it is noteworthy that the increase over the past decade coincides with an increase in the average price paid by first-time home-buyers of 40 per cent between 2002 and 2011.’ Tough: More and more young adults cannot afford to leave home and stay with parents until at least their mid-30s. Picture posed by models. The phenomenon of boomerang children was first noticed in the early 2000s, when growing numbers of graduates were competing for work and rising house prices were putting property out of reach for many. The latest figures, from the Government’s large-scale Labour Force Survey, reveal that 1.8million men and 1.1million women in their 20s and early 30s are living with their parents. One in five men is living with his parents at the age of 28, and more than half of men do not leave the family home until they are 22. There are fewer women among the boomerang children because they are more likely to set up home with a partner at an earlier age – often picking a man who is older than them. Women are also more likely to go to university and to move away from home to do so, and single mothers are more likely to become the main custodian of their children. According to the report, there are 643,000 women living in their own homes with their children as lone parents. The report said: ‘Over 600,000 more women than men were lone parents in their own household. When relationships end, women are more likely to take caring responsibilities for any children.’ Facts: ONS map showing men and women aged 20-34 living with parents between 1997 and 2011 has increased . Detail: ONS graph showing percentage of men and women aged 20-34 living with their parents by age and sex in the UK in 2011 . It added: ‘By the age of 34, only 7 per cent of men and 2 per cent of women were living with their parents. A couple of factors are associated with this age pattern. Firstly, average earnings of young people increase during their 20s and level off in their mid-30s. ‘Secondly, the likelihood of living with a partner is higher at older ages.’ Nearly two-thirds are living with someone by the time they are 31, the report said, and so can benefit from pooled income to cover rent or a mortgage. The number of young adults who live with their parents was lowest in London, at fewer than one in five. The report said this was because of ‘the influx of young people from other regions and countries’. It was most common in Northern Ireland, at 35.3 per cent. The report brought fresh calls for the Government to encourage older couples to move to smaller homes to create more housing space. Angus Hanton of the Intergenerational Foundation campaign group, which has called for tax breaks for older people who move house, said: ‘The Coalition cannot continue to leave young people’s housing and employment prospects to a market stacked in favour of the older generation.’","Nearly three million young adults living at home in 2011, an increase of almost 500,000 since 1997 .

Those checking a second back on the airline will have to hand over an additional $100, up from $50 just one year ago. But United is just one of many taking away the complementary checked baggage. Delta announced in January that it was raising its fees from $75 to $100 as well. Excess baggage: While the first checked bag is still free, the fees have steadily risen for the second, and doubled in the case of UA . High-flying headache: United Airlines is raising fees for a second checked bag on some international flights $100, citing rising fuel and handling costs . 'United’s international customers will continue to be able to check in their first bag free of charge.  This change reflects an increase in costs associated with carrying bags such as fuel and handling' Christen David, a spokesperson for United Airlines, told the Mail Online on Tuesday. This is the second such price increase in two years, when United raised its fee between the U.S. and Europe $20, from $50 to $70. Airline analyst Hunter Kaye said that despite the $30 increase, the airline should only expect ‘modest’ profits – around $30million. He said that it is likely the rest of the major carriers within the U.S. will follow suite and increase prices to match. US Airways and American Airlines charge $70 and $60 for second bags checked on international flights, respectively, according to ABC News. The additional charges usually fall on leisure travellers, who do not belong to a business or preferred flier program. Summer of discontent: Members of the Airline Pilots Association picket the United shareholders meeting, in Times Square today; they say they have been working two years without a contract . Falling in line: Delta Airlines hiked their second bag fee to $100 in January . Across the board: United has increased its fees for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, but not for other points of flight . In addition, many passengers are able to circumvent baggage fees by simply modifying their behaviour. Those going on shorter trips can eke by with the standard one bag, one personal item as carry-ons, though certain airlines are stingier than others with space requirements and airplane size. But the alarming rise in baggage fees may have more capitalistic origins. TIME’s Moneyland writer Josh Sanburn believes that the prices are almost opportunistic, and will bank on the U.S. tourist rush to the Continent as prices make travel more appealing. 'Considering the economic turmoil in Europe, you might think that the airline would consider putting fewer financial obstacles in the way of Americans taking a trans-Atlantic flight to the Old World,' he said. 'Nope. Not even declining jet fuel prices halted the move.' Mr Sanburn added that many American families will be heading across the Atlantic because the U.S. dollar is relatively strong. US Airways did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment on the fare hike. This year, airline profits are forecasted around $3billion, a wafer thin margin of just 0.5 per cent on projected revenues of $631 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association. While airlines can make more money from selling extras, it also means more travellers are getting squeezed as they're forced to pay for things that used to come with the ticket such as seat assignments. U.S. airlines, for example, are setting aside more economy seats requiring an extra fee because they come with more legroom or are closer to the front. The extra revenue from add-ons such as seat assignments and priority check-in could total $30-$60billion over the next five years, according to IATA. Passengers took to social media to express their unhappiness. One Twitter user wrote: 'Now United is on my 'Do Not Fly' list, along with Spirit.' Another said: 'We need a new airline term for ""highway robbery.""'","United Airlines upped fee for second checked bag from $70 to $100 on flights from the U.S. to Africa, Europe, India, and the Middle East .

Over 13 heartbreaking years, she suffered 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of her son at just two weeks old. But now the 32-year-old nurse and her partner have their long-awaited family, in the form of seven-week-old Mia Shannon – helped into the world by a daily dose of aspirin. Joy: Maria Pridmore and partner John Foran had been trying to have a baby for 13 years before they had Mia, pictured . Miss Pridmore said: ‘Being a mother is better than I ever imagined it could be. ‘After all the miscarriages and the two we lost, I didn’t think it would ever happen.’ Miss Pridmore and her partner, John . Foran, always wanted children. But each time she became pregnant, their . joy turned to despair when she miscarried. ‘It was just horrible. To keep going through it again and again was just agony,’ she said. ‘We were both determined to keep trying, but it put a huge strain on our relationship.’ In 2003, the couple suffered the sorrow of stillbirth when their daughter, who they named Shannon, died in the womb. And six years later, Miss Pridmore gave birth to a son, Kia, who was premature. He died just two weeks after his birth. As well as taking an emotional toll, . the losses affected Miss Pridmore’s health, and she suffered two strokes . by the time she was 30. In the end, the couple, from Moulton Seas End, . Lincolnshire, made the difficult decision to give up on their dream of . having a family. Before the birth of Mia, Maria had endured 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of a two-week old . Tributes: Maria and John kneel by the graves of their stillborn daughter Shannon and their son Kia who died at 15 days old . But soon afterwards, Miss Pridmore discovered she was pregnant again. Memories: The hand and footprints of Baby Kia who died in 2009 . She said: ‘It was a bit of a shock, . and I didn’t dare to hope it would have a happy ending.’ To add to her . fears, she was diagnosed with both pre-eclampsia and strep B – a . potentially deadly combination which causes blood clots to form in the . placenta, cutting the supply of nourishment to the baby. Annette Briley, consultant midwife for . baby charity Tommy’s, said: ‘If the placenta isn’t working well, it . could result in a miscarriage or early birth.’ So Miss Pridmore was instructed to . take an aspirin a day to make her platelets – the tiny structures in . blood that help it clot – more slippery and stop them sticking together. She also received twice-daily . injections of another blood-thinning drug, Clexane, and was ordered to . stay in bed throughout her pregnancy, with the exception of weekly trips . to the hospital for scans. Doctors at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, . Lincolnshire, were forced to perform an emergency Caesarean after Miss . Pridmore suffered further complications days before the baby was due. But despite everything, Mia arrived healthy and happy on January 16, weighing 4lb 12oz. Mr Foran, 35, said: ‘I really don’t know how to put into words what I felt. ‘It doesn’t compensate for what has happened in the past, but it makes it a bit easier.’ Miss Pridmore added: ‘It  goes to show you can never give up hope.’ Grief: Maria with her father John in hospital with Baby Kia shortly before his tragic death .","Maria had first miscarriage when she was 19.

An NHS hospital trust losing £1m a week has been put into administration to try and stop it collapsing, the Department of Health said today. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has appointed a trust special administrator to try and turn around the struggling South London Healthcare NHS Trust. The trust is in danger of following the South London Healthcare Trust, which runs three hospitals including Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich (pictured) and was put under the charge of a special administrator for being on the brink of bankruptcy . Mr Lansley said: 'I have decided it is in the interests of . the health service and, in particular, of the patients the Trust . serves.' The Trust has been put on an 'unsustainable providers regime' and the government has appointed Matthew Kershaw with the task of putting it back on a 'viable footing.' Mr Kershaw currently works as the national director for provider delivery at the Department of Health. He will take over the Trust's board on Monday July 16 and recommend measures to Mr Lansley at the start of next year. The chairs and directors have been informed that they have been suspended from board duties. It is the first time in NHS history . that a trust has been forced to hand over its administration powers to the . Department of Health after failing to meet prescribed standards. New appointment: Matthew Kershaw is the special administrator tasked with sorting out the Trust . The . Trust was only created in 2009 after the merger of three hospitals - . the Princess Royal in Orpington, Queen Mary's in Sidcup and the Queen . Elizabeth in Woolwich. Yet it has gone £150million in the red over the past three years largely because of crippling Private Finance . Initiative deals agreed by the last Labour government. The two PFI deals are now costing £61million a year in interest. Last year's deficit, paid off by money from elsewhere in the NHS budget, could have paid for 1,200 nurses or 200 hip replacements a week. The Health Secretary stepped in after . draft financial plans showed the trust would have a deficit of . between £30million and £75million a year for the next five years, despite efforts to tackle . the situation. Today he said: 'Past efforts have not succeeded in putting the South London Healthcare Trust on a sustainable path. 'This will be a big challenge and my key objective for all NHS Trusts is . to ensure they deliver high-quality services to patients that are . clinically and financially sustainable for the long term. 'The purpose of the trust special administrator is to ensure that . services are high quality and to ensure a lasting clinical and financial . solution. Health secretary Andrew Lansley said the ground-breaking decision was in the interest of patients . 'Although there have been some improvements in mortality rates, . maternity services and infection control, and some early signs of . improvements in waiting times, they do not go far enough. It will be . impossible for South London to build on these improvements while . tackling such a large deficit. 'Matthew, working with clinicians, all other staff, commissioners, . patients, the public and other stakeholders, must now drive the changes . and shape a sustainable solution for South London Healthcare NHS Trust . and the local health economy. 'I am confident that with the regime I am enacting today in place, and . working extensively with clinicians, health service leaders, patients . and local people, Matthew will have the tools and framework in place to . find a long-term satisfactory solution for the people of south east . London.' Mr Kershaw will first publish a report on October 29 after examining the Trust's long-standing difficulties. He will then launch a 30-day consultation with staff, patients and public on a draft report. A final report will be sent to Mr Lansley on January 8, 2013. Mr Kershaw said: 'My priority is to work with staff, patients, the public and all those involved in healthcare services in the south east London area to maintain high quality, effective services during the running of the Unsustainable Provider Regime. 'This means developing recommendations that ensure that people in south east London can access high quality, safe, and financially sustainable NHS services for the long-term. 'Together we will need to think differently, be bold and accept that change needs to happen. The status quo is not sustainable.' A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'This announcement is an unprecedented step by the Secretary of State and moves the NHS into unchartered waters. 'It presents a worrying state of affairs for both patients and staff at the Trust, who will be undoubtedly concerned by today’s decision. 'We know that the Trust has been in financial difficulties for some time. However, despite this, frontline staff have continued to do their best for patients, providing a high level of care.'","Health Secretary says the ground-breaking decision is in the interest of patients .

"By . Steve Doughty . UPDATED: . 19:54 EST, 7 July 2011 . A city has been carpeted with a million bin bags after a strike by binmen over pay cuts. Town hall chiefs yesterday issued safety warnings about rats and told residents that flies and bad smells are usually harmless. But the 240,000 people of Southampton were given no promises on when thousands of tons of rubbish will be cleared. Refuse collectors already in their seventh week of industrial action promised fresh strikes next week. Disgusting: Residents of Southampton are forced to pile high their rubbish sacks as the bin strike enters its seventh week . Hundreds of thousands of festering bin bags are piled up just yards from homes in Southampton . Although bin teams were back at work . yesterday, a continuing go-slow means that the backlog of thousands of . tons will not be cleared before they stop again. Officials have put the backlog in the . ‘Sewer City’ at 2,000 tons, which according to local estimates means as . many as a million bin bags may need to be cleared from streets and . driveways. Some families are reported to have banned children from . playing outside in case they encounter rats, while others have . complained of ‘sewer-like’ smells. The Tory-run authority has apologised . to residents and advised people to take rubbish to their local tips if . possible. Otherwise, they should ‘double-bag’ waste and put bags on top . of wheelie bins to try to stop animals getting at them. Overflowing: The rubbish could take six weeks to clear after bin men went on strike . The council said: ‘Where food refuse . is available, rats often become bolder and people start to notice them . more. You should always use gloves when handling refuse and refuse bags . that might have been contaminated by rats and always thoroughly wash . your hands with soap and hot water after handling refuse.’ But flies and maggots, the authority . advised, should not be a threat to health. ‘Many people find maggots . unpleasant but it is the adult flies that carry the germs,’ residents . have been told. The advice said that smells will . develop quickly in warm weather but ‘although this is unpleasant and can . cause people distress or affect their feeling of well-being, it is not, . in itself, a health hazard’. Festering: Waste chiefs estimate 2,000 tonnes of waste is lying uncollected . Rotting: One councillor has said Southampton now resembles a Third World refugee camp . Residents were also told there would be no council tax rebates because of the strike. Around 2,400 Unite and Unison union . members at the council are taking industrial action over pay cuts for . those earning more than £17,000. The council says it needs to save . £25million this year. City waste chief Andrew Trayer estimated it could take at least two to three weeks to clear the backlog. Andy Straker, regional organiser of . Unison, said: ‘With rubbish piling up on the streets and further strike . action due to take place from Monday, all the council can do is sit in . their offices and sulk. This city needs leadership from its civic . officers and all it gets is silly games from grown men acting like silly . boys.’","One councillor described rubbish-filled Southampton as a Third World refugee camp .

Britain could face another house price boom, fuelled by the ageing population and the rising number of immigrants, a Bank of England expert said yesterday. In a research paper, Professor David Miles predicted ‘a rising trajectory for real house prices’.His report comes as the average asking price in one exclusive corner of London, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, hit £2million for the first time. A decade ago, the average asking price in the area was £650,600, which means it has trebled in ten years. House prices have recorded their biggest 'spring bounce' in eight years, fuelling hopes that the property market will be more robust in 2012 than last year . Professor Miles, who sits on the Bank’s . interest rate-setting monetary policy  committee, also warned that . changes to the mortgage industry since the credit crunch meant that . young people will have to wait longer before they can afford to  buy a . home because they will be saving  for a larger deposit. House prices have dropped since the last boom, but Professor Miles said: . ‘The trend of rising real incomes and the likelihood of rising . population density means we should anticipate a rising trajectory for . real house prices over the longer term. ‘This is particularly likely in a country like the UK where population density looks set to rise relatively fast.’ He singled out the ageing population, with one in six people currently . alive in the UK expected to celebrate their 100th birthday, as well as . the growing number of immigrants. London asking prices reached a new high of £455,159, up 7.3 per cent year-on-year and all 10 regions in England and Wales recorded monthly price rises this month . At present, 62.2million people live in Britain, but the Office for . National Statistics expects this number to balloon. By 2020, it is . expected to hit 67.2million, rising again to 71.4million by 2030, . according to the ONS’s latest population estimates. The prospect of a further rise in house prices will be a cause for . celebration for millions of homeowners, but a blow for an equal number . trying to get onto the housing ladder. Over the past 25 years, house prices have reached levels which leave . many people unable to afford to buy their own home. In 1986, the average . home in a British city cost £35,209. Today the same property would cost . around £170,000. In his report on population growth, house prices and mortgages, . Professor Miles also painted a dramatic picture of how fundamental . changes to the mortgage industry since the credit crunch will affect . young people. Salubrious: Lennox Gardens, in Chelsea, where homes easily sell for over £2 million . He said the mortgage market has changed in a ‘permanent’ and ‘very . abrupt’ way which has been ‘stark, particularly for new buyers’. Professor Miles said: ‘The first effect is likely to be prospective . buyers postpone their purchase, while they save more to accumulate a . larger deposit. ‘As a result, the average age at which people would buy their first home . will rise, and the  share of owner-occupied houses will fall.’ The average age of a first-time buyer is currently 29, but this is . heavily skewed by the fact that many only managed to buy after getting . help from their parents. Professor Miles said the change in the mortgage . market is not a bad thing. He said the fact that banks and building societies insist on large . deposits to get the best loan deals is not the sign of a damaged market, . or one which is not functioning properly. He singled out the 100 per cent mortgage deals, prevalent during the . last boom, which allowed people to buy without saving a penny for a . deposit. Record highs: The average asking prices in west London's Kensington and Chelsea have surged past £2m for the first time . Professor Miles said: ‘It probably never made sense for there to be 100 per cent mortgages. ‘There may be no price at which it makes commercial sense for such a loan to be available.’ The report comes at a time when soaring numbers of families are being . forced to rent because they cannot afford to buy. The Government’s . English Housing Survey shows 16.5 per cent of households in England are . renting their home privately, the highest number since the 1970s. Meanwhile, the number of homeowners is falling. Of the 21.9million . households in England, 66 per cent own their home, compared with 70.9 . per cent in 2003, the year that it peaked. By comparison, the number of private rents has jumped from two million in 2000 to 3.6million in 2010. Matt Griffiths, from the first-time buyer campaign group Priced Out, . warns: ‘A new  generation of families will be growing up in insecure . rented accommodation. ‘They will face the possibility of eviction at short notice, making it . much harder to settle down and have stability in where your children go . to school or nursery.’","All 10 regions in England and Wales record monthly price rises this month .

It’s no yolk - a sculptor has created the world’s smallest chocolate egg, so tiny it fits on the head of a PIN. Micro sculptor Willard Wigan spent two weeks carefully crafting the egg, fashioned from real chocolate and wrapped in real gold foil. It is so small, the egg is barely visible with the naked eye - and you probably wouldn’t even taste it if you ate it whole. The intricate detail on the egg can only be appreciated by looking through a super-strength microscope. Mini egg: Willard Wigans' creation, the worlds smallest Easter egg - so tiny it fits on the head of a pin . Williard Wigan spent two weeks crafting his chocolate creation which is too small to see... and taste . The tiny egg is roughly one seventh of the size of a pin head, and sculpted from a tiny portion of a real Thornton’s easter egg. Willard, from Birmingham, struggled to create the amazing piece - after the tiny pieces of chocolate he was using were so small they melted under the bright lights he uses to see his tiny artworks. He was forced to resort to crafting a miniscule egg shape from a single grain of sand - before drizzling it with melted chocolate and slowly chipping away using a minute chisel made from a shard of diamond. Willard, whose sculptures regularly sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds, said: 'Working with chocolate was a real challenge for me. 'It’s not like any material I’ve ever used before, and it was so difficult as the heat from the lamp, and even from my fingertips, kept making it melt. 'I eventually realised the only way I could get the right egg-shape was to sculpt it from sand first, and then cover it in chocolate. 'I then added a gold left around the bottom of the egg, to give it the appearance of it being unwrapped. 'I always keep striving to make smaller and smaller sculptures - and I think it’s safe to say this is the smallest Easter egg the world has ever seen.' Willard’s incredible sculptures are . so intricate that he has even had to learn to slow down his heart rate . while creating them - as even the pulse in his thumb is enough to wreck . hours of hard work. And on more than one occasion, he has . even accidentally INHALED some of his priceless creations while putting . the final touches to them. He added: 'I have to be really . careful when making the sculptures - there have been occasions where . I’ve just breathed in and whoosh - all my hard work was gone in a single . breath. 'I had to create a . special cage for the egg while I was working on it - with big sides - . so if I accidentally blew it away, I wouldn’t have too far to look for . it.'

Four out of five Facebook users have never bought a product or service as a result of advertising or comments on the social network site, a poll has revealed. The poll, conducted online by Reuters and Ipsos Public Affairs, is the latest sign that much more needs to be done to turn 900 million Facebook customers into advertising dollars. The poll also found that 34 per cent of Facebook users surveyed were spending less time on the website than six months ago, whereas only 20 per cent were spending more. Potential revenue: A survey of more than 1,000 Americans found that 80 per cent have never bought a product as a result of Facebook advertising . The findings underscore investors' worries about Facebook's money-making abilities, which have pushed the stock down 29 per cent since its initial public offering last month - reducing its market value by $30 billion to roughly $74 billion. Of those polled, 46 per cent said the market debut, seen by investors as troubled, has made them less favorable toward Facebook. The poll was conducted between May 31 and June 4,  involving 1,032 Americans. Of them, 21 per cent said they had no Facebook account at all. The Reuters/Ipsos Public Affairs poll of 1,032 Americans, conducted online between May 31 and June 4, found: . 80% have not bought a product, regardless of Facebook advertising and/or the recommendation of Facebook friends or users. 60% of daily users are between the ages of 18 and 34. 50% used Facebook now as much as they did six months ago. 46% says the IPO has made them less favourable towards Facebook. 40% say they use Facebook every day. 34% spent less time on the site than six months ago, citing their reasons as that it is 'boring', 'not relevant' or 'not useful'. 29% of daily users are over the age of 55. 21% have no Facebook account at all. Facebook's 900 million users make it among the most popular online destinations, challenging entrenched Internet players such as Google and Yahoo. Not everyone is convinced the company has figured out how to translate that popularity into a business that can justify its lofty valuation. Shares of Facebook closed on Monday's regular trading session down three per cent at $26.90 (£17.54). While the survey did not ask how other forms of advertising affected purchasing behavior, a February study by research firm eMarketer suggested Facebook fared worse than email or direct-mail marketing in terms of influencing consumers' decisions. Debra Williamson, an eMarketer analyst,  said: 'It shows that Facebook has work to do in terms of making its advertising more effective and more relevant to people.' Last month General Motors , the third largest advertiser in the U.S., said it would stop paid advertising on Facebook. Facebook declined to comment in detail on the survey, but referred to case studies of companies such as Nutella, which found that a 15 per cent increase in sales was attributable to Facebook. The internet company also pointed to restaurant chain Applebee's, whose Facebook ads delivered a threefold return on investment. Measuring the effectiveness of advertising can be tricky, particularly for brand marketing in which the goal is to influence future purchases rather than generate immediate sales. Disappointing news: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is yet to figure out a way to tap into the social network's increasing number of mobile phone users. Facebook only offers limited advertising on its mobile platform . The success of an ad campaign must be considered in relation to the product, said Steve Hasker, president of Global Media Products and Advertiser Solutions at Nielsen. He said: 'If you are advertising Porsche motor cars, and you can get 20 per cent of people to make a purchase, that's an astonishingly high conversion rate. 'If you are selling instant noodles, maybe it's not.' About two out of five people polled by Reuters and Ipsos Public Affairs said they used Facebook every day. Nearly half of the Facebook users polled spent about the same amount of time on the social network as six months ago. Keeping users coming back is crucial for all social media services, said Gartner analyst Ray Valdes. He added: 'Facebook continuously has the challenge of Facebook fatigue, of the novelty factor wearing off, and therefore they have to introduce new kinds of interaction.' He cited features such as the 'Timeline' interface and the planned $1 billion acquisition of mobile photo-sharing app Instagram. The survey provides a look at the trends considered vital to Facebook's future at a time when the company has faced a harsh reception on Wall Street. Facebook's $16 billion IPO, one the world's largest, made the U.S. company founded by Mark Zuckerberg the first to debut on markets with a capitalisation of more than $100 billion. More work needed: The poll not only showed that Facebook users were not swayed by advertising, they were also not inclined to accept the recommendations of Facebook friends . Its coming out-party, which culminated years of breakneck growth for the social and business phenomenon, was marred by trading glitches on the Nasdaq exchange. A decision to call some financial analysts ahead of the IPO and caution them about weakness in its business during the second quarter has triggered several lawsuits against Facebook and its underwriters. While Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, mostly from ads on its website, sales growth is slowing. Consumers' increasing use of smartphones to access Facebook has been a drag on the company's revenue. It offers only limited advertising on the mobile version of its site and analysts say the company has yet to figure out the ideal way to make money from mobile users. Facebook competes for online ads with Google, the world's No.1 web search engine, which generated roughly $38 billion in revenue last year. Google's search ads, which appear alongside the company's search results, are considered among the most effective means of marketing. Facebook is still perfecting the effectiveness of its ads, said Mr Valdes, but he said he was surprised that the comments posted on the website from Facebook users' friends were also only responsible for 20 per cent of users making a purchase. He said: 'Comments and recommendations from friends on Facebook do carry a lot of weight, so I'm surprised by the number.' The most frequent Facebook users are aged 18 to 34, according to the survey, with 60 per cent of that group being daily users. Among people aged 55 years and above, 29 per cent said they were daily users. Of the 34 per cent spending less time on the social network, their chief reason was that the site was 'boring', 'not relevant' or 'not useful'. Privacy concerns were also mentioned.","Social network desperate to capitalise on its 900million customers .

A former teacher has revealed how she leapt from a cliff edge to save her 19-month-old son after he fell over the side as they chased butterflies. Melanie Liu feared the worst when she saw her youngest son Eli slip off the edge as they enjoyed a picnic at a beauty spot in Whitby, North Yorkshire. The cliff has a drop of some 65 feet to a concrete car park, but luckily Eli was unhurt because he landed in a bush about 15 feet down. Safe and sound: Melanie Liu hugs her 19-month-old son Eli (left) after he survived falling off a cliff at Spion Kop in Whitby by landing in a bush (right) Ms Liu jumped down to him, breaking her fall slightly by grabbing grass and digging her nails into the cliff face. Ms Liu, 39, who runs a guest house with her husband Bill, 44, said the incident happened on Spion Kop in Whitby last Saturday. She said they had been following butterflies with her little lad at what she thought was a safe distance. But the thick grass and vegetation at the spot made it seem to her that they were two feet from the edge, when in fact they were much closer. Ms Liu, a mother of two, said she had a firm hand on the hood of Eli’s jacket but as the child took one more step towards the edge - a distance she thought was too close - he disappeared over the side. 'It was just the worst moment of my life, he somersaulted twice and landed on a shrub about 15 feet down,' she said. 'As he dropped I jumped, you just don’t think about it at the time. It was a maternal instinct. 'They say your whole life flashes before your eyes but it was his death that flashed before mine, I was afraid of what I would see when I found him. 'I know what was at the bottom of that cliff. It was a terrifying moment.' She said she stopped beside her son, who had started crying as soon as he landed in the bush. 'I grabbed him and laid for ages on that bush, she said. 'I was shaking that much it felt like hours but it was probably minutes. It is your worst fear. Terrified: Ms Liu said it was the worst moment of her life when Eli fell while chasing butterflies . 'I was saying ""don’t move baby, stay still baby"".' Despite wearing four-inch high-heeled boots, Ms Liu was able to bring Eli back to the top after a few minutes. 'Once we got to the top we lay down for a long time,' she said. 'After 10 minutes he was fine but I was in shock and started being sick and shaking. My heart was hammering. 'It was around five minutes from when Eli fell until I got him back to safety but it seemed like hours. 'There are only one or two of those shrubs on the side of the cliff. It is so lucky that he landed on one. 'As soon as Eli fell I started screaming and was still screaming when I jumped over the side but I hadn’t realised it. 'A man had been watching on another cliff and ran to get round to us. He told me that he had heard a bloodcurdling scream. 'I was bit incoherent but but he calmed me down.' Ms Liu said the man who helped her was called Tom and lived in Somerset but she had no more details. She warned other people to take care at the cliff edge but said the grass should remain overgrown for the wildlife. She said: 'I never once let go of him and thought nothing would happen but the edge is much closer than you think. 'It took me ages to get home. I kept being sick and bursting into tears on the way. 'I won’t be going near a cliff edge again with children, no way. 'I consider myself to be a safety-conscious mum, but look what happened.'

The once-daily pill was developed by UK scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and trials were partly funded by British charities. But it has been branded as too expensive by the rationing watchdog the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. 'Not cost-effective': Abiraterone (pictured) is the latest prostate cancer drug to face an NHS ban despite being proven to extend life for men with advanced disease . Deadly toll: Prostate cancer has been described in the past as a low-profile 'Cinderella' disease . Abiraterone is the latest prostate cancer drug to face an NHS ban despite being proven to extend life for men with advanced disease. Last month another drug – Jevtana – was turned down as ‘not cost-effective’. It is a fresh blow for doctors and patients who hoped a new era of drugs could lessen the deadly toll of prostate cancer, which has been described in the past as a low-profile ‘Cinderella’ disease. Trials show men taking abiraterone and a steroid survived for nearly 15 months, while men given steroid treatment and a ‘dummy’ pill lived for 11 months on average. But some patients live far longer than expected, including Britons who have survived on the drug for more than four years after developing advanced disease. The drug also eased pain for twice as many men in the trials. Bitter blow: Campaigners condemned the draft decision by Nice, which could deny sufferers and their families vital time together . A year’s course of treatment costs £35,000, which Nice says is too expensive. Campaigners last night condemned the draft decision by Nice. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Prostate Cancer Charity, which helped fund trials, said: ‘This draft decision is a bitter blow to thousands of men and their families – and must be overturned.’ Patients have been getting abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, through the Cancer Drugs Fund, set up by the Government to pay for treatments not approved by Nice. But the fund only applies in England until 2014, which denies access to patients in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.","Once-daily pill giving extra months of life is 'too expensive'

And although they’re heralded as an international . delicacy and served in restaurants across the world, snails topped the list as most hated food. Tripe, oysters, squid and . anchovies also made up the top end of the ‘gastro-dislike’ list. Brits have been voted the fussiest food nation (picture posed by models) The Fussy Food Nation Report also found that amongst the top 20 most hated foods were liver, . olives, black pudding, kippers, blue cheese, beetroot, sardines, and . Brussels sprouts, which may not surprise many. What may come as a shock to foodies is . the fact that delicacies such as avocado, goats’ cheese, pate, prawns . and mushrooms have made the top 40 most disliked foods, which shows that . once and for all we’re a nation of fussy eaters. And it's children that are the biggest culprits . when it comes to refusing to eat certain foods with 39% being fussy eaters, while 24% of fathers are fussy followed narrowly by mothers at 23%. Escargot was voted the most hated food above tripe and oysters . A staggering 54% of people in relationships say their partner is a fussier eater than they are, with a tenth of Brits . even resent their partner sometimes because they don’t like a food that . they enjoy eating (10%). A quarter of the 2,000 people studied . feel their own diet suffers because their mother, father or sibling . refuses to eat particular foods. It's not just partners that . prove fussy - forty per cent of parents confessed they'd gone to huge . extents to get their kids eating greens by bribing their children to eat . the food in front of them. The study, which was . conducted by Hotpoint to mark the launch of the Active Oxygen fridge . freezer, which keeps food fresher for longer, also revealed 41% of . parents sneak healthy foods into their children's meals to ensure they . are getting nutrition. Not only are we fussy eaters but also just under half of us say we don’t eat as healthily as we should, one in five of us say this is because fresh food tends to spoil quickly, with most of us saying we’re simply too busy to eat healthily. Snails . Tripe . Oysters . Squid . Anchovies . Liver . Cockles . Kidneys . Olives . Black pudding . The study also asked people what puts them off certain foods, with almost 60% saying the texture and more than half saying the smell. One in seven say being forced to eat a certain food as a child has left them hating it forever, while a similar number say they hate certain foods so much they physically make them ill. Cook, food writer and broadcaster Valentine Warner said: 'I’m astounded that so few people enjoy eating beetroot, it’s one of my all-time favourite vegetables. 'Perhaps everyone has been put off by the slightly limp, pickled sort in jars? When eaten fresh, it’s delicious. 'I’d implore people to try more foods and to not be put off by previous experiences; yes, even snails can actually be very tasty. Experiencing new food is a joy, you may not like everything but it’s trial and error and in my experience, the more you try things the more you get to like them.' When it comes to our children, four in ten of us have had to resort to desperate measures to get them to eat their vegetables, with steps ranging from ‘sneaking’ them onto their plate, or ‘hiding’ them in a recipe, to bribing them with money in a last ditch attempt to encourage healthy eating. Typically the humble Brussels sprout, mushrooms and spinach feature among the most challenging foods to convince our children to eat.","Escargo, tripe and oysters top the list .

The other boasts shop-bought sausage rolls, cheese puffs, breadsticks, cucumber slices and salad cream, washed down with tins of Boddingtons and cans of cola. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the street party near the constituency home of David and Samantha Cameron that offered the rather more upmarket fare on the third day of celebrations to toast The Queen's Jubilee celebrations. Prime Minister David Cameron along with his wife Samantha attend the Spelsbury village street party, near their West Oxfordshire home . A street party to commemorate The Queen's Diamond Jubilee at Ashby De La Zouch, Leicestershire . The couple took their three children to the Jubilee celebration in a quiet cul-de-sac in the Cotswold village of Spelsbury, where delights such as red cabbage coleslaw and homemade mini-pizzas were on offer. Mrs Cameron, 41, made a beeline for a salad of lamb’s lettuce and crispy bacon, dishing up a portion for her husband, 45, and then herself.

The event was in stark contrast to the more colourful street party laid on in the market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. Union Jack tablecloths, cups, plates and balloons adorned the tables, which were piled with more conventional party snacks such as crisps, dips and ham sandwiches. These were apparently washed down with tins of Boddingtons bitter, bottles of lager, glasses of white wine and paper cups of fizzy drinks. Guests added to the colourful celebrations by wearing red, white and blue clothes – with some donning masks bearing the faces of members of the Royal Family. In West Oxfordshire, the party decorations amounted to a few more modest strings of bunting, and diners ignored the tables and chairs in favour of mingling by the gazebos. Spelsbury parish councillor Susan Tolputt, who has lived in the village for 12 years and was one of the event’s organisers, said:  ‘Everyone in the village made something and brought it along, resulting in an amazing display of food. ‘Around 200 people came and although there were tables and chairs, people stood around talking to each other while enjoying the barbecue. ‘It was a wonderful day and it was nice  to see the Camerons because they don’t spend so much time here now they are in Downing Street.’ Into the jubilee spirit: David Cameron helps himself to a cupcake as he attends a street party with his wife Samantha in Spelsbury, near their West Oxfordshire home .

A big screen was set up, showing the Royal flotilla, and bunting adorned the front of Number 10 and Number 11. But with just hours to go until the start of the party, officials decided it was best to invite the 120 guests indoors to enjoy the specially decorated Jubilee cup cakes and sandwiches in the warmth of the Terracotta room. No 10 spokesperson said: 'To celebrate the Jubilee, and as part of his duties as Prime Minister and an MP, David Cameron attended two street parties, one in Downing Street, the other in his constituency.'

The former Mayor of London was out on the streets of Brent in the north-west of the capital, where he joined in the jubilee celebrations with the borough's residents. It certainly seems a change of heart towards the Royal Family since making his views very publicly known in the past. Is he a royal convert? Former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone greets a resident in Brent, north-west London as he joins in the Jubilee celebrations having previously voiced his distaste for the monarchy . For it was he who released 1,000 black balloons from County Hall back in 1981 to 'mourn' the wedding off Prince Charles and Diana. And in a newspaper interview in 1996, he referred to the royals as 'our most sordid soap-opera' which had been populated by 'not very bright…airheads in high heels'. When it was the turn of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to tie the knot, he did at least show some kind of turnaround by calling for free travel for all Londoners to celebrate their happy day last year. Whether his latest outing represents a full fledged u-turn remains to be seen.","Prime Minister and his wife attend street party in his constituency in Spelsbury, Oxfordshire, this afternoon .

She flew to India on February 25 and was staying with an aunt in Jangpura, Dehli. The next day she was joined by her fiancé Mr Khill, who had been in Delhi since January 19 having hospital treatment for a stomach problem. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Paimana Khanjar was stabbed at least 10 times. Police believe it was a passion killing after she told her fiance she wanted to call off their wedding . The couple went shopping on Saturday . evening around 8pm at Amar Colony market, before returning to the guesthouse where Mr Khill was staying. The couple discussed their three-year engagement, which had begun in their home country of Afghanistan. A police officer told The Hindu that their relationship had was no better than 'cordial', adding that Ms Khanjar was unenthusiastic about their impending marriage, leaving Khill 'heartbroken'. He said things 'took an ugly turn' when Ms Khanjar's aunt, Nuriya, consulted a religious leader who disapproved of the wedding. Ms Khanjar told Mr Khill she didn't want to go through with it, apparently sending him into a fury. Missed: A tribute video showing photos of Khanjar has been posted on YouTube . In what is believed to have been a crime of passion, 22-year-old Ms Khanjar was brutally and fatally stabbed, when police say an enraged Mr Khill grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked his bride-to-be. Nine of the 10 stab wounds were on the upper portion of her body and one on her leg. Concerned that Ms Khanjar hadn’t returned to her aunt’s house, her neighbour Sonia went to the guesthouse to check on her. There she found her lying in a pool of her own blood, a knife sticking out of her stomach. Police say she had been stabbed at least 10 times and had other injuries to suggest she had been beaten prior to her death. The door was ajar and belongings were strewn about, indicating an earlier struggle. Passion: Police believe Khanjar was killed because she told her fiance she didn't want to marry him anymore. They became engaged to be married three years ago in Afghanistan . Police suspect that the murder was planned. 23-year-old Mr Khill told them that he had bought the knife from a market three days before. But when approached by the Times of India, the suspect went into a frenzy. ‘I did not plan anything,’ he screamed. A police officer told the paper: ‘He said he would cut carrots with the knife and he did not buy the weapon for murder. He insisted that it was moment of madness.’ Mr Khill fled the scene of the killing and on Sunday, at around 9 am, he was arrested trying to board a flight to Kabul, Afghanistan. A tribute video of photos of Ms Khanjar to the song I'll Be Missing You by Puff Daddy has been posted on YouTube. Loss: College friends said they were shocked by Khanjar's death. She enrolled in 2008 and was hoping to start a Psychology course this year . Classmates from American River College have spoken of their sadness at the news. 'Really said. Just really sad. Feel sorry for the family, it's a life cut short' student Jennifer Peet said. 'Just knowing that something like that could happen to somebody who went to my school... It's just so sad,' added another, Megan Scheiza. Jackie Beverly said: 'I think it's a tragedy because obviously she was broadening her horizons.' Ms Khanjar began her studies at the college in 2008, and was on the waiting list for a psychology class this semester.

Fruity: Women with pear-shaped figures like Kate Winslet are healthier than their apple-shaped counterparts, according to research . It may not help when it comes to squeezing into skinny jeans or slipping on a slinky dress. But it seems having a big bottom could offer some benefits – at least when it comes to health. Women with pear-shaped figures are healthier than their apple-shaped counterparts, according to research. Or in other words, those with a . defined waist and shapely derriere like Kate Winslet are better off than . those with a small bottom who are plumper around the middle. Former government adviser Dr Margaret . Ashwell worked with a nutritionist from Oxford Brookes University to . review data from dozens of studies on the best method of judging . someone’s health from their vital statistics. And their conclusion could mean the . end of the body mass index, or BMI – a mathematical formula linking . weight to height which has been in widespread use since the early 1970s. However, this formula fails to distinguish between fat and muscle, meaning some athletes are classed as obese. An . alternative measure of health is waist circumference, which is . considered important because fat that gathers around the stomach is . known to be particularly harmful. Not only does it produce more . dangerous chemicals, but it is also closer to the body’s vital organs . than flab on the bottom, hips and thighs. But . this method is flawed too, as it doesn’t take into account differing . heights. So the solution, says Dr Ashwell, who runs independent . consultancy Ashwell Associates, is to look at waist measurement in . comparison to height. Healthy prospects: With their well-defined derrieres Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez are also considered a healthy pear-shape . Her analysis of 31 studies involving 300,000 men and women from around the world showed doing this to be a better predictor of health than either BMI or waist circumference. As a rule of thumb, we should aim to keep our waist circumference measurement to under half that of our height. So, a woman who is 5ft 4in should try to keep her waist below 32in and a man who is 5ft 10in shouldn’t let his waistband exceed 35in. Any bigger than this and their shape starts to turn from pear-like to apple-like. Using waist to height as a measure should pick up potential illnesses quicker than BMI and is also suitable for all ages and all ethnicities. Dr . Ashwell told the European Congress on Obesity in Lyon: ‘Keeping your waist circumference to less than half of your height could help increase life expectancy for every person in the world. Streamline: Among the famous apple shapes with less-defined waists are actresses Catherine Zeta-Jones and Elizabeth Hurley . ‘You can measure it in centimetres, inches, miles, anything you want. It’s super-simple.’ Pear-shaped celebrities, who are wider below the waist, include actress Kate Winslet and singers Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce. Among the apples, with less-defined waists, are singer Adele, model Elizabeth Hurley and actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. Dr Ashwell’s system of measuring has another advantage. Those people whose waist is bigger than it should be can take heart.Fat from around the tummy is usually the first to go when we start a diet.","New research says big-bottomed women are healthier than apple-shaped ones .

Evil: Clappison, pictured outside Hull Crown Court today, was said by a judge to have 'blighted the lives of her children' A mother who abused her two children and kept them locked in bedrooms that were so cold her son caught frostbite was jailed for 18 months yesterday. Over a five-year period they were beaten, starved, forced to do manual labour instead  of going to school, given cold baths and shut up in the dark. Both children had to sleep in their underwear without bedding or a mattress in an unheated room, Hull Crown Court was  told during Linda Clappison’s cruelty trial. However, the 46-year-old mother managed to fool social workers by getting out toys and snacks  during a visit, and ‘made it look like happy families’. Son Andrew Clappison told the court he endured the living hell between the ages of ten and 16 and even attempted suicide. The daughter, who is now 13 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered similar treatment between the ages of six and 11. She also had her head shaved five times by her mother and was ordered to lie about it being her own idea ‘because she wanted to look like Britney Spears’. Mother-of-four Clappison, of Keyingham, East Yorkshire, was convicted of child cruelty last month. The treatment came to light when the girl went to school and told teachers she did not want to go home to her mother. Passing sentence yesterday, Judge Michael Mettyear paid tribute to the young victims, who he described as ‘the sort of children that any parent would admire’. He told Clappison: ‘Custody is inevitable. You have blighted the lives of these children.’ Andrew, 18, told the court he was ten when his mother changed after his father left home because she had had an affair. His elder brother and sister also left when the abuse started. He was kept off school half of the time but, when he did go, as soon as he returned home he was locked in his dark bedroom. Andrew said his mother punched, slapped and kicked him, beat him with a leather belt and banged his head against a wall for no reason. House of hell: The semi-detached house in Keyingham, East Yorkshire . where Linda Clappison subjected her children to a 'living hell' The worst punishment, he said, was being given a cold bath and dunked under the water. He said: ‘I was scared of her. I had to have my tea in my room. She would not let me come downstairs. I was treated like a dog.' Abused: Andrew Clappison, now 18, was beaten and starved by his mother from the age of 10 to 16, and even attempted suicide. In January 2010, Clappison removed his mattress when she caught him trying to keep warm under it. Toys and the lightbulb were also taken out. He said: ‘I was sleeping in the cold all the time. The boiler was working but I had no radiator. ‘I used to wake up with blue feet. My feet got frostbite.’ Andrew was treated for frostbite on . all his toes on one foot and the big toe on the other. He was told to . lie and say it was from playing outside. The only time a social worker visited the house she was fooled into believing the children were being cared for properly. Andrew recalled: ‘She got my toys out. ‘She made me come downstairs, put biscuits out and made it look like happy families.’ He told the court he became weak and . thin from a diet of chocolate spread sandwiches – while his mother . cooked hot meals for herself. He said: ‘It was so unhealthy it was stupid. ‘At one point I was sick until she gave me something to eat. I got to starving point. I was shaking. I wished I was dead.’ His sister endured similar punishments. She said: ‘Some days she would not give us anything to eat.’ Andrew said that when his mother . befriended a gipsy fortune teller he was then forced to work unpaid with . travellers on a market stall and at a fair, sometimes until midnight. His sister also had to work on the stall, cleaning dogs and sweeping up. Before Clappison was jailed for . cruelty, the court was told that, according to her probation report, she . had no wish to be reconciled with her children. Mother-of-four Clappison was jailed at Hull Crown Court after being convicted of child cruelty last month .","Linda Clappison, 46, abused two of her four children and made their lives a 'living hell'

A father-of-three suffered horrific burns after pouring petrol onto a lit barbecue to 'keep it going'. John Woof, 32, doused the grill in petrol from his lawnmower but was immediately engulfed by an ‘eight-foot fireball’. His fiancee and friends rushed to cover him in water and wrapped his wounds in cling film. Grin and bear it: John Woof, 32, of Bamber Bridge, Preston, doused his barbecue in petrol from his mower to liven it up but was engulfed by an 'eight-foot fireball' At least seven children were at the scene when the horror incident unfolded, but escaped unhurt. Today - as Mr Woof was recovering in hospital with burns to his face, shoulder, arms, chest, stomach and his left leg - fire bosses warned people of the dangers of using flammable liquid on barbecues as temperatures continue to soar. A photo showed him smiling from a hospital bed with bandages on his left-hand side. Mr Woof, who works as an engineer, had invited neighbours and their children to his home in Bamber Bridge, south of Preston, for a barbecue, when the coals appeared to be dying down. As youngsters played in the garden he poured petrol on to the already lit barbecue, which sent a fireball rolling across his body at 7pm on Thursday. His fiancee Naomi Molyneux, 22, who works as a care assistant in a nursing home, said: 'I was just about to go inside the house to make my neighbour’s kids a drink and I saw it blow up. Concerned: Today medics at Royal Preston Hospital (pictured) were concerned Mr Woof's airways may be blocked due to the extent of his burns . 'I noticed his chest first, and then I got him inside and soaked him in towels on his face and chest and hand, before running him a cold bath and kept pouring cold water over him. 'I work in a nursing home, so I knew to do that and I rang one of my friends who is a qualified nurse, and she said to put cling film on him.' Today, medics at Royal Preston Hospital were concerned Mr Woof’s airways may be blocked due to the extent of his burns. Barbecue-related injuries have risen in recent years. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), almost 2,000 people are rushed to A&E units each year having had an accident involving a barbecue. The most common types of injuries are burns or scalding relating to the flame. General Safety . Make sure your barbecue is in good working order. Ensure the barbecue is on a flat site, well away from a shed, trees or shrubs. Keep children, garden games and pets well away from the cooking area. Never leave the barbecue unattended. Keep a bucket of water or sand nearby for emergencies. Ensure the barbecue is cool before attempting to move it.Charcoal Barbecues . Use only enough charcoal to cover the base to a depth of about 50mm (2 inches). Only use recognised fire lighters or starter fuel and only on cold coals – use the minimum necessary and never use petrol. Never put hot ashes straight into a dustbin or wheelie bin – they could melt the plastic and cause a fire.Gas Barbecues . Make sure the tap is turned off before changing the gas cylinder. Change cylinders outdoors if possible or in a well ventilated area. If you suspect a leak to the cylinder or pipe work, brush soapy water around the joints and watch for bubbles – tighten to fix but do not overtighten. After cooking, turn off the gas cylinder before turning off at the controls to ensure any residual gas in the pipe work is used up. Source www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/barbecue . Ms Molyneux said it was lucky he had not been more severely injured. She said: 'It was horrible, it just seemed to blow up into a big flame. 'I did not go outside again I was just concentrating on helping John. 'It (barbecue) was not hot enough, so he decided to try to be clever and put petrol on. 'We have a petrol mower and he thought he had only put a bit on, but he had put quite a lot on.' The couple’s garden was full of children and Ms Molyneux  has warned others not to use petrol on barbecues. She added: 'We will just be cooking food in the oven and bringing it outside from now on.' Witnesses who were at the barbecue spoke of their shock at seeing their friend engulfed in flames. Neighbour Emma Holt, 37, who was with children Evin, 10, and Jake, 14, said: 'There was just a ‘whoosh’ and then he was straight into the bath.'We had flannels and cold water on him. It could have been a lot worse. 'I was just worrying about getting the kids out of the way. 'I rang the ambulance and the fire engine turned up, then a rapid response ambulance.' Another neigbour Lucy Davis, 32, also of The Crescent, was also at the party with Maddison, four, Megan, 11, and six-year-old Ryan. She said: 'I was stood right next to it. 'I was not looking but when I turned he had poured the petrol on and it went about 8ft up in the air. 'He just ran - I went into the kitchen and I saw his skin was peeling.' Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service watch manager Steve Boyne, based at Bamber Bridge station, who attended the incident, said: 'This highlights the dangers of igniting barbecues. 'People should only use the correct items for igniting. 'Clearly petrol is not the right fluid to be using. I think the barbecue was already lit but he wanted to get it going better so he lobbed petrol on it.' Over the past few weeks, there have been several incidents with people suffering burns while using a barbecue. At the weekend a Hampshire father and his three-year-old daughter were taken to hospital with burns after petrol was used on a barbecue and in Peterborough one person had to be taken to hospital and another was injured after a barbecue fire spread out of control. Last week in Stockport a man suffered severe burns while trying to start a barbecue. Believing the fire was failing to ignite, he went to the garage to get some flammable liquid. But the fire took off while he was gone and set fire to the garage door. He became trapped inside and suffered serious burns. In recent years, barbecue-related injuries have risen. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), almost 2,000 people are rushed to A&E units each year having had an accident involving a barbecue.

Renewed attempts to help the jailed Pakistani doctor who led the U.S. to Osama bin Laden must be made, a Californian congressman has said. Rep Dana Rohrabacher has made Dr Shakil Afridi's case a personal cause, but fears the issue has fallen off the political radar. He said without U.S. intervention the man credited with helping track down Bin Laden would be left to 'suffer in a dungeon'. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (right) says the U.S. must not abandon the Pakistani doctor Dr Shakil Afridi (left) who helped track down Osama bin Laden by running a fake vaccination programme . Rohrabacher said: 'If we let that person just . hang on a limb and forget him, now that he's put himself in danger for . us -- well shame on us. 'I . am very concerned that the United States will shame itself by letting Dr . Afridi sit there and suffer in a dungeon, and be tortured. 'It doesn't appear that other people are taking this case seriously. I don't see any movement.' Dr Afridi helped the CIA by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s children from the family compound in Abbottabad. Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by US Navy SEALS last May. The successful mission sparked a rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital. Justice: Osama bin Laden, (pictured in 1998) mastermind of the 9/11 attacks and the world's most wanted man, was killed in a US operation in north-western Pakistan which was successfully launched with help from information gathered by Dr Shakil Afridi . Strike: The compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where Osama bin Laden, the leader of terrorist network Al-Qaeda was killed by US military forces, in May last year . Angry Pakistani officials felt the . covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the US . was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror. Shortly after the raid which killed Bin Laden, Dr Afridi was arrested for conspiring against the state of Pakistan and last month jailed for 33 years. Rohrabacher told FoxNews.com that he was 'frantically' trying to keep a focus on the doctors fate, claiming officials were neglecting the case which reflects badly on the U.S. Concern: Secretary of state Hillary Clinton said she regretted Dr Afridi's conviction and the severity of his sentence . Afridi's brother Jamil told Fox News . last month that Shakil Afridi had suffered torture while in custody . ahead of his sentencing and previously appealed for U.S. Embassy help to . fight his legal case. The U.S. has insisted there is no basis to imprison Afridi on treason charges and secretary of state Hillary Clinton said in May that she regretted 'both the fact that he was convicted and the severity of his sentence'. Following Rohrabacher's latest comments that State Department said it was still focused on the case. Spokesman Mark Toner told FoxNews.com: 'We continue to urge Pakistan to consider his appeal in a manner that is expeditious, transparent and consistent with due process. 'We consider his treatment and his sentencing to be among the range of important issues we are in the midst of discussing with the Pakistani (government).' In May, outraged at Drv Afridi's conviction, U.S. Senate panels voted overwhelmingly to cut aid to Islamabad by $33million - one million for every year of the physician's 33-year sentence for high treason.","Dr Shakil Afridi jailed on high treason charge for 33 years .

Their meeting will mark a momentous and controversial step in the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr McGuinness, Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister, is to meet the monarch at a jubilee event in Belfast on Wednesday, it was announced yesterday by Sinn Fein – the political wing of the IRA. The handshake, which is due to take place behind closed doors, will be difficult for the Queen, who has lost members of her own family to republican violence. Historic: It will be the first time in The Monarch's 60-year reign that she shakes hands with any former member of the IRA. Mr McGuinness was a commander in the terrorist group . Prince Philip’s much-loved uncle, . Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was assassinated by an IRA bomb planted in . his fishing boat in 1979. The meeting will be hard for many . republicans to stomach, because they see the Queen as the representative . of an occupying country. No Sinn Fein MPs sit in Parliament because . they refuse to take an oath of allegiance to her. Lord Tebbit, who was injured in the . 1984 Brighton bomb which left his wife Margaret in a wheelchair, said he . hoped the meeting showed that Sinn Fein was starting to ‘repent’. Concerns: Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the decision would 'understandably cause difficulties for some republicans and nationalists' He said: ‘I’m glad that Mr McGuinness . is moving to finally acknowledge that the Queen is sovereign over . Northern Ireland and I hope it’s another step on his way towards . confessing and repenting for the crimes of IRA/Sinn Fein.’ Martin McGuinness (pictured in the early 70s) has faced repeated . questions over his IRA past which stretched back to the 1970s. He joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks. By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry. He held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city. During the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward claimed McGuinness had personally handed him bomb parts, an allegation McGuinness claimed was 'fantasy'. In 1973, he was convicted by Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He has also been accused of attending the interrogation of British government informer Frank Hegarty, whom he allegedly encouraged to return to Derry where he was murdered. He has always denied those allegations. However, he has never denied his role in the IRA, saying in September last year: ‘I didn’t say I never fired a gun – I was in the IRA. There were battles on the streets of Derry.' However, when asked if he had killed anyone, he answered no. He claims he left the Provisionals in 1974 to pursue a career in politics. Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell . said: ‘It shows the kind of person the Queen is if she is willing to . meet someone who has a horrendous past of engaging in and encouraging . terrorism. The Deputy First Minister was part of an organisation that murdered a member of her own family and many of her subjects. ‘Her visit to Ireland last year was a . truly historic occasion and this move by Sinn Fein shows that even the . most republican people in Ireland are willing to move forward. ‘And by meeting her, McGuinness is accepting that the Queen is Queen of Northern Ireland.’ Sinn Fein leaders agreed to the meeting at a four-hour conference in Dublin of the party’s ruling council, the Ard Comhairle. Party president Gerry Adams described . the decision as a ‘symbolic and significant step’ taken after . consulting with grass roots support. ‘This will understandably cause . difficulties for some republicans and nationalists,’ Mr Adams said. ‘But . it’s good for Ireland. It’s good for this process we’re trying to . develop. ‘After Martin McGuinness completes this engagement he will be as true, as staunch, as active a republican as he ever was.’ Cross border charity Co-operation . Ireland is to host an event for the Queen and Irish president Michael . Higgins to celebrate the arts and culture across the island. This will . provide the backdrop for the meeting with Mr McGuinness. Mr McGuinness, the IRA’s second in . command in Londonderry at the time of Bloody Sunday, was always the . candidate to shake the Queen’s hand but delicate talks have been going . on for months to arrange a suitable venue and occasion. Sinn Fein boycotted the Queen’s . successful state visit to the Republic of Ireland last year. But the . Queen made a series of gestures which were seen as a dramatic advance in . Anglo-Irish relations – including speaking in Irish at a banquet in her . honour. Sinn Fein was criticised for failing . to be involved, but Mr McGuinness has since spoken of how he was struck . by what the Queen did. Last night, Liz Edwards, a victim of an IRA bomb attack in Warrington in 1993 said she was shocked by news of the meeting. She said: ‘I still think of Martin McGuinness as a terrorist and that will never change. A leopard can’t change its spots.’","The Queen has never met with a senior figure from the now-defunct IRA, which killed her cousin Lord Mountbatten in 1979 .

Aradhana and Stuti were left at the Missionary Hospital in Padhar, India, after they were born on May 11 last year, because their parents could not afford to take care of them. Their father Hariram Yadav is a poor local farmer who has just two acres of land. Separated: Twins Aradhana and Stuti post operation at Padhar Hospital. They are both on ventilators . Conjoined twins Stuti and Aradhna are pictured before a surgical operation to separate them at the Mission Hospital in India . The twins, who were joined at the chest, were separated yesterday during a 12-hour operation involving 23 doctors and 11 nurses from India and Australia. They were wheeled in the operation room at 8am, before the surgery followed from 9am to 9pm. The team first separated their hearts, which were joined by the same membrane, followed by their fused livers. Hospital Superintendent Dr Rajiv Choudhry said he was happy with how the surgery went. The special sisters will now remain on ventilators and under close observation for the next 48 hours. The team had done a dry run of the entire procedure beforehand. The surgery was funded by Indian TV viewers and local politicians after hearing of their plight. The outpouring of generosity, with thousands of small donations by members of the public, is unusual in India where girls are often not valued in rural communities and disabled babies are often abandoned. Public generosity was matched by a £22,000 fund from the Madhya Pradesh state government. Medical experts from India and Australia work to separate the twins . The twins, pictured with their mother, left, were joined by their heart membrane and livers . The girls have been cared for by . hospital staff since their birth, with three nurses taking shifts to act as . surrogate mothers. Surgeons at the under-equipped Paddar Hospital spent months . appealing for international help and preparing for the operation. The hospital persuaded the parents, who already have a six-year-old son, to continue having a relationship with their daughters. The couple Hari Ram Yadav and Maya Yadav now hope to take their girls home after surgery. The twin girls have been looked after and even named by the hospital staff. Both their names mean 'prayer' 'We are happy that they will finally get . to be a family and both the girls will get a proper home,' said Vikas . Sonwani, assistant administrator of Paddar Hospital. Conjoined twins occur in around one in every 200,000 live births. They are identical - coming from a single egg that doesn't fully separate after fertilization and therefore always the same sex. Their prospects vary widely depending on their general . state of health, how they are joined and what organs are shared.

A terminally ill woman who cancelled her first wedding day after she was diagnosed with breast cancer finally got a dream ceremony worth thousands - after it was paid for by complete strangers. Naomi and Graham Thomas became engaged a month before she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. The couple, who have a 22-month-old son called Devon, had hoped to tie the knot last year - but weren’t able to afford it after learning the disease had returned and spread to Naomi’s spine. Naomi said: 'We’d provisionally booked a beautiful hotel for the August bank holiday just gone. 'But, due to treatment and lack of funds it just wasn’t possible so we had to pull out with two months to go. My health and our son had to be our priority so we couldn’t afford the wedding.' Naomi has also had to come to terms with the heartbreaking fact that she is not expected to live more than another five years. Her story touched the hearts of locals in their home town Sidmouth in Devon who came forward to help organise and fund their special day. The generosity of events planner Sam Williams plus a mystery benefactor known only as Mary Poppins and several businesses from Sidmouth all played a crucial part seeing the couple finally become husband and wife.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 09:56 EST, 31 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:09 EST, 31 July 2012 . It's a virus that originated in birds, but the newest strain of avian flu has killed 162 harbor seals in New England and scientists warn it could be even more dangerous if it jumps to humans. Researchers revealed on Tuesday that the aquatic mammals, which washed up dead or dying on the shores of Maine and northern Massachusetts last fall, were infected with the H3N8 strain of influenza. The seals suffered horrifying skin lesions, a previously unknown symptom in flu deaths, and pneumonia as a result of a virus that they contracted from North American waterfowl, according to researchers at Columbia University. Even more worrying is the fact that the virus has mutated to develop the ability to infect the cells of mammals -- a first for the avian pathogen. New threat: Flu killed more than 100 harbour seals in New England last year after jumping from waterfowl . The announcement follows the reemergence . of swine flu in the United States as four people at a county fair in . Indiana had to be hospitalized after catching the virus from their hogs. Scientists believe the virus entered the seals' bodies by infecting the small number of cells with avian receptors that the species carries. Once inside, the pathogen mutated to infect cells with mammalian receptors -- making it much more potent and allowing for the possibility that the strain could infect humans. 'Whenever you get a virus that spills over from one species into another and causes disease that is a significant concern,' Dr Simon Anthony, a research fellow at Columbia University's Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiologic Research, told Mail Online. 'When you get a virus jumping over from distantly-related species like waterfowl to seals, it's cause for even greater concern. 'And and when that disease mutates to infect a new kind of receptor and cause disease, it's even more concerning.' Researchers say there is no evidence the virus can infect humans now, but they worry about the potential effects of the virulent strain if it is able to mutate further and infect humans. Deadly: The strain of flu that infected the seals is disturbing because scientists never predicted the virus was mutate from waterfowl to marine mammals . Unlike the H1N1 'swine flu' outbreak in 2009, which infected millions of people but killed only 0.002 percent, the so-called 'seal flu' could prove much deadlier. However, it looks as though swine flu is back in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control counts 17 cases of the H3N2 strain since 2011. The most recent outbreak came at the LaPorte County Fair in northern Indiana when four people were hospitalized for flu-like symptoms. All of the cases were people who had handled hogs at the fair barn. Several of the animals tested positive for the same virus, which has traces of bird flu. H3N8 has evolved mutations known to ease transmission and cause more severe symptoms. Specifically, the virus has the ability to target proteins known as cytokines found in human lungs. Deadly: Scientists are worried because the flu strain appears far deadlier than the H1N1 strain, which kills just 0.002 percent of infected people in 2009 . This could cause the immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself, causing tissue damage. Dr . Anne Moscona, from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, who . led the researchers, said: 'There is a concern that we have a new . mammalian-transmissible virus to which humans haven't been exposed yet. It's a combination we haven't seen in disease before.' The strain is closely related to one that has been circulating in North American birds since 2002. But unlike the bird strain, it has adapted to living in mammals. The warning from scientists is published in the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology, mBio. Outbreak: Flu cases are low in North America and Europe, though the east coast of Africa and southeast Asia continue to struggle with outbreaks . One cause for concern was the fact that few scientists had considered the possibility of a bird flu virus infecting seals, said the researchers. It highlighted the fact that pandemic influenza can appear in unexpected ways. 'Flu could emerge from anywhere and our readiness has to be much better than we previously realised,' said Dr Moscona. 'We need to be very nimble in our ability to identify and understand the potential risks posed by new viruses emerging from unexpected sources. 'It's important to realise that viruses can emerge through routes that we haven't considered. We need to be alert to those risks and ready to act on them.' As of January 2012, the World Health Organization has confirmed there have been 583 cases of H5N1 (avian flu) in humans leading to 344 deaths. Avian flu has all but disappeared from the headlines since the 2009 swine flu pandemic, but it continues to sweep across the globe, jumping from birds to humans to swine and back again. The flu has taken numerous forms since it first mutated and passed from birds to humans -- with varying degrees of infectiousness and lethality. The 2009 'swine flu' outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 became a global pandemic when it infected millions of people and spread to nearly every country. The virus was thought to have spread from birds and later transmitted to pigs, which served as a 'mixing vessel,' which allowed the infection of humans. It was widespread, but the symptoms were relatively mild, similar to season flu. Public health officials fears the flu would mutate again and become more virulent, but that never happened. The mortality rate remained at just 0.002 percent -- killing just two out of 100,000 people infected. The strain spread to the United States in April 2009 and by May 2010, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over. A more deadly, and concerning, strain, H5N1, has spread to 15 countries after being transmitted to humans from poultry. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has discovered 607 cases of the disease in humans, killing 358 people. In 2012, 29 people have been infected so far and 18 have died. However, the disease is confined to just 15 countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East and has yet to reach the western world. So far in 2012, human cases have been isolated to Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam.","The H3N8 strain was discovered after the death of 162 New England seals .

A four-year-old girl was turned down for a place at her local primary school because she lived just one foot outside the catchment area, her outraged mother has claimed. Maggie Scott had applied for a school less than half a mile from her Birmingham home, but was instead offered a place at a primary more than four times as far away. Worse, her first choice - Boldmere Infant and Nursery School in Sutton Coldfield - was rated as outstanding by Ofsted, while Kings Rise Community Primary School in Kingstanding is in special measures. Step too far: Maggie Scott, pictured with her mother Kath and brother Dylan, 2, was crushed when she was offered a place at a very different school . Maggie's mother Kath, 41, said the Local Education Authority (LEA) ruled that the family's home was 2,277 feet from their first choice . school. The last place allocated was to a child who lived 2,276ft . away - meaning Maggie lost out by just a foot. Mrs Scott said: 'When I worked out it . was 35cm (1ft), I thought it was ridiculous, a silly position to be put in . over something so small. 'Thirty-five centimetres put me out of the bracket of my first choice school and into No Man’s Land.' Mrs Scott said she was also turned down for two other closer schools - Wylde Green Primary and Holland House Infants - which are less than a mile from her home. 'We feel sad, failed, exasperated,' she added. 'I feel like I’m being punished for making the wrong choice.' 'When I rang the LEA they told me that I had picked schools which were oversubscribed. Long journey: Mrs Scott said her daughter was also turned down for two other schools that are less than a mile from her home . 'For the last five years, if you lived one kilometre away you would have gotten in. It’s not unreasonable to put these choices in.' Mrs Scott plans to fight the decision and has joined forces with other mums who did not get their first-, second- or even third-choice schools in Sutton Coldfield. Savannah Bus, four, was also given a place at Kings Rise after her three choices - including Boldmere - were rejected. Her mother Nadine, 33,  said: 'My house is 807m (0.5 miles) from Boldmere. I went to the open day and we preferred Boldmere over the other schools as it suited my daughter’s personality. 'Last Monday, we got Kings Rise and it’s 2.2 miles door-to-door. It’s really angered us.' The mothers have now launched a Facebook support group called Boldmere Mums and will be holding a meeting at Sutton Nursery School from 7.30pm on May 10. Speaking out: Mothers Kath Scott and Nadine Bus have formed a group to campaign against what they view as unfair decisions on school places . Disappointment: Maggie was refused a place at Boldmere Infant and Nursery School, pictured, and offered one at a special measures school four times as far away . No choice: Kings Rise Community Primary School in Kingstanding is more than two miles from Maggie's home . Birmingham City Council said there was not a 'catchment area' and emphasised that decisions were based on a number of criteria, of which distance from a school is just one. A spokesman said: 'We know that school preference places are an important decision for parents/carers. The school admissions team processed over 15,000 applications which were carried out on an equal and fair basis, and we always advise parents to be realistic about their preferences. 'This year, 95 per cent got one of their preferences, and 85 per cent got their first preference. 'Any parent/carer who is unhappy with the place offered may submit an appeal for a place at a preferred school, provided that they included that school as one of their preferences. 'Staff in the school admissions team can offer advice to parents on why their child did not meet the admission criteria for their preferred school and the appeals process.'","Maggie Scott missed out while child living just a foot closer to the school in Sutton Coldfield was accepted .

Parts of England and Wales faced the risk of flooding once again today after warnings of more heavy rain. The Environment Agency urged people in Devon, Cornwall, west Somerset, North Wales and parts of the Midlands to remain prepared for the possibility of floods as the Met Office issued a weather warning for heavy rain. Intense thundery downpours are expected this afternoon, which could lead to flash flooding in some areas. Devon and Cornwall are at an increased risk of floods, and caravan and camping site operators across the South West should be ready to take action if flooding occurs, the Environment Agency said. Making the most of it: A boy plays in a dingy along a flooded road in Felpham near Bognor Regis in West Sussex near the area where the villagers had to be evacuated . The Environment Agency currently has five flood warnings (meaning that flooding is expected) for rivers in place. There are also 21 flood alerts for rivers across England and Wales, meaning that flooding is possible . Today . the agency has sent equipment to pump out floodwaters in Newburn near . Newcastle where a collapsed culvert led to a build up of water on the . River Dene, and in Felpham and Bognor Regis where residents had to be . evacuated after heavy rainfall flooded their homes earlier this week. Sussex Police, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and council officers also said they were working together to evacuate people from flooded homes in the village of Elmer, near Bognor Regis, after reports of flooding of up to 6ft in some homes. They used inflatable boats to reach 250 vulnerable homes, knocking on doors and searching properties to make sure people were safe and received the help they needed, a Sussex Police spokeswoman said. Be aware: The map on the left shows the rain concentrated in the South Wast this week while the map on the right shows where there is warnings of heavy rain .

Chief Superintendent Paul Morrison . said: 'I can assure residents that working with partner agencies we are . doing all we can to care for those affected by the floods. 'We are constantly reviewing the . situation with partners and have created a multi- agency adverse weather . office to coordinate our response.' Nigel Croad, deputy chief executive of Arun District Council, said: 'As a . district council our role is to support the emergency services in their . response to this incident and working with others our priority is . always to help people who have been evacuated from their homes, ensuring . they have somewhere safe and dry to stay and helping with housing . advice. 'Three rest centres have been set up across the district in the last 24 hours in response to the exceptional weather conditions. Further unsettled weather is predicted for the rest of the week, and the Environment Agency is keeping a close watch on river levels, after heavy rain has left many areas more vulnerable to flooding. Environment Agency teams have been working round the clock, with other emergency responders, checking flood defences, clearing blockages, monitoring river levels and issuing flood warnings. The Environment Agency urged the public to remain vigilant and check its website and Twitter feed for the latest situation. It also advised the public to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through floodwater. A spokesperson for the Met Office said: 'A good portion of the UK will be sunny dry and sunny today, but there will also be some heavy showers across certain regions.' Meanwhile three of the UK’s biggest water . companies are lifting hosepipe bans, imposed to deal with drought, . following weeks of heavy rain, from midnight tonight. Anglian Water, Thames Water and . Southern Water are to end restrictions because of the ‘exceptional’ rainfall over the last three days, on top of April’s record levels. Seven water companies across southern . and eastern England brought in hosepipe bans after two unusually dry . winters left some groundwater supplies and rivers as low as in the . drought year of 1976. But . the restrictions were followed by record rainfall across the UK in . April and more rain in May and the beginning of June, leading to . flooding in some areas. Richard . Aylard, sustainability director for Thames Water, said: 'While we . prepared for worst, bringing in restrictions to save water to ensure . there would be enough if the dry spell continued, the topsy-turvy . British weather had other ideas. Water cycling: A man makes his way along the flooded road in Felpham, Bognor Regis today after the South East and mid Wales were worst hit by the rain which has battered Britain .

'We . are really pleased we can now lift the ban but, with groundwater levels . still low and the possibility of a third successive dry winter, we . still need to be careful. We don’t need a ban, but we do need to ask . everyone to keep on using water wisely.' Southern . Water’s water quality and strategy manager Meyrick Gough said: 'While . our focus remains firmly on dealing with the aftermath of the torrential . rain and flooding in the south over the last few days, it is also right . for us to lift the water restrictions.' In . its latest drought briefing last week, the Environment Agency said the . wet weather had significantly reduced the risk of drought and widespread . water restrictions this summer. River levels and reservoir stocks . have improved significantly and further water restrictions for the . public and businesses are unlikely, the Government agency said. But . groundwater levels are still well below normal in some areas, with some . as low as in the drought year of 1976, and are unlikely to improve . before the winter. Companies which rely primarily on underground aquifers for supplies are maintaining their hosepipe bans. Mike Pocock, water resources manager . of Veolia Water Central, said: 'Months of wet weather, particularly . during the next autumn and winter period, will be needed to restore . groundwater to normal levels. 'The . current temporary use ban, which includes hosepipe usage, has been . assisting to reduce demand and conserve our water resources and we would . like to thank our customers for their incredible support. 'Unfortunately, . at present we will not be relaxing the temporary use ban further, as we . need to conserve our supply of water to prepare for the possibility of a . third dry autumn and winter.' Meanwhile Britain's washout summer has caused a slimy new problem for farmers - an invasion of millions of crop munching slugs.

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:09 EST, 24 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 25 May 2012 . Bad news: The news that the UK is back in recession and the double dip is worse than predicted is a huge blow for Chancellor George Osborne . George Osborne suffered a new blow yesterday after it emerged that the first double-dip recession in Britain since 1975 has been even deeper than previously thought. Official figures showed that the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of the year. That is worse than the 0.2 per cent decline initially reported. The slump between January and March plunged the UK back into recession – defined as two quarters of contraction in a row – following the 0.3 per cent fall in output at the end of 2011. And it is feared that output will fall again in the current second quarter because of the extra bank holiday for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Britain is trapped in the longest economic downturn for a century, eclipsing even the Great Depression of the 1930s. One financial analyst described the outlook as 'terrible’ and warned that with the eurozone crisis raging 'the headwinds are turning into a hurricane’. But as pressure mounted on the Chancellor to kick-start the recovery, the Treasury pledged to stick to its plan to wipe out the record deficit racked up by Labour. Chloe Smith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the figures were 'disappointing’ and admitted that Britain was in 'a technical recession’. But she added: 'We need to stick to our path. It would not be acceptable to fail to deal with our debts.’ Labour accused Downing Street of being 'complacent and out of touch’. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'What more evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies have failed and that they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth and jobs?’ Wrong: The Treasury had hoped the figures would be revised upwards today but it got worse . The figures from the Office for National Statistics were revised down after construction output crashed by 4.8 per cent compared with the previous quarter, the steepest decline in 11 years. The uphill challenge faced by the new boss of Mothercare was underlined today as a dismal UK performance dragged the parenting retailer to a £103 million loss. Presenting his first set of results, Simon Calver, who joined at the end of April, said he would be 'ruthless' on costs as he rolls out a three-year turnaround plan. The group saw like-for-like sales tumble 6.2% in the year to March 31 in the UK, where it plans to cut store numbers from 311 to 200 by 2015 in a bid to save £13 million a year. A £55 million writedown on the value of the group’s Early Learning Centre and nearly £10 million in UK restructuring costs triggered a bottom-line pre-tax loss of £102.9 million, compared with an £8.8 million profit the previous year. Mr Calver, who came to Mothercare from internet movie rental firm Lovefilm, said: 'We have a long way to go, and the plan to bring the UK business back to acceptable levels of profitability will take three years.' Ministers are looking at using government guarantees to stimulate spending on infrastructure and housing to try to boost the economy. The ONS report also showed that industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, factory output was flat and the powerhouse services sector grew by 0.1 per cent. The slump would have been even worse but for the biggest rise in government spending for four years. It was up 1.6 per cent in the first three months of the year and was driven by spending on health and defence. James Knightley, a London-based economist at Dutch bank ING, said it 'questions how well the Government is implementing the austerity measures’. Jason Conibear, director of currency specialists Cambridge Mercantile, said: 'The headwinds are turning into a hurricane. 'The UK economy is in a pretty terrible place right now, and the Greek-fuelled volatility coming in from across the Channel is only going to exacerbate matters in the months ahead.’ Downing Street said that with much of Europe in recession, UK growth was always going to be hard. * The number of suicides has risen sharply since the recession began. Some 3,471 suicide verdicts were recorded at coroners’ courts in England and Wales last year. That was up 7 per cent from 3,252 in 2010 and 15 per cent from 3,007 in 2007, when the credit crunch began to bite. * Hundreds of thousands of private sector workers are enduring a pay freeze which has lasted for three years, according to a report. More than a third did not get a rise in 2009 and 2010 and the worst-affected workers have been hit by three consecutive years without a salary boost. The study by pay experts XpertHR looked at pay deals affecting almost four million private sector workers. It found that the average pay rise for those who got one was a paltry 2.5 per cent, far below the rate of inflation which is currently 3 per cent.","Gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% .

So young: Cheryl Tariah, 17, who was beaten with a hammer then strangled by failed asylum seeker Ako Amin . A failed asylum seeker who strangled his British girlfriend to death after learning he was to be deported was jailed for at least ten-and-a-half years today. Ako Amin, 19, flew into a rage and battered 17-year-old Cheryl Tariah with a hammer after she showed up at his hostel bedroom unexpectedly. He then grasped his hands around her neck, choking her to death in a ‘prolonged’ attack, the Old Bailey heard. After covering his victim’s body with a duvet, Amin casually strolled to a nearby library, where he bragged to a friend: ‘The hammer didn’t do it - I had to strangle her.’ Iranian-born Amin, who had originally claimed asylum in the UK in 2008, then tried to flee the country and was discovered clinging to the bottom of a lorry at Dover three days later. Judge Richards Marks QC told him his ‘wicked act’ had deprived Cheryl’s mother - whose husband died in 2010 - of a loving daughter’s ‘comfort and support’. ‘This is a shocking incident in which a young woman has lost her life and the consequences for Cheryl Tariah’s mother can only be imagined,’ he said. ‘She lost her husband in 2010 and is left by herself to look after a severely autistic son. ‘No doubt Cheryl would have been a great comfort and support to her in that task. ‘She now no longer has that comfort and support through your selfish and wicked behaviour - for there is no other way to describe it. ‘I hope you ponder for the rest of your life what you did that day, for it was shocking, appalling and unforgiveable.’ Amin, whose family were involved in politics in their homeland, fled to the UK in December 2008 after his brother was murdered. He applied for asylum, but was rejected and he had exhausted the appeals process the day before the killing on February 7 this year. ‘It may give the court some insight into his state of mind the following day when he was to kill Miss Tariah,’ said prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse. Cheryl, who lived in Tottenham, north London, and was studying art at Chelmsford College in Essex, had been in an ‘on-off’ relationship with her killer for around a year. But she often found him to be possessive, jealous and controlling. ‘He refused to let her talk to other boys or let her go to parties,’ said Mrs Whitehouse. ‘It was said he hacked into her Facebook and email accounts and changed to password to stop her sending messages.’ She went to Amin’s bedroom in a hostel above the Buy Labels for Less store on High Street, Barkingside, east London, at around 12pm. A neighbour overheard Amin shouting out other men’s names, before Cheryl told him: ‘Don’t hurt me, leave me alone and get off me.’ The shouts were followed by screams and choking that could be heard through an open window in the street below. The Old Bailey: The judge told . Amin his 'wicked act' had deprived Cheryl's mother - whose husband died . in 2010 - of her daughter's 'comfort and support' Amin then walked calmly to a nearby library, where he asked a friend to dispose of the body. When he refused, the killer tried to flee the country. When he was picked up at Dover on February 10 he confessed to police, but claimed his victim had confessed she had been unfaithful to him. ‘I lost it,’ he said. ‘I lose it easily. I smashed my TV up one or two weeks ago with my violent temper.’ A search of Amin’s bedroom revealed a black-handled hammer concealed in a black bin bag. Jason Dunn-Shaw, defending, said: ‘He destroyed a young and innocent life and nothing can be done about that. ‘He will always live with that memory, the horror or what he has done. ‘He appreciates these feelings will never approach the intensity of the feelings of her family and friends.’","Ako Amin, 19, had exhausted his asylum appeals process the day before killing his girlfriend .

A steady stream of mourners, many fighting back tears, followed him, all wishing to pay their respects to the boy with no name who was found dumped by a stream. The child – no more than a month old – had lain undiscovered, his body wrapped in a fleece, until a dog walker stumbled across him eight months ago in a remote part of Lancashire. Despite extensive inquiries, his parents have never been found. Tragic: The coffin was carried into the church by a funeral director whilst floral wreaths and teddy bears were laid at the church paying tribute to the 'llittle angel' and saying 'Be at peace sweet child' Tributes: The boy no more than a month old was born full term but was abandoned on the banks of a stream last October . So he will lie in a grave with a headstone carved with the words ‘Baby boy found in Kirkham’. Despite never knowing the love of a family, however, his passing did not go unmourned. The poignant burial was attended by scores of locals at St Michael’s Parish Church, Kirkham. Moved by his story, they clubbed together to raise £1,000 to pay for the service. Grief: All members of the community were invited to the funeral. The order of service entitled 'Funeral Service for a baby boy' was headed by the words: 'celebrate life' The coffin was carried into the church . by funeral director Bill Crawford, whilst floral wreaths and teddy . bears were laid outside paying tribute to the ‘Little angel’ or ‘Little . Moses’. One card read: ‘Be at peace sweet . child.’ The order of service, entitled ‘Funeral service for a baby boy’ was headed with the words ‘Celebrate life.’ Mourners sang the hymn All Things . Bright and Beautiful, and listened to readings of Psalm 139 by three . local primary school headteachers and a passage from Mark Chapter 10 by . Detective Inspector Martin Clague, one of the officers investigating the . case. Detective Chief Inspector Andrea . Barrow, of Lancashire Constabulary, who is leading the inquiry, lit a . candle during the 30-minute service and BBC’s Crimewatch, which featured . an appeal to trace the baby’s family, sent flowers. Touching: Tributes were left by shocked members of the community - Lancashire Police are still desperately searching for the family of the boy . The service concluded with a rendition of Brahms’s Lullaby, sung by the church choir. ‘Some cases get to you, and this is . one,’ DCI Barrow said. ‘We will never give up hope of learning how the . little boy came to be placed in this remote area. ‘It was so far off the beaten track, it could have only been known to someone familiar with the locality. ‘Whoever did this will remember it . every day of their lives. It will be immensely traumatic. That’s why . it’s important they get help too, tell us what happened.’ She added: ‘We don’t know whether he . ever lived after birth. We don’t know the cause of death. We don’t want . to speculate. Someone out there knows what happened. It is not too late . to talk to us. We’ve still got a team working on this case.

A father sent a chilling text to his wife that he had killed their four children before then trying to take his own life. Prosecutors in the northern state of Lower Saxony, Germany, said police found the bodies of the four youngsters, aged five, seven, nine and 12, in the town of Gross Ilsede on Thursday evening. Their 36-year-old father had suffered serious injuries, ""presumably"" from trying to commit suicide, and was now in an induced coma in hospital. A forensic investigator stands in the garden of the semi-detached house in Gross Ilsede, Germany, where the bodies of four children were found . According to the prosecutor in nearby Hildesheim, the man had left a suicide note detailing ""marital problems"" and said that his wife was abroad on holiday at the time. It is believed that the man told her about the deaths of their daughter and three sons by text message. She then passed the message on to relatives, who contacted the police. When officers arrived at the family's semi-detached home, they found the children's bodies and their seriously injured father, along with the suicide note. According to German newspaper, The Local, prosecutors said the children had suffered ""cut injuries"" and were thought to be asleep at the time of the attack.

War veterans face paying up to £700,000 out of their own pockets to unveil the Bomber Command Memorial because the Government is refusing to stump up the cash. The pensioners, who are trustees of the Bomber Command Association, will be personally liable for the cost of staging the event if they fail to raise the money through donations. The charity has spent five years raising £6.5million to build the new memorial. Honouring the fallen: An artist's impression of the Bomber Command Memorial, which is being unveiled on Thursday . 'Disgusting': The RAF Bomber Command Memorial under construction in Green park. War veterans have been told they face a £700,000 bill for staging its official opening after the MoD sais it would not cover the costs . However they still have to find £700,000 to provide seating and security for the event on Thursday, which will be attended by ten members of the Royal Family including the Queen. The monument, in London’s Green Park, will commemorate the 55,573 Bomber Command airmen who died in the Second World War. It has already proved controversial after it emerged that more than 100 veterans could miss out on the unveiling because of a lack of space. Earlier this month, David Cameron gave the trustees hope when he told MPs the Government had ‘the ability to intervene’ if funds were not raised in time. Tribute: RAF Bomber Command personnel in World War Two. The memorial will commemorate the 55,573 airmen who died during the conflict . But now the trustees, who include four Bomber Command veterans, have been told the Ministry of Defence will not help. Jim Dooley, chairman of the memorial’s fund-raising committee, said the veterans were still £500,000 short. ‘The MoD response to this has been disgusting,’ he said. ‘The unveiling has become a state occasion, yet we are getting no help from the state.’ Trustee and veteran Harry Irons, 88, from Romford, Essex, said: ‘If we can’t get the £500,000 I will probably lose my house. I haven’t got much else.’ Full backing: The Mail's campaign for RAF Bomber Command . The memorial was built with private donations, but the bill for its unveiling has risen because the 6,500 widows and veterans face security checks before they can enter Green Park. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it would ‘make a contribution’ but would not say how much. The MoD said it was not allowed to give to charities, despite records showing it has donated to 28 charitable bodies in the past five years. A Government spokesman said: 'The Government does not usually support opening ceremonies for public memorials. 'However, given the unique circumstances of the Bomber Command Memorial, an exception has been made in this case. 'The Government will make a contribution towards the opening ceremony to help cover the additional costs of seating and security for the many veterans wish to see the unveiling of this important memorial. 'This is in addition to £1million that the Government has already contributed towards the VAT costs of the construction of the memorial.' Andrew Robathan, Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, said: 'The MoD has worked very closely with the excellent people of the Bomber Command Association to ensure a successful unveiling of the memorial.

This is the shabby seaside flat where a British businessmen murdered in China conducted an affair with the woman who is chief suspect in his death, it is claimed. Neil Heywood is said to have shared the £250,000 top-floor terrace apartment near the Bournemouth seafront with Gu Kailai, the wife of one of China's communist party leaders. Mrs Gu has been named as chief suspect in the Old Harrovian's death in a hotel room in Chongqing last November. Mr Heywood was even spotted pinching her bottom as they walked up stairs, it was claimed. Modest: Keystone House where Gu Kailai owned a flat and Neil Heywood is believed to have stayed as with her . Her playboy son Bo Guagua, now 24, is believed to have also occasionally stayed at Keystone House, which was listed as Mrs Gu’s address by Company House. She first came to Britain in 2001 to set up a business in nearby Poole while her husband rose the ranks within China’s Politburo, which has been badly tainted by the scandal. She also sent her son to Papplewick prep school, near Ascot, Berkshire and later Harrow and Oxford University. Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar with contacts inside Mr Bo's circle, told The Times that there was a ‘definite’ romantic attachment between Mr Heywood and Mrs Gu. He alleged that Mrs Gu, a lawyer, was denied ‘any normal passion’ from her husband, who also wanted to set aside her career ambitions. An early theory put forward into Mr Heywood's death suggested he was killed after Mr Bo found out about the affair. Mr Heywood, who had known the Bo family . for more than a decade, was said to have confided in a friend about the . alleged affair with Mrs Gu, saying it had ‘left his life under threat’. 'Romantically linked': Gu Kailai and Neil Heywood are said to had an affair due to her husband's 'lack of passion' Regarding their apparent love nest in Bournemouth, another source told the newspaper: ‘He stayed in the first room on the right. ‘Most mornings he was lean out of the window having a fag. She was always in the kitchen’ The claims come amid increasing rumours on Chinese websites that the pair were having an affair. It is said that Mr Heywood later called off the relationship for unknown reasons. Some sources suggest that Mrs Gu was becoming increasingly paranoid. And now it has been claimed that Mr Heywood was poisoned after threatening to expose a plan by Mrs Gu to move money abroad. It was the first time a specific motive has been revealed for Neil Heywood's murder last November, a death which ended Chinese leader Bo Xilai's hopes of emerging as a top central leader and threw off balance the Communist Party's looming leadership succession. Mrs Gu asked Heywood late last year to move a large sum of money abroad, and she became outraged when he demanded a larger cut of the money than she had expected due to the size of the transaction, two sources with knowledge of the investigation said. Questions: Chinese officials are investigating . whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr . Bo (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left) Allegations last week claimed that Mr Heywood had hidden details of Bo Xilai's financial dealings with his lawyers in Britain . The claims tie up with allegations . last week that Mr Heywood had hidden details of Bo Xilai's financial . dealings with his lawyers in Britain. The murder has provoked a scandal in both China, where Mr Bo had been a likely successor to the presidency, and Britain. David Cameron has criticised spies’ failure to warn that one of China’s most powerful politicians was linked to the murder. The Secret Intelligence Service took three months to brief William Hague on the close links between the Mr Heywood and Mr Bo. Within that time, the Foreign Secretary’s own staff learnt that the death was suspicious but still waited three weeks before passing this onto him. The Mail has learned that Mr Cameron’s aides have demanded answers from both MI6 officers and Foreign Office officials about how the Government was blindsided by Mr Heywood’s death last November. Chinese officials are investigating whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr Bo and his wife Gu Kailai. Mr Bo has now been ousted from his powerful position as the Communist Party boss of Chongqing as a power struggle rages at the top of the Politburo in Beijing. Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood . was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but . details of his demise are sketchy . Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan . Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil . Heywood was found dead . Mr Hague has ordered an investigation into what went wrong, telling Parliament that the Foreign Office raised the alarm in late January only after warnings from expat businessmen in China. The delay meant that Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne met Mr Bo and posed with a panda on November 15 – the day after Mr Heywood was found dead – unaware of links between the two men. The Prime Minister told his staff to demand answers before he met Chinese propaganda chief Li Changchun in Downing Street. Mr Hague said Foreign Office officials were first made aware of suspicions about 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s death on January 18, two months after his death. He was not personally briefed until . February 7, the day after Bo Xilai’s police chief told U.S. authorities . that Mr Heywood was poisoned. They had previously maintained that he died after taking excessive alcohol. Mr Heywood’s friends have said he rarely drank alcohol and questioned the official explanation. Living it up: Bo Guagua, centre, who was well known . for his lavish lifestyle and love of partying during his days as a . student at Oxford University, is also believed to have stayed at the flat in Bournemouth . Keeping up the pressure: David Cameron meets . China's propaganda chief Li Changchun at Downing Street, seeking . reassurances that the probe into Mr Heywood's death would follow due . process . British . expats in China have accused the Foreign Office of failing to push for a . full investigation into the death because of fears over crucial trade . links between the two countries. Internet reports claimed Mrs Gu, who . was godmother to the Heywoods’ two young children, met Mr Heywood’s . widow Wang Lulu in a cafe two days after his death, accompanied by two . armed policemen. The . politician’s wife was said to have begged Mrs Heywood to agree to a . swift cremation without a post-mortem examination. Mrs Heywood was . unavailable for comment. A . city official in Chongqing, Xia Deliang, has been arrested and allegedly . confessed that he prepared the poison and handed it to an employee of . Mr Bo. The internet reports were not immediately blocked by Beijing’s . censors, which has been interpreted to mean they were officially . sanctioned. Mr Bo has accused his political . enemies of ‘pouring filth’ on his family. The Boxun website has . previously carried claims he was a womaniser who slept with more than . 100 women. It also alleged . he and his wife were involved in a series of murders and that Mr Bo . accepted nearly £100million in bribes while he was party leader in . Chongqing.

John Forrester, 49, was head of music at Kincorth Academy in Aberdeen when he started a relationship with choir-girl Claire Bennett, who was only 16. Despite the controversy that surrounded their relationship - which ended his teaching career and turned her family against her - the couple married and have two children. But speaking at her home at . Auchenblae, Mrs Forrester told a local newspaper they were no longer . together, and that her husband had moved out. The 24-year-old said the pair were 'not on good terms.' It is understood Mr Forrester has been staying for two weeks in a nearby property once owned by his wife's grandmother.

Mrs Forrester told a local newspaper that her husband had moved out and the 24-year-old said the pair were 'not on good terms . However, when Claire, originally from Kincorth, joined his class and the choir, the pair started a relationship. At first they chatted through mobile phone messages and this evolved into a relationship. Mr Forrester quit his post so they could be together and the girl abandoned her studies and ran away from home. They moved into a flat in Torry in February 2005 and got engaged two years later. Officials at Aberdeen City Council reported Mr Forrester to police, sparking an investigation that resulted in him being charged under the Sexual Offences Act. However, the Crown Office decided the case was 'not in the public interest' and did not prosecute. The couple married in November 2010 at Ferryhill Church, but local newspaper Daily Record reported at the time that it didn't got as smoothly as the couple hoped -  Mr Forrester shouted and swore at photographers and chased one across the road, leaving his bride in tears. A children's charity called the wedding an 'aberration' and said it went against 'moral codes of not only his profession, but of society'. The couple settled in the Mearns village of Auchenblae with their two children, Erin, born in December 2005, and Andrew, who was born in January 2008. It was reported that Mr Forrester took a job working in a local supermarket after leaving the school.

Britain rolled out the red carpet for Aung San Suu Kyi today as she was welcomed by the Prime Minister at 10 . Downing Street, delivered a historic speech to both . houses of Britain's Parliament, and then visited Prince Charles and the . Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House. In the climax of her landmark visit to the UK, the Burmese pro-democracy leader became the only woman, other than the Queen, to address both houses of Britain's parliament. The Burmese pro-democracy leader followed in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, Pope Benedict XVI and US President Barack Obama to be invited to make a rare address at Westminster Hall. Ms Suu Kyi's historic speech followed a meeting with David Cameron at 10 Downing Street this morning, where the Prime Minister praised her as a global symbol of courage and hope. Later this afternoon she then met Prince Charles and Camilla where she covered the roots of a black tulip magnolia sapling, on her first trip to Britain in 24 years. Delivering the history speech in Westminster this morning, the Nobel peace laureate . said she was seeking practical help to address the problems still besetting her . country. She appealed to Britain ‘as . friend and an equal’ to support the people of Burma in their drive for . democracy. In particular, she said she hoped the UK could help rebuild . the education system while providing new investment for the future. ‘I am here in part to ask for practical help, help as a . friend and an equal, in support of the reforms which can bring better lives, . greater opportunities, to the people of Burma who have been for so long . deprived of their rights and their place in the world,’ she said. ‘My country today stands at the start of a journey towards, . I hope, a better future. So many hills remain to be climbed, chasms to be . bridged, obstacles to be breached. ‘Our own determination can get us so far. The support of the . people of Britain and of peoples around the world can get us so much further.’ Ms Suu Kyi, who received a standing ovation from MPs and . peers in a packed Westminster Hall, said the key to reform was the . establishment of a strong parlimentary institution. She said that after 49 years of direct military rule, it . would take time for the country’s fledgling parliament to find its feet and its . voice.

'Your example has inspired people across the world and it’s . inspired people here in Britain too. Prime Minister David Cameron greets Ms Suu Kyi on the steps of No 10 Downing Street earlier today. Mr Cameron said Britain would be a “staunch” supporter of . Burma’s steps towards democracy and confirmed that he had also invited President . Thein Sein to visit the UK. “He too has shown considerable courage in leading the latest . reforms,” he said. The Nobel peace laureate previously met the Prime Minister . in April when he became the first western leader to visit Burma following the . decision by the country’s military leaders to allow her and her party to stand . in parliamentary elections. On that occasion, Ms Suu Kyi responded to his offer to visit . Britain with a cautious “Perhaps”. She had not left Burma in 24 years, fearing . that she would not be allowed to return if she did. Mr Cameron said Ms Suu Kyi was “absolutely right to warn now . against reckless optimism” about the future of her country. “We will remain vigorous and rigorous in our questioning . until we have made those changes irreversible,” he said.

It would also be investing £3 million in peace-building work . to address ongoing violence in Burma, and increase support each year for . education, healthcare, business and the rule of law. “In a world beset by problems and difficulties, your example . of courage and determination has shone through,” he told her. “If the Burmese people now fulfil their dreams, your country . will be a light in the darkness for all people who struggle for the freedom . that you ought to see for your country.” Mr Cameron defended his decision to invite Mr Sein to . Britain, saying he believed the president was sincere in his commitment to . reform. “There is a process of reform in Burma,” the PM said. “In . order for that to succeed we have to work with the regime.” Ms Suu Kyi also met with Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague for a meeting at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office today . He was backed by Ms Suu Kyi, who said: “We don’t want to be . shackled by the past.

On trial: Sylvia Cooper, 45, pictured arriving at Warwick Crown Court, is accused of a string of sexual assaults . A lesbian police community support . officer sexually assaulted five colleagues, fondling one woman’s breasts . and groping a male officer in his patrol car, a court heard yesterday. Sylvia Cooper, 45, subjected officers . of both genders to a string of unwanted sexual advances, persistently . touching their genitals and slapping their bottoms, it is alleged. On one occasion, she reached under a . WPC’s skirt from behind, while on another she grabbed a male officer . while he was wearing cycling shorts and complimented him on his ‘nice . package’, the  court heard. Cooper is said to have treated the . assaults ‘as a joke’ but officers were so uncomfortable they switched . shifts to avoid contact with her. One female colleague requested a transfer because she was scared Cooper would touch her in the police station’s changing rooms. Cooper appeared in court yesterday . accused of eight sexual assaults against colleagues at West Midlands . Police when she worked as a PCSO in 2009 and 2010. She has been . suspended from the force. Glyn Samuel, prosecuting, described a . series of examples of Cooper’s ‘inappropriate’ behaviour, including one . time when she asked a female colleague for sex. He told the court: ‘The behaviour complained of is persistent non-consensual touching. ‘It includes the groping or slapping . of bottoms, the groping or grabbing of breasts and even grabbing the . groin area of male officers. ‘All of this has had a significant effect, particularly in one case, on the people making the complaint. ‘People just did not want to work with Sylvia Cooper. ‘They did not want to be near her because they did not know what she was going to do with them.’ It is alleged that Cooper slapped and touched one female community support officer’s bottom more than once a week. On one occasion, she asked her: ‘Do you fancy a ****?’ The officer was so traumatised by the . assaults she had to seek medical help and eventually requested to be . transferred from the force, Warwick Crown Court heard. Speaking yesterday from behind a . protective screen, she said: ‘On several occasions she [Cooper] would . rub my knees with her hand and there has been occasions when she would . slap me with the palm of her hand on my bottom. It could be a few rubs, . possibly about once a week at least.’ The female PCSO said this would happen . both in the office in front of other police officers and when they were . out on foot patrol. In 2010, she then allegedly saw Cooper rub a male colleague’s leg as he was driving a police car. ‘My locker is in the same room as . Sylvia’s and after that I didn’t want to get changed in front of her so I . almost ran down to my locker and got changed out of my uniform into my . clothes,’ she added. ‘Once I was changed she came into the . locker room. She saw that I had got changed into my own clothes and said . to me, “I can’t believe I’ve missed you with your clothes off”.’ Unwelcome attention: Warwick Crown Court, right, heard Cooper, left, had such a lecherous reputation colleagues deliberately changed their shifts to avoid coming into contact with her . The court also heard evidence from a male officer who claims he had his buttocks and groin groped by Cooper. He told the jury: ‘I got changed to . work in my cycle uniform and was in the report-writing room. Sylvia was . on my right on the computer. Next thing I knew there was a grope between . my legs and Sylvia said, “Nice package”. I was shocked and . embarrassed.’ The court also heard that Cooper told a colleague that she . and her female partner had tattoos ‘in an intimate place’. Cooper, who was recommended for a . Women in Policing Award  during her service, denies the allegations, . claiming she only pointed at the male officer’s ‘package’. Defence lawyer Martin Steen said: ‘If . there was any touching, it wasn’t regarded as sexual assault by the . victim.’ The case continues.

Vile: Convicted sex offender Kevin Rooney, pictured, raped and murdered a vulnerable pensioner in her sheltered housing home. He has been jailed for at least 21 years today . A convicted sex offender who raped and murdered a vulnerable pensioner in her sheltered housing home has been jailed for at least 21 years. Kevin Rooney attacked mother-of-five Rosina Sutherland, 74, after ransacking her property in the Longstone area of Edinburgh. He raped her, repeatedly hit her on the head and body, compressed her throat and restricted her breathing during the fatal ordeal on October 29 last year. Rooney, 26, fled the scene with almost £400, the keys to the property and the victim’s walking stick. He then went to a nearby pub where he used the cash to buy drinks for himself and strangers in the bar. The killer later told police: 'I’ve murdered someone. If you gie (give) us a fag I’ll show you the body.' Rooney, who was on bail at the time of the offence, has 36 convictions spanning a decade. They include a 2004 conviction for lewd and libidinous practices against two boys under the age of 10. He pleaded guilty to robbery, rape and murder earlier this week after two days of a trial at the High Court in Aberdeen. Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lady Dorrian jailed Rooney for life, as required by law in murder cases. She ordered him to spend a minimum of 21 years and four months behind bars. Police branded Rooney’s crime 'shocking and depraved', after the sentence was passed. Shocking: Rooney attacked mother-of-five Rosina Sutherland, 74, after ransacking her property in the Longstone area of Edinburgh. This picture shows a view of the city . The killer sat with his head in his hands as the details of his murderous act were revealed in court for the first time. The court heard that, uninvited, Rooney entered Mrs Sutherland’s house where she lived alone at some point after 4pm that day. She did not know him. He ransacked her house, throwing treasured possessions such as family photographs on the floor. He also pulled the telephone cord apart, depriving her of a chance to contact the outside world. Rooney then raped her, repeatedly struck her in the face, placed his hand over her mouth and nose, and compressed her throat, preventing her from breathing. She died and was left partially clothed on the floor. Rooney took around £380 from the house but left behind tracksuit trousers and top, his mobile phone and a library card in his name. Advocate depute Alison Di Rollo told the court: 'From there, the accused went to the Longstone Inn, a nearby public house, where he used the deceased’s money to buy drinks for himself and strangers in the pub. Behind bars: Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh today, judge Lady Dorrian, pictured, jailed Rooney for life . 'He drank for some time at the bar, buying lager, cider and shots, playing pool and chatting to staff and customers. 'Throughout, he walked with a limp, and with the deceased’s walking stick, telling one person whom he engaged in conversation that he had been shot in the leg while in the Armed Forces. 'The walking stick was noticeably too short for him. The accused is 6ft 3in tall and the deceased was 5ft 3in.' Unemployed Rooney was detained by police in the early hours of the following day, on an unrelated matter. It was then that he told them: 'I've murdered someone. If you gie (give) us a fag I'll show you the body.' 'Over the next few hours, he made a variety of comments to police, including: 'I asked her for the time and pushed her. She was cold. I didn't mean it.' He also told officers: 'I went to an old dear's house. I just wanted somewhere to stay. I killed her. I hit her a few times and suffocated her.' Police took him out to try to find the location but he was unable to direct them to the address. Meanwhile, an alarm was eventually activated at the victim's house after it recorded no activity in the home. After failed attempts to contact her, Mrs Sutherland's son-in-law was informed and he went round to the house. There, he found her body and the emergency services were called. Rooney later told police: 'Hopefully I'll die cos I'm not doing 15 years for murder. I'm not going to get bail for murder, am I? It was an accident.' When police were alerted to the discovery of Mrs Sutherland's body, the property in Longstone Park was secured as a crime scene and forensic work began. Rooney's DNA was later found on swabs taken from the pensioner's body. A post-mortem examination found Mrs Sutherland had blunt-force head injuries, suggesting she was punched repeatedly before death. When Rooney was detained on suspicion of murder, he told police: 'I would never steal off an old woman.' He also laughed when asked about the sex attack, and said: 'I've got two personalities, I can't help it.' The prosecutor told the court that the victim, who had various medical ailments, lived a quiet, private life that revolved around her family and her cat. She was extremely close to her two sons and three daughters. Ms Di Rollo said: 'The family of Rosina Sutherland has been devastated by this offence and the circumstances of the loss of their much-loved mother. 'Not knowing exactly how much she suffered and imagining what she went through in her final moments has been almost impossible for them to bear.' Detective Superintendent Alan Crawford, from Lothian and Borders Police, said: . 'This was a shocking and depraved crime, and my thoughts at this time . are with Rosina Sutherland’s family, who have been put through a . harrowing ordeal as a result of Kevin Rooney’s actions. 'I would like to pay tribute to them for the courage they have shown, . and in particular for the assistance they provided to the officers . investigating Rosina’s murder.

Phil Gannon, 58, pictured arriving at Liverpool Magistrates Court yesterday, was found guilty of two counts of using abusive or insulting words . A Liverpool fan has been found guilty of hurling racist abuse at fans and players during a football match - after his actions were captured on live television. Father-of-four Phil Gannon, 58, was caught on camera performing a racially offensive monkey . impression during the FA Cup fourth round clash between Liverpool and Manchester United at Anfield on January . 28. Liverpool Magistrates’ Court today banned Gannon from attending matches for four years. Gannon was also accused of hurling racist abuse at Patrice Evra during the game, the first between the Premier League rivals . since an eight-match ban was imposed on Liverpool striker Luis Suarez after the . FA found him guilty of racially abusing Mr Evra. In the 23rd minute of the game the TV camera panned over . fans in the lower Centenary Stand, where Gannon was sitting with two friends, . and he was seen to position his hands under his armpits. The coverage, broadcast worldwide by ITV, quickly spread . across social networking site Twitter and complaints were made to police, the . court heard. One trial witness also told the court he heard Gannon say . towards Evra in French: ‘Tu es petit noir homme merde’ , which in English translates . as ‘You little black s*** man’. Gannon, a carpenter and joiner  from Heol Meirion, Barmouth, north Wales, repeatedly shouted abuse . including  ‘pikey b*******’ at opposing . fans throughout the game, the bench was told. He also shouted: ‘F*** off you spastic mutants’ in the . direction of disabled supporters watching the game nearby, a witness said. The court heard the offences were racially aggravated, . despite Gannon’s claims that the 'monkey' gesture was a reference to 'cavemen' and that he never abused Evra in French. Defending solicitor David Woods accused anyone who identified the gesture as racist as being racist themselves.He said: 'If you equate monkeys with black people then you are as racist as the person who is doing it. 'By looking at the gesture in that way then you assume that someone is being racist.'The prosecution say it's a clear racist gesture and the defendant says it isn't as he was saying the Manchester United fans were cavemen in relation to their actions towards him.' But the chairman of the bench, who declined to give his . name, said they deemed it to be a monkey gesture, adding that it was 'clearly . racist' and the bench also believed that Gannon shouted a racist insult at Evra . in French when he came towards the touchline.

The hour-long procedure which was originally popular with patients suffering from incontinence or a sagging of the vaginal canal following childbirth, is now more widely used for cosmetic purposes to either to enhance the appearance of the genitalia or boost sexual satisfaction. While the average age of those requesting the surgery is between 30-45 some doctors are concerned the trend is causing teenagers to become increasingly 'misled or confused' about what is normal. Media influence: This June Jessica Canseco, one of the stars of a reality show on VH1 called Hollywood Exes, underwent vaginal laser rejuvenation while the cameras rolled . 'It's really concerning, because [the trend] is really reaching younger ages, in their teens. 'I heard of a mother taking in a 16-year-old and 11-year-old wanting to get it done. It's just not right,' Dr Iglesia, a Washington, D.C., gynecologist, noted in an editorial in the June issue of the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. Critics believe it is yet another . service aimed at women pursuing an impossible ideal of physical . perfection, and surgeons say the majority of patients have been influenced by internet pornography and the media industry. One patient said she looked at 'a few Playboys here and there' before opting for labiaplasty . Dr. John Miklos who trained as a gynecologist and . reconstructive surgeon, and now calls himself a 'medical . tailor,' specializes in surgery to reshape a woman's private parts. On average he performs as many as 180 labiaplasties a year to cut back the skin flaps surrounding the vaginal opening. There are two main types of procedure available:Laser Vaginal Rejuvenation . Designer Laser Vaginoplasty . By all measures, Miklos has thrived on . his expertise and along with his partner Dr. Robert Moore, now has practices . in Atlanta, Georgia and Beverly Hills. In 2011 more than 2,140 U.S. women underwent vaginal rejuvenation, according to the American Society for . Aesthetic Plastic Surgery while the International Society of Aesthetic . Plastic Surgeons put the total at almost 5,200 in 2010. Experts . note such figures do not include the many procedures done by . gynecologists. And last year, according to NHS figures the demand for genital cosmetic surgery in the UK rose five-fold over the course of a decade. 'More women today are concerned about . the aesthetics of their private parts. 'The concept of beauty has . extended from having the right looking cheeks to the right looking . genitals,' Dr Sachin Dhawan told India Today. The growth comes despite a warning from . the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in . 2007 that strongly questioned the medical . validity and safety of female genital cosmetic surgery which can cost between $2,500 and $12,000. One of the major concerns is that many surgeons fail to explain risks, such as infections, scarring, pain . and the loss of the very sensations some patients seek to enhance. 'None of these procedures have proven effectiveness, and there is potential for harm,' Dr Iglesia added. However many patients are more than happy to proceed with surgery, even when warned of the dangers, as they are sold on the idea of having a 'designer vagina'. 'Even when women are told of potential . complications, like insensitivity of the clitoris ... they still may be . unstoppable if they have the notion that they need a younger-looking or . more perfect or more desirable vulva,' said Harriet Lerner, a . psychologist specialising in women's issues. Kari, 36, who did not want to use her last name, said she was unhappy with the way her genitalia looked and opted for labiaplasty. 'One side was longer than the other . side. ...

It was the beginning of a dream life together for proud parents Paul and Isabel Mason and their beautiful newborn triplets. Tragically the dream was to last for little more than a week. Just eight days after she gave birth, Mrs Mason collapsed and died from a rare and undetected heart condition possibly triggered by her pregnancy. Isabel Mason, right, had been 'on top of the world' after giving birth to triplets but she died just eight days after their birth. Her husband Paul is pictured left . The sudden loss has understandably left her husband distraught. Mr Mason said his wife – whose funeral is today – had been ‘over the moon’ after giving birth to Mattias, Lukas and Sarah and he described his family’s week together as ‘precious’. ‘We were both overjoyed to be having an instant family,’ he said. ‘The triplets were our first and most probably last children. ‘We looked forward to sharing and introducing our children to our shared hobbies of family time around the kitchen table, playing guitar, country walks, camping, motorbiking, listening to the rain and watching the world go by.’ Instead, his 34-year-old wife collapsed and was taken to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital – the same hospital in which she gave birth. She died there on March 10. Triplets Mattias, Lukas and Sarah, pictured, will now be brought up without their German-born mother . Mrs Mason is believed to have possibly died from haemopericardium, where blood leaks into the sac surrounding the heart from a cut in an artery. A consultant cardiologist said the problem, which often proves fatal, was more likely to happen during pregnancy. The couple, of Weeke, near Winchester, both worked for Ordnance Survey in Southampton. Memories: Isabel and Paul Mason on their wedding day in 2010 . They met at work and were married in 2010 in a Tudor house. It had been Mrs Mason’s childhood dream. As they planned a family together, Mrs Mason, an IT project manager originally from Zeulenroda-Triebes in South-East Germany, underwent IVF treatment. After a pregnancy of 34 weeks and three days, she gave birth naturally to Mattias, 4lb 5oz, Lukas, 3lb 7oz, and Sarah, 3lb 9oz. Mr Mason, 44, who works in the products department, said: ‘Since Isabel’s death I have been overwhelmed with the messages of support and tributes to her. We would like to thank all of our friends and colleagues who have been in touch as these words of comfort and kindness mean so much.’ The keen motorcyclist added: ‘I have . been advised by doctors to take things easier. It is surprising how . quickly one can go from strong to stressed. ‘I have been literally inundated and overwhelmed by everyone’s response, from across the world, to the sad news about Isabel. ‘Everyone . has offered help, including people I hardly know. My brother, his wife . and my wider family have been an absolute rock.’ Mr . Mason had recorded his joy at the birth of his children on an internet . forum for new parents in the days after the births. His entries read: . ‘There are so many thoughts going on in my head. ‘Things to do with the house, to look out . for Isabel, to communicate on email and social media, for work, arrange . stuff, order the pram, photos to upload and send to relatives and . friends, small stuff that we have experienced and other relevant . minutiae that we should capture before it is lost in the ticker tape of . life.’ The Royal Hampshire County Hospital where Isabel Mason gave birth to triplets but died just over a week later . Yesterday, his wife’s profile on Twitter still described her as ‘in love; pregnant with triplets; smiling; philosophical and relaxed whenever possible’. An inquest into her death has been opened and adjourned. Cardiologist Dr Dawn Adamson explained that the haemopericardium may have been caused by ‘aortic dissection’, a condition more likely to occur in pregnancy.

Moments before the fatal collision, in the footage obtained by NBC, the deckhand on the duck boat appears to be engrossed in his cell phone sending a text message. Attorneys for the parents of the two Hungarian foreign exchange students who died released the tape days before a civil wrongful death lawsuit goes to federal court. The tour leader can be seen leaping from the vessel as those on board, none wearing their orange life jackets, flail around in terror. Attorneys for the victims' families have . said the vessel lacked an emergency air horn and radio and had overhead . canopies that trapped the two victims underwater when the boat . capsized. They also say passengers were not made to wear life preservers until moments before the crash. Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs .

The 35 other tourists survived when pulled from the fast-moving current by firefighters and a passing ferry boat. Miss Schwendtner and Mr Prem were both described as strong swimmers by their families. They were touring the U.S. with their high school through a church-sponsored exchange program. The video, which shows . the impact of the barge and tour boat from the New Jersey side . of the river, was part of the official record compiled by the National . Transportation Safety Board who investigated the crash. The families have filed a wrongful . death lawsuit against K-Sea Transportation of East Brunswick which . operated the tugboat guiding the barge.

Crushed: Moments before the crash, the tour leader can be seen leaping from the vessel as those on board, none wearing their orange life jackets, flail around in terror . Negligence: The driver of the tugboat which was guiding the barge was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter . Before the lawsuits can proceed, a judge will hear arguments next week . on whether maritime law should limit the liabilities of the operators of . both vessels. In November, tug pilot Matthew Devlin of Catskill, New York, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to the maritime equivalent of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors said he was distracted by calls on his cell phone relating to a family emergency and moved to a part of the tug that blocked his view of the river. The safety board said in its 4,400-page report of the crash that the duck boat overheated on the 103-degree day because someone left a radiator cap off. The captain mistakenly thought the steam was an engine fire and anchored the boat in the busy channel.

A self-proclaimed ‘office cougar’ has been jailed for sexual harassment after spreading lies and rumours about her male colleagues. Cambridge graduate Jeevani Wickramaratna, 44, targeted one victim at an electronics firm where she worked, claiming to be having an affair with him.

Christine Hart, prosecuting, said: ‘She claimed Mr Stokes was having an affair with the office cougar [an older woman who prefers younger men], and many of the messages were sexually explicit and caused great distress to both him and his family. ‘Wickramaratna then began sending him a series of messages saying she was setting him free and said she had told his family about their affair and that he loved her.’ Further abusive Facebook messages were sent, including a false allegation that Mr Stokes had been diagnosed with HIV.

A British teacher is fighting for his life in a Thai hospital after a stranger savagely attacked him with a metal bar. Adam Pickles, 40, is in a coma after the brutal assault which left him needing emergency brain surgery. In a tragic twist of irony, Adam, of Bradford, West Yorks., who used to teach at a school in Wakefield, had only just recovered from a horrific motorbike crash. Attack: Adam Pickles, 40, is in a coma after the brutal assault in Thailand which left him needing emergency brain surgery . It had also left him in a coma, missing the birth of his eight-month-old son Benjamin. His parents Adele, 61, and Andrew, 62, have flown from their home in Leeds to be at his bedside while friends at home and abroad rally to raise the cost of his medical care. Mrs Pickles said: 'It breaks my heart. The days seem very long, just waiting, waiting, hoping he'll come back to us. It's any mum's worst nightmare. 'We are hoping he can make as full a recovery as possible for Benjamin. He absolutely loves him and he had so many plans for him. We really need him to come back to us for the sake of his little boy.' Mr Pickles, a former teacher at the Cathedral School in Wakefield, moved to Thailand seven years ago, where he lives in Pattaya and works at the Regent's International School as head of English. He was attacked as he drove home alone from a bar in the Nong Prue district, where he plays pool, last Thursday. On the way, he stopped and got out of his car, although it is not known why. He was then beaten over the head before his attacker - who is believed to be a Westerner - drove off, leaving him for dead. Thai police are investigating but have not yet arrested anyone. A passer-by found Mr Pickles and he was rushed to hospital, where he is in intensive care after emergency surgery to remove blood clots from his brain. Mrs Pickles said: 'They have said this week is the crucial time as to whether he makes it.' Doctors say it could take up to a month for him to wake, and the brain damage may leave him with impaired speech and movement. More than 4,000 people have joined a Facebook group set up to help pay for Mr Pickles' medical treatment and bring him home. Friends, relatives, former students and strangers have sent hundreds of messages of support to his parents and Benjamin's mother Pafan. Between them they have pledged more than £10,000 in 48 hours. Mrs Pickles said: 'It is giving us so much comfort to know everyone loves him so much. He would just be overwhelmed by the response. 'People have been so generous and we are so grateful. We want to say thank you so much.' The hospital charges more than £2,000 a day, and medical repatriation may cost at least £70,000. Mr Pickles' insurance will not cover the full bill, and his care after the motorbike crash cost family and friends more than £15,000. His best friend Neil Clappison, of Leeds, said: 'It feels completely unreal that this is happening to Adam after all he went through last year. 'It was horrendous for him to miss the birth of his beautiful son, so what is happening now seems almost unbelievable. 'We are doing everything we can to raise the money needed to ensure Adam survives and then to bring him home. 'The hospitals there are ruthless and if they don't have the money on a per day basis, they may leave you to die. 'We won't let this happen to somebody who really is one in a million.' Danielle Nicholls, a former colleague at the Cathedral School where he worked from 2001 to 2005, said: 'He's one of those characters that everyone who meets him loves. 'He radiates positivity and makes everyone smile. We're all very saddened by his situation and will do everything we can to support the fundraising campaign. 'We send all our love and sincere hopes for his full recovery to his family.'

Dangerous: Billy Joe Craven has been jailed for life after a vicious attack on a stranger, during which he punched her 30 times . A judge has described CCTV footage of a man's vicious attack on a woman as among the 'most harrowing' he has ever seen. Billy Joe Craven, 19, punched his victim 30 times in 20 minutes, raining blows on her face and head until she was unconscious. He pounced on his 25-year-old victim yards from her home as she returned from a New Year's party in Chapelfields, York, partially stripping and then attempting to rape her. Handing chef Craven a life sentence at York Crown Court, Judge Stephen Ashurst, said the victim's injuries, including multiple bone fractures, were so severe that she was unrecognisable. The attack was captured on CCTV and Judge Ashurst said: 'It is one of the most harrowing pieces of footage I have ever seen.' He told Craven, of Chapelfields: 'The sexual violence upon her was self-evidently degrading and the brutality of the violence puts this case in my judgement into an exceptionally serious category.' He added: 'Your disturbed personality and history of sexual misbehaviour makes you dangerous to the public.' Alan Mitcheson, prosecuting, told the court that Craven had been out celebrating with workmates after finishing their New Year’s Eve shift. Two colleagues had warned him about his sexual overtures to their partners, but he persisted. He left them at 3.45am and wandered around streets near his mother’s home until he came across the woman as she arrived outside her house. Craven only ceased the horrific attack when he heard a passer-by calling the police and ran off covered in her blood. The passer-by gave chase but lost him in the maze of streets. The victim, left lying on the ground, was found suffering from hypothermia 30 minutes later. Jailed: Billy Joe Craven, 19, was given a life sentence at York Crown Court (pictured) Craven later went to York Hospital, astonishingly claiming to police that he been robbed, but his only injuries were grazed knuckles. As he brazenly gave a witness statement to officers, they arrested him because they had found his party hat and rucksack at the scene of the crime. Mitigating, James Bourne-Arton said the attack had not been life-threatening or planned. Craven pleaded guilty to sexual assault, attempted rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge Ashurst jailed Craven for life with a recommendation that he not be considered for parole for at least five years and seven months and put on the sex offenders' register for life. He was also banned from working with children. Detective Chief Inspector Nigel Costello, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'I am satisfied with the life sentence imposed and hope that it brings some comfort to the victim. 'This was a truly vicious attack and, in my 22 years' police service, I have never seen anything more harrowing than the CCTV footage that captured the entire offence. 'The level of injuries sustained by the victim made her unrecognisable. 'Her injuries, both physically and psychologically, will require further treatment to aid her recovery. 'However, she has been extremely brave in how she continues to rebuild her personal and professional life. 'I hope the life sentence helps her to put this horrendous ordeal behind her.' DCI Costello added: 'Billy Craven is a very dangerous individual and someone that the authorities responsible for his release will have to consider carefully as to whether he will never be a threat to the public again. 'I thank the witness in this case who had the courage to investigate what he encountered and then intervene by calling the police and giving chase to Craven as he fled the scene.'","He pounced on his 25-year-old victim as she left a New Year's party in Chapelfields, York, partially stripping and then attempting to rape her .

"By . Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 15:51 EST, 19 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:11 EST, 19 June 2012 . Transgender rocker Tom Gabel has spoken on camera for the first time as a woman called Laura Jane Grace. The lead singer of punk band Against Me!, who is married and has a two-year-old daughter, came out as transgender last month, the first major rock star ever to do so. The 31-year-old spoke this week about the life-altering changes since making the decision and how her family, friends and band mates have been, on the whole, supportive. Scroll down to see a 2010 interview with Gabel . True identity: Laura Jane Grace (pictured left) was born as Tom Gabel and is leader singer of punk rock band Against Me! Laura Jane Grace told MTV: 'I've been completely blown away by the . majority of people's reactions. ... They've been more than respectful . and more than supportive, and it's been, for me, completely humbling.' The rock star knew she was in the wrong body as early as four or five years old when she watched Madonna on TV and wanted to be like her when she grew up - both as a performer and as a female. She added: 'You don't understand what's happening to you ... though, as you grow older, you realize this isn't something that goes away. 'And you start hearing so many other . people's stories, and you realize, ''That's me. This is what I'm going . through.'' And it becomes so apparent that you'd be a fool to continue . to deny it.' Laura said she is not attracted to men and will still be married to wife Heather, who plans to stay in the relationship as her husband undergoes extensive treatment to . become a woman. Changes: As a teenager, Laura Jane Grace abused drink and drugs to mask her gender identity crisis . Gabel will take . hormones, undergo electrolysis and is considering gender reassignment . surgery but Heather isn't put off by his decision. 'When he starts taking hormones, he’s . gonna get these cute little boobs... I’ve never been attracted to . girls, but when he has that cute little boob sticking out of the side of . his tank top... hi-ya!' Heather told Rolling Stone in an interview published this month. Heather has already accepted Laura Jane Grace, as her wife, describing their couple's sex life as 'like normal but better'. Although the majority of people have been supportive - including Heather's family - the brave decision has ended Laura Jane Grace's relationship with her father, a retired Army major. The singer explained that as a boy she felt disconnected from her body and suffered from gender dysphoria, which caused her to abuse drugs and alcohol. Forever love: Tom's wife Heather, seen here with the singer, plans to stand by her spouse during and after his physical transition to becoming a woman. They have a two-year-old daughter . Public figure: Laura Jane Grace as lead singer of Against Me! (left) and when she performed as Tom Gabel . 'Growing up, my experience with transsexualism was nothing but shame,' she said. Without the Internet and with the only reference point in popular culture being 'scary trannys or butt-of-the-joke trannys', she said, the only option was to keep the feelings buried and wear women's clothes in secret. Laura said she only told a few family . members and close friends about the plan to have a sex change operation . before going public. Laura's only reservation about having the operation was how Heather would react to the news. 'But she's been super-amazing and understanding,' he said. Secret no more: In an interview with the Rolling Stone this month, Tom Gabel revealed to the world his decision to become a woman . Laura said she opened up about her decision to Rolling Stone Magazine because she is the first major rock star to ever assume a new gender. Transitioning from a man to a woman requires intense surgeries and years of hormone therapy. Some of the procedures include: . Vaginoplasty - The man's penis is turned inside-out to create a full-formed vagina. Breast implants - Hormone therapy will cause patients to grow breasts, but many opt to enlarge them with implants. Tracheal shave - Cartilage in the throat is removed and the Adam's Apple is reduced . Jaw recontouring - The broad, sharp lines of the man's jaw are softened by shaving down the jawbone. On hearing the news, friends from the music world came out in support of Gabel. Indie rock bands . including Tegan & Sara and Gaslight Anthem expressed support for their . peer, calling the announcement 'so incredibly . brave'. Her bandmates from Against Me! have simply said that they want Laura to be happy. 'I'm going to have embarrassing moments and that won't be fun,' she told the June issue of the magazine. 'But that's part of what talking to you is about -- is hoping people will understand, and hoping they'll be fairly kind.' Though Laura Jane Grace has only recently opened up to fans about issues with sexual identity, there have been hints in the lyrics of Against Me! songs - and in the band's name. In 'The Ocean,' on the band's 2007 album 'New Wave,' he sings: 'If I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman / My mother once told me she would have named me Laura.' Gabel also wrote a song called 'Transgender Dysphoria Blues.' Against Me! is best known for the song 'Thrash Unreal.' The group is on tour with The Cult this month across the U.S. before heading to play dates in Europe. The band: Against Me! began in 1997 in Naples, Florida, and are supportive of Gabel's decision to become a woman .","Singer of punk band Against Me! went public last month about sex change .

A grandmother died after an Indian doctor made a ‘catastrophic error’ by misdiagnosing kidney failure for a poverty-related infection common in the sub-continent. Dr Neeraj Tekkar wrongly believed Eva Hudson was suffering from hookworm when she was rushed to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset. Hookworm is parasitic infection of the intestines that is prevalent in underdeveloped parts of the world like southern India but is rare in Britain. Dr Tekkar had only moved to the UK in 2009 and started working at Bournemouth Hospital in 2011. In fact Mrs Hudson, 77, was suffering from kidney disease which Dr Tekkar did not spot and the mother-of-three and grandmother-of-five died four days later. At an inquest into her death, a coroner recorded a verdict that Mrs Hudson died of natural causes with 'neglect a contributory factor'. Mr Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth coroner, added that she may have been alive today had she received proper treatment. He said: 'He came up with a novel diagnosis that she was suffering from hookworm - he reassured the family. Daughter Julie Sansome (left) said . Dr Tekkar made a catastrophic error of judgement. Pictured with other members of Eva's family including , Mike Hudson, Sharon Brown and Dave Brown . 'He effectively ignored readings that . showed renal impairment. He should have got further advice on that . aspect and not let her leave the hospital. 'I think she may well have been saved or lived longer if there had been more attention carried out.' Dr Tekkar is still working at Bournemouth Hospital but his position is currently under review by the General Medical Council. Afterwards . Mrs Hudson’s daughter Julie Sansome blasted the Dr Tekkar, who . qualified as a doctor in India in 2003, as well as hospital bosses. She said: 'Dr Tekkar made a catastrophic error of judgement in misdiagnosing my mum. 'However, . we feel the blame must also fall on the shoulders of the Royal . Bournemouth Hospital for allowing him to be left unsupervised in a . situation where he was able to make life or death decisions.' The Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset where Mrs Hudson was misdiagnosed and sent home . The Bournemouth inquest heard that . Mrs Hudson, from Moordown, Bournemouth, first became unwell last October . and lost two-and-a-half stones in weight. The hookworm is a parasitic that lives in the small intestine of its host - which can vary from a human to a dog or a cat - and are thought to infect more than 600 million people worldwide. Two species of hookworms commonly infect humans. Ancylostoma duodenale can be found in the Middle East, North Africa, India and while Necator americanus is found in the Americas, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia. The worms suck blood from its host's internal walls causing anemia and loss of iron and protein in the gut. Coughing, chest pain, wheezing, and fever will sometimes be experienced by people who have been exposed to very large numbers of hookworm larvae. Indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea can occur in the early stages of infection although tend to improve with time. Hookworm is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics. Hookworms can cause intellectual, cognitive and growth retardation in infected children as well as prematurity and low birth weight among newborns born to infected mothers. In developed countries, hookworm infection is rarely fatal, but anemia can be significant in a heavily infected individual. She was taken to hospital by ambulance on December 18 when she was seen by Dr Tekkar. He diagnosed hookworm as he suspected that Mrs Hudson could have caught it from faeces when looking after her daughter’s dog. The doctor told the inquest that he identified hookworm as 'a possible diagnosis in the absence of an obvious cause.' He added: 'I understand it is not very common in this country.' He then sent her home to recover, a decision later questioned by his superiors. Dr Karim Hassan, lead consultant at Bournemouth Hospital, said: 'It is a big lesson. Any incidents of such calibre are taken very seriously. 'We have made sure that this case has been well discussed and all the lessons have been learned.' Asked if Mrs Hudson should have been allowed home, he added: 'My clinical sense would have indicated to me to investigate further.' Mrs Hudson was rushed back in to hospital three days later on December 21. She then underwent a CT scan and an emergency operation was carried out on her. She died the following day. The cause of her death was given as complications from a strangulated hernia and kidney disease. The GMC is due to make a decision on Dr Tekkar’s position in the near future. Mrs Hudson worked as a shop assistant and had a cleaning job. She leaves daughters Julie Sansome, Sharon Brown and son Michael and five grandchildren.","Doctor reassured grandmother's family she had hookworm and sent her home .

Mr Ryan, a former personal trainer who is 6ft 2in tall, added that his one diet 'weakness' was that he liked to drink coffee in the morning - which, by most . peoples' standards, is a guilt-free indulgence. The Insanity workout claims to be 'the hardest fitness program ever put on DVD'. claiming to burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour, it is based on 'plyometric drills' - exercises that comprise of long bursts of fast and powerful movements to develop muscle power and to improve speed.

The regime, which, like Insanity, involves learning fitness moves from a DVD, is broken down into a range of cardio activities, pull-ups, push-ups, karate and yoga. 'I'm kind of a skinny guy', he told Politico.com in March before revealing that he leads P90X workouts along with fellow politician Bart Stupak every morning on Capitol Hill. He added: 'There's about a dozen of us who do it... It's a fantastic workout.' House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy is also said to take part in the daily workout which begins at 6am.

"By . Oliver Pickup . UPDATED: . 07:59 EST, 8 August 2011 . The gunman who allegedly fatally wounded a police officer over the weekend, left a suicide note before going on a shooting spree, officials have said. San Diego-based officer Jeremy Henwood was pulling away from traffic lights on Saturday when Dejon Marquee White's car pulled up alongside him and he unloaded his shotgun. Following the unprovoked attack, police later cornered the armed 23-year-old and killed him. After searching his apartment, they found a two-page suicide note. Officer Jeremy Henwood (left) was shot dead in an unprovoked attack on Saturday. Dejon Marquee White (right) is alleged to have carried out the shooting, and left a suicide note before the spree . Sitting alone in his car the 36-year-old policeman was allegedly attacked by White, and died in hospital yesterday. Investigators have said that they can determine no motive for the shooting of the police officer. Before the weekend's shooting White was described as a 'petty criminal', and he had previously resisted arrest and performed minor thefts. The suicide letter did not inform readers as to how he was going to kill himself, or for what reasons, however he was linked to another shooting on Saturday - before Mr Henwood was shot dead. Outside an In-N-Out Burger restaurant located in El Cajon, 14 miles away from where the police officer was gunned down, Martin Hanna was shot at point-blank range - while in his car sitting with his girlfriend - with a shotgun. Police were trying to determine whether there was any link between White and Mr Hanna, who is expected to recover, though he is still in a critical condition. The alleged shooter is then believed to have sped away in an Audi car and he was travelling so quickly that he caught the attention of a patrol car, who gave chase yet was unable to keep up with the vehicle, which was reported to have been moving at over 100 miles per hour. Dejon Marquee White's Audi vehicle is shown, following his death. The 23-year-old was killed by police officers after he allegedly reached for his shotgun . Shortly afterwards, Mr Henwood was either stopped or moving slowly when a black Audi . with temporary plates flashed its headlights and drove to the left-hand side of his car. The suspect is then reported to have pointed a gun out of the passenger window and fired, according to police. Witnesses then used the dying officer's radio to . call for assistance and performed first aid until paramedics arrived and took him to hospital. San Diego police chief William Lansdowne led the tributes to Mr Henwood, who also served for the U.S. military in Afghanistan . A short time after the attack, officers . tracked the Audi to an apartment complex and saw a man with a shotgun climb into the car and begin to drive away. Several squad cars then blocked the road and converged on White in order to make the arrest.

A British multi-millionaire entrepreneur who was accused of possessing cocaine after being arrested in a U.S. nightclub has accepted an offer to carry out community service instead of going on trial. Mary Gorman, wife of former Gadget Shop chairman Chris Gorman, was also alleged to to have lashed out at a police officer following the incident in the toilets at Roxy in Orlando, Florida, on August 13 last year. Her lawyer confirmed that she would not stand trial, and dismissed as 'incorrect and totally wrong' reports, apparently sourced from legal papers at the time, that she had been arrested after allegedly performing a sex act on another man while her husband watched. Arrested: Mary Gorman (right), wife of former Gadget Shop chairman Chris Gorman (left), was accused of possessing cocaine and lashing out at a police officer . The sexual allegations were not included on the charge sheet, but Mrs Gorman had faced up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of the drugs and violence offences after a trial. The move is the latest development in an embarrassing saga for the Gormans, who live in a £2million home in Renfrewshire, Scotland, and are believed to have an estimated £45million fortune. Mr Gorman was also arrested following the nightclub incident, but a misdemeanour charge against him - for allegedly 'interfering' with police who arrested his wife - was dropped at Orange County Court in Florida last year. Accused: Mrs Gorman, whose estimated fortune is £45million, was charged after being arrested in a Florida nightclub in August last year . The couple, who have four children, had been at a hip-hop night at the club while on a family holiday to Disney World. Mrs Gorman's lawyer, Mark Horwitz, said she had agreed to a 'pretrial diversion' offer from the State Attorney's Office, which will mean the case against her is dismissed after she has completed community service. He said she had accepted a similar offer previously, only for the opportunity to be withdrawn by the authorities. In a statement, Mr Horwitz said: 'The State Attorney's Office has again offered to resolve the case against Mary Gorman through her participation in the Pretrial Diversion Program. 'Mrs Gorman has accepted the State's offer and will be meeting with a representative of pretrial diversion in the near future. A specific date for the initial meeting has not yet been set. 'The Pretrial Diversion Program is a frequently used method of resolving criminal cases. 'The State Attorney's Office and not the court decides when and in what cases to offer pretrial diversion to defendants.' Mr Horwitz said the scheme usually required defendants to do charity work. He added: 'In Mrs Gorman's case, she was previously offered pretrial diversion but before Mrs Gorman could meet with the pretrial diversion personnel, the State Attorney's Office withdrew the offer. Fortune: The entrepreneurs, who have four children, live in a £2million home in Renfrewshire, Scotland . 'The offer to resolve the case . through pretrial diversion was again recently put forth by the State . Attorney's Office and Mrs Gorman again accepted. Trip: Mrs Gorman was arrested during a family holiday to Disney World in Florida . 'Upon . successful completion of pretrial diversion, which does not involve an . admission of guilt, the case against Mrs Gorman will be dismissed by the . State.' Mr Horwitz said reports of a sexual nature about Mrs Gorman's actions in the nightclub were untrue. He said: 'I believe the basis for the sensational reporting of sexual activity is the arrest affidavit filed in this case. 'In . a statement given to me and the prosecutor in this case, the arresting . officer stated that the references in his affidavit concerning sexual . activity are incorrect and not true. 'In fact, he never saw Mrs Gorman participating in any sex act, nor did he see any sexual organs exposed as related in the arrest affidavit.' Mr Gorman, originally from Hartlepool, County Durham, made his millions in technology companies such as mobile phone retailer DX Communications and internet services firm Reality Group. He was also the former executive chairman of the Gadget Shop chain and was awarded an OBE in 2005. He played an active role in the high-profile Make Poverty History campaign that year. Mr Gorman's company, DX Communications, whose turnover grew from £100,000 to £70million in the late 1990s, was sold for £42 million. He later established and sold Reality Group in a £35million deal. Mrs Gorman describes herself as a 'creative entrepreneur' with business interests in technology, music, beauty and the creative industries.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared to indicate that Iran would be prepared to stop high-grade uranium enrichment. Ahmadinejad said he would meet the demand of the United States and its allies if world powers agreed to meet its needs for the fuel. On his presidential website he said: 'From the beginning the Islamic Republic has stated that if European countries provided 20 percent enriched fuel for Iran, it would not enrich to this level.' Negotiation: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visiting the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility in April 2008 (file photo) His comments coincide with the start today of world power talks over the Iranian nuclear programme. The two day conference will discuss ending a decade-long stand-off over Tehran's nuclear programme which has become a serious source of potential military conflict in the Middle East. World powers are pushing for the suspension of Iran's high-grade uranium enrichment activities over fears the country is trying to develop nuclear weapons, although Tehran denies the accusation. Sidelined: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may have been sidelined by the hard line regime . Despite the latest offer, it unclear how much influence Ahmadinejad has over the negotiations, and whether his remarks reflect Tehran's position in the talks. Experts and diplomats said a breakthrough was unlikely at the meeting in Moscow with the Iranians. The international powers taking part are also wary of making concessions that would let Tehran draw out the talks and give it more time to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Iran strenuously denies it has any wish to obtain such weaponry and says it only wants nuclear technology to generate electricity. Israel has threatened to bomb Iran if no solution to the dispute is found. Oil markets are nervous over the prospect of intensifying regional tensions and the frail world economy can ill afford a further increase in crude prices. A European Union spokesman said after the talks started: 'The atmosphere was fine, business-like and good. 'We hope this translates into a serious political commitment by the Iranians to address our proposals.' But a Western official made clear the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany were ready to deepen Iran's diplomatic and economic isolation if no deal is reached. Power: The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (seated second from right) stands down next year and has fallen out of favour with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (seated second from left) He said: 'If Iran remains unwilling to take the opportunities these talks present, it will face continuing and intensified pressure and isolation.' The Moscow talks follow two rounds of negotiations since diplomacy with Iran resumed in April following a 15-month hiatus. The United States wants to halt Iran's enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity, a level which some experts consider to be a dangerous step towards achieving the ability to create the explosive material required to make a nuclear bomb. Ahmadinejad's comments on enrichment appeared intended to ease pressure from the world powers and encourage them to make concessions at the talks. But the Iranian president, who stands down at elections next year, has fallen out of favour with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the man who has the ultimate decision-making power over the strategic nuclear programme.","Looming threats of military strikes and tougher economic sanctions face Iran .

Three licensing officers and two police officers raided The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, after spotting an advert promising ‘music from 4am’. The name of the band - billed as a two-piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am, and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm. 'Very confused': John Adams (left) and Joe Becket were baffled after council officials mistook their band name, 4AM, for a late-night stage time . Kate Dillon, landlady of The Feathers, said she was ‘amazed’ at the ‘sting’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from Spelthorne Borough Council. She said it was like ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’, adding: 'They turned up with two police officers and three council officers. 'I was outside at the time collecting glasses (and) I came into the pub and said: ""What on earth is this all about?"". 'They wanted to know if there was going to be music on until 4am and I was absolutely speechless for the first time in my life. 'I’m too old to stay up that late.' The duo, named 4am after a song by jazz legend Herbie Hancock, is made up of singer John Adams and drummer Joe Becket. Mr Adams said everyone was ‘very confused’ about the raid, adding: 'This has never happened to us before. Raided: Customers and staff at The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, were stunned to see police and council inspectors charge in . 'We’re called 4am after one of our favourite tracks by Herbie Hancock. That’s how we got the name, it’s from the album Mr Hands. 'When we were looking for a name that was our favourite album. We play stuff to get the ladies dancing, it’s all dance and soul.' Simon Freeman, 32, was at the gig when the raid took place - and said it was ‘totally ridiculous’. He said: 'These two police officers came in with these three guys from the council and they were very confrontational. 'You should have seen their faces when they realised the name of the band was 4am, not the time of the gig - they shot off with their tails between their legs. 'It will take quite a while for them to live this one down.' A spokesman for Spelthorne Borough Council admitted yesterday that its officers had made an error after spotting a poster for the gig earlier this month. He said: 'Following a visit to The Feathers, there was no cause for concern. The visit was carried out after seeing an advertisement which mentioned 4am.

Rocketing costs: Jacquie Heal, 44, from Bristol with the paperwork from the care home Sherwood Lodge where her mother is a resident . The family of a pensioner are furious after her care home fees were more than doubled to a staggering £125,000 a year. Pamela Watts, 76, is currently paying £3,543 a month out of her savings to live at a care home in Sandford Station Retirement Village in Somerset. But her fees are now being increased to £10,355 per month, of which the Government contributes just £432. The home, run by the St Monica Trust, says Mrs Watts’ fees have increased because of her complex and challenging needs. She has been given until July to decide whether to pay the increased fees - or move out. Her daughter Jacquie Heal, 44, said her mother will now have to sell her home in Bristol to meet the astronomical costs. Mrs Heal, a housewife, is calling on the Government put a cap on fees at care homes, which are currently free to charge what they like. She said: 'It seems as when you are a privately funded patient, care homes can charge what they like. 'There seems to be no regulatory body controlling the fees or putting a cap on them. 'These fees are extortionate - you could enjoy an all-year luxury cruise or pay three live-in carers a week for the same money.' Mrs Watts suffers from lymphedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissue, and cannot walk. She moved into Sherwood Lodge in December as she requires a specialist track hoist to move her around. But her daughter says she is still able to carry out everyday tasks herself such as eating and drinking. Mrs Heal added: 'Mum’s only problem is with her lymphedema which causes swollen legs and makes it impossible for her to walk. 'She is articulate and can feed herself, brush her hair and give herself a drink. I think it is outrageous that the fees have risen so much as mum’s needs have not changed.' Sandford Station retirement village is charging a 76-year-old resident £125,000 a YEAR in fees . Mrs Heal, who lives in Cleeve, North Somerset, applied to the government for Continuing Healthcare Funding for help in paying the fees. But the application was refused - as Mrs Watts’ has savings of more than £23,000 and therefore does not qualify for help. Mrs Heal has now written to North Somerset MP Dr Liam Fox and health secretary Andrew Lansley asking for support, as well as appealing to the St Monica Trust. A spokeswoman for St Monica Trust said the price increase will only cover the actual cost Mrs Watts’ care - which is 91 additional staff hours every week, costing £1,365. She said: 'The trust has been very concerned to provide a long-term care solution for Mrs Watts, despite her extremely complex care needs which has arisen as a consequence of various health conditions, weight and lack of mobility. 'The care requirements for Mrs Watts are considerably greater than for all other residents. 'She currently receives an additional 13 hours of dedicated care every day. 'The trust has been providing this additional care, without question, and at its own cost since early December, but we hope people understand that, as a not-for-profit organisation, we cannot continue to do this on an indefinite basis.' But a spokesman for the National Pensioners Convention said the cost was “astronomical”. He said: 'These are astronomical fees. The care home usually charges around £1,000 each week - so this is more than double the average cost. 'There is no cap on fees, no minimum or maximum that care homes have to adhere to. They can charge what they like and what they think they can get away with. 'It is worse than a postcode lottery, it is a home by home lottery with each charging something different. 'It is pretty despicable and an areas that desperately needs to be controlled. In a way it is exploiting an individual who simply cannot afford to sustain such a high cost. 'If she cannot pay, she will be forced to move out and find other care, something that places a great deal of stress and strain on a person.'","Mrs Watts ,76, has until July to decide whether to pay the increased fees - or move out .

The Duke of Cambridge also revealed he tore up his original guest list because it included 777 people neither he nor his bride knew. Speaking about the noisy crowds outside Clarence House on the eve of his wedding to Kate Middleton, he said: 'They were singing and cheering all night long, so the excitement of that, the nervousness of me and everyone singing - I slept for about half an hour.' Prince William kisses his wife Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Royal Wedding in London on April 29 last year . In the build-up to the big day, he said: 'There was very much a subdued moment when I was handed a list with 777 names on - not one person I knew or Catherine knew. 'I went to her and said, ""Listen, I've got this list, not one person I know - what do I do?"" and [the Queen] went, ""Get rid of it. Start from your friends and then we'll add those we need in due course. It's your day.""' Prince William also revealed that, while she has a reputation for being a stickler for protocol, in reality the Queen loves it when things go wrong. In an interview for a documentary to mark his grandmother's Diamond Jubilee, the prince reveals that she and the Duke of Edinburgh 'adore' it when a slip-up livens up yet another dull official engagement. 'One of the things I know that over the years they've loved is when things go wrong - they absolutely adore it because obviously everything always has to be right, but when things go wrong around them they're the first people to laugh. The Queen has seen so many parades or performances, when there's a small slip-up it tickles their humour, ' he said. The prince was interviewed by presenter Alan Titchmarsh for Elizabeth: Queen, Wife and Mother to be broadcast on ITV1 next Friday. The Prince said Queen Elizabeth told him to rip up his original wedding guest list and start again . Crowds who fillled The Mall and camped out overnight before the appearance of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, made him nervous . And he revealed that while the Queen adores her dogs and horses, which help her to 'switch' off, the corgis drive everyone else mad with their barking. Of her famous pets, he says, they are 'barking all the time... I don't know how she copes with it, but her private life with her dogs and her riding and her walking, it's very important to her - she has got to switch off. 'She enjoys it. I would just question the noise!' William also spoke of the close bond that exists between the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, saying: 'He's been just the most incredible support to her. I don't know how anyone, coming from the background he came from, and the Navy, he was going places, he was hugely promotable. William said he only got half an hour's sleep the night before the royal wedding when he married Catherine Middleton . Happy family: Prince William said everyone's fascinated by the Queen's life . The Prince was speaking to TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh (pictured) in an interview to mark the Queen's Jubilee . 'A very strong personality, to go from that, and then take a side step, or even a back step, and be the support he's been to the Queen has been quite amazing, and it's a real eye-opener for all of us to look at. As he would put it, he's just the Duke of Edinburgh. She is the Queen. 'He very much wants to be there to support her, so that she doesn't get that isolation, that loneliness, but also as a sounding-board. And also, he makes her laugh, because some of the things he says and does, the way he looks at life, is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.' 'They were singing and cheering all night long, so the excitement of that, the nervousness of me and everyone singing - I slept for about half an hour.' The Duke of Cambridge . William said the prospect of following in the Queen's footsteps was a daunting one: 'There's not much wriggle room left for me to try and find my own path but I will do. It's just a matter of learning what's gone before me. She's an incredible role model. I would like to take all of her experiences, all of her knowledge and put it in a small box and to be able to constantly refer to it. 'Everyone's fascinated by the Queen's life and how she's done it. And I would just hope, and I think she would love, is that a bit of what she's done and a bit of what she's achieved, and a bit of how she's conducted herself, we all take away in our own lives and try and do it ourselves. ' Also interviewed is William's cousin, Princess Eugenie, younger daughter of the Duke of York. She reveals that she often entertains her grandmother with tales of her escapades at university in Newcastle. 'She lights up whenever I talk about something to do with me because she's so interested in all of us. We talk about my Newcastle life,' she says. In an interview in the Radio Times she said: 'Of course, the members of the royal family are human and make mistakes, but look at the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William, the Princess Royal - they have a complete dedication to their job, to enthusing people and making them feel special.

A dozy drug dealer was caught when police found a photo on his phone of him wearing a crown made of 20 pound notes and a bag of cannabis hanging from his mouth. Ayub Hagos, from Abbey Wood, London, was arrested after officers searched a flat in Southsea, Hampshire last October and found a haul of drugs and cash. The 19-year-old denied having anything to do with the drugs until police took a look at his phone and discovered a gallery of photos of cash, guns, knives and white powder. Incriminating photo: Ayub Hagos poses with wads of £20 notes, a crown made from cash and a bag of cannabis in his mouth . He pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a class A drug with intent to supply and was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Portsmouth Crown Court on Friday. Police who raided the flat found 23 wraps of crack cocaine, with a street value of £920, 11 wraps of heroin, worth £440, a knuckle-duster and 500 pounds cash in his bag. Hagos was alleged to have travelled from his home in London to the south coast to sell the drugs. Caught red-handed: Hagos also had a picture on his phone of him admiring his drugs with a pile of cash on his lap . During his trial, Hagos' barrister Alexander Thompson told the court he had been naive. Hagos denied having anything to do with the drugs, until police found the incriminating photos on his phone . Mr Thompson said: 'He took the photographs as bravado to make himself seem more important in front of his peers. 'It is incredibly naive for a sophisticated drug dealer to have these sort of photographs on his phone.' Prosecutor Matthew Lawson said: 'The crown would certainly say it is an overwhelming case. 'The photographs are such that the defendant would have had difficulty in disassociating himself with the drugs.' The court heard he had previous convictions for possessing cannabis and assault. Sentencing him, Judge Richard Price said: 'You came down from London with class A drugs, crack cocaine and heroin, to sell in this city. 'I am satisfied that is the sole purpose of your visit to this city. 'You are more than a street dealer, you are a supplier to those who sell on the streets.

Mr Tomlinson, a newspaper vendor, had . been walking home from work but had been prevented from taking his usual . route due to the protests in the City of London in April 2009. At the time, Harwood was said to be . bristling with aggression after a protester had scrawled ‘all cops are . bastards’ on a police carrier. Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC compared Harwood to a thug during the opening of the trial at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Tomlinson's widow Julia (right) arrives at Southwark Crown Court along with her stepsons Paul King (centre) and Richard King (left) to witness the proceedings . He said: ‘It was a rush of blood to . the head. It was unnecessary aggression more akin to thuggish behaviour . than proper reasonable policing. ‘There had been no need to use any . force upon Tomlinson, let alone a forceful baton strike followed by a . powerful push to the back that sent [him] flying to the ground. ‘The display of force has all the . hallmarks, we submit, of a gratuitous act of aggression by a lone . officer whose blood was up having lost the self-control to be expected . of a police officer in such circumstances and who was going to stand no . truck from anyone who appeared to him to be a protester and to be . getting in his way.'

Garden guru: Bob Flowerdew advised a studio member to put their pet rabbit under a trampoline to save space in the garden . A BBC gardening expert has horrified animal welfare experts by suggesting that a woman keeps her family's pet rabbit beneath a trampoline to save space. Garden guru Bob Flowerdew was answering a question at a live recording of cult Radio 4 programme Gardeners' Question Time at the Chelsea Flower Show when he made the suggestion. Audience member Jane Wood had asked the panel about ways she could cope with her children and pets in a small garden. Mr Flowerdew told her: 'The first thing you can do is put the rabbit under the trampoline - that will economise on space.' Although the audience roared with laughter at the suggestion, fellow panellist Matthew Wilson warned that the pet would likely be flattened. The RSPCA also warned rabbit owners to disregard the advice. A spokesman said: 'Putting an animal under a trampoline while it is in use could cause distress. 'The RSPCA would urge people not to follow this advice, even if it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek.' 'Rabbits are active animals. They need the opportunity to hop, run, jump, dig, stand fully upright on their back legs and stretch out fully when lying down. 'It is very important you provide your rabbits with a secure living environment that is large enough for them to exercise in and stand up fully on their back legs without their ears touching the roof.' 'As rabbits are a prey species - they also need to be able to hide in a secure place, away from the sight and smell of predators (e.g. foxes, cats, dogs, ferrets and birds of prey).' Not funny: The RSPCA said people should not follow Mr Flowerdew's advice even if it was meant to be tongue in cheek as it could cause distress to a rabbit . A BBC spokesman said that Mr Flowerdew's comments were not intended to be taken seriously.

Staff at a cash-strapped council have spent more than £5million on takeaway pizzas, cosmetics, nightclubs and lingerie using company credit cards, it has emerged. Bosses at Essex County Council allowed 757 employees the use of council purchase cards, resulting in costly shopping sprees at the taxpayer's expense. The receipts include £644.45 on cosmetics; £3,600 ordering from Domino’s Pizza; £87,023.20 on costly hotel stays; £52,868.60 on theatre tickets and £3,827.21 spent in local bars and nightclubs. Luxury: Staff at Essex County Council spent more than £5million on council credit cards in two years, including a £1,400 stay at the Dorchester hotel in London (pictured) Council staff have also enjoyed living the high life with a £1,400 stay at five-star London hotel The Dorchester. They have also made three trips to Five Lakes Golf Country Club in Maldon, Essex, at a total cost of £2,200 to the taxpayer. Over a 27-month period between December 2009 and April 2012 officers racked up a whopping £5,136,145 in spending. Robert Oxley, from the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be left gobsmacked that their money has . been spent on the council living it up at nightclubs plus stays at . five-star hotels, shoe-shining and even hat cleaning. 'Residents . will be left wondering why they are picking up bills totalling tens of . thousands of pounds at country clubs, florists, bakeries and record . shops. 'The receipts suggest officers at Essex County Council have been enjoying the high life at taxpayers’ expense.' Lingerie: One receipt shows a staff member spent £17.50 at women's underwear store La Senza - the council claims this was to buy clothes for a child in care . The spending figures - released following a Freedom of Information request - come just two months after a damning report from the Audit Commission slamming Essex County Council for 'a lack of control over corporate credit cards' dating back to 2009. Last year, the council cut 450 jobs after slashing its annual budget by £98million as part of sweeping cutbacks. Takeaways: Council staff spent £3,600 ordering from Domino's Pizza . Purchase cards were first brought in as a 'cost-effective method for low-value purchases' with staff warned they were not for personal use. But since 2009, the number of purchase cards in use at the council has more than doubled from 295 to 757. Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said: 'People at Essex County Council need to realise that it isn’t Essex’s money, it isn’t the Government’s money, it is the public’s money and the public have a right to know how it is being spent. 'I’m sure Essex will now look carefully at the number of people holding these cards because it strikes me as excessive. 'If they do that, you are not likely to get money spent on cosmetics and McDonald’s.' Essex County Council today defended its spending, claiming much of the money was used to cover expenditure for children in their care. A spokesman for Essex County Council today defended its spending, claiming much of the money was used to cover expenditure for children in their care . A spokesperson said: 'Essex County Council has a robust policy relating to spend on P-cards and all P-card holders must be given authorisation by a senior manager to carry out such transactions. Council boss: Chief executive Joanna Killian . 'The P-cards are used by officers working across all the council’s services, including schools, children’s homes and our country parks. 'Our Looked After Children teams take on the role of a parent for these children and are responsible for their daily care needs while they are under the care of the county council’s children’s social services. 'Approximately 750 of the 41,000 officers employed by Essex County Council have a card and expenditure on them only relates to a small proportion of our overall budget.' When asked to explain £17.50 spent at lingerie store La Senza, the council argued it was used to buy clothes for a child in care. Other shopping trips included £1,000 spent in luxury London department store Harrods during a care trip for children with disabilities. Selina Huang, 23, who works at a Chinese restaurant in Chelmsford, said: 'What the staff at County Hall are doing with the money is so bad.

When great-grandmother Joan Lloyd swapped her bus pass for a boob job in November 2010, spending £4,250 to go from an A to an F cup, she not only changed her looks. She changed her life when she landed herself a sexy new toy boy. Joan, 66, has found love with Phil Absolom, who, at 28, is 38 years her junior, and she's moved him into the home she used to share with late hubby David, who died in 2010. Joan, 66, has found love with Phil Absolom, who, at 28, is 38 years her junior . Last year she promised her dying husband that she would get a boob job and 'go further' in life after he passed away. Speaking to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning she said: 'He mentioned it and starting to laugh about it and I said ""Oh I can't do that"" but he said ""promise me.""' The mother of four's boobs started to sag after she had given birth so she took the plunge and had the operation. Joan's late husband made her promise him that she would undergo the surgery . And it was after that that her and Phil's paths crossed, but they didn't meet in a conventional way. Phil said: 'I met Jane through Facebook, it was a mistake, I was looking for a Weatherspoon chain because I was going away and then I saw Jane. 'I had done some research because of the papers she had been in and I thought I would say ""Hello, how are you doing?"" and wish her good luck and then Jane responded to me. Despite their age difference, the couple seemed happy and relaxed in each others company on the show . 'It took about three weeks, and I was going to give up in the end.' 'I had seen people being crude because obviously everyone sees Jane's busts before her personality, an then we started talking on the phone and it escalated from there.' But Phil had stiff competition as Jane had received nearly 600 messages from men as young as eighteen interested in her. Jane instantly fell for Phil's personality, she said: 'We have such good fun and when I first saw him, when he came to stay with me in the hotel before I came on the show, he came through the lobby and I thought ""oh wow, that's just for me. You know I am going to have him, he is gorgeous"" The 66-yeard-old has received a mass of attention since she hit the headlines with her boob job . The pair love doing ordinary things like cooking together and playing monopoly . 'My legs were like jelly when I saw him.' Jane takes her fitness very seriously and Phil joked that many people find it difficult to keep up with her in life. The couple laughed and joked on the show and explained how they enjoy cooking together and playing monopoly together. Although Phil has received some negativity towards his relationship with Jane, he said: 'I think to myself, I could be with someone my own age but unhappy and it could fall apart.' The pair don't have issues with the generational gap: 'We have to give and take' said Phil. When asked what her late husband David would say if he was looking down on her, Jane replied: 'He would say ""good on you girl, good on you. This is what I wanted you to do.""'","Joan, 66, met Phil, 28 on Facebook after her saw her in the newspaper .

Sara Agintas, tipped the scales at a hefty 33 stone, but now is looking forward to a brighter future . A 33st benefits claimant who said she was 'too fat to work' has now secured part-time work after undergoing complimentary weight loss surgery. Sara Agintas, 43, from Milton Keynes, grabbed the headlines after she  demanded a £14,000 gastric band op on . the NHS, while refusing to diet or exercise because it was 'too hard'. Despite her public plea health specialists refused to operate, however a private London surgeon came forward and offered to carry out the two-and-a-half hour procedure free of charge. Since undergoing the op at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in London on May 24, during which 85 per cent of her stomach was removed,  Mrs Agintas has lost 11bs and gone from a size 38 to a 32. And now with a newfound sense of confidence she has also got a job as a part-time Avon representative. While she's happy working for the cosmetics brand, the mother-of-six said she would eventually like a permanent role at Tesco as she moves towards her target weight of 15st. She said: 'When the surgeon offered to operate, it was like a dream come true. I am so lucky. It was my fault I was fat. I did not deserve help, but I needed it. I could hardly move at 33st.' Mrs Agintas who receives £15,000 a year in state benefits, says she binged on junk food for 25 years, admitting to spending up to £200 a week on takeaways and downing 12 'small' cans of lager a day while expecting her sixth child. She is mother to Gemma, 25, Lauren, 21, Thomas, 18, Sam, 13, Hannah, 12, and Zoe, nine. While doctors warned her of the health dangers she insisted that she found it 'too hard to diet' and said exercise hurt. She also complained she was too fat to work. In March, as a final resort she pleaded for taxpayers to shell out for the weight-loss surgery as she could not fit in an office chair or a holiday plane seat. But when a private surgeon in West London heard of her predicament, he felt sorry for her and offered to perform the op for free. Last month Mrs Agintas,  who lives with her husband Halbin, 42, who works part-time because of a back injury, had the two-and-a-half-hour operation, which has divided her stomach and left a narrow, sleeve-shaped section. Now limited now to small food portions for life, she has lost 11lb in weight since coming home and gone from a size 38 to a size 32. Instead of gorging on takeaways and junkfood Mrs Agintas has a Weetabix for breakfast, a scrambled egg for lunch, followed by a plate of potatoes and vegetables in the evening. While working towards her target weight of 15st and Mrs Agintas is also determined to help three of her children, who are judged obese, to lose weight - although she does not want them to go through the same risky operation. She told Closer magazine: 'I will never eat McDonald's again. The sleeve is not a miracle cure. I have got a lot of work to do, but it is the best thing I ever did. The sleeve is a dangerous operation. I could have died, but I took the chance because I thought my weight was going to kill me.' Family values: Sarah Agintas, pictured with her husband Halbin, is mother to Gemma, 25, Lauren, 21, Thomas, 18, Sam, 13, Hannah, 12, and Zoe, nine - but says it was her pregnancies which forced her to binge on junk food . She added: 'For the first time, I am excited about my future.' Mrs Agintas first became pregnant aged 17 by her boyfriend of just a few months. She said she was delighted by the pregnancy because she had always looked forward to being a mother, and at 6ft, she was 15st.  But it was then that she developed unhealthy cravings for junk food that saw her weight go up and down, throughout the next five pregnancies. 'I ate a jar of pickled onions a day, . followed by three cakes and three packets of crisps. For dinner, I’d . have two pork chops with veg followed by two Big Mac meals – I ate for . two!,' she told Closer. She moved into a one-bed council flat when she split up with her boyfriend a few months after becoming pregnant. After giving birth to Gemma, Mrs Agintas weighed 16st and claims she applied for 15 jobs, but gave up looking for work and turned to cheap junk food when she was unsuccessful. Her weight crept up to 20st in 1990, when she was aged 21 and she measured a size 24. Then . she met a new partner and moved into his three- bedroom council house, . quickly falling pregnant with her second child, Lauren. She . gained three stone as her eating habits spiralled out of control, and . in one average day she would down three Pot Noodles – at 400 calories a . go – two sausage rolls and four packets of crisps. When she had her third child, Thomas, two years later, she weighed 28st and would think nothing of having four thickly buttered slices of toast for breakfast. She even fell through the stairs in her house, forcing the council to reinforce the floor. Mrs Agintas . admits doctors insisted that she needed to restrict her food intake and . make a drastic change to her diet, but she found it too difficult. Her children have been raised on a diet of junk food and Mrs Agintas . said: 'They ate what I ate – pasties and crisps. I was lazy – it was . easier to phone for a takeaway than cook. I gave them chips four times a . week,' she told the magazine. Pregnancy: Mrs Agintas says she developed a craving for junk food when she was pregnant and her children raised on a diet of junk food and said 'I was lazy - it was easier to phone for a takeaway than cook. I gave them chips four times a week' In 1993, Mrs Agintas split . with her boyfriend, who left her for another, skinnier woman and was . forced to move the family into another three-bed council house. But her broken heart was mended three years later, when she met her current partner bricklayer Halbin. After a whirlwind six month romance, the couple were married, although Mrs Agintas could not afford a big enough wedding dress, so was forced to wear a size 30 trousers and blouse. It was then she began having takeaways meals five nights a week, totalling an eye-watering £200 for the family. In 1998, she ballooned to 38st after . giving birth to fourth child Sam – in the last few months of the . pregnancy she gorged on a 24-pack of chocolate bars every day. She developed high blood pressure due to . her unhealthy lifestyle, although she did not have any complications . during her pregnancies. When Sam was a baby, she joined a gym, but admitted she would only do five minutes of exercise and then would then go home to a fish and chip meal afterwards - although she still lost 6st taking her down to 32st. But, in 1999, she piled 2st of the weight back on by the time she had given birth to her fifth child Hannah. At 34st, Mrs Agintas gave birth to her sixth and final child, Zoe in 2003. She admits to drinking up to 12 small cans of Heineken a day- 50 units a week- for the last few months of her pregnancy - but insists it was safe because she had watered it down with ice. Mrs Agintas, has tried to encourage her family to eat healthier after experiencing arthritis, diabetes and asthma but for her a gastric bypass was her last and only option.

Secret tapes put forward as evidence at the trial of an alleged mafia 'boss' have revealed how one mobster hated Frank Sinatra so much that he wanted to kill him. The trial of Joseph 'Uncle Joe' Ligambi, reputed head of the Philadelphia mob, began last Thursday after he was arrested on gambling and extortion charges in 2011. Prosecutors claim that Ligambi provided video poker machines and other illegal gambling devices to bars, restaurants and shops in Philadelphia. Underworld: The alleged 'boss' of the Philadelphia mob Joseph Ligambi (center), with two unknown associates, is standing trial on extortion charges . The prosecution wants to use tapes recorded by a mobster-turned-FBI informant to paint a picture of the violent past of the mob. However defense attorney Christopher Warren, who is representing Ligambi and another alleged gangster Joseph . 'Scoops' Licata, described the tapes to jurors as just a 'bunch geriatric gangsters talking', according to philly.com. He said that the recordings were not relevant to his clients' trial. The tapes were made by mobster Nicholas 'Nicky Skins' Stefanelli who became an informant for the FBI and recorded dozens of conversations by wearing a wire. One conversation took place between 69-year-old Stefanelli and Licata at the American Bistro in New Jersey last April. Louis Fazzini, 45, and Nicholas Mitarotunda, 74, were also allegedly at . the meal. The men talk about a mafia consigliere (advisor) called  Antonio 'Tony Bananas' Caponigro who was told by Sinatra to 'stop talking' during a performance. The mobster was so enraged, he was said to have 'hated' the singer and threatened to kill him. Mobbed: Sinatra at the of 28 is surrounded by adoring female fans at Grand Central in New York...however one head of a Philadelphia crime family was less than enamored . Rage: Antonio 'Tony Bananas' Caponigro, an 'advisor' to the Philadelphia mob, threatened Sinatra's life after the singer was rude to him in 1968 . The gangsters then begin to discuss their other favorite singers - with Bobby Darin, Tom Jones and Elvis Presley topping the list. One suggests that Presley did a better version of My Way than Sinatra. The discussion around the dinner table then turns to fashion, in particular custom-made shirts, along with how you get a better sleep in prison because no one can call you in the middle of the night. They also complained that prison sentences were getting longer because, in the past: 'Every cop was on the take. Nobody to pinch you. Do anything you want.' Stefanelli, 69, allegedly committed suicide after being found dead in a New Jersey hotel room this February. Murky past: FBI informant Nicholas Stefanelli, 69, was found dead in a New York hotel room earlier this year while Joseph Licata (right) is standing trial for extortion . Defense lawyer Mr Warren has argued that the tapes have nothing to do with the Ligambi case. Ligambi and 12 others were said to have ran illegal gambling operations and charged exorbitant interest on loans. A 70-page indictment, filed last May, described a 'Godfather-like' world where the reputed mobsters used threats to kill or harm people in a bid to recoup business debts. The trial resumes on Thursday and is expected to last up to three months.","Mob 'boss' Joseph Ligambi on trial in Philadelphia .

A doctor is accused of raping a former lover he had a secret affair with in Pakistan and threatening to release naked photographs of her when she rejected his advances. Dr Muhammed Khan, who practices in Glasgow, is fighting for his career at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing (MTPS). His alleged victim, who can only be identified as 'Miss A', has accused Khan of raping her when she was a student in Pakistan when she was 17 in 2001. Defence: Dr Muhammed Khan, pictured, is fighting for his career at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal . Service hearing. Miss A claims Khan threatened to disgrace her by showing photographs of her nude . She told the medical watchdog panel in Manchester that over a nine-year period Khan forced her to have sex and pose for explicit photographs. The woman, who also works in the medical profession, finally made the complaint to the MPTS in 2009 after claiming Khan arrived at her workplace with the explicit photographs. Miss A claims Khan threatened to disgrace her by showing the photographs of her nude and performing a sex act to her father in Pakistan and friends. It is against Islamic law for women to have boyfriends and a sexual relationship is taboo in Pakistan and with devout Muslim families who have strict rules on marriage. Despite this Miss A admitted to the panel that she and Khan did have a sexual relationship which continued even after she was allegedly 'brutally raped' in 2001. Under cross-examination Miss A claimed she continued with a relationship with Khan because she 'was convinced that what he did was out of love'. The incident is thought to have happened at the Khyber Medical College in Pakistan when Khan is said to have 'lured' Miss A with a promise to hand over some photos. Defence counsel Mr Anthony Hayworth refused to accept she had been raped and they instead confirmed their love for each other by swearing on the Quran. Allegations: The victim, who has not been named, told the medical watchdog panel in . Manchester (pictured) that over a nine-year period until 2009 Khan forced her to . have sex and pose for explicit photographs . He said: 'You regarded each other as husband and wife, didn’t you?' Miss A denied that but admitted that their relationship continued for a further seven years afterward, during which the two regularly exchanged telephone calls and text messages. The panel were told that gifts, birthday cards and messages with elaborate 'I love you' sentiments were swapped between them. But the relationship soured when Miss A, who was dating and has since married another man, refused to rekindle their relationship once Khan arrived in the UK in 2008. It is claimed that Khan then embarked on a campaign of blackmail because he was demanding that Miss A should have his hand in marriage. The MPTS is to ascertain whether he has acted improperly as a GP which carried a most severe penalty of being struck off. Defence counsel Mr Anthony Hayworth claimed Miss A’s accusations were a 'fantasy' and she was trying to get 'revenge' for going against her faith. Mr Hayworth also accused her of lying for failing to admit that she and Dr Khan had sex 'over a dozen times' to the panel. She said: 'I have not been lying. This is a story over ten or 11 years. It’s been very difficult.' Mr Hayworth claimed that no photos of Khan exist and she never received any because she has not been able to produce them as evidence. She said: 'I was told to delete them which I did because it was very dangerous for me to have them on my home computer.' Khan is further accused of telephoning a friend of Miss A and saying he had discussed kidnapping him in Pakistan but denies all the charges against him. The medical professional qualified at the University of Peshawar in 2004 but is not registered as a GP or a specialist in the UK. He is 'registered with a licence to practise', according to the General Medical Council. No criminal charges have been brought. The hearing continues.

A paraplegic man who says he was stranded in the New Mexico desert without his wheelchair dragged himself about four miles down a dirt road over three days before a motorist stopped to help him. Tattered and dirty, Ricky Gilmore's blue jeans tell part of the story. His body tells the rest - the skin on his left leg and buttocks is shredded, his wrist is sprained and his kidneys are in bad shape from going without food and water. 'Ah man, I'm just a big mess. I ache and I'm just in the first stages of healing,' he told The Associated Press on Tuesday from his hospital bed at the Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock, New Mexico. Torn: Ricky Gilmore shows off his tattered and torn jeans, which he was wearing as he inched through scrub brush along a dusty road for three days . Gilmore, 49, said he was dropped in the . desert by a couple in a white truck who he met while he was hitchhiking. He had invited them to his home for steaks and they later went for what . Gilmore thought was going to be a joyride. When . he declined to share his alcohol with them, Gilmore said the man . grabbed him by his feet and threw him out of the truck while parked . along the desolate road. It . was early evening and Gilmore had nothing - no wheelchair, no food, no . water, no coat - to help him endure the flat desert scrubland. 'It . was dark and I was shivering and the wind was blowing so I just crawled . to a bush and dug in right there. It was cold that night,' he said. With the sunrise, survival mode kicked in. 'I started dragging myself. I did the same thing all day and I only got about two miles,' he said. Left for dead: Gilmore was in the middle of the Navajo Nation Reservation when he was dumped . Two people passed by. Gilmore tried flagging them down but they only honked and kept going. After spending a second night at the side of the road, Gilmore said he woke up sore and thirsty and didn't want to move. 'I . could have easily gave up and said forget it, but I said I'm not going . to freeze out here and I just kept on going,' said Gilmore, who lives by . himself and lost the use of his legs in a car crash years ago. On . the third afternoon, a man in a blue pickup truck stopped and called . for help. Gilmore said doctors told him his body temperature was 94 when . he was found. 'I don't think I would have made it another night,' he said. Gilmore is being treated for acute . kidney failure from dehydration, a sprained wrist and a blood infection. He spent two days in intensive care and it could be at least another . week before he can go home. Desolate: This is the bleak landscape of the Navajo Indian Reservation where Gilmore was dumped without food, water or his wheelchair . The Farmington Daily Times first . reported Gilmore's story. He was found along a seldom traveled road on . the Navajo Nation about 10 miles from his home in Newcomb, which is on . the eastern side of the reservation. The Daily Times reported that Gilmore filed a report with the Shiprock Police Department. There were no officials at the department after hours Tuesday who could confirm details of the report. Gilmore said he's bandaged up 'big time' and morphine is helping with the pain. Still, he had a nightmare Monday night in which he found himself sitting at the edge of a freeway waving his hands at the passing traffic, but no one looked at him. His plan is simple for when he gets released from the hospital: 'Go home and pray, take inventory and just get a good night sleep in my own bed and heal.'","Ricky Gilmore was thrown out of his wheelchair in the middle of the Navajo Nation Reservation in New Mexico .

The father-of-four accused of running a string of Manhattan brothels funded the operation with thousands of dollars provided by his mother, it has been claimed. Sheila Thomas, 64, may have unwittingly provided $45,000 in loans to her son William Thomas for the sleazy operation. Thomas, 42, a former IT company expert, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of running four brothels from the Financial District to the Upper East Side. Scheme: Actress Sheila Thomas (pictured left) unwittingly provided $45,000 to her son William for his alleged string of brothels in New York City . Mrs Thomas has had bit parts in movies including Robert De Niro's Good Shepherd and made many TV commercials. In early 2008, she gave her son $10,000, according to bankruptcy filings seen by the New York Post. Calls to Mrs Thomas by MailOnline went unanswered today. Several months earlier, Thomas has registered Aaron Integrated Care - which police claim was a shell business for his prostitution ring. Mrs Thomas, who has also starred in the HBO series Mildred Pierce with Kate Winslet, then provided a $25,000 loan in January 2009 and another $10,000 four months later. Police claim William Thomas had created two sleazy websites to promote his . hooker business, which charged between $200 to $300 an hour for sex with Asian women. These . were overseen in four brothels on Maiden Lane, Sixth Avenue near 37th . Street, East 50th Street and East 58th Street, authorities allege. Last June, William Thomas was sued for repayment of the $45,000 - but has not paid any of the money back. Available for hire: The E4A website provided photographs of escorts in various outfits . Websites E4AKorea.com and E4ANY.com have now been taken down but advertised for the 'authentic girlfriend experience' His ex-wife Susan told the New York Post this week that she was the one who alerted the authorities to Thomas' alleged scheme. She had brought the father of her two . teenage sons to court over $100,000 in unpaid child support and took . the opportunity to alert authorities to what she had seen at his . apartment - allegedly 'large amounts of cash...and the website on his . computer'. One of Thomas's teenage sons appeared shocked by news . of his father's arrest, taking to Twitter yesterday to make the apparently . sarcastic comment: 'Awesome dad! way to make the thomas family proud.' He added: 'Pretty . surreal to hear your dad’s name on the news in connection to a massive . prostitution ring bust. had to happen eventually i guess.' His last comment suggests he already knew something about the allegations or the arrest. Neighbors . said Thomas had been living quietly in an apartment in Fort Greene with . his one-year-old son, the boy's mother and his three-year-old daughter . from a previous marriage. He was described as a 'quiet guy' and 'always friendly'. A source said Thomas married his second wife, half-Korean beauty . So Young, who apparently had the connections he needed for his business . venture. They had a daughter, now three, but divorced in March, a . source told the New York Post. Thomas was arrested and charged with . promoting prostitution after an undercover cop posed as a customer who . wanted to have sex with an Asian woman. He connected with Thomas on websites . www.E4AKorea.com and www.E4ANYC.com. The 42-year-old was arrested on . October 11 and posted $10,000 bail two days later. On the websites, which have since been taken down, pictures of half-naked Asian women promising 'Your Midtown Korean experience' and the 'girlfriend experience' for up to $300 an hour were advertised. Hookers are shown posing topless and in lingerie on his website, for services at his brothels. Pictured here is the midtown brothel . 'GFE's do multipop on an hour rate basis,' the websites detail, indicating the hooker would have sex multiple times. The undercover officer kept in touch . with Thomas by email and text and 'became a member of the E4AKorea . private men’s club', prosecutors said in court. He then went to one of the brothels and met a Korean woman who . introduced herself as 'Olivia' and told him he could kiss her but had to . wear a condom during sex. The . complaint said: 'The undercover officer asked for a . Japanese girl, and [Rei Spain] said the Japanese girls don’t do full . service, only massage and ""happy ending"" for $100 plus $40 tip.' Two . women, Jung Lee, 28, of Queens, and Rei Spain, 38, of Long Island, were . also arrested for prostitution and promoting prostitution.

The bodies of four innocent young girls, possibly sisters, are wrapped in linen tied with pink bows as they lie among dozens of dead women and children, the latest victims of Bashar Assad's brutal regime. The girls are believed to be among some 22 civilians slaughtered by the state-sponsored miltia known as the Shabiha in the town of Douma near Damascus yesterday. Harrowing: These four young girls, their bodies wrapped with bright pink . bows, were among 22 civilians allegedly slaughtered by stated-sponsored . militiamen in a Damscus suburb . 'There was a horrible massacre in Douma last night,' the media office of the opposition network in Douma said in a statement. 'More than 20 civilians have been slaughtered by shabiha who were at a checkpoint and then stormed into a residential building nearby.' Mahmoud Doumany, an activist living in Douma, said that he had the names of 20 of the dead but that 10 were too disfigured to be identified. 'People now are scared and very angry. Some of the martyrs were killed with knives, others were shot,' he said. Syrian . state television said 25 people had been killed by 'terrorist members . of the so-called 'Liwa al-Islam.'' State media labels opposition members . as 'terrorists.' Victims: The bodies of six other civilians allegedly slaughtered in the town of Douma . According to opposition activists militiamen known as shabiha stormed into a residential building and began slaughtering people indiscriminately . The Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Syrian army was not present in the area. Opposition video showed images of corpses wrapped in blankets and of the bodies of women and children, one of whom had a hole in his head and another had part of his face missing. 'God is great,' said a man off screen, his voice trembling as he walked around the house, filming bodies on several floors of a residential building. It was not possible to verify what happened due to Syria's restrictions on media access. More than 32,000 people have been . killed in Syria's conflict, which began with peaceful pro-democracy . protests in March 2011 and escalated into civil war as repression . increased. Global and . regional powers have been unable to stop the violence, with the West . condemning President Bashar al-Assad but shying away from arming the . rebels, and Russia, China and Iran sticking by the embattled autocrat. Syria, . whose leadership comes from the Alawite sect linked to Shi'ite Islam, . says it is fighting Islamist hardliners backed by Sunni Muslim states . like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Also . today, an al-Qaida-inspired Islamist group rejected the short holiday . cease-fire proposed by the international peace envoy to Syria. Rebel fighters race for cover after a tank attack in the streets of Bustan Al Basha yesterday . Syrian security officers guard the damaged aviation intelligence department building which was reportedly attacked by two suicide bombers . Casualty: Syrian civilians wheel a man injured by an artillery shell which landed near a bakery, to a hospital for treatment in the city of Aleppo . The envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, said the government in Damascus and some rebel leaders had agreed to a four-day truce during the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, which starts Friday. But in a statement posted on militant websites Jabhat al-Nusra, rejected the cease-fire, calling it a 'filthy game' and saying it has no faith that President Bashar Assad's regime would respect the truce. The Syrian government says it's studying the proposal. So far all diplomatic efforts have failed to stop Syria's violence, which activists say has killed more than 34,000 people. Both sides have agreed to earlier cease-fires only to thwart them with more attacks. The U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria . said the government in Damascus and some rebel leaders have agreed to a . temporary cease-fire during a four-day Muslim holiday that starts . Friday. The . Syrian government, however, did not confirm Wednesday's announcement by . Lakhdar Brahimi, saying only that it was still studying the envoy's . proposal. An al-Qaida-inspired group today rejected the short holiday cease-fire proposed by international peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi (pictured) Brahimi told reporters in Cairo that President Bashar Assad's government has agreed to a truce for the Eid al-Adha holiday. Brahimi said Damascus will issue a statement on accepting the cease-fire later 'today or tomorrow.' The announcement came as government forces intensified airstrikes on a rebel-held area near the besieged city of Aleppo. The fighting in Syria has killed more than 34,000 people since March last year, according to activists. Brahimi did not elaborate on how the truce would be monitored. The envoy has met with Assad in Damascus on Sunday as part of his push for a cease-fire between rebels and government forces. He also held talks last week with opposition groups inside and outside Syria and earlier received 'promises' but not a 'commitment' from them to honor the cease-fire. In Damascus, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdessi stressed Wednesday that the cessation of military operations during Eid al-Adha is still 'being studied' by the General Command of the Army and the Syrian armed forces, and that 'the final position on this matter will be issued on Thursday.' Abdelbaset Sieda, the head of the Syrian National Council, the main opposition group in exile, told The Associated Press that he had little hope the truce would take hold. He said opposition fighters have told him they are willing to adhere to it, but will respond if attacked by regime forces. 'This regime, we don't trust it, because it is saying something and doing something else on the ground,' Sieda said in a phone interview from Stockholm, Sweden. Brahimi's proposal is far more modest than a six-point plan by his predecessor as Syrian envoy, former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. A cease-fire was the centerpiece of Annan's proposal and was to lead to talks on a peaceful transition. However, a truce never took hold and both sides violated their commitments, though Annan said at the time the regime was the main aggressor because it refused to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from population centers. In Syria, regime warplanes struck the village of Mar Shureen near a strategic rebel-held town in the country's north Wednesday, killing five members of an extended family, activists said. Hunger: Displaced civilians wait for food near an NGO charitable kitchen in a refugee camp near the town of Azaz . Rubble: Buildings damaged in what activists said was an artillery attack by government forces lie abandoned in Houla near Homs . The village is located just outside the town of Maaret al-Numan, about a mile (1.5 kilometer) from a Syrian military camp that troops and rebels have been fighting over for several days. Rami Abdul-Rahman, the director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The AP that government aircraft hit the village in the morning hours. The dead include a father and his two sons, aged 10 and 24, as well as a two other relatives, a woman and a young man, Abdul-Rahman said. His group relies on reports from a network of activists on the ground. Opposition fighters seized Maaret al-Numan, which lies along the main highway between Aleppo and Damascus, earlier this month, disrupting the ability of Assad's army to send supplies and reinforcements to the northwest where troops are bogged down in a stalemate with the rebels in Aleppo, Syria's largest city. At least 10 people were killed and 13 were injured when an artillery shell landed near a bakery in Aleppo, Abdul-Rahman said. Amateur video posted Tuesday showed stacks of pita bread on shelves, soaked in blood, and human remains scattered on the floor. Residents are also seen carrying injured people, some missing limbs, out of a shop that appears to be a bakery, loading them into civilian cars as a man shouts: 'May God punish you, Bashar ... He is bombing the people at the bakery. ' Syria restricts access to foreign reporters and the authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Three people have been arrested in connection with the killing of five people at a bar that was then set on fire, apparently to hide the crime. Denver police announced that the criminals were attempting to rob Fero’s Bar & Grill shortly before closing on Wednesday but they would not expand about how the incident escalated to murder. 'It appears that the motive of this crime was robbery, that they came in there, I don't want to say that it was a robbery gone bad, but it wound up being a robbery. The arson was set to try to cover up the crime scene,' police commander Ronald Saunier said. Scroll down for video . Horrific discovery: The bodies of a man and four woman were discovered at Fero's Bar & Grill in Denver after firefighters extinguished a fire at the bar early Wednesday morning . Joseph Hill, 27, and his brother, Lynell Hill, 24, and Dexter Lewis, 22, were all arrested in Denver starting late Wednesday night, police said. An officer on routine patrol around 2am Wednesday noticed a fire at the bar. Keeping details close: Denver police chief Robert White said that it was likely a robbery that escalated into multiple murder . Inside, firefighters found the bodies of one man and four women, including 63-year-old Young Fero, the bar owner. Investigators think the fire had been burning for about 15 to 20 minutes before the officer spotted it. Investigators were led to the trio because of some tips that came in after a news conference that afternoon. Detectives also had help from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Marshals Service's fugitive unit. Saunier said he believes the suspects had been to the bar before. The Denver medical examiner identified the other victims as Daria M. Pohl, 22; Kellene Fallon, 45; Ross Richter, 29; and Tereasa Beesley, 45. Pohl, Fallon and Beesley were from Denver. Richter's hometown wasn't released. The medical examiner didn't release . the cause of death. Police haven't said how they died and wouldn't . discuss whether any weapons were found. The suspects are being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, felony murder, aggravated robbery and arson. The . bar is in a strip mall about five miles south of downtown Denver, just . beyond the upscale Cherry Creek North shopping district. It is wedged among a check-cashing store, a tennis shop, a nail salon and a car repair business on busy Colorado Boulevard. Police said the fire did extensive damage, but little of that was visible from the outside. The bar attracted both regulars and people staying in nearby hotels, but neighbors said it didn't seem busy most days. Scene: The bar is in a strip mall about five miles south of downtown Denver, just beyond the upscale Cherry Creek North shopping district . Frequent patron Chris Brady said the bar's customers ranged from 'semi-homeless-looking people' to patrons in suits and ties. He was at the bar for a regular poker game held Tuesdays and left at about 11pm. 'There was nobody random or crazy in there,' Mr Brady said. Mr Brady said Ms Fero was known for cooking up beef dishes for customers at a moment's notice and usually would close the bar herself. She bid him goodnight Tuesday as he paid his tab. 'She said, “Thank you, sweetie. Have a good night,”' Brady said. 'I said, “You too,”’ Mike Spinale, one of Ms Fero's neighbors in Aurora, described her as 'really nice.' 'She didn't speak much, but I know she owned a bar and she worked all the time,' Mr Spinale said. 'She told me she did everything herself.' Danny Fero, who said he was Ms Fero's ex-husband, said he talked with Ms Fero about a month ago regarding a visit with their daughter, but she made no mention of any threats. He said he was shocked by the events at the bar he once co-owned with her. He told The Denver Post the two had met when he was working as a spokesman and photographer for the U.S. Army in Seoul, South Korea, and she was a clerk at the Korean Ministry of Agriculture. The two later married and had a daughter. Investigation: Authorities continue to look into the crime scene; they believe that the victims were killed before the blaze began . Grisly: Police said they believe the victims were killed before the fire was started, calling it an arson-homicide . Jerry Richardson, who maintained an ATM at the bar, described Ms Fero as 'feisty.' 'When she wanted that machine fixed, she would tell you about it,' Mr Richardson said. Few details were immediately known about the other victims. At an address listed for Ms Pohl, a man who answered the door declined to comment. Neighbors Bert and Suzanne Kasben expressed disbelief that the studious 22-year-old was killed. 'She was always working,' Bert said, adding he knew she held several waitressing jobs. Location: Fero's Bar & Grill is located in a shopping complex next to a check cashing business . The Kasbens said Ms Pohl was one of three sisters in a tight-knit family who often were seen walking their dog in a quiet cul-de-sac. Meanwhile, Ms Beesley was listed in state records as the owner of Maxim Lounge, another Denver bar. Frank Peluso, who works in an office building half a block from Fero's Bar & Grill, said he used to eat lunch at the establishment but hasn't been there in three years. It seemed to be declining and the owners have tried various things to attract more business, including offering karaoke, he said. 'It's one of those places that you wonder how it stays in business,' Mr Peluso said. Resident Matthew Neam said you can't see into the bar because the front windows are frosted. He said he and his friend used to joke about what might be inside. 'I've never gone in there,' Mr Neam said. 'It always looked kind of sketchy to me.'","Firefighters responding to early-morning blaze discovered five bodies in bar .

When she last hit these shores as a beautiful young starlet, the world was dancing to Greased Lightning. More than three decades later, Olivia Newton-John will return for her first UK concert tour since 1978. Now aged 64, the singer may no longer be able to pass herself off as John Travolta’s high-school sweetheart. But she has not lost the striking blonde hair or figure that once set male pulses racing. The Australian – who was born in England - was already 29 when she starred as 17-year-old Sandy Olsson in iconic musical Grease. Miss Newton-John will tour seven arenas nationwide from March 10 next year. With performances at London’s O2 Arena and the Royal Albert Hall she clearly expects even bigger audiences than last time.Her . last five-date tour of the country – part of 1978’s worldwide Totally . Hot tour – saw her perform in the Dominion Theatre in London and the . Apollo in Birmingham. Miss Newton-John recently denied rumours she became romantically involved with Travolta, now 58, when they acted in Grease. She said: ‘The truth was we were just good friends and used to hang around together, going for drinks or a meal. ‘But there was nothing in it. He still remains a friend today.’ Grease is the word: Olivia Newton-John, right, and left with John Travolta in the smash-hit film, has said she and her Grease co-star remain friends to this day . The star became famous as a singer years before the film became a box office hit. In a 40-year career, she has sold more than 100million albums and won four Grammy Awards. Between 1974 and 1976, she released a record of seven consecutive number one singles. Comeback: Miss Newton-John, seen above as Sandy with John Travolta as Danny in Grease, will perform at seven UK venues from March next year . Her best known hit, Physical, topped the charts for ten consecutive weeks in 1981. But Miss Newton-John’s musical career waned as she started to be compared with younger artists. She cancelled a 1992 comeback tour after being diagnosed with breast cancer. After having a partial mastectomy she concentrated on campaigning for better rainforest conservation, published cookery books and set up a health spa in Australia. Earlier this month, it was announced she will release a Christmas album with Travolta this year.

A Tibetan man died after setting himself on fire outside a Chinese government building yesterday afternoon. Dorjee Rinchen, 58, burned to death outside the Armed Forces department in Labrang, occupied Tibet, in the second fatal self-immolation protest this week. Security forces later clashed with mourners when they tried to bring his body back to his village in Gansu province, northwestern China. Protest: Dorjee Rinchen is seen burning on the street outside the Chinese Armed Forces department in Labrang, Chinese Tibet . Burning for freedom: Dorjee Rinchen falls over in pain in what was reported as the the second self-immolation protest in Labrang town this week . On Monday a 50-year-old man died in Labrang after setting himself alight at a nearby monastery, whilst shouting slogans for Dalai Lama’s return to the Himalayan region. Fighter: Dorjee Rinchen set himself on fire . Mr Rinchen’s death is the eight self-immolation death in ethnic Tibetan areas this month, London-based organisation Free Tibet said. The horrific protest action has increased in the last 18 months, with 58 incidents reported since March 2011. Chinese security forces tried to prevent local people from returning Mr Rinchen's body to his home in a nearby village, but after a brief confrontation, they were allowed to pass. When Tibetan monks from the Labrang Monastery, the scene of Monday’s self immolation, later attempted to visit Mr Rinchen’s home to pray, they were stopped by security and forced to pray by the roadside. Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden said: 'Dorjee Rinchen is the second Tibetan to set himself on fire in Labrang in two days. 'Like many Tibetans in the last eighteen months, he set himself on fire in front of a government building that symbolises China’s occupation. 'Tibetans are paying a terrible price for the Communist Party leadership’s determination to maintain stability.' Military control: Locals facing a standoff with the Chinese security forces, who tried to prevent them from returning Mr Rinchen's body to his village . Prayers prevented: Monks from nearby Labrang Monastery tried to visit Dorjee Rinchen's village to pray for him, but were stopped en-route by military personnel and made to pray by the roadside . Holy place: The Tibetan city of Labrang can be seen in the background of the Labrang monastery, which is one of the largest in Tibetan Buddhism . China maintains that Tibet has always been part . of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was . virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the . 1950s. Streets in Tibetan areas are lined with Chinese military personnel, and recent changes in education policies have seen almost all subjects in Tibetan schools now taught in Mandarin. Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan . spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment . and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the . Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high. The first self-immolation in . connection with the fight for an independent Tibet was reported in 2009. The protests, which sees individuals douse themselves in flammable liquid and set themselves alight, are reportedly inspired by the acts of Buddhist monks during the Vietnam war in the 1960s. Tibetans currently have no legal recourse to protest against Chinese rule, making traditional demonstrations impossible. Those who do face severe repercussions, with reports of physical assaults on Tibetans by Chinese security forces. One recent victim, a 17-year-old girl, was beaten by security guards and given a three year prison sentence for throwing up pieces of paper calling for the . freedom of Tibet on the street. The escalation of self-immolation since 2011 is a result of further Chinese government clampdowns on the Tibetan people. The Chinese response to protests has in turn fuelled further grievances, which have lead to the increase in self-immolations as the desperate Tibetans see no other way of having their voices heard, Free Tibet said. Apart from cases where Tibetans have set themselves alight in pairs, Free Tibet have no indications that the self-immolations are anything but individuals acting on their own accord. The controversial method of protest is much debated among Tibetans themselves. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.","Eight Tibetans dead as result of self-immolation this month .

Rikki Todd died four days after the attack when he was punched, kicked and had his head stamped on outside the Halfway House pub in Camperdown, Northumberland on December 23 last year. Newcastle Crown Court heard how Rikki was beaten allegedly by Danny Scott and Jack Walton, both 18, after he had teased one of the boys from their group, ruffled his hair and said he looked like the Canadian teen popstar. Accused of murder: Jack Walton (left) and Danny Scott, both 18, have been accused of murdering 19-year-old Rikki Todd (right) who was punched, kicked and had his head stamped on outside a pub last year . Graham Reeds QC, prosecuting said: ‘CCTV footage shows Rikki repeatedly ruffling the hair of a youngster who was part of the defendants’ group. ‘Rikki thought he had a passing resemblance to the Canadian singer Justin Bieber and, while drunk, thought it would be amusing to say so. ‘His attempts at humour irritated the boy and angered those who were with him.’ Scott and Walton, both of Seghill, Northumberland are on trial accused of murder. Both deny the charge. Mr Reeds told Newcastle Crown Court on Monday how witnesses saw one of the attackers, allegedly Scott, knock Rikki to the ground with a punch. Bieber taunt: Mr Todd joked that one of the boys looked like Canadian teen popstar Justin Bieber (pictured) and CCTV footage showed him ruffling the boy's hair, the court heard . Rikki’s head hit the pavement before he was kicked and stamped on. Mr Reeds said: ‘Two witnesses remember Scott appeared to be particularly pleased with what he had just done. ‘He saw Rikki was now lying motionless on the floor and he shouted ""I’ve knocked him out"" or something similar and he lifted his hands in celebration of what he had done. ‘Almost immediately after the punch struck him, others in the group continued the attack. ‘A boy saw Jack Walton aim a kick . which connected with the side of Rikki’s head and a witness says Scott . stamped on the back of his head. ‘Both were forceful and deliberate blows.’ Rikki, an apprentice heating . engineer from Allanville, Camperdown, had been drinking with friends at . the pub, playing pool from the late afternoon before a Christmas disco . later that night. After the . Bieber taunt, there was some minor pushing and shoving between the two . groups and they were all asked to leave the pub, the court heard. Drinking at the pub: Mr Todd was drinking with friends and playing pool at the Halfway House pub in Camperdown, Northumberland when the argument broke out. The boys were asked to leave and the attack on Mr Todd ensued outside . A confrontation started outside and Mr Reeds said at that point Rikki may have been looking for a fight. They argued over what happened and handshakes were offered but refused, making tempers grow more heated. Rikki squared up to one boy but ended up facing three or four teenagers, the court heard. Scott is alleged to have then pushed his way through the fracas and punched Rikki  to the ground where he was then allegedly kicked and stamped on. Mr Reeds said: ‘The evidence shows . the defendants were part of a group of three or four on one, and . Scott pushed past someone else and launched a surprise attack. ‘His immediate delight at the result of his actions speaks eloquently about what he intended to do. Accused: Scott and Walton denied the charge of murder at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) as the judge heard that Mr Todd squared up to one boy but ended up facing three or four teenagers . ‘The prosecution say both defendants were part of a joint enterprise in attacking Rikki Todd in retaliation for his behaviour.’ Rikki was taken to hospital with a fractured skull but died in hospital four days later on December 27 after suffering bleeding and swelling of the brain. A post-mortem examination showed his head injuries were consistent with a heavy fall followed by kicks or stamps, prosecutors said. He also suffered a broken collar bone, which was consistent it with having been stamped on. The trial continues.

When council officials visited residents at a tower block to reassure them about a temperamental lift, there was only one way to do it. Unfortunately, the show of faith by the six occupants - including a pregnant woman - backfired when they got stuck a couple of floors from the top. After much fruitless jabbing of buttons, an emergency call was put through to firefighters to come to their aid. Red-faced: The fire brigade had to be called when council officials got stuck in a lift on their way to convince residents of its safety . Now they'll listen: Residents at Grade II-listed Brooke House had made numerous complaints about the lift . The fire crew tried to wedge the lift open at Brooke House in Basildon, Essex, and shouted suggestions to those inside. Meanwhile, red-faced colleagues on the other side of the doors made frantic phone calls to check those imprisoned in the lift were all right. But the farce deepened when it suddenly sprang back into life, carrying the delegation down to the ground floor and then back up to the 12th floor. Are you alright in there? Colleagues made frantic phone calls to communicate with the trapped officials . At this point the doors opened, allowing the five council officials and an Essex Fire Service safety officer to scramble out after 30-minutes of drama. The group took to the stairs to complete their trip to see residents as part of a community safety event. The irony of the situation was not lost those living in the Grade II-listed building, who have made numerous complaints about the lift breaking down. Amber Cooper, 30, who lives there with her five-year-old son, Jamie, said: ‘We have put up with this all the time so it’s good for the council to see first-hand what it’s like. ‘It’s a total nightmare. My mum is disabled, so she struggles to get to me when the lifts aren’t working.’ Another resident, a woman in her 50s, added: ‘You have to laugh as you really couldn’t make it up. ‘At least now these people can see what we have to put up with.’ The firefighters tried to wedge the doors, but eventually the lift descended and they opened of their own accord . Basildon Council had invited residents of the tower block - which has 14 habitable floors lifted 40ft into the air on massive concrete stilts - to come to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss problems, including anti-social behaviour and the troublesome lifts. When no one showed up - probably because they were scared they wouldn’t make it - the officials decided to seek out residents themselves. The council yesterday said refurbishment work had now begun on the one of the lifts. The other one is due to be updated in February. A spokesman added: ‘Fortunately, what goes up must come down. The problem was quickly resolved and did not disrupt the main event. ‘However, it did give council officers first-hand evidence of how much the lift improvements are needed and how much it will benefit local residents of Brooke.","Residents at grade II-listed Brooke House in Basildon, Essex, had made complaints about lift breaking down .

Just a few minutes after they left the airport, the two plane enthusiasts got into difficulty – a fisherman who witnessed the crash from the ground said it was clear they were in trouble. ‘You could see he was in panic mode because the engine was just sputtering,’ the fisherman said. ‘When he hit [there was] a very loud noise.’ He told CBS News in the US that he was one of a number of people who frantically tried to help the two men by tying a rope to the plane in a bid to stop it from sinking in the Moriches Inlet in Long Island. And while he and a number of other men tried this, people in boats tried desperately to open the doors to the cockpit to rescue the men. Witnesses say the two men were unconscious as the frantic rescue attempts were under way around them. Unfortunately the plane continued to sink and by the time the emergency crews arrived, the 1946 Globe GC-1A had sunk to a depth of around 20ft. Susan Spadaro, owner of the nearby Spadaro Airport, told the New York Post that McLavin and 72-year-old Dr Andrew Messana were long-time friends and fliers. ‘The only reason they took the plane out was to help at the event,’ Miss Spadaro said. 'One passion in life': Cyril McLavin saved up for years to own a plane, and only bought the small aircraft during the summer . ‘We had them for lunch, and then they took off. A few minutes later, they were gone. They were great guys and loved to fly.’ She said that Mr McLavin had ‘saved for years’ to buy his plane and added: ‘He was so proud of it. He just bought it in July.’ Mr McLavin, who emigrated to the US in the Eighties from the village of Dysart, Co. Westmeath, was working as a building maintenance contractor, and living in the Queens area of New York. Former school friend Frank Tiernan told Midlands 103 radio yesterday that he remembers a true aviation enthusiast. He said: ‘From the time we were at school, Cyril had one passion in life and that was aviation and planes. ‘What makes me remember this is that when you look back at the Eighties, aviation was probably what space travel is now. ‘But for most of us it was cars and maybe country boys tractors that we were more into. ‘But once there was a plane around, Cyril knew by the noise of it what type it was and what was powering it.’ His aunt Mary McLavin said: ‘He absolutely loved flying so we take comfort in the fact that he died doing what he loved. ‘He died happy as he was in his beloved plane.’ The chairman of St Malachy’s GAA Westmeath added that it was ‘his passion in life’. Investigators are still unsure about what exactly caused the plane to come down on Saturday at around 3pm. The bodies were recovered late on Saturday night. Heavy tides are said to have hampered the rescue efforts as divers tried to get to the cockpit. Two teams of three divers spent more than five hours trying to get to the men but were unsuccessful. The crash is being investigated by the US’s National Transportation Safety Board. A resident of Mc McLavin’s home village of Dysart said last night: ‘I don’t remember much of him since he left, except that he did come back for two family funerals. ‘I know he left in the Eighties but other than the funerals, he hardly came back – as far as I know. The lads who knew him though said that he was big into his planes.’ Mr McLavin left St Mary’s Christian Brothers School in 1978 and then graduated from Athlone Regional College in 1979. He emigrated shortly after. Mr McLavin is survived by a younger brother, and it was not clear last night what the funeral arrangements will be.","Irishman Cyril McLavin, 51, died with his friend when 1946 plane crashed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:58 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:14 EST, 23 October 2012 . Officials at the White House and State Department were alerted two hours after attackers stormed the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 that an Islamic militant group had claimed credit for the assault, emails show. The emails, obtained by Reuters from government sources not connected with U.S. spy agencies or the State Department and who requested anonymity, specifically mention that the Libyan group called Ansar al-Sharia had asserted responsibility for the attacks. The brief missives also show how U.S. diplomats described the attack, even as it was still under way, to Washington. Deadly: Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi . The three emails in questions were sent on the afternoon of September 11 by the State Department's Operations Center to multiple government offices, including addresses at the White House, Pentagon, intelligence community and FBI. The first email, timed at 4.05pm Washington time - or 10.05pm Benghazi time, 20-30 minutes after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission allegedly began - carried the subject line ‘U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack’ and the notation ‘SBU,’ meaning ‘Sensitive But Unclassified.’ The text said the State Department's regional security office had reported that the diplomatic mission in Benghazi was ‘under attack. Embassy in Tripoli reports approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well.’ The message continued: ‘Ambassador Stevens, who is currently in Benghazi, and four ... personnel are in the compound safe haven. The 17th of February militia is providing security support.’ First missive: The first email was sent by the diplomatic mission in Benghazi 20-30 minutes after the attack on the complex began . False hope: A second email stated that the attack on the mission had stopped and the compound had been cleared . Attackers named: A third message stated that a group called Ansar al-Sharia ha claimed responsibility on the attack on Facebook and Twitter . At 4.54pm Washington time, a second email was fired off, headed ‘Update 1: U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi’ said that the Embassy in Tripoli had reported that ‘the firing at the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi had stopped and the compound had been cleared.’ It said a ‘response team’ was at the site attempting to locate missing personnel. A third email, also marked SBU and sent at 6.07pm, carried the subject line: ‘Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack.’ Official version: President Obama said during an interview on '60 Minutes' that he didn't believe mob violence alone was responsible for the deadly assault on the embassy . The message reported: ‘Embassy Tripoli reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and has called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.’ While some information identifying recipients of this message was redacted from copies of the messages obtained by Reuters, a government source said that one of the addresses to which the message was sent was the White House Situation Room, the president's secure command post. Other addressees included intelligence and military units as well as one used by the FBI command center, the source said. It was not known what other messages were received by agencies in Washington from Libya that day about who might have been behind the attacks. Intelligence experts caution that initial reports from the scene of any attack or disaster are often inaccurate. U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Benghazi assault, which President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials ultimately acknowledged was a ‘terrorist’ attack carried out by militants with suspected links to al Qaeda affiliates or sympathizers. Administration spokesmen, including White House spokesman Jay Carney, citing an unclassified assessment prepared by the CIA, maintained for days that the attacks likely were a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim film. While officials did mention the possible involvement of ‘extremists,’ they did not lay blame on any specific militant groups or possible links to al Qaeda or its affiliates until intelligence officials publicly alleged that on September 28. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack on a building . which has now been revealed to be a CIA base . There were indications that extremists with possible al Qaeda connections were involved, but also evidence that the attacks could have erupted spontaneously, they said, adding that government experts wanted to be cautious about pointing fingers prematurely. U.S. intelligence officials have emphasized since shortly after the attack that early intelligence reporting about the attack was mixed. Spokesmen for the White House and State Department had no immediate response to requests for comments on the emails. By the morning of September 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, Reuters reported that there were indications that members of both Ansar al-Sharia, a militia based in the Benghazi area, and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African affiliate of al Qaeda's faltering central command, may have been involved in organizing the attacks. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . Fourteen hours after the attack, President Obama sat down with Steve Kroft of ‘60 Minutes’ for an interview and said he did not believe it was simply due to mob violence, CBS reported. ‘You're right that this is not a situation that was -- exactly the same as what happened in Egypt and my suspicion is that there are folks involved in this who were looking to target Americans from the start,’ Obama said. One U.S. intelligence official said that during the first classified briefing about Benghazi given to members of Congress, officials 'carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information, relying on the best analysis available at the time.' Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . The official added, however, that the initial analysis of the attack that was presented to legislators was mixed. ‘Briefers said extremists were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous, there may have been a variety of motivating factors, and possible links to groups such as (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Ansar al-Sharia) were being looked at closely,’ the official said.","Three emails were sent from Benghazi to White House, State Department, Pentagon, FBI and other offices .

A federal appeals court has blocked the scheduled execution of a mass killer convicted of eight slayings that shocked South Florida in the 1970s. The decision by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals came during a flurry of legal decisions over claims that 64-year-old John Errol Ferguson suffers from mental illness so severe he cannot be executed. Ferguson, a paranoid schizophrenic with delusions that he's the 'prince of God,' had faced a planned lethal injection at 6 pm yesterday in Florida's death chamber. Life behind bars: John Errol Ferguson, 64, has been on Death Row for 34 years for killing eight people in the 1970s. He was due to be put to death on Tuesday before receiving a late stay of execution . The U.S. Supreme . Court quickly upheld the stay of execution. Ferguson has spent more than three . decades on death row for eight brutal killings, including those of a . teenage couple, in 1977 and 1978. The Supreme Court had initially rejected an emergency appeal by Ferguson earlier on Tuesday - as did the 11th Circuit - before making its later ruling. The state of Florida failed in its bid to overturn the decision. The appeals court set a schedule for motions that will likely delay the execution until at least the first week of November, if not longer. Victim: He raped and shot Belinda Worley, 17, as she went for ice cream . with her boyfriend in January 1978. Her boyfriend was also shot dead . Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's . office argued in court papers that the late ruling 'makes a mockery of . the state's compelling interest in finality' in Ferguson's case. He has . been on death row for 34 years. In Washington, the nation's high . court noted that Chief Justice John Roberts took no part in the case. There was no further explanation. Ferguson was convicted of shooting . eight bound and blindfolded people execution-style in South Florida in . 1977, then killing a teenage couple months later in 1978 after they left . a church event planning to get some ice cream. He has previously been ruled mentally . competent to be executed, and over recent days federal judges in . Florida, Georgia and Washington have wrestled with his appeals over that . issue. The execution was scheduled after the . Florida Supreme Court this month upheld a lower court ruling based on . testimony by a panel of psychiatrists appointed by Governor Rick Scott. The state justices wrote that 'Ferguson understands what is taking place and why.' The latest ruling from the federal . appeals court said it would explore whether the Florida Supreme Court's . decision was an 'unreasonable determination of the facts' based on . Ferguson's documented history of mental illness. His lawyers have argued that Ferguson . lacks rational understanding, because he suffers from delusions that . he is the 'prince of God' and that God is preparing him to return to . Earth after his execution to save the United States from a communist . plot. Ferguson was convicted of two sets of murders and is suspected in a third. In 1977, he and two accomplices . fatally shot six people at a Carol City home, then the worst mass . slaying in Miami-Dade County history. Even more shocking was Ferguson's . murder of a teenage couple who had left a church event in Hialeah in . 1978 and never met up with friends they planned to meet for ice cream. Legal wrangling: Ferguson has been granted a stay of execution following a late court ruling . John Errol Ferguson was sentenced to death for eight killings in 1977 and 1978, although some investigators believe he killed even more. May 1977: An elderly couple were found beaten, tied up and shot dead in their motel room. The gun was used in Ferguson's later crimes but he was not charged as there was no other corroborating evidence. July 1977: With three others, Ferguson broke into a house and tied up eight people and shot them in the head. Livingstone Stocker, 33, Michael Miller, 24, Henry Clayton, 35, John Holmes, 26, Gilbert Williams, 37, and Charles Cesar Stinson, 35, all died. Two survived: Johnnie Hall, 45, and Margaret Wooden, 24. He was convicted of the killings. October 1977: Posing as a police officer, he shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery. They survived. January 1978: Shot and killed Brian Glenfeldt, 17, on his way to get ice cream with his girlfriend, Belinda Worley. Belinda, 17, was raped and also shot. He was convicted of the killings. In the 1977 case, Ferguson pretended . to be an electric utility worker to gain access to the Carol City house, . which police said was a local hangout for marijuana dealers whom the . bandits wanted to rob of drugs and cash. Former Miami-Dade prosecutor David . Waksman said most of the victims were friends who happened to drop by . the house while Ferguson and the other men were there. The victims were blindfolded and . bound, but the encounter turned violent after a mask worn by one of . Ferguson's gang fell off and his face was spotted by a victim. The decision was made to kill all . eight people in the house, said Waksman, now a legal adviser to a local . police department. They were shot one by one. Two managed to survive. Almost six months later, passers-by . spotted the bodies of Brian Glenfeldt and Belinda Worley, both 17, who . had been fatally shot. Worley also had been raped. Her jewelry was . missing along with cash from Glenfeldt's wallet. Trial testimony showed the couple had . stopped at a romantic 'lovers' lane' when they were approached by . Ferguson, dressed as a police officer. Ferguson shot Glenfeldt in the . car and Worley tried to flee but was caught. The randomness of the crime and the . youth of the two victims stunned many in Miami, then a slower-paced . place that was yet to become the infamous 'cocaine cowboys' murder . capital of the 1980s. Ferguson confessed to killing 'the two kids' after he was arrested in April 1978 for the earlier murders, court records show. Worley's mother, Edna Worley, waited . for decades for Ferguson's execution and often said that 'if she could, . she would pull the switch,' her son Michael . Worley, told The Miami Herald. Edna Worley died in May, according to her son. He said: 'She planned on attending the execution. She wanted to be there for her daughter.' Ferguson was sentenced to die in both . cases; he unsuccessfully used the insanity defence in the trial over . the teenagers' murders. Fate: Ferguson was due to be put death in Florida State Prison by lethal injection at 6pm yesterday . Waksman said the gun he used was also . traced to the killings of an elderly couple slain outside a Miami . motel, but he was never charged with that crime because there was no . other corroborating evidence. The two accomplices in the 1977 . slayings, Beauford White and Marvin Francois, were found guilty in . separate murder trials and were executed in the 1980s. A third man, who stayed in the car . the entire time, pleaded guilty to lesser charges and testified against . Ferguson and the other two. It has been 34 years since Ferguson . was first sentenced to die. That is longer than many on death row but by . no means the record in Florida. Corrections Department records show . several inmates have been on death row since the early 1970s and one . first got there in 1967.","John Errol Ferguson was convicted of killing 8 people in 1970s murder spree .

An unfolding murder that started in Tennessee and traces back to more deaths in Alabama now has police trying to explain how three women, an 18-month-old boy, the man wanted for questioning and his friend all ended up dead. The discovery of six bodies in two states Monday and Tuesday presents a puzzling case for authorities as they began searching for clues to confirm that the deaths were somehow linked. Three women and an 18-month-old boy were killed in Tennessee, about a mile away from the state line. An infant and toddler are spared inside the home. Children: The three-year-old boy (left) called his relatives saying that he could not wake anyone in his house up, including his 18-month-old brother Rico Ragland (right) Victim: They were the sons of Chabreya Campbell (in both above), who was six-months pregnant when she was killed in her home and police wanted to speak to her ex in connection to the murders . A man wanted for questioning in the homicides is found dead in the Alabama woods near the Tennessee border, while one of his presumed acquaintances is found shot to death. The mystery began Monday when a 3-year-old boy called relatives from a house outside Fayetteville saying ‘I can’t wake them up’. Third woman found: Amber McCaulley was also found dead and is thought to be related to this case . Family members arriving at the house, about 100 miles south of Nashville, Tennessee, found all the doors and windows locked, but were able to coach the child into opening a garage door. When they reached inside to pull him out, they saw blood and called police. When authorities got there, they found the lifeless bodies of 22-year-old Chabreya Campbell, and her 18-month-old son, Rico Ragland. Campbell was six months pregnant. The body of 21-year-old Amber McCaulley of Huntsville, Alabama, was also inside the home. 'I cannot imagine. I cannot imagine. ... There's no reason for anyone to have done something like this,' the surviving 3-year-old’s godmother, Constance Winston said. At the start of the investigation, police wanted to speak to the father of the 3-year-old survivor, named Warren Vincent Crutcher. They released Crutcher’s photo, name and car description to the public in hopes of finding him, saying that he was considered to be armed and dangerous. Questionable: Warren Vincent Crutcher (left) was the father of the 3-year-old survivor, and both he and his acquaintance Jeffrey Pope (right) were found dead as well in a different location . Emotional: Friends and relatives were visibly distraught at the scene, including one woman who collapsed . A short while later, Crutcher was found dead in the Alabama woods, just across the Tennessee state line, with no further explanation except to say that his death did not look like a suicide. Jeffrey Pope, who was identified by local news media as an acquaintance of Crutcher, was fatally shot in Huntsville and was found by utility crews in the woods, police said. Authorities did not confirm the connection between the two men, but they are investigating whether Pope's death could be linked to the other five. Hours later, the body of 21-year-old Jessica Brown was found in her home in Fayetteville but her 2-month-old child was found unharmed. Brown’s connection- if any- to the case is unknown. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services had no prior involvement with Campbell, Crutcher or their children, spokeswoman Molly Sudderth said Tuesday. She said the slayings would lead DCS to open a case and, if needed, take the 3-year-old into state custody until permanent arrangements could be made for him. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

As the Tourette's-like illness continues to plague Le Roy school and baffle health experts, questions are now arising around the cleanup of a 40-year-old . chemical spill that contaminated some of the local water supply. Around 30,000 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE), an industrial solvent that's hazardous in high . doses and can affect the nervous system, were dumped into the . ground during a train crash in 1970 on the outskirts of Le Roy. The EPA declared the area a Superfund site in 1999 after the TCE soaked into the ground and spread into a plume under part of Le Roy. Scroll down for video . Archive pictures: It has been suggested that it was chemicals leaked from a 1940 train crash that is causing the Tourette's like disease . Superfund site: The site of the 1970 train crash has a danger sign warning the public not to enter . Hazardous waste: The EPA declared the area a Superfund site in 1999 after the TCE soaked into the ground and spread into a plume under part of Le Roy . The site is now in a state of disrepair and neglect, according to PIX 11 News, with more than 200 drums of hazardous waste rusting outdoors, some of which had holes in them allowing the contents to leak out. The . EPA admitted to the station they didn't know what was in all of the barrels and said about one hundred of them have been there since the 1990s. A spokesman said: 'The barrels contain dirt and . rock from when wells were dug to monitor ground water at the site. Most of these drums have been tested . and contain material that is not considered hazardous and we are . gathering more information about the balance. 'EPA is taking steps to get these drums . removed from the site as soon as possible.' A contractor confirmed to the station that the rock and dirt in the drums did contain TCE. Danger: Hundreds of barrels containing potentially hazardous material are still at the site, most of which are rusty and leaking their contents . Leak: Around 30,000 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE) was dumped into the ground during a train crash in 1970 on the outskirts of Le Roy . Cause?: The site was declared a Superfund site and the EPA admitted they do not know what is in the barrels still present in the area . 'To be safe, it's put in drums and . carted away and there's a plant that burns it,' he said. 'But it's like everything else. They forget about it until the . cameras show up and it's like, ""Oh, we better get rid of the damn . things"".' Doctors and teachers at the school deny that the disorder affecting 19 girls and one adult have anything to do with the spill. Le Roy historian Irene Walters said she remembers the spill and said the chemicals contaminated all the wells in the area and several of her friends died from cancer. Doctors who have treated or tested . the girls in Le Roy believe they are suffering from conversion . disorder, or the twitching symptoms are possibly related to an . infection. Lori Brownell, 16, posted a video on YouTube showing the Tourettes-like . symptoms she has suffered since August. She is one of 15 at LeRoy High . School in New York State who have developed the mystery condition . More recently, Facebook and YouTube were being blamed for the mystery illness. Doctors said that symptoms are being . ‘reinforced and magnified’ because victims of the bizarre condition are . uploading videos of themselves onto social networking sites to appeal . for help. They argue that when other people in . the town of LeRoy view the videos, they are unconsciously mimicking what . they see and spreading it around. The true cause of the illness is still . a mystery and there no formal suggestion that Facebook or any of the . other social networking websites are to blame. But David Lichter, professor of . neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has treated several of the . patients, said he might now understand how it has affected so many . people. He told MSNBC: ‘It's remarkable to see . how one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts . something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with . known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements. ‘This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’ In total 19 patients have come forward . with Tourette’s like symptoms since last Fall, which include . uncontrollable facial and body twitching. Trying to understand: Thera Sanchez, 17, has had . the mysterious symptoms for months and all of the treatments he has . received have not helped to clarify any options for her or her family . They include 14 girls aged between 13 . and 18 and this week the first adult victim, 36-year-old nurse . practitioner Marge Fitzsimmons. Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich. She has suggested that a chemical . spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls’ school may be the cause. Researchers have also come up with a . string of theories and believe teenagers may have been struck down by . paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, or PANS, which is a . kind of OCD linked to strep throat. Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores. Mystery: Fifteen Le Roy High School students reported a mysterious outbreak of spasms, tics and seizures which may be caused by a brain infection . Some doctors have also suggested it . could be a mass psychogenic illness which can be triggered by stress and . is spread from unconscious mimicry of one another. Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, chief of . neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in Buffalo, said: ‘When one . has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals . with similar symptoms. ‘That's what's going on with these . girls. They are in a segregated small rural town in New York state. They . are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of symptoms takes control.’ During an angry meeting on Saturday . parents berated LeRoy schools officials and asked why the soil around . natural gas well which had been dug on school ground had not been tested . for contamination. Demanding explanations: Parents gathered for a meeting with school administrators to determine what was being done to ensure the safety of students near the 1970 chemical spill . Patrick Frauley (left) and Beth Miller (right, whose daughter is one of the ill teens, spoke at the meeting . 'This could take years! What are you doing to protect my kid? What are you doing to protect these peoples kids?' said parent Patrick Frauley. Many of the parents of the sick teens attended the meeting, but none of the teens themselves were present. 'I'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind, I just want my daughter to get better,' said Beth Miller. Adding to the concern was that the . wells were drilled using the controversial hydraulic fracturing method, . also known as ‘fracking’. Dr Greg Young of the New York State . Department of Health had earlier explained that tests had ruled out . environmental factors as the cause of the disease. He also claimed that genetics, antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame. WATCH VIDEO HERE .

Twenty-five people bought tickets to watch animated film Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted at Cineworld, in the Cornerhouse, Nottingham. But as parents and children settled down to watch the PG-rated film, staff accidently started showing 15-rated Paranormal Activity 4 instead. Natasha Lewis, 32, and her eight-year-old son, Dylan Lewis-Gray, were among the shocked cinema-goers. Miss Lewis, 32, of Bulwell, Nottingham, said: 'I’m disgusted about it. Dylan doesn’t want to set foot in there again. 'There were parents and kids in there, including some children who were younger than Dylan. 'We then saw the opening scenes and everyone started to take the kids out. We had to get the kids out fast as some were crying. Everyone was upset. 'Dylan has not liked going to the cinema before but I thought we’d try it out. He doesn’t want to go back.' A spokeswoman for Cineworld said: 'We have investigated the incident and can confirm that this was a technical error with the projector and apologise sincerely to the families. 'All customers who were affected by the incident were offered refunds and complimentary tickets. 'We also invited customers to watch the screening of Madagascar 3 half an hour later. 'We take matters such as this very seriously and are currently working with technicians to ensure this does not happen again.' What do you think?

Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, will personally assess all aid spending of more than £1m. The ministry has faced criticism about deals with contractors . Justine Greening is to examine every aid contract worth more than £1million in a bid to tackle her ministry’s reputation for waste. She said she was determined to improve financial controls ahead of another massive budget increase at the Department for International Development. Her intervention will mean a major tightening of the rules – her predecessor Andrew Mitchell took personal control only when contracts cost more than £40million. Deals worth less were handled by junior ministers or even officials. Miss Greening is also summoning the department’s major contractors for talks on cutting costs. DfID has faced criticism over its reliance on private sector consultants – dubbed poverty barons  – who were paid almost £500million last year. 'Suppliers must show they’re not just in it for the money,’ said a Whitehall source. 'In the next few weeks Justine will get all our top suppliers in for face-to-face meetings to explain that the department will be looking for better value for money in new contracts. 'If they can’t deliver better value, we’ll use suppliers who do.' Miss Greening is also insisting on personally signing off IT and buildings deals worth more than £500,000. She was appointed International Development Secretary last month at a time of renewed criticism of the Government’s plans to pour billions more into foreign aid in the coming years. A string of peers on all sides used a Lords debate yesterday to urge ministers to drop the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said it was bizarre that the aid budget was 'roaring ahead' when other spending programmes were being cut back. He said it was 'pathetic' that the Government’s main argument for imposing the target was that all three parties had pledged to at the last election. 'In my rather long political experience when all three political parties are agreed on a policy it is nearly always mistaken – as it is in this case,' he added. Labour peer Lord Hollick said the extra £4billion to be spent on aid spending could be spent on a 2p cut in income tax to help the economy . Another Tory ex-minister, Lord MacGregor, said it was wrong to judge a department 'by whether it pushes money out of the door rather than whether it is properly spent'. He called for an end to the £285million-a-year aid programme to India, saying it risked creating a ‘perverse incentive to the Indian government to use less of their own resources to relieve poverty’. Aid spending is due to increase from £8billion a year to £12billion in order to hit the Government’s 0.7 per cent target. Labour peer Lord Hollick said the extra money should be used instead to fund a 2p cut in income tax to 'reduce the burden of recession on the hard-working squeezed middle and stimulate growth'. Lord Boateng said although he supported the idea of increasing aid he had concerns about DfID’s capacity to spend the money effectively. The former Labour cabinet minister said the department 'had more money at its disposal than it could deal with'. Responding for the Government, Baroness Northover rejected the call for ministers to drop the commitment on aid spending, insisting it was both in the interests of Britain and recipient countries. Lady Northover denied achieving the pledge would prioritise the amount of aid over results achieved.","Justine Greening to curb waste at Department for International Development .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:47 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:48 EST, 23 October 2012 . The warden of the prison where Ohio puts inmates to death says the state's execution table can easily hold a condemned 480-pound inmate who has argued he is so big it might collapse. The table was tested by placing a prison employee who weighs the same amount as inmate Ronald Post on it as well as extra weights and it remained standing. Post argues his weight, vein access, scar tissue, depression and other medical problems raise the likelihood his executioners would encounter severe problems. 'The execution table held firmly and showed no signs of instability,' wrote Donald Morgan, warden at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, in a court filing. Big problem: Death row inmate Ronald Post, 53, who weights 480lbs with a scheduled date for execution set for January of 2013 claims he's too big to be easily and humanely killed . Judging by the two tests, Mr Morgan . said he is confident the table 'can and will accommodate the weight of . inmate Post for his scheduled execution.' There is also the question of how much . Post actually weighs, since his lawyers reported that he weighs 480 . pounds but the state reports that he weighed 396 pounds just last week. Post, 53, is scheduled to die January 16 for the 1983 shooting death of Helen Vantz in Elyria. The victim’s son, Bill Vantz, has called Post's arguments 'laughable.' Post's attorneys also want more time . to pursue arguments that claims of a full confession by the inmate to . several people have been falsely exaggerated. 'Indeed, given his unique physical and . medical condition, there is a substantial risk that any attempt to . execute him will result in serious physical and psychological pain to . him, as well as an execution involving a torturous and lingering death,' a court filing said last month. Breakable: A gurney is seen at a Virginia Correctional Facility, similar to one in Ohio which Posts claims he could also break if placed on due to his size . Mr Morgan said he successfully tested . the strength of the table with an employee who weighed 420 pounds, and . later by piling 540 pounds of weight on the table. The table straps . easily fit around the employee, Morgan said. The state is also questioning the . validity of arguments in favor of sparing Post made by a doctor who did . not examine him. The state says Post hasn't presented evidence he can't . be put to death 'in a humane and dignified manner.' Ohio is also challenging Post's . arguments on technical grounds, saying he has exhausted his claims . before federal courts and shouldn't be allowed to make this new . argument. Ohio executes inmates with a single dose of pentobarbital, usually injected through the arms. Escaped death: In 1994 Mitchell Rupe, who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death, had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation . Arguments: Richard Cooey, who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008, argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible . Medical personnel have had a hard time . inserting IVs into Post's arms, according to a court filing. Four years . ago, an Ohio State University medical center nurse needed three . attempts to insert an IV into his left arm, the lawyers wrote. Post has tried losing weight, but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise, according to his court filing. Post's request for gastric bypass . surgery has been denied, he has been encouraged not to walk because he's . at risk for falling, and severe depression has contributed to his . inability to limit how much he eats, his filing said. While at the Mansfield Correctional . Institution, Post 'used that prison's exercise bike until it broke under . his weight,' according to the filing.","Death row inmate Ronald Post claims his weight, vein access and scar tissue would prevent a humane execution .
