Athletes will be required to volunteer in schools or sports clubs across the country to encourage and mentor children and ‘inspire the Olympics athletes of the future’. The programme will provide about 5,000 days of volunteering support. Inspire future athletes: Olympic athletes wishing to compete in the 2016 Olympic Games will have to do five days of volunteering if they get National Lottery funding . It will be unveiled by Maria Miller at the Conservative Party Conference today in her ﬁrst major speech since being promoted to Culture Secretary last month. She will say: ‘In schools and clubs across the UK our Olympic athletes will be dedicated to helping the next generation shine as they themselves have shone this summer. Driving up sport participation: Culture Secretary Maria Miller will unveil the programme at the Conservative Party Conference today . The Department for Culture, Media and . Sport last night confirmed the new programme, which they said is aimed . at ‘driving up sports participation in schools’. A spokesman for the department said: ‘It . is about mentoring and coaching young people and using the success and . popularity of the Games, and big names of the athletes, to drive up . sports participation and inspire future stars. ‘We want to inspire the next generation of athletes,’ he added. The volunteering drive is expected to be aimed at children at sixth form age who are most likely drop out of sports activities and lose interest in it. The Prime Minister announced in August that UK Sport will receive £500m over the next four years to maintain funding for Olympic sports at same level before the 2016 Games as during the runup to London. Mr Cameron said: ‘There’s a direct link between elite success and participation in sport. I want one of the legacies of these Games to be our athletes triumphing in Rio in 2016, and in future Olympic Games. Guaranteeing this funding will help ensure that happens.’ In her speech, Mrs Miller is also expected to thank the 70,000 Olympic volunteers from this year, who are said to have contributed eight million hours of unpaid work behind the scenes. London 2012 Chairman Lord Coe said the volunteers had cultivated one of the country’s biggest fan clubs, and his reference to them at the Paralympic closing ceremony drew one of the most sustained ovations of the night.

A schoolboy who murdered a man after being told to behave played the role of a killer in a film aimed at getting his life back on the rails. Ochaine Williams, now 16, fatally stabbed aspiring architect Steven Grisales after he dared to tell him to stop throwing conkers. Then aged just 15, the notorious gang member with an appalling criminal record embarked on a sophisticated cover-up in a bid to avoid justice. Scroll down for video . 'Mindless violence': Ochaine Williams, left, now 16, has been named for the first time as the killer of 21-year-old aspiring architect Steven Grisales, right . Now it can be revealed he appeared in a chilling amateur film production dreamt up by counsellors at Park View Academy in Tottenham, North London. Williams played the role of a bullied pupil whose mobile phone is stolen by robbers who later taunt him and force him to tie their shoelaces. In the short piece, filmed under the banner ‘Disaffected Films’, a friend tells the weeping schoolboy ‘don’t do anything stupid, I’m telling you his day will come.’ But baby-faced Williams lies in wait for his bullies and stabs one to death off-screen. A girl who finds the body screams: ‘It’s too late he’s not breathing.’ Amateur film: Williams can be seen wearing a white jacket in the amateur production, in which he plays a bullied pupil who turns on his tormentor . Williams' character weeps after being taunted by bullies in the chilling film . The details can be reported for the first time after the Court of Appeal lifted an order banning the identification of Williams after an application by the Daily Mail. Lady Justice Hallett said the public had a right to know who was responsible for the appalling murder in August last year. She increased Williams’ sentence to 12 years after finding the 10-and-a-half year term he was given at the Old Bailey in June was ‘unduly lenient’. The senior judge said: ‘This was yet another example of mindless violence on the streets of London.‘Mr Grisales, an innocent young man, has died simply because he dared to stand up to bullies. ‘Not satisfied with having strength in numbers and the ability to overpower Mr Grisales without resorting to a weapon, the defendant sought to take his revenge. ‘He may not have taken the knife with him but he certainly knew where to find it in a flash. He took it and deliberately thrust it into Mr Grisales’ chest. ‘He was no stranger to handling knives and far from expressing remorse it seems he was part to an elaborate cover-up which showed a degree of sophistication in criminal ways beyond his 15 years.’ Mr Grisales, 21, had been shopping for his grandmother and was on his way to Silver Street station in Edmonton, North London, when he was attacked in College Close. He had challenged a small gang of youths who were throwing conkers in their spiky husks at him. Williams denied being the killer, but was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey earlier this year. The victim's parents Andreas and Jasmid Grisales with Detective Richard Beadle outside The Old Bailey after their son's killer was sentenced in June . Williams' family and friends protested outside The Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of stabbing Steven Grisales to death . The thug was a member of a notorious street gang, the 'Northumberland Park Killers' or ‘NPK’ and had a long record for violent street robberies, battery and burglary. Following his arrest, the teen boasted of his affiliation to the street gang by writing on his prison mattress: 'NPK. Riding the Big Bird. Innocent on Remand.' Just a month before the murder, he was handed a youth rehabilitation order for a house burglary and ordered to wear an electronic tag. He was caught carrying a knife at school and police were called to his home when he threatened his mother with a kitchen knife after she challenging him for skipping school. Yet despite flouting his curfew conditions up to 20 times, the teenage gangster was not locked up. The court heard the victim was a man of ‘impeccable character and great promise’ who left his family devastated at the ‘needless loss of their son’. A barrister representing the Attorney General said the original sentence failed adequately to reflect the gravity of the offence and ‘public concern over offences of this nature’. Lady Justice Hallett apologised to Mr Grisales’ family that she could not impose a longer sentence. She said: ‘In a split second of anger he denied Mr Grisales that life. ‘We understand that it may seem to his family that the result is unfair. However, we hope that they understand we are bound by a sentencing regime laid down by the law.’ Speaking after the case yesterday, Mr Grisales’ father Andreas said: ‘The sentence still only represents a small fraction of the life denied to Steven.’ Mr Grisales had returned to Britain from Argentina to take up a scholarship to study architecture at Westminster University. His organ donations following his death helped to save the lives of three women.

Japan's Toyota Motor Corp announced a massive recall today to fix malfunctioning power window switches which it says will affect 7.43million vehicles worldwide in the biggest single recall since 1996. The move comes as Japan's biggest automaker tries to rebuild trust after a series of recalls between 2009 and 2011 in which it pulled back around 10 million vehicles and as it struggles with plummeting Chinese sales as a result of a Sino-Japanese territorial dispute. The recall will include 2.47million . vehicles in the United States as well as 1.40million vehicles in China . and 1.39million vehicles in Europe - 138,000 of which are in the UK. PR nightmare: Former president of Toyota Motor Corp, Katsuaki Watanabe, pictured in 2006 unveiling a new Corolla, one of the models affected by today's recall of more than 7.4million cars worldwide . Damage limitation: The recall will include some models of the Yaris (above) because of malfunctioning power window switches . Toyota's main rivals in the U.S. include Ford and General Motors Co, while in China they include Volkswagen AG, Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd, and in Europe Hyundai and Nissan. The recall will include some Yaris and Corolla models on which the power window switches can be repaired in about 40 minutes, the company said. 'The process to repair (the power window switch) is not an extensive one,' spokeswoman Monika Saito said, adding that it would involve putting heat-resistant lubricant on the switches or exchanging them. Toyota declined to disclose how much the recall would cost or how it might affect its earnings. Production glitch: Models of the Toyota Camry are lined up in the company's factory in Georgetown, Kentucky in 2006. The Camry is also among the vehicles affected . Massive headache: In Japan, Toyota is recalling about 459,300 vehicles, including the Vitz, produced between 2006 and 2008.

The vehicles recalled outside Japan include certain models of the Yaris, Vios, Corolla, Matrix, Auris, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia, xB and xD produced between 2005 and 2010. The first time the problem was reported was in September 2008 in the United States, Saito said. Could emit smoke: Engineers make final checks to vehicles at a plant in Ohira village, northern Japan. The company says it should only take 40 minutes to fix the error with the window switches . No accidents, injuries or deaths have . been reported as a result of the problem, though there is a possibility . that the malfunctioning switches could emit smoke, she said. The move comes a day after Toyota reported that its sales fell 48.9 percent year-on-year in China in September. Japanese car brands have suffered as a result of an outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment in China in response to a territorial dispute between the two countries.

Workers at Idaho's largest dairy operation, which indirectly supplies food giants Kraft and Wendy's have been charged with animal cruelty after shocking undercover footage revealed terrible abuse. The three former staff members at Bettencourt Dairies' Dry Creek Dairy in Hansen were seen beating cows with a pink cane as the animals slipped and slid on the wet concrete floor; kicking, shoving and stomping on cows that have fallen between the metal bars in the milking stalls; and a cow being dragged out of the barn by a chain around her neck as she lies prone on the concrete floor. Luis Bettencourt, the owner of the dairy, said that when the Idaho Department of Agriculture told him about the video and allegations in August, he was 'sick about it.' Bettencourt's dairy operation is the largest in Idaho, with 13 facilities and about 60,000 milk cows. Scroll Down for Video (Warning - Graphic Content) A worker at Bettencourt Dairies' Dry Creek Dairy in Hansen kicks out at a cow in restraints . Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said he filed misdemeanor animal cruelty charges against Jesus Garza, Jose Acensio and Javier Victor Rojas Loayza in late August after an investigation that was prompted by the video. If convicted, the men face fines of up to $5,000 each and jail time on a first offense. 'We don't tolerate animal abuse. That's a big issue for us,' Bettencourt said. 'I love my animals and I've been in the dairy business since I was a kid. Animal care is a number one issue in our facilities.' Bettencourt said officials with the Idaho Department of Agriculture showed him the footage in August and he fired the five workers seen in the video the next day. In the weeks since, he said he's installed video cameras throughout his facilities and hired an additional supervisor. 'And we also showed the video to all the rest of the employees in our dairies, all 500 employees, and they had to sign a deal that said they understand that there's zero tolerance for animal abuse in our dairies,' he said. Another staff member at Dry Creek Dairy kicks out at at suspended cow who was being prepared for milking . Sad: One staff member punches a cow they are attempting to milk in the face - while another rams a bar down on a cows head . A cow is struck with a pink metal bar after the cow refuses to do what he wants . We've been in business 30 years and we've never had this happen before. We're all devastated here.' Nathan Runkle, the executive director of Mercy for Animals, said those steps amount to 'too little too late.' He hopes the video will convince Kraft Foods, Burger King and the Wendy's fast food chain's — companies which Runkle says uses milk from Bettencourt Dairy — to stop using milk from the Idaho company and send a 'clear message to the industry that animal abuse will not be tolerated.' 'We believe this abuse is ongoing and was allowed to flourish, unchecked, until Mercy for Animal sent a hidden camera in,' Runkle said. 'There are no meaningful watchdogs inside a factory farm. ... Across the country this is actually our fourth dairy industry investigation that we've done and every single one of those investigations has led to animal cruelty charges being filed.' The same pink metal bar is used as a rod to beat a cow which is unable to move . A man stands on the head of a cow at Dry Creek Dairy - while another cow cries out in distress . A cow that refused to move is towed by a tractor - part of a series of abuses that caused three staff members to be charged with misdemeanors . The organization wants Kraft to require suppliers to establish policies on the care and treatment of cattle, including prohibiting animals from being dragged without a sled, prohibiting dairies from docking the tails of cattle or removing their horns after a certain age, and requiring that the provide clean, dry housing areas and nonslip flooring in milking barns. Angela Wiggins, a spokeswoman for Kraft, said the company is continuing to voluntarily work with its dairy suppliers to make sure they meet or exceed animal care guidelines. 'Kraft has cared about the well-being of animals for years. We have high standards for our suppliers already in place,' Wiggins said. The video was upsetting, and Kraft doesn't condone the abusive behaviors, she said. 'We think it's extremely serious,' she said, adding, 'We're glad to see the immediate action taken by those involved.' Wiggins also stressed that Kraft doesn't raise dairy cows and doesn't have a direct relationship with Bettencourt dairies. She said the company planned to make its standards and communications with suppliers more transparent for consumers, and will post them on its website. Loebs, the prosecutor, said Bettencourt Dairies has cooperated fully with law enforcement and investigators don't believe any of the dairy's upper management knew about the mistreatment.

'There's no indication at all that the owners of the dairy were in any way complicit in this behavior. In fact, they have been extremely cooperative with the investigation,' Loebs said. 'They were very supportive of the charges being filed and as far as I can tell, it's an isolated incident.' Burger King admitted that while a Mercy for Animals investigation indicates that Bettencourt may be part of their supply chain, they are conducting their own investigation. Idaho dairy farm which supplies Kraft and Wendy's fires staff after 'sickening' video shows them stomping, dragging and beating cows inside milking barn . 'We take this matter very seriously,' said a spokesman for the fast food firm. 'Burger King Worldwide does not tolerate or condone cruelty to animals. As a part of our animal welfare commitment, we require that all suppliers and their vendors adhere to our vendor code of ethics. 'Burger King Worldwide has launched an immediate investigation into this serious allegation and will take swift action if there is evidence of systemic violations to our animal welfare policies or vendor code of ethics.' A spokesman for Wendy's said that while Bettencourt Dairies’ Dry Creek Dairy in Idaho is not a direct supplier of Wendy’s, they do sell milk to a cheese processing company, who then sells on to one of the fast-food chain's direct suppliers. 'We have instructed Wendy’s supplier to disassociate with Bettencourt immediately,' said the Wendy's spokesman. 'Wendy’s maintains stringent animal welfare standards with our suppliers.' Pam Juker, spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Agriculture, said the agency launched an investigation immediately after Mercy for Animals officials showed the department the video and other documentation. 'Obviously our first concern is the well-being of the animals,' Juker said. 'The images do not meet acceptable animal care or husbandry standards. So we did a preliminary investigation and then turned the matter over to local law enforcement.' The agency hasn't ever received any other animal welfare complaints involving Bettencourt dairies, she said.","Bettencourt is an indirect supplier of Kraft Foods and Wendy's .

A special five judge Appeal Court headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord .

Controversial: Locking up killers and rapists with no hope of release was too harsh. Appeal Court judges were told today. Killers David Oakes, left,  and Danilo Restivo, right, are subject to 'whole-life' orders . Killers David Oakes and Danilo Restivo, and the 'Bermondsey Beast' rapist Michael Roberts are all subject to 'whole-life' orders - which mean they can never apply for release on parole. Five judges at the Court of Appeal in London were also asked to reduce the thirty-year minimum term imposed on a man who was jailed for life after he 'executed' a stranger in the street. Kiaran Stapleton, 21, who labelled himself 'Psycho' when he appeared in court, shot Indian student Anuj Bidve, 23, at point blank range in Salford, Greater Manchester. Stapleton, Oakes and Roberts all watched today’s proceedings - before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, and four other judges - via video link from their respective prisons. Another rapist David Simmonds given a whole life tariff . at Bristol Crown Court in December 2004 also challenges his sentence. He . was the only prisoner in court. Edward Fitzgerald QC - for 40-year-old Italian national . Restivo , who was found guilty of the 2002 'depraved' and 'callous' murder and mutilation of 48-year-old mother of two Heather Barnett - . claimed whole life in his case was 'not justified'. Appeal: Judges were also asked to reduce the thirty-year minimum term imposed on Kiaran Stapleton, 21, right, who shot Indian student Anuj Bidve, 23. The 'Bermondsey Beast' rapist Michael Roberts, left, wants a minimum term instead of his whole-life order . He told Lord Judge sitting with Lord Justice Hughes, . Lady Justice Hallett, Lord Justice Leveson, and Lady Justice Rafferty, that while they accept his was a 'terrible crime' the sentence was 'inappropriate'. He argued that when Parliament changed the law in 2003 . with 'whole life' tariffs , the penalty, which 'removed all hope of . release' became 'harsher'. Mr. Fitzgerald agreed but said hair fetishist Restivo . from Bournemouth, sentenced at Winchester Crown Court in June last year, . had a severe psychiatric personality disorder after being raped as a 13 . year old and this was a significant mitigating factor and substantive . reason for allowing the possibility of some future review. He said it was wrong 'to throw away the key' and 'rule out altogether all hope of release'. Oakes announced at the beginning of the hearing that he wishes to 'appeal against my conviction'. Rapist Roberts, who terrorised elderly women in a London suburb for more than a decade, was jailed in January and told he will live out his days behind bars. Roberts, now 46, joined a small group of 'life means life' prisoners after raping three victims - one aged 83 - and viciously attacking a fourth in Bermondsey, south London. Hearings: A special five judge Appeal Court headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge are hearing five appeals where 'whole life' - when life means life - tariffs were imposed in four cases and a minimum of 30 years in the fifth . He evaded justice for 15 years but was captured after a cold case review by Scotland Yard. Hair fetishist Restivo was given a whole life tariff in June 2011 for the 'depraved' and 'callous' murder and mutilation of a mother-of-two in Bournemouth. The Italian national, now 40, was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of the 2002 murder of neighbour Heather Barnett, 48. Oakes, now 51, Steeple, Essex, who 'sadistically tortured' his former partner before shooting her and their two-year-old daughter, was told at Chelmsford Crown Court in May that he will never be released from prison after a jury found him guilty. He went to Christine Chambers’ house in Braintree where he killed her and daughter Shania with a shotgun. Lawyers for those currently subject to a whole-life order are asking the court to set a minimum term instead. David Perry QC, for the Crown, said it was seeking to 'support the whole-life orders made in the cases of Oakes and Restivo', and the minimum term imposed in Stapleton’s case. In the case of Roberts it was conceded that the making of a whole-life order was 'wrong in principle'.But he stressed that in making such a concession, 'we are not seeking to minimise the seriousness of the offences'. He added: 'Our submissions are intended to reflect the fact that a whole-life order is reserved for rare cases of exceptional gravity, where a whole-life order is made for the purpose of pure punishment, and not for public protection.' During the proceedings one of the judges, Lord Justice Leveson, emphasised that the issue being considered by the court was not about 'letting people go'. Offenders become eligible to apply for parole once their minimum term has expired, but they are not released until they are deemed to no longer represent a risk to the public. Lord Justice Leveson said that if an offender was not safe to release, then they should stay in prison for 'as long as it takes and if that is forever then so be it'.

Gareth Lloyd apologised for the calls and said he did not realise the anxiety it would cause . A bachelor made thousands of nuisance calls telling people his penis was stuck in jam jars and a vacuum cleaner. Gareth Lloyd, 49, remained silent in some of the phone calls while in others he said his penis was trapped in a variety of household objects. Lloyd, of Bryn y Coed, Holywell, who cares for his elderly mother, made 5,800 calls from an unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phone in just three months. BT traced the number to the unregistered phone but police had struggled to find him. He was only caught when his number came up on a mobile phone officers were analysing. Lloyd was given a 12 month community order today after pleading guilty to three charges under the telecommunications act at Flintshire magistrates' court at Mold. The court heard how an extensive enquiry was launched to try and identify the nuisance caller. But such was the scale of his calls that a number of complainants have never been identified. Prosecutor Justin Espie said some people had spoken of their upset and anxiety at the calls, made between February and April. The court heard some of the calls were of a sexual nature but he never went into explicit detail. Lloyd admitted making calls which caused annoyance, inconvenience and needless anxiety, and making calls which were grossly offensive but said it was a prank that got out of hand. He said he never thought he would get caught and never realised the anxiety his behaviour would cause. Phillip Marshall-Thomas, defending, said he was sure that the majority of calls would have been perfectly innocent and within the legal boundaries. He did accept that he had made calls as alleged by the prosecution and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. There was no obscene language or threats of violence. Mr Marshall-Thomas said: 'He thought that he was having a bit of a joke. It was a joke in poor taste, perhaps a little perverted to say the least. He accepts that. 'He now realises that his behaviour was totally unacceptable.' He said Lloyd had not tried to get another phone since his arrest and had not made any similar calls since. Gareth Lloyd was given a 12 month community order and banned from owning a pay-as-you-go mobile phone for one year . He said Lloyd does not have a drink problem but accepted some of the calls were made after he had been drinking. Mr Marhsall-Thomas said: 'My client apologises profusely for his behaviour. 'He realises now how much worse his behaviour was than he considered at the time.' Lloyd was the carer for his 84-year-old mother and the court was told it would cause great difficulties if he went to prison. District judge Andrew Shaw placed him on a 12 month community order and a separate order of 12 months preventing him from using or owning any mobile phone other than a contract phone where his details would be registered. The judge also ordered him to pay £85 costs and said that although his calls had caused a substantial nuisance, there was no obscene language or threats of violence.","Gareth Lloyd told people his penis was stuck in a jam jar or a vacuum cleaner .

Heroin addicts should be handed free tin foil, to encourage them to smoke rather than inject the drug, the Government’s drug tsar said. Prof Les Iversen, chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said inhaling heroin was safer than injecting it - because it removes the risk of catching dangerous diseases from needle sharing. Drug addicts can already access free needles and syringes from the NHS, and Prof Iversen said tin foil should be added to the list of approved paraphernalia. Prof Les Iversen said using foil to inhale heroin was safer than injecting it. This photograph is posed by a model . He said: ‘We recommended that aluminium foil should be part of legal paraphernalia. 'Heroin addicts and other injecting drug addicts can already obtain needles, sterile water and alcohol wipes etc legally so we’ve suggested that foil should be added to that list. ‘Foil can be used as a way of smoking heroin instead of injecting it and is thus considered safer, avoiding the hazards of injecting with possibly contaminated needles. ‘We’ve been subjected to a number of questions from the Department of Health about the safety of smoking versus injecting, and we are still waiting a response. 'We’ve been promised one by the end of the month.’ The Home Office insisted heroin is 'extremely harmful' but ministers will consider the advice. Prof Iversen said aluminium foil should be part of legal paraphernalia . Figures last month showed heroin usage had stabilised at 0.1 per cent of the population in 2010-11. But the number of people using methadone, which is prescribed by doctors as an alternative to heroin, has gone up from 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent over the last two years. Prof Iverson said the provision of foil to heroin users would reduce the risk of infection, cutting costs for the NHS. He added: ‘I think it’s a good idea because it avoids the harms associated with injecting drug use, both infection at the site of injection and also the danger of transmitting viral and bacterial disease. ‘That can certainly lead to a large charge for the National Health Service and if we can find a safer way I think we should use it.’ A Home Office spokesman said:  'Heroin and crack cocaine are extremely harmful and cause misery to communities across the country.

Businessman Bob Bashara, 54, from Grosse Pointe, Michigan, pleaded guilty to solicitation to murder and told the court he paid someone $2,000 to get Joseph Gentz taken out from inside jail so that he couldn't testify against him. Gentz admitted strangling Jane Bashara earlier this year but said he was doing it at the direction of her husband. Bashara denies these claims and authorities have still not been able to charge him in connection with her murder. In July, furniture and appliance store owner Steve Tibaudo testified . that Bashara enlisted him to try and find someone to kill Gentz in the .

Court: Bob Bashara, 54, of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, was charged with solicitation to murder trying to make a hit against a man he allegedly hired to kill his wife . Prosecutors said at his arraignment in June that he spent two weeks trying to arrange to have Gentz killed as the handyman waited in jail court hearings on the case of Jane Bashara's death. Ms Worthy said at the arraignment: 'The evidence will show that Mr Bashara wanted Mr Gentz killed because he ... didn't want him to testify in any future proceedings, should there be any.' Prosecutors also said Bashara approached a second individual to kill Gentz. Bashara will be sentenced next month and faces up to ten years in jail. While police have long considered Bob Bashara a person of interest in his wife’s murder, he has not been charged in her death. Gentz also faces charges of conspiracy, an indication that authorities believe more than one person was involved. Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to Detroit . Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars . Since his wife’s murder, Bob Bashara has vehemently denied being involved, but Gentz tells a different story, saying Bashara promised him money and a used car if Gentz killed Mrs Bashara. In an email to Ohio’s The News-Herald, Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney spokeswoman Maria Miller said: '[The case is] still under investigation’. However, the paper reports that word from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office indicate Bashara will be brought in either this week or next week to face charges. In an appearance on Good Morning America in February, Bashara, with his daughter Jessie proclaimed his innocence in the case. In the meantime, The News-Herald reported that Bashara has collected about 24 letters from character witnesses to use in court if he’s charged with the murder in an effort to secure a release from jail on bond. He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent. 'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all the negativity, I'm going to have to live through'. Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home in February and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area. Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month when he was charged for his role in Jane Bashara's murder . Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago. On the day of Jane's memorial service, Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 to have done. But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.' The businessman said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home. Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place. The local businessman admitted he and Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money from  Jane before getting into a struggle with her. Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, Mr Bashara was said to be having a relationship with a woman who he was planning on buying a house with . Her husband told police that Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'. 'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's capable of it,' Bashara said. It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Bashara was the mastermind behind it all. Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Mr Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge. A Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there. She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls. 'They are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might have been hidden cameras, things like that'. Sources confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that Mr Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was murdered.

A heartbroken family has revealed how a popular amateur footballer died with a tear in his eye, weeks after developing locked-in syndrome. Bryan Herbert was left aware and awake but almost completely paralysed and unable to talk since suffering a stroke. He died on Tuesday night surrounded by his loved ones. Tragedy: Bryan Herbert was left aware and awake but almost completely paralysed and unable to talk since suffering a stroke. He initially suffered a fit more than two months ago after playing for his local team . His mother Alicia said: 'He had a tear in his eye and knew he was going on Tuesday. He will be missed by a lot of people.' Bryan’s family, all from Bacup, Lancashire said he initially suffered a fit more than two months ago after playing for Stacksteads St Joseph’s football team, which he captained. Around three weeks later the former All Saints High School pupil, who also played for Bacup Borough and The Little Queen’s pub in Bacup, woke up sweating, feeling unwell and unable to move his whole left side. By the time paramedics arrived Bryan wasn’t . able to talk and was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital, pictured, where he . remained in the critical care unit for several weeks before he passed away . By the time paramedics arrived he wasn’t able to talk and was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital, where he remained in the critical care unit for five weeks. His girlfriend, parents, brothers and sisters said their final goodbyes to the 27-year-old during ten emotional minutes medics granted them after revealing nothing could be done to save him. Vicky Bruty, 25, described her beloved boyfriend as the ‘complete life and soul of the party’ before the stroke. She said: 'He was everything and loved us all. The last conversation we had as a couple was over two months ago - the day before we were going on holiday. 'We talked about living together. He said how much he loved me and how we would start a family when we got home. 'But he suffered a stroke before we left and had been in hospital ever since.' His father Gary, who turned 48 this week, said Bryan started improving two weeks ago as he lay in hospital. He said: 'He was ‘locked in’ from day one, kept crying and couldn’t talk to us at any point. They found a lump in the back of his neck immediately and it got bigger.' Gary said that despite Bryan moving his arms and legs a bit and even laughing two weeks ago, his son took a turn for the worse on Monday this week. He added: 'He suddenly needed a tube down his throat to help him breathe. And they found more damage to his brain. 'It is distressing. You don’t want to see your kids die before you. In the ten minutes we got with him everyone just started either crying or feeling numb with pain. And we all said our goodbyes.' Paying tribute to his son, Gary added: 'He was a smashing lad who loved football, Liverpool FC, fishing, snooker and poker. 'Hundreds of people attended a fundraiser at the New Con Club in Bacup for him two weeks ago.' The former St Mary’s Primary School pupil had also been a chef at the Cobblers Inn, where he’d met his girlfriend Vicky. He lived on Clough Road in Bacup with his mother. Bacup Borough manager Brent Peters said Bryan’s legacy will always remain with the club. He said: 'Bryan will be a sad loss, not only to his close family but his football family.' An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned by a coroner.","Bryan Herbert was left aware and awake but almost completely paralysed and unable to talk since suffering a stroke .

A consultant lost his job at an NHS hospital after carrying a sample of HIV-infected blood in his hand luggage while flying from Africa to the UK, a High Court judge heard. Tubonye Harry - who was a genito-urinary specialist at the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk - was returning from Nigeria, where he did private work, Mr Justice Burnett was told. The judge said the sample should have been packed in the aircraft’s hold and Dr Harry had breached regulations designed to prevent passengers being exposed to infection. Dr Harry had also broken rules by opening a package containing the sample at home instead of in a laboratory, the judge added. He was dismissed by James Paget bosses earlier this year. 'The transportation of human blood is governed by strict regulations,' said Mr Justice Burnett. He added: 'On a return journey from Nigeria in . December 2010, Dr Harry accepted that he carried two samples of blood, . one infected with HIV, in his hand luggage. 'He said that they were appropriately . packed in accordance with the regulations, but agreed that the . regulations required them to go in the hold. He said that he had been . unaware of this. 'The second aspect is that he opened . the package in which the samples had been transported at home. He then . took them to the laboratory. The regulations require that samples be . opened in the laboratory. Disciplined: Tubonye Harry was a genito-urinary specialist at the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk . 'The rationale behind these strictures . is not difficult to divine. Should an incident occur in which a phial . of infected blood is broken there is a risk that people might . inadvertently come into contact with it and be exposed to infection.' Details of the case emerged as Mr Justice Burnett ruled on a dispute between Dr Harry and the General Medical Council (GMC) - which registers doctors - at a High Court hearing in London. Dr Harry, who also faced a number of other allegations relating to his work, has been suspended pending the outcome of GMC disciplinary proceedings, the judge was told. But he argued that the GMC’s 18-month interim suspension was unfair and unnecessary - and the judge agreed. Mr Justice Burnett terminated the suspension, which prevented Harry from seeking alternative work, saying it was 'disproportionate'. Dr Harry qualified as a doctor in 1979 and had been a consultant since 1996. He carried the infected blood from Nigeria in 2010 and lost his job at the James Paget in January.

A coroner has called for tougher laws on ‘legal highs’ after a 20-year-old student took one and died just one month before it was outlawed. Tragic Grant Mace was found dead in the sea after taking methoxetamine - known as MXE or mexxy - billed as a ‘safe’ alternative to ketamine. Grant, a first year robotics student at the University of Plymouth, died after taking the hallucinogenic drug on March 4. Methoxetamine or MXE commonly called Mexxy is a synthetic drug sold on the internet with similar effects to Ketamine . Tragically MXE was made illegal just four weeks later on April 5, the inquest in Plymouth, Devon, heard. Just four weeks after his death it became the first drug banned by the Government under a new temporary class drug order. This week anti-drug campaigners have warned a new ‘legal high’ is hitting Britain’s streets every week. Campaigners are currently calling for the Government to outlaw a substance called ‘Annihilation’ which is available legally and has been linked to several deaths in Europe. An inquest in Plymouth, Devon, heard Grant had taken methoxetamine with two friends in his student halls. He was found floating dead in the sea the next day and it is unclear if he went swimming or fell in. But the inquest heard the cause of death was drowning after the drug had caused Grant to 'lose control of his mind and body'. Plymouth coroner Ian Arrow recorded an open verdict and called for the Government to tighten the laws on legal drugs. Grant Mace was a first year robotics student at the University of Plymouth . He said: “I’m satisfied that the drug had an adverse effect on Grant’s cognitive function and I am satisfied that he hallucinated. 'We don’t know what his movement is after that. At some stage he was in the sea, but I’m afraid the full circumstances will never be known. 'The effects of this drug are unknown and you would do things you wouldn’t normally do. 'We need to get the message out there to the people who want to take it and to the shops which sell it that this drug is dangerous and is not fit for human consumption. 'Some form of legislation needs to be put in place to prevent further deaths.' The inquest heard Grant and two friends bought a capsule-form of the drug from a local shop and took it in the university’s hall of residence. Grant’s friend Charlotte Bundy told the inquest: “Grant had never taken it before. It was powder in a capsule so we swallowed it. 'It’s like a legal form of ketamine and it made everything like Alice in Wonderland, it made you feel all happy and it makes it difficult for you to get about.' The inquest heard shortly after taking the drug in student digs a fire alarm went off and Grant and his friends left the building. But Grant was so out of it his friends lost sight of him and they tried contacting him on his mobile phone but with no success. Grant, of Basildon, Essex, was . spotted by a member of the public at around 10.30am the next day in the . sea near the Royal Plymouth Corinthian Yacht Club. The inquest heard Grant bought the drug from the Dam (corr) Good Head Shop in Plymouth. Speaking . after the inquest, a spokesman for the shop said he had started selling . MXE after receiving 'a lot of requests' for the drug. It was sold in the shop at £10 for 0.2g of powder and £8 for one of the 'maxi' pills. He said: “It was more of a request thing. A lot of people ask for it and if there is demand for it I will buy it in. 'There are quite a few that we won’t touch, and I obviously won’t sell the illegal stuff. 'It has been banned now. You would be surprised how little of that you needed. That was lethal that stuff.' The inquest was told that Mexxy was 'like a legal form of ketamine and it made everything like Alice in Wonderland, it made you feel all happy and it makes it difficult for you to get about' Detective Constable Stuart Payne, a drugs liaison officer at Devon and Cornwall Police, told the inquest that anyone who took the drug and then entered water would 'possibly drown'. He said: 'The drug can put you in a state where you are conscious but you’ve got no control over your body, over your body movements or your thoughts. 'You think you’re in a nice warm cosy place but really you have no control over what you are doing. 'Because of the relaxed state when you take this drug, if you are near water then the possibility is you will drown. 'It is a comparatively new substance. No one is sure what it contains. 'It’s very similar to walking into a garden centre, picking weed killer up and swallowing it to see what effect it has.' Methoxetamine - which can easily be bought online - saw a surge in popularity in Britain and across northern Europe. The drug, also known as MXE or mexxy, is described as having the same effect as ketamine without the side effects. But despite claims that MXE is ‘safer’ than the illegal alternative experts say it can cause mental health problems. It was sold online as plant feeder or bath salt. Grant’s box of MXE was marked as ‘not fit for human consumption’, the inquest heard.","New ‘legal highs’ are hitting Britain’s streets every week .

More than 400 serving and retired troops will this week descend on Parliament to  confront David Cameron in a  protest unprecedented in the  history of the British Army. Officers and soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers will mount the Army’s first picket of the Palace of Westminster on Thursday after the Government axed its second battalion. Despite being threatened with court martial, serving soldiers are due to join their retired colleagues on the march, which coincides with a Parliamentary debate about defence cuts. Threatened: The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Afghanistan. More than 400 serving and retired troops will protest against cuts . The Army forbids their participation in any anti-Government demonstration. It is the first time soldiers have demonstrated on the streets of London since the Bishopsgate Mutiny of 1649, when 300 members of the New Model Army launched a protest against Oliver Cromwell’s order that they be sent to Ireland. It is also the first time the British Army has taken to the streets in protest since it was formed in 1707. The Fusiliers claim Mr Cameron forced through the disbandment of 2RRF to save the Royal Regiment of Scotland  because he feared cutting soldiers north of the border would boost nationalists in an independence referendum due in 2014. Rebellion: Troops last protested in 1649 against Oliver Cromwell (pictured) Captain Joe Eastwood, a former Regimental Sergeant Major of the Fusiliers, said: ‘There is a lot of anger because we know the Government did a deal to save the Jocks and to cut 2RRF. ‘I am sure that serving soldiers will join us on the protest, but given the risks to their careers, the arrangements for their participation are under the radar. ‘The MoD is threatening to use Section 69 of the 1955 Army Act. Pressure is being applied, with courts martial promised for  those who defy orders. So some arrangements must remain cloak-and-dagger.’ During Thursday’s protest, the Fusiliers, led by retired Colonel Brian Gorski, will march through Whitehall wearing their black berets, and red and white hackles. As they pass the Cenotaph, they will salute fallen comrades before  proceeding to Downing Street where petitions against 2RRF’s disbandment will be handed in. Afterwards, they will watch a debate on the cuts from the Commons public gallery. A motion opposing the scrapping of 2RRF– so far signed by 30 MPs – has been brought by Tory John Baron, an ex-Fusiliers officer. Colonel Gorski said: ‘The Army marching on Parliament is unique. The MoD is making enquiries and it may well have people out monitoring the march. ‘There is a lot of sensitivity about this because 2RRF’s disbandment was referred to the Prime Minister’s office, and he gave it the final nod. For these reasons there is great risk to  soldiers if they attend. During the protest, the Fusiliers will pass the Cenotaph (pictured) where they will salute fallen comrades . ‘For the sake of their careers, my advice is they shouldn’t appear on the march, but if they happen to be passing Parliament or going through Whitehall at the time that is up to them.’ An Army spokesman said: ‘The Armed Forces are entitled to their beliefs provided their practice does not conflict with the  services’ values and standards. ‘Although personnel are not  precluded from activity which is potentially political in nature, they are not permitted to do so  in uniform.’","Serving soldiers will join march despite being threatened with court martial .

Art critic Brian Sewell has revealed how he helped hide traitor Anthony Blunt after the surveyor of the Queen's pictures was publicly unmasked as a Soviet spy. Blunt told Sewell he was the fourth man in the Cambridge spy ring soon after confessing to MI5 interrogators in 1964. But, as he reveals in his memoir, Sewell spirited his friend away from the glare of the media after Margaret Thatcher publicly named him 15 years later in the Commons. Advisor: Anthony Blunt with the Queen during her visit to the Courtauld Institute of Art where he was a director . Blunt's friend: Art critic Brian Sewell helped the traitor when he was exposed in the Commons . They became friends and confidantes in the 1950s  when Sewell studied under Blunt at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Stripped of his knighthood: Anthony Blunt . Blunt had denied he fed secrets to the Soviets while working for the security services during World War II, when quizzed 11 times by MI5. But when they finally forced him to confess, he later told Sewell he was part of a network recruited in the thirties, which included Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean. Sewell claimed the Queen knew of Blunt's spying and kept him in his post for another decade before Blunt retired in 1972 after 27 years as her art advisor.

Two Americans were awarded the Nobel economics prize on Monday for studies on the match-making taking place when doctors are coupled up with hospitals, students with schools and human organs with transplant recipients. The work of Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley has sparked a 'flourishing field of research' and helped improve the performance of many markets, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Roth, 60, is a professor at Harvard University in Boston. Shapley, 89, is a professor emeritus at University of California Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Prized: Staffan Normark, center, Permanent Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences gives a press conference to announce the winner of the Nobel prize in Economic Sciences on October 15, 2012 in Stockholm. US duo Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley win Nobel Economics Prize on October 15, 2012 . Duo: Alvin Roth, right, and Lloyd Shapley, left, won the 2012 Nobel prize for economics . 'This year's prize concerns a central economic problem: how to match different agents as well as possible,' the academy said. Shapley made early theoretical inroads into the subject, using game theory to analyze different matching methods in the 1950s and '60s. Together with U.S. economist David Gale, he developed a mathematical formula for how 10 men and 10 women could be coupled in a way so that no one would benefit from trading partners. While that may have had little impact on marriages and divorces, the algorithm they developed has been used to better understand many different markets. In the 1990s, Roth applied it to the market for allocating U.S. student doctors to hospitals. He developed a new algorithm that was adopted by the National Resident Matching Program, which helps match resident doctors with the right hospitals. He also helped redesign the application process of New York City public high schools, ensuring that fewer students ended up in schools that were not among their top choices. Similar formulas have been applied to efforts to match kidneys and other human organs to patients needing a transplant, the academy said. Roth was in California with his wife when he got the call from the prize committee at 3:30 a.m. 'We missed the first call because we were asleep, but we had time to wake up and think that might be what it was,' he said. 'My wife is going to go out and get us some coffee, and maybe we'll absorb it.' He said he didn't expect things to change too much, and that he would teach a class at Stanford on Monday. Old-Fashioned Love: 2012 Economics Nobel Prize winner Alvin Roth celebrates with wife Emilie at his home in Menlo Park, California, on Monday, October 15, 2012 . Joy: U.S Mathematician Lloyd Shapley raises his arm outside his home after being notified that he won the 2012 economics Noble prize in Los Angeles, California, October 15, 2012 . 'But I imagine that they'll be listening with renewed interest,' he said. 'I think this will make market design more visible to economists and people who can benefit from market design.' 'Matching ... is about how you get all the things that you can't just choose but you also have to be chosen - so getting into university, getting married, getting jobs,' he said. 'You can't just have what you want; you also have to do some courtship and there is courtship on both sides and we study the market place processes by which those types of courtship are resolved.' The official prize citation said the two were awarded for 'the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.' Shapley learned that he and Roth had won the $1.2 million award from an Associated Press photographer and another journalist who went to his home in Los Angeles early Monday. 'Matching ... is about how you get all the things that you can't just choose but you also have to be chosen.' Professor Alvin Roth . 'I consider myself a mathematician and the award is for economics,' Shapley said. 'I never, never in my life took a course in economics.' Shapley is the son of renowned . astronomer Harlow Shapley, whose work early in the 20th century included . helping estimate the true size of the Milky Way galaxy. 'Now, I'm ahead of my father,' Shapley said. 'He got other prizes ... But he did not get a Nobel prize.' 'Even though these two researchers . worked independently of one another, the combination of Shapley's basic . theory and Roth's empirical investigations, experiments and practical . design has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the . performance of many markets,' the academy said. David Warsh, who follows academic economists on his Economic Principals blog, says Roth's work has revolutionized the way organs are matched to patients. Before Roth, he says, 'there were no economists in that business at all. He's really changed it, and saved a lot of lives.' The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was the last of the 2012 Nobel awards to be announced.

The family of a boy who developed severe cerebral palsy after a hospital blunder led to him being starved of oxygen at birth have received a £6million payout. Joseph O’Reggio, 11, has been left unable or speak or feed himself after staff at Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital failed to act swiftly enough when his heart rate dropped. His mother Rachel O'Reggio, now 40, had gone into labour after a healthy pregnancy on the morning of April 13, 2001. Injury: Joesph O'Reggio has been left unable to speak or feed himself after maternity staff failed to act swiftly enough when his heart rate dropped at birth which led to brain damage . But the following day, from late morning, her unborn baby's heart rate dropped. Although he was being monitored, it wasn’t until around 10pm that evening - when there was a shift change - that specialist help was called for. Joseph was delivered by forceps shortly after 10.45pm, but his heart rate was weak and he suffered brain damage. Now more than a decade on, the Royal Courts of Justice, London, have awarded a £6million care package to Joseph’s parents. The couple, from Wolverhampton, West . Mids, won their fight to get Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust to accept . that they were liable for the majority of Joseph's injuries and that he . should have been delivered earlier. Joseph . requires round-the-clock care and his parents hope the money will allow . them to move to a specially adapted home with their three other . children. Payout: Jospeh's parents Rachel and Julian O'Reggio, pictured outside the High Court in London where they were awarded a £6million care package . He will also . have access to the specialist rehabilitation equipment he needs . including the installation of a multi-sensory room that uses light, . sounds, smells and shapes to develop his skills with hearing, sight, . taste, touch, language and hand-eye co-ordination. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of . Justice today Joseph's Julian O'Reggio, 39, said he and his wife were over the . moon with the figure they have been given. He said: 'We’ve managed to secure the funding Jo needs now to last him for the rest of his life. 'This money will be used for extra . physio appointments, speech therapy, occupational therapy to really try . and bring him out so he can live his life to the full. Mrs O'Reggio, . a part-time credit manager, who also has two daughters and a younger . son, said: 'I cannot describe how it feels knowing we finally have . justice for Joe. 'It is . a mixture of huge relief and happiness that he will now always have . access to the treatment he deserves and be cared for the rest of his . life. Battle: Parents Rachel and Julian O'Reggio, pictured with Joseph and their other children Molly, 9, Phoebe, 5, and Oliver, 2, fought for over a decade to force the hospital to accept liability . 'His brother and sisters are great with Joe and love to play with him, but at his age he should be playing and running around with them. 'It is heartbreaking that he has not been able to meet the normal milestones in his life. 'This settlement means we will always have support and he will always be cared for, as well as funding all the specialist equipment he needs. 'However, although it draws a line under everything, nothing can turn back the clock and Julian and I will always remember that if the correct decision had been made earlier, Joe would be the healthy boy we dreamed of.' Blunder: The court heard how staff at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton failed to act swiftly enough when Joseph's heart rate dropped . Sara Burns, a Partner and medical negligence expert at Irwin Mitchell who represents the family, said: 'Rachel and Julian have waited patiently and with huge dignity for today’s settlement, which will make such a big difference to Joe’s life. 'The adaptations to a new house and one-to-one support will make life easier for the whole family who have given up so much to care for Joe and juggled hospital appointments and rehabilitation support with trying to provide a normal family home life. 'This was a complicated case but the fact is the mistakes made during Joe’s care should simply not have happened. 'Patient safety must be the top priority across the NHS, but sadly, we continue to be contacted by families whose children have been left brain damaged as a result of negligent hospital staff, looking for access to the rehabilitation and support they desperately need to live their lives as independently as possible. 'Trusts must ensure thorough training of staff and that guidelines are in place for when to call for senior support, not just for midwives, but all areas of the NHS. 'This will reduce basic, preventable errors from happening that have devastating consequences for patients and their families.' Joseph was Rachel’s first pregnancy and she said the money was a huge relief and it was devastating at the time. She added: 'We were very angry, we were very raw, for a fair few years, we have gone on to have three other healthy children. That made it a little bit easier emotionally. 'It’s a huge relief today that we can get Jo care for the rest of his life and pay the carers to help him in every day living. 'Jo needs 24-hour care, he has no functional use of his arms, his hands, or anything. He has to washed, bathed, gel in his hair, he has to fed, he can’t give himself a drink. 'The apology means a lot, more than anything it means a lot because it’s that acknowledgement of what they did. We fought for this for more than 10 and half years, and it means more than anything.'","Joseph O’Reggio, 11, has been left unable or speak or feed himself .

In his toughest attack on the government in Tehran to date, Mr Cameron told the annual dinner of the United Jewish Israel Appeal that the regime’s ‘claim that its nuclear programme is intended purely for civilian purposes is not remotely credible’. He added: ‘Iran is not just a threat to Israel. It is a threat to the world. ‘Now there are some who say nothing will work – and that we have to learn to live with a nuclear-armed Iran.

Ecologists have released hundreds of Britain's largest breed of spider into the wild - which can grow to eight centimetres. The great raft spider has been saved by a breeding programme involving ten zoos. With a leg span of up to 8cm, the arachnid is capable of catching and eating a fish as it glides across the surface of water. An adult male great raft spider similar to the ones which are being released as part of a Bristol Zoo conservation programme. They can grow to 8cm long . As with most spiders, the female is the larger sex. This semiaquatic creature dines on small water-based insect larvae, sticklebacks, tadpoles and other small spiders. Just three populations are believed to exist in the UK after they were ravaged by agricultural drainage. Around 200 baby spiders have already been released at the RSPB's Strumpshaw Fen reserve near Norwich. Ecologist Dr Helen Smith said: 'Most invertebrate groups don't receive a lot of conservation effort. 'The ones that tend to receive the attention are the big and spectacular ones ... this is very much the case with great raft spiders. 'They're big, they're beautiful and they have to fly the flag for other species.' Funding from Natural England, the BBC Wildlife Fund and the Broads Authority hopes to reintroduce the spider to the Norfolk Broads, where it was once commonplace. Instead of being raised in their usual nursery webs, suspended from wetland plants, the tiny animals were individually housed in test tubes - where iron-willed volunteers fed them by mouth. Bristol Zoo Gardens keeper Carmen Solan raised 170 of the arachnids, using a special tube operated with her mouth to feed the tiny critters dead flies. She said: 'It does take a lot of time. Carmen Solan with some of the great raft spider's which she fed by mouth while they were very young. One of the young spiders set to be released into the wild. The great raft spider can reach sizes of 8cm . 'You have to be careful to make sure they've got enough humidity to be able to moult.' Carmen even had favourite spiders - which in the wild are capable of catching a stickleback. Dr Smith said: 'Having invested their summer into feeding them individually, people do get quite attached. 'But when you return the next year and see 500 to 700 babies, it's worth the effort.' The ecologist, who has 20 years' experience working with raft spiders, says the conservation programme is designed to give the spiders the best chance in the wild - boosting survival rates by as much as 90 per cent. She said: 'We're all improving our captive-rearing expertise through this process.'It's early days. 'We're two years down the line now but the indications are that the spiders are settled in well.'

The spiders were once commonplace in the Norfolk Broads, and researchers hope they will flourish again. Previous batches of spiderlings released have been discovered to be breeding well in the fen, and four nursery webs were spotted, each containing around 200 tiny spiders. Dr Smith said: 'With animals that are this rare you can make lots of arguments about food chains and food webs, and how important that is. 'We simply don't know what pulling out one brick will do further down the heap.' The spiders can live up to two and a half years, but thankfully they will not be appearing in bathtubs any time soon, as they cannot survive outside their marshland habitat.

In a letter, mother-of-two Sally Nightingale urges the Prime Minister to give her five minutes of his time in return for the 17 years of service her husband Danny has given to the Army. She writes: ‘My husband is a good man, a loving father and a loyal servant to his country. He should not be locked away behind bars.’ Sally Nightingale, who has written to the Prime Minister asking him to end the 'injustice' of her husband's sentence, is pictured outside the detention centre today where he is imprisoned . Sergeant Nightingale, 37, a Special . Forces sniper who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was sentenced to . 18 months in military detention after admitting owning a 9mm Glock . pistol. The weapon was a gift from a group of . Iraqis he helped train in 2007. He left it behind with other possessions . when he left Iraq and it was then put in a container and sent to SAS . headquarters in Britain and then to his home. He had planned to pass the gun to his . SAS regiment as a trophy but forgot he had it after suffering brain . damage following a collapse on a charity trek in Brazil. Mrs Nightingale, 38, who visited her . husband in detention for the first time yesterday, said that because his . Army pay has stopped she could face eviction from the home she shares . with their daughters, Mara, five, and Alys, two, because her salary from . her job with Weight Watchers is not enough to pay the rent. In her letter to the PM she says: ‘He . was prepared to sacrifice everything if he was ever required to do so. 'I . am now asking you for five minutes in return for his years of service.

Henry was meant to be a miniature pony - but he was getting bigger and bigger by the minute. The owners of the two-foot tall pony just couldn't figure out why he had become so bad-tempered, until they noticed his stomach was all bloated. It wasn't the result of eating too much hay, however, that was causing the problem, but Henry's strange habit of swallowing sand. Snacking on sand: Henry the 2ft high Shetland pony became ill after grazing on sand in an all-weather paddock . He had been left to exercise in an outdoor all-weather paddock and, it seemed, had taken to the taste of its grainy covering. Unfortunately, his new meal had blocked his large intestine and this was having an effect on his other organs. His owners and other horse-lovers rallied round to quickly raise £6,000 for life-saving treatment and Henry is now making a full recovery. Owner Caroline Howarth, from Coppull near Chorley, Lancashire, bought Henry when he was six months old for her eight-year-old daughter Madison. Escape artist: Henry, seen here with her eight-year-old owner Madison, needed emergency surgery to flush out the build-up of sand . 'As soon as I saw him I knew we had to have him,' Mrs Howarth said. 'But after a while we noticed his tummy was getting bigger and bigger. Day-in, day-out it just kept swelling. 'I thought he might need worming and I kept a firm control on his food intake. 'It did not stop and the vets took a blood sample which said his liver wasn't working properly. 'They gave him more tests and my horse insurance level of £1,000 ran out. 'We had to fund any future treatment ourselves.' Happy again: The miniature pony is now making a full recovery after the emergency treatment, which was paid for by local horse lovers . Fellow horse lovers at the Seven Stars Stables at Standish, where Henry lives, decided to raise money for treatment by going on a sponsored walk. Henry was taken to the Equine Hospital at the Leahurst Campus of the University of Liverpool, which specialises in rare illnesses and serious injuries to horses. Vets there decided to flush Henry's stomach and found a build up of sand was causing all the problems. They carried out surgery to save his life and placed him on a special diet as he recovers back to health. Mrs Howarth added: 'He is a cheeky little horse and at the horse hospital they had to put a notice on his stable saying he was an escape artist. 'He now has a special diet - but no sand!'","The tiny Shetland pony, who lives in Lancashire, had become bad tempered and his stomach was getting bigger and bigger .

"By . Associated Press Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:33 EST, 17 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:36 EST, 17 November 2012 . Moonshine distillers are making their first batches of legal liquor in a small Georgia town's city hall -- not far from the mountains and canopy of trees that once hid bootleggers from the law. A handful of moonshine distilleries are scattered around the South, but observers say this is the first they've ever seen right in a city hall. The distilleries come amid an increased interest in the U.S. for locally made specialty spirits and beer brewed in homes and micro-breweries. Brew hall: The Dawsonville Moonshine Distillery, at right, stands next to the Georgia Racing Hall of Fame Museum and City Hall, in Dawsonville, Georgia . Fresh batch: Distillers Dwight Bearden, right, and Bob Suchke look over a batch of fermented apple brandy mash as they make moonshine in the Dawsonville Moonshine Distillery . 'Happy' Wood: Entrepreneur Cheryl 'Happy' Wood stands under a portrait of her grandfather Simmie Free in the Dawsonville Moonshine Distillery . The Dawsonville moonshine makers and city officials say the operation helps them preserve a way of life. It also carries on traditions from an era when moonshine meant extra income for farmers, medicine for their children and helped fuel the beginnings of NASCAR racing. ‘Dawson County was, sure enough, the moonshine capital of the world at one time,’ distiller Dwight Bearden said, as he checked on the still where the third batch of Dawsonville Moonshine was being prepared. ‘It was just a way of life back then.’ The clanking of the still and the smell of corn and alcohol fill the room several yards and a few interior walls away from the offices of the city clerk, the mayor and other officials running the town about 60 miles north of Atlanta. The city leases the space to the distillery. Moonshine Distillery: The backwoods moonshining business birthed one of the nation's most popular sports in NASCAR, according to a company advertisement . Outside city hall are old, abandoned cars from the days when Ford Coupes and other models from the 1930s and `40s hauled moonshine down Georgia Highway 9. The windy mountain highway became known as Thunder Road, because it was filled with the screaming sounds of car engines as bootleggers hauled their moonshine to Atlanta. The young drivers were sometimes pursued by 'revenue men' from the federal government, and the chases sometimes led to overturned cars and deadly wrecks. Townspeople are proud of how young Dawsonville men raced their cars at places like Lakewood Speedway in Atlanta after moonshine deliveries, which helped stock-car racing gain a following in its early days. Today, cars on Georgia 9 slow for school zones on their way through Silver City and Coal Mountain - two of the smallest communities from Dawsonville to Atlanta - and the suburbs of Cumming, Alpharetta and Roswell farther south. Brewing the remedy: Distiller Bob Suchke feels a copper pipe above a condenser barrel while making a batch of genuine corn whisky moonshine . Inside the distillery are plenty of reminders of the days when moonshine was made in the surrounding foothills. Entrepreneur Cheryl ‘Happy’ Wood points with pride to a portrait of her grandfather, Simmie Free, hanging on one wall. ‘Mama said, “When you get this going, I want you to hang this up,""’ Wood said. Free learned how to make moonshine from his father, who learned it from his father generations ago, she said. ‘We grew up around it, and it was our medicine,’ Wood said. Cough medicine was among its medicinal uses, she said. Making the potion: Distiller Dwight Bearden feels a copper pipe above a condenser barrel while making a batch of genuine corn whisky moonshine . Bearden, 56, recalls how extra income from his family's moonshining business helped feed him as a child, and often meant a better Christmas if sales were good. There are a handful of other moonshine distilleries in Southern states such as North Carolina, but officials from state and national groups say they aren't aware of any operating in a city hall. ‘That's a new one for me,’ said Gregory Minchak, a spokesman for the National League of Cities. J. Katie McConnell, senior associate for economic development at the League of Cities, has been studying the craft beer industry in recent months, and how small breweries and distilleries have sprung up and expanded in many communities. In Washington, D.C., for instance, the city's first gin distillery in more than a century opened this year, she said. The raw ingredients: Bearden shows off the corn malt to be used in a batch of genuine corn whisky moonshine . Proof check: Suchke uses a hydrometer which measures the proof of a batch of genuine corn whisky before it's tempered . The real stuff: A batch of genuine corn whisky empties out of a condenser barrel before being tempered . Wood has been planning the distillery for about five years. As she searched for a site, she and city officials began to realize that city hall would be an ideal spot, Dawsonville Mayor W. James Grogan said. The idea was that the distillery would tie into the city's history since it would be right next-door to the Georgia Racing Hall of Fame Museum, Grogan said. The distillery has reached several key milestones this year. Last week, the distillery was delivering the second batch of moonshine it's made to its distributor, which has orders from liquor stores and other businesses around the state. Georgia law prohibits the distillery from selling its liquor at the site, but allows a distributor to ship it to stores with a liquor license, where it can be sold legally. Clarity is everything: Suchke checks the clarity of a batch of genuine corn whisky before its tempered . Fresh batch: Bearden stands over a condenser barrel while making a batch of genuine corn whisky moonshine . Wood recently got approval from state officials to offer small samples for tourists to taste. State Rep. Rusty Kidd of Milledgeville, who introduced that bill during the most recent session, said Thursday he believes there will be more legislation during the upcoming session that would allow the Dawsonville distillery and others in the state to sell a single bottle of moonshine to tourists who want to take one home. The samples will be offered on a counter made from wood cut by one of the distillery's employees, Bob Suchke of Dahlonega. Tin covering the front of the tasting counter came from an old barn, Wood said. Locally made and locally grown products are a key aspect of the business, she said. A batch of apples fermenting last week came from the north Georgia town of Ellijay, about 30 miles away, she said. The local movement has been a successful one in north Georgia, where several vineyards dot the mountain landscape and offer tastings of wines made with locally grown grapes. In Blue Ridge, at least one apple orchard brews and bottles its own apple and peach ciders. Corn used by the distillery is also grown locally, and the distillery sticks to authentic recipes and doesn't use any sugar, Wood said. ‘This ain't sugar liquor,’ she said, ‘this is the real deal.’ Dawsonville Moonshine ad: 'Georgia Corn Whiskey'","The Dawsonville Moonshine Distillery is brewing its first batches of legal moonshine in Dawsonville, Georgia's city hall .

It takes a high level of fitness as well as a great deal of focus and dedication to achieve a black belt in taekwondo. So you would think that doing it while pregnant would be out of the question. But one single mother proved that she had what it took to become one of the few women to gain a fourth degree taekwondo black belt when she was eight months pregnant with her first child. Girl power: Katie Billingham trained for her fourth degree taekwondo black belt up until she was eight months pregnant . Katie Billingham, 29, put herself through a gruelling four-year schedule before gaining the qualification on October 25 this year. She said:  ‘It's such a long training period. ‘When I fell pregnant I just thought I will do what I can and keep going until the time comes when I have to stop. ‘I styled my training back as it got nearer because sparring would have been silly. ‘But you can lower the intensity and still get a lot out of it. And exercise during pregnancy is always very important anyway.' Gruelling: Miss Billingham, 29, underwent a four-year schedule before she gained the qualification in October this year . Can you kick it? Miss Billingham lowered the intensity of her training when she was heavily pregnant but said that exercise during pregnancy is important . Dedication: The single mother only stopped training when she 'was wobbling up and down' but continued teaching up until she went into labour . The former carnival queen fell pregnant with first son Leo, now two-years-old, midway through the training but remarkably, continued with her programme. And she only stopped fighting in December 2010 when she was eight months pregnant, one month before she gave birth by emergency caesarean a month later. She said: ‘I got together with my instructor for a Christmas meal and I decided I had to throw in the towel until I gave birth. Back to it: The single mother started training again just months after her first child Leo was born by caesarian . ‘I was wobbling up and down then. But I . continued teaching my classes until I went into labour, only calling to . cancel the class from the hospital bed. The single mother revealed she started training again just months after her first child Leo was born and was back to her best within a year. Miss Billingham, from Stourport in Worcestershire, added: ‘After giving birth I had to slowly ease myself into it. It was difficult because the whole mentality of taekwondo is to push yourself harder and harder. Katie Billingham, pictured five months pregnant, with Lord Sebastian Coe and her instructor Vince Farquharson at a sports promotional event . Achievement: Miss Billingham pictured with a certificate for her fourth degree taekwondo black belt . ‘I was back teaching after six weeks and it was a couple of months before I was training again. ‘I even didn't wear my black belt for . a while because I didn't feel I was at that standard. 'It took me a year . to get back and it was a difficult challenge but it was worth it.’ Miss . Billingham, who teaches taekwondo across the Midlands, gained the . fourth degree, or dan, at an assessment day in Bristol with 640 other . black belt holders this October. Despite giving birth midway through her training, she recorded the fifth highest score at the event. And the single mother, who is also a personal trainer and fitness instructor, revealed that slowing her training before she gave birth might have helped her. Katie, who started taekwondo aged just 12 and gained her first black belt when she was a student ten years ago, added: ‘I think lowering the intensity helped enable me to perfect the positions. ‘I think it's done me a lot of good in terms of my skills. ‘There's not many females above fourth degree and one of the reasons for that is child birth. ‘A lot of women feel they are not the same after that so stop. ‘I meet a lot of mums who lose themselves a bit after having children and I would like them to know that the body is still capable of amazing things. ‘I've got five years until my next degree but I haven't got any plans to have another child at the moment.’ In taekwondo, a black belt is not the highest qualification, as further degrees can be given, depending on the amount of time spent training. A ninth degree of black belt is the highest achievement but there is no known UK resident with that qualification.","Katie Billingham fell pregnant halfway through four-year training schedule .

Cheers rang out as one was intercepted before reaching the city, shot down by a newly-installed battery of Israel’s ‘Iron Dome’ missile defence system. The other crashed harmlessly into the Mediterranean. Hamas, the Islamist hardliners who run the Palestinian enclave, said Israeli air strikes hit 200 sites in Gaza, wrecking the office  of Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh – scene of a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart on Friday. The strikes also destroyed a police headquarters and the building housing the interior ministry. Officials said 41 Palestinians – nearly half of them civilians including eight children and a pregnant woman – had been killed since Israel began its air strikes on Wednesday. Three Israeli civilians were killed by a Hamas rocket the next day.

Surgeon and Health Minister Dr Mufeed Mkhallalati said: ‘They know this area is really populated – they know they are going to kill women and children. 'It is deliberate. Totally deliberate.’ An explosion seemed to go off every five minutes – even through the night – in Gaza. They rattled the windows and rocked the hotel in which we are staying.

'UMaine's Greek and international student communities are mourning the loss of three of their own, but they are not alone in their grief,' said Robert Dana, vice president for student affairs and dean of students. 'Losing these three young men - David, Marcelo and B.J. - is a loss for the entire UMaine community and the many people - including faculty and staff - whose lives they touched. They brought great light and energy to our campus, and we will miss them.' Fraternity brothers: Marcelo Rugini was the third of the victims, who met through their frat house . Their Cessna 172 was believed to be traveling about 100mph and had just gone airborne when it clipped a pickup truck that was driving across the runway. The plane kept climbing for a brief few seconds, reaching an altitude of about 100 feet, witnesses said. Then . it veered eastward and spiraled down about 300 yards into a . thickly-wooded area nearby and burst into flames, according to Knox . County Chief Deputy Sheriff Tim Carroll. The collision sent flames 10 to 20 feet in the air and smoke billowing into the sky, police said. One fraternity brother, senior Lucas . Bernardi, told the Bangor Daily News that the three had flown out of . Bangor International Airport earlier in the day and then toward Lincoln . County over a farm where one of the victims had worked over the summer. He said one of the victims had just earned his pilot's licence and wanted to take his friends for a fun ride. 'It wasn't the first time they had been flying,' Mr Bernardi told the newspaper. 'I was supposed to go with them, but I didn't.' Mr Hannigan, who graduated from the university in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, was piloting the plane and had been working on his flight hours, Dana said. Mr Cheney was a business major. Mr Rugini, who was from the town of Muliterno in southern Brazil, was an economics major.

The party is said to have been held just metres away from where Savile (pictured) was said to have carried out some of his worst sex offences . The party was just a few hundred yards from dressing rooms where Savile is said to committed some of his worst sex crimes. The bash was being held to celebrate the BBC  move from Bush House, its London home for over 70 years, to a new state of the art, multimedia broadcasting centre in the heart of the capital. A source told the paper staff had been in high spirits as they partied with food, music and drink. They said: 'It was your standard office party until one bright spark decided to play the Jim’ll Fix It theme tune on their iPod. Amazingly people seemed to love it and started dancing and cheering.' The source claimed it happened several times over the course of the evening  with the same reaction. They claimed it was only after one of the 'most ­disapproving stares anyone has ever seen' from a senior member of staff, that it stopped.The BBC refused to comment or give dates for when the party could have taken place. It confirmed the move to Broadcasting House started in April and will continue until next year.

For years it frustrated British intelligence with its fiendishly clever enciphering . A German Enigma coding machine has sold for more than £85,000. The rare device went under the hammer today and estimates expected it to sell for £40,000 to £60,000. However, a lively bidding session at Bonhams in Knightsbridge saw it fetch an impressive £85,250. Auction officials said there was a lot of interest with a large number of online and phone buyers joining those bidding in the auction room. A keen buyer from the US made the final bid and secured the historic machine. Built by Heimsoeth and Rinke in 1941, the oak-encased machine, which encrypted German codes during the Second World War, is the three-rotor version, used between 1938 and 1944. Patented by HA Koch at the end of the First World War, the device was intended for commercial purposes but by 1939 the majority of Enigma machines had been appropriated for German military use. The Enigma was the . most advanced machine of it's kind and analysts have argued it paved the way for modern . computer systems. Code-named Station X, its employees eventually broke the Enigma codes, with the help of Colossus . Colossus: The first electronic computer was designed and built by Tommy Flowers, a post office engineer . Using a complicated system of rotors, the machine would encode messages before sending them via Morse code to another machine. However, its downfall was the construction of the world’s first top secret computing machine, Colossus, at Bletchley Park near Milton Keynes. At its peak the team at Bletchley, who included Alan Turing, regarded by many as a mathematical genius, were cracking 6,000 encrypted German Enigma messages every day. Alan Turing played a key role at Bletchley Park during World War Two, where he worked as a codebreaker. Colossus Mark 2 is a rebuild of the original 'supercomputer' that helped Turing and others break Nazi codes . During the war messages scrambled by the Enigma machine were eventually decoded in under 24 hours. The fact that the British managed to crack Enigma is credited with shortening the war by two years. There were many battles taking place during Word War One and World War Two - apart from the military and propaganda wars, there was also a race to crack the enemies' coded messages. Bletchley Park, near Milton Keynes, was the site of secret British code-breaking activities during World War II. It was code-named Station X. It was the modern-day equivalent of GCHQ in Cheltenham and the government recruited thousands of people from a variety of backgrounds to take on the might of Hitler's intelligence machine. A German warship firing artillery during the Battle of Jutland . Winston Churchill referred to Bletchley as the goose that laid the golden eggs because it produced a daily stream of intelligence that helped guide his decision making. One particular success of intelligence was when British forces received information through decoding that vast numbers of naval German craft were assembling. During the following Battle of Jutland some 8,648 British and German sailors lost their lives on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Bletchley's biggest breakthrough came with the building of Colossus, the first electronic computer that helped British scientists crack German Enigma codes. There were many talented people at Bletchley, including Tommy Flowers, a post office engineer who designed and constructed Colossus, but perhaps the most celebrated is Alan Turing. Turing was a mathematical genius whose work was key in breaking the Enigma codes. Turing committed suicide at the age of 41, with some blaming persecution because he was homosexual.","A keen buyer from the US secured the historic machine .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:55 EST, 24 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:01 EST, 24 October 2012 . A 15-year-old Florida boy has admitted to shooting his mother two years after telling police that she was killed at the hands of an intruder. During a court hearing Tuesday, investigators said that Jonathan Rowles came clean to them that there was no break-in at his Naples home, and that he was the one who pulled the trigger one Sunday in August of 2010, gunning down his 39-year-old Mother, Kelly Rowles. 'He said, ""Yes, it was an accident, and I'm sorry for lying,""' Collier County sheriff's detective David Hurm Sr said during the hearing. Matricide: Jonathan Rowles, 15, left, admitted to killing his mother, Kelly, right, by accident in 2010 after initially blaming her death on a fake intruder . The Sheriff's Department has initially ruled the shooting an accident, but the State Attorney's Office decided to charge Rowles as a juvenile with manslaughter, the Naples Daily News reported. Police received a call shortly after 9am on August 22, 2010, about a shooting inside a condominium at 9288 Grassy Way in the Fiddler's Creek development. When officers arrived on the scene 13 minutes later, they found Kelly Ann Rowles dead from a gunshot wound to the head. During Tuesday's hearing, investigators who responded to the scene of the shooting two years ago described Jonathan Rowles' demeanor at the time as relatively composed. The 13-year-old boy chatted with police about video games and school, but started to cry when told that his mother was dead. ‘He was fairly calm, but he kind of looked nervous and upset,’ said Angela Larson, a victim's advocate who tended to Rowles on the scene. Larson testified that the boy initially said that a bald man wearing black gloves got into their home and shot his mother while he watched TV in another room. But when pressed further, Rowles' story turned vague, raising the officers' suspicions. ‘The information he was providing wasn't consistent with the physical evidence I was seeing on scene,’ Hurm said. Crime scene: Kelly Rowles was shot in the head inside her condo at 9288 Grassy Way in the Fiddler's Creek development in August 2010 . At that point, Rowles admitted to the shooting, Hurm said, but said it was an accident. In September 2010, the 13-year-old turned himself in at the Collier County jail, NBC2 reported at the time. This week, Rowles' public defender, Justin Barger, was seeking to suppress statements made by his client to investigators after the shooting stemming from allegations of coercion by law enforcement. Serious charges: Jonathan Rowles' father, Chris, is accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl in the course of three years . However, during the hearing, five Sheriff’s Office employees denied intimidating Rowles during questioning. Detective Hurm insisted that although he used a stern inflection at one point while interviewing Rowles, he did not yell at the teen. He pointed out that the boy struggled to grasp the meaning of the word 'intentional.' Hurm also said he went through Miranda rights at length, calling it 'the longest Miranda I've ever been involved with.' Two years after Kelly Rowles’ shooting, many questions remain unanswered, in part because juvenile records are sealed under Florida law, and in part because law enforcement officials have not been forthcoming with information about the case. Authorities have not revealed whether the mother and son had a turbulent or good relationship, nor whether Kelly Rowles’ death was international or accidental. It also remains unknown what exactly the boy told officials after the shooting. At an August hearing, Barger said Rowles has been living with his grandmother and doing well in school. Rowles' father, 42-year-old Christopher Rowles, was arrested in March and remains jailed on $100,000 bond for allegedly molesting a 14-year-old girl at least a dozen times over a three-year period. If convicted, Johnathan Rowles would not face any prison time because he is charged as a minor.","Kelly Rowles, 39, was shot in the head inside her Naples, Florida, condo in August 2010 .

An unemployed dance teacher has been sentenced to six months in jail for falsely accusing X Factor judge Louis Walsh of groping him in a nightclub. Leonard Watters pleaded guilty to making two false reports to Irish police that the pop music mogul sexually assaulted him in Dublin nightspot Krystle last April. The 24-year-old father-of-two from Navan, Co Meath, who was described in court as a Walter Mitty-type character, had apologised publicly to Mr Walsh at the city’s District Court. Passing sentence, Judge Dermot Dempsey immediately granted Watters bail to appeal against the decision, on condition that he lodged 100 Euros in cash with the court. Pleading for a non-custodial sentence, Watters’ solicitor, Cahir O’Higgins, said his client was a tragic figure whose life had been a litany of disasters from an early age. Watters was now a laughing stock and a joke, and had been treated as a pariah in his own community, he told the court. 'For ever and a day, he will be known as the guy who accused Louis Walsh in the wrong,' he said. At a previous hearing, Watters apologised to Mr Walsh. 'I would like to sincerely apologise to Mr Louis Walsh for all the stuff I put him through. The allegation was false,' he said. Detective .

'Monster': Alex Richter, 28, of Racine, Wisconsin is accused of molesting at least six young children and taping the assaults. A college student is accused of molesting at least six young children and videotaping the assaults under such titles as 'Monster Unleashed.' Alexander R. Richter, 28, who attended Gateway Technical College in Wisconsin, was jailed on 49 felony charges November 9. Police believe there are more victims to be found. Authorities say Richter volunteered to baby-sit his classmates' children and then repeatedly had sex with the boys and girls on camera as they cried and begged him to stop. When detectives served Richter with a search warrant he told them, 'I'll save you time, the things you are looking for are under the coffee table,' the criminal complaint said. Richter faces dozens of charges including first-degree sexual assault of a child under 13, sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography. Officers found an unspecified number of DVDs, a tripod, cameras and a hard drive in his house in Racine, Wisconsin. They said one DVD, titled 'Monster Unleashed,' showed Richter having sex in his home with four different children -- three girls and a boy. The youngest child, one of the girls, just turned 5 this month. In some of the footage, the children are crying and can be heard telling Richter to stop or seen trying to fight him off, according to the complaint. Police are looking to identify more victims. Authorities have been able to name six children who appear in videos and photographs from evidence seized at Richter's house. 'We're not putting a number on it, but from the evidence we've recovered we believe there are additional victims,' Racine police Sgt. Marty Pavilonis said. Accused child molester Alexander Richter, 28, offered to babysit for classmates at Gateway Technical College in Wisconsin. Richter approached at least one classmate last year, according to the criminal complaint, and offered to baby-sit her children - a son who was then 6 years old and a daughter who had just turned 4. He's accused of making at least 11 videos of himself having sex with both children, including one in which police say he guided the boy into attempted sexual activity with his sister. Prosecutors said Richter also had photos of the siblings posing naked and simulating sex acts with each other. The allegations came to light last month when the boy, now 7, touched another child inappropriately, the criminal complaint said. When confronted, the boy told his mother that was how 'Alex' touches him and his sister, according to the complaint. Investigators say the children told them Richter had oral and anal sex with them on multiple occasions, used sex toys on them and filmed them taking baths. Pavilonis said authorities are trying to determine whether any of the images have been shared with other people as child pornography. 'A number of investigators and officers have children,' the police sergeant said, 'and we certainly investigate as if our own children were involved.' Richter remains in jail after a judge set his bond at $1.5 million in cash.","DVD with kids crying as he abused them was titled 'Monster Unleashed'

The New York City police officer accused of plotting to kidnap, rape and cook at least 100 women has been indicted by a federal grand jury. Gilberto Valle was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping on Friday, facing him with life in prison if convicted in what his defence has argued was only a 'fantasy.' The six-year married veteran also faces a maximum of five years for illegally accessing the National Crime Information Center database to collect potential victims' address according to investigators. Indicted: Gilberto Valle has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in a twisted plot to allegedly torture, kill, cook and eat women . Not guilty: Valle, 28, is seen in this courtroom sketch last month with his public defender Julia Gatto, center, after pleading not guilty to criminal charges . Valle, 28, who works in Harlem, was . arrested by the FBI for the heinous plans in October after his estranged . wife reportedly tipped off police. Valle is being held without bail after a judge's ruling he posed a danger to the community. That judge also found enough evidence showing Valle had clear and convincing intent to carry out his plans. One such document on Valle's computer was . titled 'Abducting and Cooking (Victim 1): A Blueprint,' according to the . criminal complaint. The file also had the woman's birth date and other . personal information and a list of 'materials needed' - a car, . chloroform and rope. 'I was thinking of tying her body . onto some kind of apparatus ... cook her over low heat, keep her alive . as long as possible,' Valle allegedly wrote in one exchange in July, the . complaint says. Harrowing: He allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators . Shock: Valle's brother arrived at the apartment to collect his dog and was swarmed by reporters . Emails, computer files, and fetish . chats were retrieved from the NYPD officer’s computer. None of the women . was harmed, although a prosecutor said some of the women knew Valle and . he had stalked at least two of them at home or work - once in his . police car in a 'very intimidating fashion.' In other online conversations, . investigators alleged, Valle talked about the mechanics of fitting the . woman's body into an oven, noting that the women’s legs would have to be . bent, and discussed how 'tasty' one woman looked. 'Her days are numbered,' he wrote, . according to the complaint. That woman told the FBI she knew Valle and . met him for lunch in July. Public defender Julia Gatto had asked for bail, saying the Valle was only guilty of a 'deviant fantasy.' 'There's no actual crossing the line from fantasy to reality,' Gatto . said. 'At worst this is someone who has sexual fantasies about people he . knows and he talks about it on the Internet,' according to the AP. But Valle was arrested because he was . too close to carrying out the 'grotesque and disturbing' plots, . Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said. He had 'plans to kidnap, . rape, torture, kill and eat the body parts of young women, some of whom . the FBI has identified and they acknowledge knowing the defendant for a . period of time,' she said. Valle, a graduate of the University . of Maryland, where he studied psychology and criminal justice, was . suspended from the police force after his arrest. Scene: FBI searched his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens (pictured) and allegedly found lists of women on his home computer. One file was named: 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint' He allegedly created files on his . personal computer containing at least 100 women with at least one photo . of each, details of their physical characteristics and lists of their . addresses. He even . allegedly had a file named 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A . Blueprint' containing information including the woman's name, date of . birth, height, weight and bra size. FBI . agents tracked down 10 of his named victims who said they knew him. Phone records showed he was once outside the home of one woman, who told . investigators that she hardly knew him. In . another eerie message, Valle, who is believed to have married in June, . wrote that his knowing the victims would lead to a 'flawless' abduction . as his arrival 'will not alert her', the complaint noted. His co-conspirator, who has not been named, responded with equal excitement at the plans. 'I love that she is asleep right now not have the slightest clue of what we have planned,' Valle allegedly wrote, ABC reported. 'Her days are numbered... She does look tasty, doesn't she?' His alleged co-conspirator responded: 'You do know if we don't waste any of her, there is nearly 75 lbs of food there.' He also allegedly asked Valle, 'How big is your oven?' and 'What's your favorite cut of meat?' Their . bizarre relationship only became more deranged as Valle allegedly . offered to sell a woman to the other plotter in February for $5,000 so . that he could rape and kill her. But Valle said he would only deliver the . woman and would not get involved in the rape as 'I don't want to be . tempted the next time I abduct a girl', he wrote, prosecutors said. Vile: This photo shows a passage of a Federal complaint filed in New York on Thursday against Valle . Horrifying: The complaint shows Valle's in-depth plans for the kidnapping and killings of the potential victims . He allegedly added that the co-conspirator needed to ensure her body was not found. Valle is not known to have engaged in any of these plans, an officer told the New York Times on condition of anonymity. No women were harmed, the FBI confirmed. It is believed he has a young child; his estranged wife has commented on Facebook about needing a babysitter, while the New York Daily News noted that his home appeared to be child-proofed. Valle was suspended on Wednesday and arrested by the FBI, who worked in conjunction with the NYPD on the case, on Thursday. He is due to appear in a federal . court in Manhattan later today on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and . access of unauthorised computers. Secrets: Valle, pictured with his mother, was reportedly investigated after his wife tipped off authorities . Workplace: A police officer stands guard outside the 26th precinct where Valle worked. He allegedly used law enforcement databases to conduct surveillance on potential victims . 'The allegations in the complaint . really need no description from us,' Mary E. Galligan, the F.B.I. acting . assistant director, said in a statement. 'They speak for themselves. It would be an understatement merely to say Valle’s own words and actions were shocking.'

A Minnesota man with terminal cancer was miraculously cured while working to restore an old, abandoned church that needed as much as care as he did. Greg Thomas of Montgomery, Minnesota, was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in his head and neck three years ago, KARE11 News reports. He has since had difficult swallowing and uses a feeding tube for nutrition. Now, after spending months restoring the old wood-framed chapel, his cancer is believed to be in remission. Scroll down for video . Serenity: Greg Thomas, a cancer survivor, works on restoring the 126-year-old church he stumbled upon . Through the fields: Thomas walks with his dog . Thomas, who was 57 at the time of his diagnosis, was laid off from his job delivering propane. ‘When I found out that I had cancer, they told my family to go ahead and start planning my funeral,"" he told KARE11. To cope with his stress he started taking long walks though the countryside with his dog. Thomas came across the old church during one of those walks. The foundation was decaying and the paint was peeling. An old chapel: The church was in need of much care when Thomas found it . He attempted to go inside the chapel when he first noticed it, but it was locked. So he sat on the steps for a while. Built in 1868 by Catholic Czech settlers who later moved to a bigger parish, the old Church had not housed a congregation in more than a century. One day, Thomas decided to reach out to the few people living close to the church. Restoration: The church now sits in the same place with a new exterior . Salvation: With his cancer in remission, Thomas continues to work on the church . He was out of work, and thought fixing up the structure would give him a sort of sanctuary. ‘He went to a neighbor and said he wanted to paint the church, and who does he talk to, so the neighbor sent him to talk to me,’ Don Rynda, treasurer of the foundation that keeps up the church cemetery, told KARE11. Thomas went to repairing the church soon after. Now the old chapel is freshly clothed in white and Thomas’s cancer is in remission. Thomas said he plans to continue his work on the church, moving on to the roof and the interior next.

Couples should not try to emulate the glamorous weddings of the stars if they really want their marriages to last, a High Court judge said last night. The lavish ceremonies splashed across the pages of celebrity magazines such as Hello! have little to do with the reality of lifelong commitment, according to Sir Paul Coleridge. They are also twice as likely to end in divorce over ten years, according to research from the Marriage Foundation, the  charity Sir Paul launched  this year. Forty per cent of stars’ marriages end within a decade compared to just 20 per cent of ordinary couples’, the study found. Sir Paul Coleridge, left, has warned couples against developing false expectations of marriage from glossy magazines such as Hello!, pictured right . ‘The worrying feature of these . statistics is the picture they paint to those who regard the celebrity . lifestyle as something to be admired and copied for its own sake,’ Sir . Paul said. ‘These are, after all, the role models . upon which many, especially young people, fashion their lives. Aspiration for happiness built on celebrity lifestyle is, it seems, . dangerously flawed. All of us subconsciously want to believe that these . beautiful people are living an idealised life which we can vicariously . enjoy. ‘Surely this must create a false . expectation within the participants that in some way their relationships . will be better, easier and, above all, more exciting than the average. A wedding issue of Hello! magazine being read. The report says the celebrity culture absorbed from magazines like Hello! gives us an 'unrealistic, fairy-tale expectations about marriage' ‘Unfortunately all men and women, . glamorous or not, are riddled with the same weaknesses and shortcomings . which surface even quite soon after the excitement of the wedding has . died down.’ Sir Paul, a senior family court judge, . said real life has nothing to do with the stars’ love stories played . out in celebrity magazines and on TV. ‘There is a disconnect between the . nature of real long-term relationships and the dramatised and apparently . more exciting versions portrayed on screen or imagined for them by the . rest of us,’ he said. Katy Perry and Russell Brand, pictured left in 2010, were married for 14 months and Jennifer Lopez was married to dancer Cris Judd, right for eight months . 5 of the shortest celebrity marriages: . Britney Spears and Jason Alexander (55 hours) Sinead O’Connor and Barry Herridge (18 days) Drew Barrymore and Jeremy Thomas (30 days) Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon (60 days) Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries (72 days) 5 of the longest–lasting celebrity marriages: . Kirk Douglas and Anne Buydens (58 years) Barry and Linda Gibb (40 years) Jeff Bridges and Susan Geston (35 years) Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach (31 years) Tony and Cherie Blair (30 years) ‘This is surely exacerbated by huge, expensive . fairytale weddings attended by the icons of the day.’ The report pointed to the 55-hour . marriage between Britney Spears and Jason Alexander and said that ‘few . non-celebs can match that kind of relaxed attitude to their marriage’. Others whose marriages barely made a year include Russell Brand and Katy . Perry, and Kim Kardashian. Sir Paul said that while most celebrities hankered for a stable marriage like anyone else, their fame made it harder to find. ‘They pay the price by being even less able to sustain long-term healthy relationships than the rest of us,’ he said. The 40 per cent rate of celebrity . marriage break-ups over ten years was worked out from an examination of . 572 prominent celebrity weddings since 2000. It found a fifth were over . within four years, against just one in 20 of all marriages. The report said there were some starry . happy endings.

A generous rector handed out crisp £10 notes at his church service in the hope that parishioners would make a fortune to help with church repairs. Richard Steel, rector at Kirkheaton Parish Church, near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, put his hand in his own pocket to help with a final push to raise £73,000 to help renovate the church. Taking his cue from the Parable of the Talents in the Bible, where Jesus tells the story of a man who entrusts money to his servants, Richard wants to see some creative ideas for a return on his investment. Cash: Richard Steel, rector at Kirkheaton Parish Church, handed out £10 notes to his flock. He wants them to invest it and put the profit towards the renovation of the church . In the rather harsh parable - on the man's return he finds two of his servants had doubled the investment while the other, who rather missed the point, simply buried his money in the ground. Richard said: 'I handed out around £450, it was mainly just the regular congregation, I don't think anybody came along just to get the ten pounds. 'I'm still not entirely sure what people will do with the money but I'm looking forward to hearing about all the great investments. 'We need to raise the money for work we need to do on the church. Already £375,000 has been raised and a further £73,000 is needed and I thought this would be a good time to try it out.' Faith: Rector Richard Steel hands out the £10 notes to his parishioners to invest in the hope that parishioners will make a fortune to help with church repairs. Parable: The rector has taken inspiration from the biblical tale where a man entrusts money to his servants . He added: 'Not everyone in the church has money to give so I thought I'd offer them some ""seed capital"" to invest, maybe in baking cakes for sale, buying car washing kit, material to make cards or a woolly hat to keep warm when offering a dog-walking service. Charity: The money will be partially used to make the church a hub for the community . 'I want all, from the oldest to the youngest to feel involved in this exciting project and hopefully do some good and have some fun while they are doing it. 'People have until Easter to put their idea into action and return with the profits. 'The parable does have a sting in the tail. The servant who didn't use the money wisely was ""cast into the outer darkness"". 'Jesus was encouraging people to fully use the gifts they had been given for God, not to waste them, but I promise that, even if they make a loss, I won't be doing that to anyone.' The stunt is part of the final fundraising drive for a project which will see the church developed to make it more flexible for the wider community as well as church use. This will include installing a new floor, new heating system, kitchen and toilets, office, as well as entailing a complete redecoration and replacing the pews with chairs. Scaffolding is due to be put up this weekend at the church and from Easter Sunday church services will be held in Kirkheaton Primary School until the work is completed - probably in around six months' time. The parable can be read at Matthew, Chapter 24:14-30.","Rector Richard Steel handed out the cash so churchgoers can invest it .

Linked arm-in-arm, Paula Broadwell and her husband Scott were seen together yesterday evening for the first time since the news broke of her affair with shamed former CIA Director David Petraeus. Arriving at her brother's home in the Mount Pleasant suburb of Washington D.C. in a black SUV, the two put on what was a clear show of solidarity as they marched from the garage to the back door of the $2.3 million property. Since the scandalous revelations surrounding his wife first surfaced just over a week ago, Scott Broadwell has been conspicuous for his absence and his appearance last night indicates that he is standing by the West Point Graduate. Paula Broadwell arrives back at her brother's Washington D.C. home with husband Scott . Looking stern and taking the lead from her husband, the Paula Broadwell did not speak to the gathered news reporters as she marched into her sibling's home. Presumably, the pair had been out that evening, possibly at dinner and it is not clear when Scott arrived at the home or when Paula herself left. Indeed, this is the first time that Paula has been seen since Tuesday evening, when she was photographed wearing a hot pink top in the kitchen of her brother's home. She has been holed up there since returning from what was supposed to be a romantic get-away with Scott to celebrate her 40th birthday - which was curtailed when news of the Petraeus affair broke over one week ago. Paula Broadwell and her husband Scott parked their car in the garage at her brother's Washington D.C. home and then entered in through the back yard entrance . Friends and family of the pair told . reporters in the wake of the affair revelations that the Broadwell's had . built a happy home in Charlotte, North Carolina, where they live with . their two sons, Lucien 6, and Landon, 4. The radiologist works at a hospital . in the southern city and the 43-year-old and his wife  'love . to do Crossfit, run, ski and surf together.' according to a biography of Paula Broadwell published by the University of Denver, . In . January, while promoting her now fated biography of David Petraeus, . Paula Broadwell told the Charlotte Observer that she met Scott in . Germany and described them both as 'adventure junkies.' At . an alumni event for the University of Denver in October, Broadwell said . it was 'very difficult to start a family' when the two of them were on . active duty. 1841 Park Road in Washington D.C.'s affluent Mount Pleasant suburb is where Paula Broadwell and her husband Scott are now staying .

'We had decided before we got married that every other move would be the other person’s choice, since we are both very career-oriented,' said Paula Broadwell at the event. according to the Daily Beast . 'And he chose Colorado, he chose Denver.' They moved into their $800,000 two-story brick home in Charlotte's Dilworth suburb in 2009 and Scott became an employee of Charlotte Radiology at the same time. In the January interview with the Charlotte Observer Broadwell said that when she was abroad with Petraeus in Afghanistan, Scott and her mother took care of their two sons. Scott Broadwell and his wife have also been involved in a number of groups that work to benefit veterans of the armed forces. Since the affair broke, their home has been empty and visible on the driveway is power-washed writing, which reads in a flourishing font: ‘Dad loves Mom.’ Paula Broadwell's affair with . Petraeus was exposed after she sent a series of messages to Florida . socialite Jill Kelly, apparently warning her off her lover. The messages, which have been described as 'kind of cat-fight stuff',  had been sent anonymously to an account shared by Mrs Kelley and her husband, but FBI investigators traced them to Broadwell.

In another, the biographer of the . former CIA director was apparently aggressive towards Mrs Kelley, . saying: 'Who do you think you are?' She also accused the socialite, a . Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You . need to take it down a notch.' Kelley has denied being any more than . friends with Petraeus and released a statement saying: 'We and our . family have been friends with Gen. Petraeus for over five years.

It was intended as a 17th birthday celebration for his twin sons at the family’s holiday villa in southern Spain. But Stephen Mallon’s dream of a two-week break in Competa, with its labyrinth of pretty cobbled streets and spectacular views, ended in tragedy. Attacked by a mob of 30 men as he left a local bar with his sons, he died after spending 12 days in hospital in a coma. Stephen Mallon (right) had dreamed of a two-week break in Competa with his children Jenny, Peter and Carl. But, it ended in tragedy when he was attacked by a mob of men . Now three-and-a-half years later, the businessman’s body is still preserved in a British mortuary, while his devastated family wait for the Spanish courts to bring his killers to justice. Charges of manslaughter were brought 16 months ago but no trial date is yet set and Mr Mallon, originally from Glasgow, must remain, according to Spanish law, where he is until the case is over. But the delay has taken its toll on his grieving family, who have decided to speak of their ordeal for the first time in the hope a trial will take place soon, allowing them to finally find closure. Last night, Mr Mallon’s daughter Jenny, 23, a St Andrews University student, told The Scottish Mail on Sunday: ‘Our family has been destroyed by what happened to dad. He was a decent, honest man who loved his family. It’s hard for us to accept he’s gone. It’s like a nightmare we never wake up from.’ The family believe the killing was fuelled by anti-Britishness towards the expatriate community and are concerned for British families still visiting the area, oblivious to on-going ill-feeling. She added: ‘Dad was attacked by men with knuckle dusters, bottles and metal bars intent on inflicting harm. We couldn’t bear for this to happen to another family.’ Miss Mallon, who was at the family’s house in Bournemouth, Dorset, with her mother, Teresa, 45, when the attack happened, has had to rely on eye-witness accounts to piece together the moments before the assault. Mr Mallon and his sons, Carl and Peter, were attacked after leaving La Estrella pub, in Competa, a village the family liked for its quiet location away from the busy Costa del Sol resorts an hour away. An altercation in the pub beforehand, between a local youth and another British man, led to the bar owner closing the premises. Jenny Mallon said: 'Our family has been destroyed by what happened to Dad.' She told of how he was attacked by men with knuckle dusters, bottles and metal bars intent on inflicting harm . Her brothers, now 20 and promising boxers who hope to compete in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, were unable to help their father when the mob struck. Mr Mallon, wounded by a bottle to his head, was forced over a balcony, sustaining horrific injuries as he landed on concrete 25ft below. Miss Mallon said: ‘The Mayor has tried to play down anti-Britishness for fear it will affect tourism but we believe there is no other explanation. ‘Lies were spread that one of my brothers looked the wrong way at a local girl and that’s what started the fight. But my brothers were quite shy and unlikely to do that. ‘My dad hadn’t even been drinking – the post mortem showed no alcohol. They were just out for a nice meal and got dragged into this nightmare.’ The family are also angry about ‘insensitive’ treatment from police and medical staff. Miss Mallon and her mother flew to Malaga after a phone call from the twins. They found Mr Mallon, who suffered a brain haemorrhage, in intensive care in the city’s Carlos Haya Hospital. ‘Peter and Carl, their clothes covered in blood, one with a broken nose and the other a fractured right hand, hadn’t been allowed to see dad and had been left to sit outside on the grass all night waiting for news,’ said Miss Mallon. ‘Inside the hospital, we were desperate to know what was happening but there was no compassion. No one seemed to want to do anything to help us. Maybe they assumed my dad and brothers had caused the fight but it set the tone for the next 12 days. It was horrific.’ She also learned there appeared no sense of urgency in getting her father to hospital for the one hour journey to Malaga, despite his terrible injuries, and when paramedics eventually turned up in an ambulance, according to eye witnesses at the scene, they seemed more intent on texting on their mobile phones than rushing to Mr Mallon’s side. At police headquarters, the family were interrogated and the twins made to wait in cells before questioning. Miss Mallon said: ‘A bag with my dad’s blood-covered clothes was handed to my shocked mum. We refused to take it, saying the clothes might contain DNA evidence and they should be examined. Tests later identified a number of people. We thought it was unbelievable incompetence on their part.’ Days later, the family were told Mr Mallon would not recover and three doctors had decided to switch off his life support machine. ‘We were given an hour to say goodbye,’ added Miss Mallon. ‘I remember afterwards seeing two orderlies pushing my dad, his face covered, along the corridor, whistling as they passed by us. Mum and I were crying yet they didn’t seem to notice. The memory never leaves me.’ It was six months before he was repatriated and the family told he must be preserved in case of another post mortem. She said: ‘The Bournemouth coroner gave dad a place in the mortuary but we never imagined he would still be there three years on.’ The Mail on Sunday has learned a number of youths were arrested by police after the June 6, 2009, incident and questioned before being handed over to investigating magistrate, Silvia Coll Carreno, at a court in nearby Torrox ,to decide who should face charges. Sworn statements were taken from suspects, scenes-of-crime officers, paramedics and Mr Mallon’s sons in court hearings closed to the press and public. The magistrate has now finished her task and, in an indictment, has formally accused five Spaniards with manslaughter and another 12 with wounding and affray. They are all aged between 18 and 25. It is understood delays have been caused by a ‘minor’ administrative error, resulting in the indictment being returned to the Torrox court to be corrected and resent. Now prosecutors and defence lawyers will formally submit their reports on behalf of their clients to Malaga’s Provincial Court and a trial is expected to be held in six months. A court source said: ‘Prosecutors will outline the sentences and punishments they are asking for and their version of what happened the night of Mr Mallon's death and the defence lawyers will do the same. That hasn’t happened yet because of the large number of accused but the court hopes to be ready for trial in at least six months.’ But Miss Mallon, who has since learned to speak fluent Spanish in order to understand everything at the trial, is sceptical about the date. She said: ‘They keep saying six months, one month, two months….I hope for everyone’s sake it is finally going to happen.’ It is only through counselling from Scottish charity PETAL – People Experiencing Trauma and Loss - that Miss Mallon can finally talk about what her family have been through. The marine biology student, who developed post-traumatic stress following her father’s death and has struggled to cope with her university studies at times as a result, said: ‘It is like a form of torture and there is still no end in sight. How can we ever move on without being able to say goodbye or any sense of closure?’ She added: ‘We were a really close little family before this happened. Now we are all just functioning and frozen in time.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Stephen Mallon was set upon when left a local bar in Competa with his sons .

To one carcass found with its tail cut off in Louisiana, Mr Solangi said: 'Animals don't eat each other's tails off.' The resulting scene has speckled parts of the Gulf since earlier this year with bodies, though in recent months the IMMS says they’ve increased. In one case a carcass was found stabbed with a screwdriver in Alabama and in another on Elmer's Island, Louisiana a bullet was found in its lung in September. On Friday, a team went to Deer Island and found a second dolphin dead with a portion of his jaw missing. A dolphin found dead earlier near Gautier's coastline had a 9mm bullet wound.

A former minister has today condemned Government plans to cap household benefits at £500-a-week as 'immoral'. Former children's minister Sarah Teather accused ministers of seeking to 'gain popularity at the expense of children's lives' by pushing through a popular but ineffective measure. She said: 'I think deliberately to stoke up envy and division between people in order to gain popularity at the expense of children's lives is immoral. It has no good intent. Speaking out: Sarah Teather has hit out at plans by David Cameron and the Government to cap household benefits at £500-a-week . She added: 'There are all sorts of things you have to do when times are tight that have negative consequences but you do them for good purposes. 'But to do something for negative purposes that also has negative consequences - that is immoral.' The Lib Dem had faced calls for her sacking after missing a crucial vote on the reforms in February despite having publicly questioned them. She was eventually relieved of her government role in September's reshuffle. Teather said that the cap is merely a political device to 'demonstrate whose side you're on' rather than a move that will save the Government much money. She predicted a mass exodus of families from London who can no longer afford to live there because of the cap but who would struggle to find work in cheaper areas. Dismissive: A spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused Sarah Teather of hugely misinformed scaremongering . She told The Observer that child protection and education services might struggle to keep track of youngsters whose families are forced to leave London. But a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused her of hugely misinformed scaremongering. He said: 'The criticisms Sarah Teather is levelling against the Government's welfare reforms are hugely misinformed and therefore result in needless scaremongering.' 'It's not fair or right that benefits claimants receive higher incomes than hard-working families who are striving to get on in life. 'Our reforms bring fairness back to the system while ensuring we support the most vulnerable.' Exodus: Sarah Teather says that many families may be forced to leave London as they will be unable to afford to live there under the proposed benefit cap . Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party colleague was right to warn of the risks of 'very serious social consequences' but defended the need for a cap. It was required to prevent housing benefit 'escalating out of control' but had to be accompanied by an increase in the provision of affordable housing, he said. 'What is immoral, and I have read her article carefully, is demonising poor people.' He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'We have got to cap the housing benefit element while at the same time increasing the supply of affordable housing. 'That is absolutely critical because without that you will have very serious social consequences which Sarah has quite rightly warned about.' Defiant: Business secretary Vince Cable defended the cap on benefits despite the attack from his party colleague Sarah Teather . Labour has posted a 12-point opinion poll lead over the Tories - its widest margin of advantage in a ComRes survey for more than seven years. The Opposition gained two points to 43 per cent on a month ago and the Conservatives dropped two to 31 per cent, in the poll conducted for the Independent on Sunday and Sunday Mirror. It showed the Liberal Democrats static on 10% and Ukip down one on 8 per cent. Two thirds of voters also backed a cut in British contributions to the EU as Prime Minister David Cameron prepares for a Brussels summit later this week to discuss the future budget. Tory rebels joined forces with Labour last month to defeat the Government by pushing through a call for a real-terms cut. Mr Cameron is arguing for a real-terms freeze. In the poll, 66 per cent said UK payments 'should be cut rather than frozen' with 12 per cent against and 22 per cent unsure. A majority (58 per cent) also agreed that Britain should withdraw from the EU altogether 'if some EU powers cannot be restored to the UK', including a 53 per cent majority of Labour voters. Even Liberal Democrat voters backed that stance by a margin of 39 per cent to 32 per cent. Asked if the UK should 'leave the EU regardless', 43 per cent agreed - with more Tory and Labour supporters backing the policy than not. While nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of Lib Dem voters agreed, a clear 57 per cent were opposed. ComRes interviewed 2,024 British adults online between November 14-16.","Sarah Teather has condemned the benefits cap as 'immoral'

Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said he took time out every day to pray and claimed the police force was a 'family' which had been devastated by the tragedy . ‘You do often feel so helpless, so praying for the dead officers, praying for their families, becomes your own reaction, your own expression of hope really for them, at a time of great need.’ Despite the tragedy, the chief constable, who was speaking on the BBC’s Songs of Praise, said he firmly believed police officers in the UK should be unarmed. He said: ‘We believe very much in what Robert Peel laid down for us back in 1829, that we are a routinely unarmed police force, that we use the minimum of force and that we have this close, very close, connection with the community that we serve and that is really, really important to us.’ The Chief Constable said a vigil would take place for both his staff and the public one week on from the killings.

A mother who is refusing to pay a fine for taking her son out of school in term time to attend her wedding in the Caribbean will appear before magistrates next week. Frances Harden, 31, was denied permission to take Harrison, 13, out of school for the wedding in April but went ahead anyway and was fined £50 on her return from the 14-day trip. She believes the school’s decision was unreasonable and says she refused to pay the local council’s anti-truancy penalty on principle. Her refusal has since resulted in the fine doubling to £100, and now she has been summonsed to appear in court. Bride: Frances White with her husband Nick Harden and her sons Harrison (centre right) and Alex at her wedding in St Lucia. She is due to appear before magistrates next week after refusing to pay a town hall fine for taking Harrison out of school so he could attend the ceremony . Absent without leave: Harrison walks his mother down the aisle during the Caribbean ceremony . Beach wedding: Stockport Council has now summoned Ms White to court after she refused to pay a fine for taking Harrison out of school during term time . Mrs Harden said: ‘It is ridiculous. I can understand why these rules are needed for people who abuse the system, but this was a one-off in exceptional circumstances – our wedding day. ‘We had to book it during term time because we both work full time and it was the only time everyone could get there.’ Mrs Harden, a care assistant from Stockport, began planning the £8,000 wedding at a four-star hotel on the island of St Lucia in 2011 and one of the highlights of the beach ceremony was for Harrison to give her away. She says that when she realised the wedding would not fall in the middle of his Easter holiday, as she had expected, she repeatedly tried to email his headmistress Dr Rose Hegan at Marple Hall School in Stockport. Going to court: Ms White and Harrison outside his school gates in Marple near Stockport . Summons: The letter Stockport Council sent to Ms White after she refused to pay the fine . Dream wedding: Ms White had been planning her big day for more than a year . A month before the wedding, she was eventually refused permission to take Harrison, her son from a previous relationship, out of school. Heading to court: Ms White has refused to pay the council's fine on principle . Her younger son Alex, six, was allowed by his primary school to take time off. Mrs Harden, whose husband Nick, 32, is a project manager, will face a charge of failing to ensure Harrison’s attendance at school when she appears before Stockport magistrates. She said: ‘The system is inconsistent and I’m refusing to pay the fine out of principle. I want to make a point in court and I’ll be representing myself. I am expecting a £1,000 fine, but I don’t care. ‘I want something to change because I think it’s preposterous letting some children off and not others. I didn’t have a problem with Alex’s school –  they embraced it.’ A spokesman for Marple Hall School said it was obliged to follow local authority and government ‘guidance which is clear that permission for holidays can be given only rarely’. Stockport Council said: ‘As schools are closed for 13 weeks a year, there is ample opportunities for holidays or family celebrations to take place outside of term time. ‘Where term-time holidays take place without the approval of the school, parents are liable to receive fixed-penalty fines.’","Frances White refused to pay town hall fine for her son's 11-day absence .

Jason Corkovic insisted that he needed to wear a hoodie because he hoped to work in the building trade when he was released from prison and might need one. The astonishing claim was made by his lawyer, Jane Miller, after the 41-year-old and two accomplices were convicted of a plot to rob £90,000 from a cash delivery van. ‘There are factors such as rain to contend with,’ she told a judge. ‘When one walks down the street one likes to keep one’s head dry. ‘I wonder whether to prevent a person from wearing a top with a hood, being a gentleman in Manchester, which has a propensity to endure rain, might be to have his human rights interfered with.’ But Judge Roger Thomas QC told Corkovic he should wear a traditional flat cap instead. ‘Let’s not be silly about this – you say Mr Corkovic is a gentleman, well then, he can use a furled umbrella,’ he added. ‘Or what about a flat cap?

A 7-year-old girl once cared for by a Houston, Texas woman convicted of murder after a fire at her home day care killed four children told jurors Thursday that the woman previously left several babies unattended while she took other children to McDonald's. Jurors heard the child's testimony during the punishment phase of Jessica Tata's trial. She was found guilty Tuesday of one count of felony murder in the death of 16-month-old Elias Castillo and faces up to life in prison. Prosecutors said the February 2011 fire that killed Elias started after Tata left a group of children alone with a pan of oil on a hot stove while she went shopping at Target. Along with the four children who died, three were injured. Home daycare operator Jessica Tata was convicted on Tuesday of murder over the death of Elias Castillo, one of four children who died in a fire at her home . Emotions: Rosie Castillo, center, grandmother of 16-month-old victim Elias Castillo is visibly distressed as she walks out of Tuesday's closing arguments . Tata's attorneys say she never intended to hurt the children, who ranged in age from 16 months to 3-years-old and she tried to save them. Brighten Long, who was enrolled with her brother at Tata's day care, told jurors that Tata had left children alone before. She said Tata once took her and several other children to eat at a McDonald's but left some babies alone in her home. Prosecutors said this happened in July or August 2010. ‘Did she leave the babies by themselves in the house when you went to McDonald's?’ prosecutor Connie Spence asked the girl. ‘Yes,’ said Brighten, who held a doll in her lap as she sat on the witness stand. Brighten said Tata and the children brought the food back to the day care and ‘the babies were still in the cribs’ when they returned. She did not say how many babies were left alone. Brighten's mother, Holly Long, told jurors that after her daughter told her what happened, she pulled the girl and her brother out of Tata's daycare. The siblings were only in Tata's care for two to three weeks, Long said.

On several occasions, she knocked on the door and no one answered but she could hear children inside, she said. Tata's daycare van, which Lay had seen in the neighborhood, was not in the driveway. ‘You could hear children playing. You could hear them laughing. You could hear them talking,’ Lay said. ‘Nobody would answer the door.’ Lay said a woman she didn't know answered the door once, but the woman couldn't answer questions about the day care. Authorities say Tata was the only authorized employee of the day care. Alfredo Galvan, a former investigator with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told jurors he investigated Tata, who had received food stamps from December 2007 to February 2011, and determined she had committed welfare fraud. The court heard that Tata, who had fled to Nigeria after the fire, had also committed welfare fraud .

Pardoning a lucky turkey ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday has been a tradition for nearly half a century, started by President John F. Kennedy, and carried on by each president since. But now PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has sent a letter to the president imploring him to put a stop to the ‘sorely outdated’ ceremony that ‘makes light of the mass slaughter of some 46million gentle, intelligent birds.’ The animal rights organization asked the president to forego the tradition and instead put a Tofurky roast on the holiday table. Pardoning: Obama pardons Courage the National Thanksgiving Turkey in 2009 . Tasty treat? In 2010, Mr Obama pardoned Apple while his daughters Sasha and Malia look on; he joked in 2009 that they were the reason he didn't eat the pardoned bird . Liberty and justice for all: Last year, a 45-pound bird named Liberty was the lucky turkey to get a presidential pardon . PETA President Ingrid E. Newkirk wrote to Mr Obama, saying that the annual turkey pardon ‘makes light of the mass slaughter’ of each turkey and ‘portrays the United States’ president as being in some sort of business partnership with the turkey-killing industry.’ She wrote that Tofurky – turkey made from tofu – is a ‘delicious, healthy’ alternative to eating a turkey. By Tuesday night, Ms Newkirk said that she received no official answer from the White House either way, though it seems highly unlikely that Mr Obama would cancel the Wednesday afternoon ceremony. Earlier Tuesday, the official White House Facebook page posted a picture encouraging users to vote for which turkey should be the official bird of the 2012 holiday – Cobbler or Gobbler. The White House blog compiled a short biography for the two birds, saying that both were born on a farm in Rockingham County, Virginia. Fight for the right: An activist of animal rights group PETA holds a sign and a box of Tofurkey, a vegetable protein turkey replacement in front of the White House in 2010 .

Cobbler craves cranberries, is known for his strut, and enjoys the musical styling of Carly Simon. ‘Gobbler, a patient but proud bird, loves to nibble on corn and enjoys any music with a fiddle.’ Following the pardoning, both turkeys will be transported to Mount Vernon, the estate of George Washington, where they will be placed in a custom-made pen at the livestock facility. Mr Obama joked with reporters in 2009 that his daughters Malia and Sasha were the true saviors of the turkey that year. ‘I was ready to eat this sucker,’ he said. ‘I’m told Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson actually ate their turkeys,’ Mr Obama continued. ‘You can’t fault them for that; that’s a good-looking bird.’ Contender: Cobbler is one of the turkeys up to be this year's official turkey, and enjoys strutting and eating cranberries .

The European Union would maintain Britain's £3billion rebate and make further cuts in overall spending in its next seven-year EU budget, according to its latest draft compromise drawn up ahead of a vital summit later this month.The proposals, made by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, could help appease Britain and other austerity-minded governments keen to limit their contributions to the union's finances, as the bloc tries to reach a deal ahead of a budget meeting on November 22 and 23.But further cuts - proposed by Britain, Sweden and others - to farm subsidies and development funds for poorer countries are likely to face opposition from France and former communist Eastern European states. Herman Van Rompuy: The EU President's proposals could help to appease the UK by offering the chance for it to retain £3billion . The European Union pays a refund of £3billion back to the UK on its contribution to the EU budget. 'The existing correction mechanism for the United Kingdom will continue to apply,' said a draft proposal sent to capitals late last night. Linked rebates for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden would also remain, but Austria would lose its refund. The draft outlines further cuts of about 27 billion euros from a proposal drafted by the Cypriot EU presidency at the end of last month.The Cypriot plan already reduced the roughly 1 trillion euro ($1.3 trillion) budget proposed for 2014-2020 by more than 50 billion euros, meaning the overall reduction from the European Commission's original plan now lies at about 80 billion euros.That is unlikely to be deep enough to satisfy countries like Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands, who are pushing for cuts of between 100-200 billion euros to the Commission blueprint. The European Parliament's demands for a 6.8 per cent increase in spending - despite the economic crisis - saw budget talks dramatically stall yesterday. Prime Minister David Cameron has signalled his refusal to approve the 9billion euro (£7.2billion) increase, insisting the EU should live within its means like families at home. Austerity-minded: David Cameron has warned that the EU cannot continue to increase spending . The deepest cuts in the latest proposal fall on EU cohesion funds used for building motorways, bridges and other infrastructure projects in less developed regions, which have been reduced by about 17 billion euros.Farm spending, which had been left largely untouched in the Cypriot compromise, is reduced by nearly 15 billion euros in the Van Rompuy proposal, including a cut of 8 billion euros in direct subsidies.France has long threatened to oppose any plan that reduces payments to farmers, which currently account for about 40 percent of all EU spending.But Britain, Sweden and others would like the EU to reduce spending on farm subsidies to free up funds for research, energy projects and other measures to boost economic growth.'The revised proposal means some small steps in the right direction but it's not enough,' Sweden's EU Minister Birgitta Ohlsson said in a statement on the proposals. 'We need a clear model for reducing agriculture subsidies.'The proposal from Van Rompuy also suggests that two-thirds of receipts from a new financial transaction tax planned by about a dozen EU countries should be paid directly to the bloc's budget, in return for an equivalent cut in those countries' national contributions.But the idea is unlikely to win the support of the countries involved.","Herman van Rompuy to appease London ahead of critical meeting by offering UK chance to keep £3billion .

Squeezed into a cattle truck under the watchful gaze of Nazi soldiers, this haunting photograph captures Polish Jews being expelled from their homes at the outset of what was to become the deadliest phase of the Holocaust. Part of a collection that has come to light for the first time in around 70 years, the picture is believed to have been taken in 1941 as German forces established Lublin Ghetto in east Poland, confining the district's Jewish community of around 40,000 into a single, tightly packed area. The following year the ghetto was 'liquidated' as part of Operation Reinhard, and tens of thousands of Lublin Jews were herded into trucks once more - this time bound for the Nazi death camp Belzec. Doomed: The chilling photographs, revealed for the first time in more than 60 years, were taken as the Jewish occupants of Lublin Ghetto were herded on to cattle tracks to be transported to Nazi death camps . The chilling photographs of the resettlement of Lublin Jews have emerged after owner Raymond Krzyzewski sent them to a local historian in the city last week. The pictures were smuggled from Lublin by Mr Krzyzewski's father, who had worked for the Jewish Central Welfare Committee in the district at the time. March 1941: Ernst Zorner, the district's Governor, proclaimed the establishment of a ghetto in Lublin. October 1941: The Nazi administration began preparing the eventual expulsion of the Jews of Lublin - apart from the 25,000 working for the German Army, the S.S., and police. Early 1942: Lublin Ghetto was divided into two sections, with Ghetto A housing unemployed Jews and Ghetto B the remainder . 16 March 1942: Lublin Ghetto was surrounded by S.S., many sick and elderly Jews were shot in the street . Later, it was ordered that 1,500 people per day were to be deported 'to the east for work' 17 March 1942: The first of Lublin's Jews were deported to the Belzec extermination camp . By 14 April 1942 around 26,000 Jews had been sent to their deaths at Belzec from the ghetto. The remainder were sent to the nearby Madjan Tatarski Ghetto where many were killed, and others were sent to the Majdanek death camp. The proximity of the photographer to the . subjects in the chilling images has led historians to conclude they . were taken by German troops. Historian Jakob Chmielewski said: 'We received a collection of five images that are likely to have been taken between 10 and 13 March 1941 at the time the Germans were carrying out their expulsion of Jews from the Jewish quarter. 'They wanted to create a ghetto and rid Lublin of the Jews, which they did on March 24, 1941. 'We know that they are from before the liquidation of the ghetto in 1942 because that happened at night time, so these clearly aren’t from then,' the historian said. 'Also, you can see that the Jews are clearly being prepared for deportation as they have the remains of their belongings with them. 'I think the photos were probably taken by other Germans, because of the proximity of the photographer to the soldiers. 'It seems that some of the Germans are posing and smiling - they seem quite at ease,' said Mr Chmielewski. 'And it’s interesting to note that two of the photos show Jews posing. My guess is that these were to be used as propaganda.' Lublin Ghetto was one of at least 1,000 established in German-occupied and annexed Poland and the Soviet Union alone. In 1942, Lublin Ghetto became one of . the first to be liquidated by the Nazis, with the majority of its . prisoners deported to the Belzec extermination camp between March 17 and . April 11 that year. Jewish residents of the ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland can be seen holding their belongings as they were made to form a line under the watchful eye of German soldiers . The fact that the three elderly men are posing has led historians to conclude the photos were taken by German soldiers and used for propaganda purposes . The remainder were sent to the nearby Majdan Tatarski Ghetto, and were either killed there or sent to the Majdanek death camp. Of the some 40,000 Lublin Jews, no more than 300 are thought to have survived the horrors of Nazi occupation. Operation Reinhard was the name given to the Nazi plan to murder Polish Jews in the General Government area of the country during the Second World War. The operation marked the introduction of extermination camps, and saw as many as two million people - almost all Jews - sent to Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka to be murdered. Harrowing: Ghettos like Lublin were created by the Nazis for the purpose of isolating, exploiting, and then eradicating Jewish populations in territories they occupied .

Icon: Art Ginsburg, popularly known as Mr Food, died of pancreatic cancer on Wednesday. He was 81 years old . Art Ginsburg, the delightfully dorky television chef known as Mr Food, died at his home in Weston, Florida, on Wednesday following a struggle with pancreatic cancer. He was 81. Ginsburg - who enticed viewers for decades with a can-do focus on easy weeknight cooking and the tagline 'Ooh! It's so good!' - was diagnosed just over a year ago. The cancer had gone into remission following early treatments and surgery, but returned earlier this month. Ginsburg had an unlikely formula for success in this era of reality cooking shows, flashy chefs and artisanal foods. With a pleasantly goofy, grandfatherly manner and a willingness to embrace processed foods, Ginsburg endeared himself to millions of home cooks via 90-second segments syndicated to 125 local television stations around the country. And though he published 52 Mr Food-related cookbooks, selling more than 8 million copies, he was little known to the nation's foodies and mostly ignored by the glossy magazines. That was the way he liked it. 'They're on the Food Network. They're getting a lot of national publicity. And they're getting big money,' he said of fellow food celebrities during a 2010 interview with The Associated Press. 'I was always the hometown guy. I don't want to be the super celebrity. When you need bodyguards, that's not my deal.' Ginsburg grew up in the meat business, and eventually started his own catering company. He made his television debut in 1975 in upstate New York on a local morning program. His Mr Food vignettes were syndicated in nine television markets by 1980. His popularity peaked in 2007, when he was appearing on 168 stations. Friendly face: With grandfatherly manner and a willingness to embrace processed foods, Ginsburg endeared himself to millions of home cooks via 90-second segments syndicated to 125 local television stations around the U.S. He also was generous with the enviably broad reach of his culinary pulpit, frequently inviting up-and-coming celebrities to do guest appearances with him. 'Art Ginsberg was a warm, gregarious man who knew food is more about love and sharing than a fancy ingredient list,' said Rachael Ray, who Ginsburg invited on air long before she was a huge celebrity. 'He was a supportive and loyal friend and I'll miss his smile and warm hugs. This Thanksgiving I'm thankful I knew him.' In recent years, Ginsburg eased his involvement in the day-to-day operations of the company he founded, Ginsburg Enterprises Incorporated, which produces the television segments and oversees his many other ventures, including a line of housewares. The company also produced television segments that did not star Ginsburg, billing them as the 'Mr. Food Test Kitchen.' It plans to continue producing and syndicating those segments.","Ginsburg lost his battle with pancreatic cancer .

His mother, who contacted police last . week out of concern her son was planning a shooting, said Tuesday that . he has shown signs of Asperger's syndrome, borderline personality . disorder and other conditions. She said her son has had inpatient . treatment in the past. ‘He didn't ask to be born different. He grew up his whole life in (his sister) Kristyn's shadow. He wanted to . be successful and be somebody,’ Tricia Lammers said during a news . conference at the National Alliance for Mental Illness in Springfield, . KLOR-TV reported. ‘Just two weeks ago he asked me - . both my kids still call me mommy - he said, `Mommy, do you think I'm a . failure?’ I said, “No Blaec, I don't.”’ Her son was arrested last week after . she told police she was concerned he ‘may have intentions of shooting . people’ during the opening weekend of the last instalment in the popular . vampire movie franchise. According to a police probable cause . statement, she said she believed her son had amassed weapons similar to . those used by the gunman who attacked a theater in Aurora, Colorado, . during the latest Batman movie in July. That attack killed 12 people. 'Mentally ill': The 20-year-old is said to have suffered from depression and been off his medication . Investigators later determined Lammers had recently purchased two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition. Lammers' parents also tipped off . authorities about the previous Walmart incident. The 2009 police report . said Lammers' mother called authorities after finding a suicide note . from her son and a missing kitchen knife. An officer was en route when the . mother said her son's vehicle had been found in the parking lot of the . Walmart store in Bolivar, a town about 130 miles southeast of Kansas . City. The parents said in 2009 that Lammers . had been diagnosed with depression, and his mother said Lammers had an . appointment that day with his psychologist and ‘he has been acting . different since then.’ According to a probable cause . statement in the movie theater case, Lammers was questioned Thursday . afternoon and told authorities he bought tickets to a Sunday Twilight . screening in Bolivar and planned to shoot people inside. Lammers also said he planned to ‘just . start shooting people at random’ at the Walmart store less than a mile . away, so if he ran out of bullets, he could ‘just break the glass where . the ammunition is being stored and get some more and keep shooting until . police arrived,’ investigators wrote. The probable cause statement said . Lammers was ‘off of his medication,’ but his mother said Tuesday that to . her knowledge, that wasn't true. The 20-year-old admitted to police . that he was inspired by a number of well-publicized mass shootings, such . as James Holmes' attack on a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises in . Aurora, Colorado in July. Lammers was reported to police by his mother, according to the Springfield News-Leader, after she became concerned when he bought two guns despite never having been shooting before. 'Quiet': The suspect described himself as a 'loner' and admitted he had had 'homicidal thoughts' She said they reminded her of the . weapons used in the Aurora shooting, in which 12 audience members were . killed, and feared her son might be planning a similar atrocity. He . voluntarily attended an interview with Bolivar police, and initially . claimed that he had bought the guns in order to go hunting. But . when officers brought up well-known gun massacres, Lammers 'stated that . he had a lot in common with the people that have been involved in those . shootings', according to a police report. Lammers then confessed he had bought two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition with the intention of shooting movie-goers at the Twilight screening on Sunday, to which he had already bought a ticket. He visited a nearby town earlier this week to practice shooting at a range. The suspect also said he was thinking about going to the local branch of Walmart to 'just start shooting people at random', so that he would have access to extra ammunition if he ran out of bullets. On Friday morning, Lammers was charged with first-degree assault, making a terrorist threat and armed criminal action, according to court documents. Death: Lammers had bought a ticket to the new Twilight film where he planned to launch his massacre . Inspiration: Lammers planned to imitate James Holmes, who killed 12 movie-goers in Aurora, Colorado . 'Thankfully we had a responsible family member or we might have had a different outcome,' Bolivar police chief Steve Hamilton said. He said Lammers is under a doctor's care for mental illness, and court documents said he was 'off of his medication.' Mr Hamilton said it appeared that Lammers obtained the firearms legally but that police were continuing to investigate 'to determine how in fact he was able to obtain a permit.' Ashley Miller, who lives in a nearby town, said she has known Lammers for about a year and described him as 'one of the sweetest guys I had ever met' but 'very emotional,' noting he would periodically stop talking to her. She said he told her that he had bounced between relatives growing up. As an adult, he bounced between girlfriends, she said. 'He was never actually happy,' she added. 'I think he had depression or something.'","Blaec Lammers followed a male clerk for more than two hours with a knife in his hand .

Entire new towns and cities must be built across the country to tackle Britain’s housing crises, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was time to ‘rediscover that proud tradition of creating new places’. In a speech to the National Housebuilding Council, Mr Clegg warned that without a dramatic increase in house building home ownership would remain a ‘pipe dream’ for a generation of young people. Nick Clegg warned babyboomers of the fifties and sixties are now watching their children struggle to buy a home . The Government is making £225 million available funding to 'unblock' a series of major local housing projects which have 'hit a wall'. Together, the schemes - which range in size from 4,000 units to 9,500 - will provide up to 48,600 new homes. But Mr Clegg said the shortage of homes is becoming so acute, there will in future need to be even more ambitious, with new developments of 15,000 to 25,000 homes. He said housebuilders should draw inspiration from the garden cities of early 20th century, such as Letchworth and Welwyn, and the new towns of the post-war era like Milton Keynes and Stevenage. ‘We can either condemn ourselves to haphazard urban sprawl – the surest way to damage the countryside,’ he said. ‘We can cram ever more people into existing settlements, concreting over gardens and parks – and bear in mind we already build the smallest homes in Western Europe. ‘Or we can build places people want to . live. Places which draw on the best of British architecture and design, . which have their own identity and character. ‘Which, rather than destroy the countryside, actually have a crucial role in keeping it intact. ‘Places put together in a way that makes sense for modern British families.’ Leafy: Clegg wants to 'unblock' a series of major local housing projects to emulate success of Letchworth in Hertfordshire (pictured) Mr Clegg announced the European Investment Bank will be injecting £400m into the UK affordable housing sector to help build new energy efficient affordable homes. He said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a 'generational shift' in the debate, with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted. 'The babyboomers of the fifties and sixties, people who were largely catered for by the massive housing expansion after the Second World War, are now watching their children struggle.' He went on: 'The plight of the next . generation is making what was an abstract housing shortage increasingly . tangible and real. And as we, as a society, become more open to . development that creates the space for politicians to be bold.' Mr Clegg warned Britain is already building 100,000 fewer houses than is needed every year. Over . the next decade, each year, the UK is going to grow by around 230,000 . households, he said. ‘Last year we managed to complete 117,000 – just . over half. ‘Unless we take . radical action, we will see more and more small communities wither, our . big cities will become ever more congested as we continue to pile on . top of each other,  and the lack of supply will push prices and rents so . high that unless you or your parents are very rich, for so many young . people, living in your dream home is going to be a pipe dream.’ Concerned: The Deputy Prime Minister warns that unless radical action is taken to boost housebuilding, for many young people their dreams of a home of their own will be no more than a 'pipe dream' He said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a 'generational shift' in the debate, with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted. 'The babyboomers of the fifties and sixties, people who were largely catered for by the massive housing expansion after the Second World War, are now watching their children struggle,' he is expected to say. 'The plight of the next generation is making what was an abstract housing shortage increasingly tangible and real. And as we, as a society, become more open to development that creates the space for politicians to be bold.' Dr Adam Marshall, policy director of the . British Chambers of Commerce said: 'Unblocking stalled sites alone is . not enough. We would challenge the government to be more ambitious and . increase the Homes and Communities Agency’s (HCA) target by a further . 100,000 homes by 2015, which would provide a substantial return in . economic growth.'","Deputy Prime Minister uses speech to say that .

In Britain we like to think our native spiders aren’t capable of delivering a bite that could kill us. But Natalie Hemme, 31, feared she would either die or lose an arm after being bitten by one of the creatures in her house as she slept. The arm swelled up so much that the blood flow was blocked and the limb became infected. Natalie Hemme nearly had her arm amputated when she developed compartment syndrome after being bitten by a spider whilst asleep at her Surrey home . As the flesh on it began to die, doctors warned they may have to amputate to save her life. ‘I was in that much pain when they told me I needed my arm amputated I didn’t even care,’ said Mrs Hemme, a civil servant. ‘It was agony and I know I have been . very lucky to survive and keep my arm. I can’t believe all this happened . over a bite from a house spider. 'You’d expect it in Australia, but not here.’ Mrs Hemme, from Wallington in Sutton, South-West London, woke up to find a red bite on her left wrist in February. Over the following two days, her arm began to swell and throb and her local NHS clinic prescribed antibiotics. But over the next few days her . condition deteriorated and her husband Michael, 35, had to dial 999 when . she began vomiting and couldn’t stand up. She was taken to St George’s Hospital . in Tooting, where she was diagnosed with Compartment syndrome – a . condition in which tissue such as muscle dies off because the blood . vessels supplying it have been squeezed shut by pressure on them. She was treated with antibiotics to . control the deadly infection causing the swelling, but was warned she . would most likely lose her arm. Following physiotherapy after being bitten, Mrs Hemme has now regained the some movement and has returned to work . She added: ‘By now it looked like a balloon. I honestly thought I was going to die.’ In a three-hour operation surgeons managed to strip away most of the infected tissue. They stopped short of amputating the limb but warned Mrs Hemme she might still lose it. For the next three days she was taken back to theatre daily for more infected tissue to be removed. A week later it was infection-free and surgeons rebuilt Natalie’s arm using tissue from her thigh. Following physiotherapy, she has regained some movement and has now been able to return to work. She said: ‘My arm and leg are both badly scarred but I’m lucky to be alive. Now I always check the bed for . spiders and insects. At first I was worried it must have been a foreign . spider, but the doctors assured me it wasn’t. ‘Whatever bit me was the usual kind of creepy crawly that lives in houses across Britain. 'In this country we don’t worry about such bites but I want to warn other people to be aware of what can happen.’","Natalie Hemme .

The vast majority of Britain’s traffic lights are dangerous and should be ‘torn down’, according to the chairman of the National Trust. Sir Simon Jenkins believes the signals are a means of ‘state control’ which cause more accidents than they prevent. In an impassioned plea, Sir Simon argues that as a nation we have become ‘obsessed’ with traffic lights and that if he were in charge he would tear down 90 per cent of them. Sir Simon Jenkins, left, believes that the signals are a means of state control which cause more accidents than they prevent . Interviewed in the December issue of Readers’ Digest, he said: ‘Most accidents take place at traffic lights because everyone is looking at the lights and not at other road users. ‘We’re obsessed with traffic lights in Britain, and in London there’s a light practically every 30 yards, mostly with a clear street ahead. They’re a very inefficient way of enabling road users to get around. ‘I’d tear down 90 per cent of traffic lights. They are merely ways in which the state exerts control over us. They’re also dangerous,’ he added. Sir Simon’s remarks have not been met with wide approval from road safety groups. Think you might be spending more time at a red? You could be right. Traffic lights have been with us since the 1920s but in recent times their numbers have exploded, up a third in the past decade alone . Some signals and signs are now being removed in towns across Britain. Mayor of London Boris Johnson has ordered a review of thousands of lights in the capital, and more than 20 have already been taken out . RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘There is growing evidence that in many high streets and densely populated urban areas, a simplification of traffic control would be beneficial in terms of cutting accident numbers and improving the flow of traffic. ‘However, the majority of traffic lights fulfil an important safety role for both road users and pedestrians. ‘In many situations the removal of traffic lights would actually do more harm than good by causing far greater congestion, because it would take away the ability to control traffic flows to reflect changing demand patterns. ‘Just imagine what traffic would have been like during the Olympics this summer if London hadn’t had the ability to manage traffic flows and priorities via traffic lights from a central control centre.’ Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, says that traffic lights are ‘essential’. He said: ‘Although there may be some that could be removed or changed without causing too many problems, removing most of them would cause gridlock and result in more, not fewer, accidents. RAC technical director David Bizley says says a simplification of traffic control would be beneficial in terms of cutting accident numbers, but the majority of traffic lights fulfil an important safety role . ‘It is incorrect to say that most accidents occur at traffic lights, and when accidents do happen at traffic light junctions, it is not because drivers are distracted by looking at the lights. ‘There are many causes — running the red light, approaching too fast, not anticipating that the lights will change, following too closely, pedestrians stepping out without looking, to mention a few.’ However, Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, believes that there are now too many traffic lights on our roads. ‘If drivers think they are spending more time stuck at red, they would be right,’ he said. ‘Traffic lights have been with us since the 1920s, but in recent times, their numbers have exploded, up a third in the past decade alone. ‘Finely tuned, they play a vital role, but inconsistently set, they can be the source of immense frustration, especially where they are seen to unfairly favour one type of road user over another — for example, thousands of sets of lights put buses first.’ In 2005, almost all traffic lights were removed from the Dutch town of Drachten, pictured, as part of a radical road safety experiment.

In the interview entitled ‘If I ruled the world,’ Sir Simon, 69, also says he would make a history a compulsory lesson at school, prevent any building over a hundred years being demolished and would stop building on green fields.","Sir Simon Jenkins says the lights are a means of 'state control'

PR guru Matthew Freud was caught speeding on a motorway at 117mph in a Ferrari - while his five-year-old son slept in the front seat. Wealthy Freud, head of the international PR firm Freud Communications, was caught by police racing home along the M5 in Devon. He was today banned from the roads for six months and fined almost £1,000 at Exeter Magistrates Court, for the 'exceptionally high speed'. Banned: PR guru Matthew Freud, pictured leaving court today, was banned from the roads for six month after being caught speeding at 117mph in a Ferrari . Freud, who is married to Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, was speeding home from a business trip in Cornwall when he was pulled over by a police officer. The court heard Freud, 48, of North West London, had borrowed the black Ferrari 458 Spider from a business associate and was not used to its power. The £200,000 supercar has a maximum speed of 199mph and can go from 0 to 62mph in just 3.4 seconds. The JPs told Freud at court: 'This was an exceptionally high speed especially with a small child in the car.' Prosecutor David Barnes told the court . that a speed detection device recorded the speed at 117mph on the 70mph . M5 at Sampford Peverell on July 31, 2012. Mr Barnes said the police stopped the Ferrari and Freud said the vehicle belonged to his business partner. He said: 'It appeared the defendant was . in the company of his five year old son who was asleep in the front seat . of the vehicle.' He said the weather was fine and dry that evening and traffic was moderate. Freud’s lawyer Martin Bourne told the court that his client already had nine points on his licence in the last three years - two fixed penalties for speeding and for for using a mobile phone while driving. He said: 'He was driving back to his London home. He had been in Cornwall during the day for a business meeting. It was the school holidays and that is why his young son was with him. He was caring for his son as he went about his business.' Excessive: Freud was caught speeding at 117mph in a borrowed black Ferrari 458 Spider, similar to the model pictured . He said he had borrowed the car and was not used to it or its speed when he put his foot on the accelerator and ‘did not keep an eye on the speed’. 'He apologises for the offence. He accepts that it was a grossly excessive speed.' Freud is married to businesswoman Elisabeth Murdoch - daughter of Rupert Murdoch. Mr Bourne told the court four of Freud's six children attend school in three different counties and his wife works away a great deal and Freud does much of the driving for his family. He added: 'He is not someone who habitually speeds.' The court heard Freud would not suffer exceptional hardship by a ban and his means were ‘substantial’ to pay a fine. Mr Bourne said: 'He is a resourceful man who can manage his life. He is chairman of a company he founded 28 years ago.' Freud admitted speeding and the magistrates put six points on his licence making a total of 15. He was banned from driving for six months and ordered to pay a total of £905 in fines and costs. The court warned him not to drive before the end of his ban as by doing so he would be committing an ‘extremely serious offence’. Freud paid by card before being driven away from court in a black Mercedes. Freud pictured with his wife Elisabeth Murdoch after their wedding in Blenheim Palace in 2001. Today, Exeter Magistrates Court was told he does much of the driving for the family as his wife works away a lot . Freud is the great grandson of Sigmund Freud and the son of the late MP and broadcaster Clement. His first wife was Caroline Hutton, with whom he had two children. She went on to marry Earl Spencer, the brother of Princess Diana. He and Elisabeth Murdoch also have two children, and she has two from a previous relationship. He heads Freud Communications, which he founded, and employs about 200 people. Its list of clients includes big name brands such as Sky, Asda, Universal and Walkers. The company also enjoyed a 30% increase in profits this year after winning a London 2012 contract. It was the lead PR agency for ticketing, volunteering and the torch relay programme. He set up his first firm at 16 and founded his own PR agency aged 21.","Freud said he was not used to the power of the borrowed car .

A terminally ill woman who was granted the right to die after a court battle with her own parents then had a last-minute change of heart will be home for the holidays. Grace Sung Eun Lee, a Manhattan bank manager who fought her family for the right to die then signed a document allowing her deeply religious father to make decisions about her healthcare, is being moved from the hospital to the family's home in Queens. 'Grace will be taken care (of) at home in Douglaston,' her brother, Paul Lee, wrote in an e-mail to supporters. 'We just wanted you to know that this wouldn't have been possible without your help.' Bitter battle: Grace Sung Eun Lee, centre, is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour, but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes . Ms Lee had told her parents and the doctors: ‘I want to die.’ But . because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a Korean . Christian church in Queens, they believe that allowing her daughter to . choose death over life is a sin. A judge at the state appeals court yesterday sided with Ms Lee after the rift with her parents led to an agonising legal battle for the family. But 24 hours later, she signed over her decision-making abilities to her father, Rev. Manho Lee, according to WABC-TV. He is certain to keep her on life . support for as long as possible, as he believes that if she removes her . breathing tube she will have committed suicide, which he regards as a . sin. Ms Lee, a 28-year-old former bank manager from New York, said the decision would allow her 'to make peace with my God'. Devastated: Miss Lee's parents are pictured at the hospital after hearing the news that she has won the right to die . Happier times: Grace, centre, pictured with her parents Manho Lee, left, and Jin-ah Lee, right; her father is a pastor at a Flushing, Queens church . Speaking with the New York Daily News, Ms Lee’s mother, Jin-ah Lee, said: ‘Despite all this confusion, (my daughter) wants to go to heaven. I keep telling her she can get better.’ Her daughter is currently at Long Island North Shore Hospital, hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive. She is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem. Ms Lee’s father is Antioch Missionary Church reverend Manho Lee, and practices out of his church in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens. His congregation flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life. The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell. The difference in beliefs led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the hospital, with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances. Smiling: Ms Lee had worked as a manager at Bank of America and lived in Manhattan . Meeting: On October 1, there was a press conference at North Shore Hospital to inform the media of Grace's condition . Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed.’ However, Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision. Doctors said that her medications, including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough to cloud her judgment. Ms Lee’s troubles began last year. Before her illness, she worked as a manager for Bank of America, living and working in Manhattan. She was also training for the famous New York City marathon. She had emigrated with her parents from Seoul, South Korea, the Daily News reported. But Ms Lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem. Though she received chemotherapy and radiation, the treatments did not successfully target the tumour, and last month, she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed. Ms Lee had apparently talked to nurses at North Shore about removing the tubes, but her parents interceded. Offering support: Members of the congregation in Ms Lee's room, praying for her to be healed . Full of life: Grace Sung Eun Lee pictured before her illness . A Facebook page entitled Save Grace SungEun Lee cited a passage from the Old Testament, which reads: ‘”For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord. “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’ A post from reads: ‘We can see God’s powers working every day and know that God has a plan for her too!’ Children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28-year-old, with one writing: ‘I hope you feel better. I miss you, Grace Teacher.’ Cultural, as well as religious differences have come to play in Ms Lee’s case. Rev Young Gab Hyun said: ‘In Korean culture... we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter.’ Words of love: Young members of the church offered kind words to Ms Lee, calling her 'Grace Teacher,' and pleading with her to come back soon . ‘The role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient,’ Tia Powell, M.D., the director of Montefiore Einstein Center for Bioethics, told MailOnline. ‘If the patient is capable of making her decisions, then that’s where we would honour.’ Dr Powell added that while it may be heart-wrenching for the parents to face, she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together. ‘The question is not whether she’s going to die, it’s how she’s going to die. ‘There’s nothing worse than losing a child,’ she said, ‘but there are limits to medical treatment. There are many things we cannot fix, we cannot perform miracles.’ Dr Powell said that there are some practices that could help Ms Lee’s parents come to terms with their daughter’s illness. ‘These are religious people, and they know we are all mortal,’ she said. ‘Being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering.’","Grace Sung Eun Lee, 28, is paralysed from neck down due to brain tumour .

She has become known as a shrewd socialite, throwing lavish garden parties for the military's top brass and referring to the most influential as 'close friends'. And now, Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife whose complaint over threatening emails revealed David Petraeus' affair, has attempted to exploit her connections once again. In her first words since her part in the scandal was revealed over the weekend, Kelley has sent a string of pleading emails to the Tampa Mayor, complaining she has been receiving threats and claiming: 'The truth will one day prevail.' Scroll down for video . Anxious: Jill Kelley, pictured leaving her Florida home earlier this week, has written pleading emails to the Tampa mayor complaining that she has been receiving threats and no help from the police . The anguished messages, seen by the Tampa Bay Times, were sent in the early hours of Tuesday and Wednesday to Bob Buckhorn, whom she knows socially. She claims her three children are scared to return home and her doctor husband has been forced to sleep at the hospital because he cannot get into their driveway, due to the swarms of media. 'Dear Mayor Bob,' she wrote, adding that she, Petraeus and . General John R. Allen - whom she was found to have exchanged 'flirtatious' emails with - 'have been exploited by the media'. 'I . wouldn't care - if they got the facts right and the focus was on the . criminal that stalked all of us,' she added, apparently referring to Petraeus' mistress Paula Broadwell. 'But the truth will . one day prevail.' It is the second instance of her trying to exploit her 'position' - after she called the police asking for 'diplomatic protection' from the media due to her role as honorary consul to South Korea. Not smiling now: Kelley is pictured entertaining General Petraeus and his wife Holly at her home last year . Rubbing shoulders: Jill Kelley, left, and her twin sister Natalie Khawam pose with March Rubio, then a candidate for Senate, in March 2010. They only attended his event for the photo, staff said . 'I'm an honorary consul general, so I have inviolability, so they should not be able to cross my property,' she told the 911 operator. 'I don't know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well, because that's against the law to cross my property because, you know, it's inviolable.' But the move backfired - with the police releasing the calls to the media and failing to provide her the protection reserved for those in positions of genuine authority. 'To put insult to injury, your police dept gave the local 911 tapes to the press!' she wrote to Buckhorn, adding that the recordings included her cell number, so 'I have been receiving threats all night'. 'I'm scared and cannot believe what my city, in which I have contributed so much of my love, time, money and leadership, has now done to me and my innocent family,' Kelley wrote. Buckhorn told the Times that he did . nothing in response to Kelley's complaint and simply said that the 911 . recordings were public records. 'Fearful': She wrote that her surgeon husband Scott, pictured returning home on Thursday, has had to sleep at the hospital because he is unable to get into the drive because of the media by their house . Demands: She had earlier asked for diplomatic protection at her $1.3 million home in Tampa . He added that he knew the Kelleys . socially after he won the mayoral race in March 2011 - even though they . did not support him in his bid and he had never met them before. Emails: Kelley sent messages to Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn complaining about her treatment . Yet just three weeks after he was sworn into office, the doctor and his wife hosted a reception for him at their lavish $1.3 million home on Bayshore Boulevard. Kelley has since invited him to a string of social events, including her daughter's sixth birthday party, which are also documented by email, the Times reported. She invited him and his wife to a dinner party for the King of Jordan and, after he was unable to attend, she wrote to him again. 'The King and his sister (the Princess) are awesome . people!' she said. 'Actually your name was brought up . by the Generals when they were showing off the party I hosted you! (everyone loved that party).' They met again when he and his wife gave her a ride home following an event at MacDill Air Force Base, for which she organised events as a volunteer social liaison officer. 'Gen. [James] Mattis, was so kind to offer, but I realised . you two were passing my way,' she emailed the mayor the following day. Their messages also show how she involved herself in a spat over a radio host's claims that he was going to deep fat fry the Koran earlier this year, according to the Times. Officers at MacDill told the mayor that the publicity stunt could harm troops, and asked him to speak with the host.

Kelley also called the mayor to tell them she had been speaking with . Gen. Allen and Vice Admiral Robert Harward, the deputy commander of . CentCom, who said they needed the mayor's help. When Buckhorn responded to say it was being dealt with, she said 'they asked me to get involved, like I did when it happened with the Pastor last year'. Kelley's shrewd social-climbing tactics also came to light this week when she was pictured with Marco Rubio and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, when he was running for the Senate. The photograph was tweeted by Republican Angelette Aviles who said that it was taken at a March 2010 fundraiser, where tickets were $1,000. Who's who? A chart shows the connections between the major players in the Petraeus scandal . But the twins didn't pay - instead, they . appeared, took the photo and left, Aviles told the Times. They did not . contribute to his campaign. Yet over the past week, Kelley's connections have given her more exposure than she was perhaps intending. After David Petraeus dramatically resigned from the top of the CIA last Friday, it emerged that Kelley had played a key role in exposing his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. In May, Kelley alerted the FBI that she had been receiving threatening, anonymous emails warning her to 'back off' Petraeus, whom Kelley and her husband are good friends with. The FBI was forced to launch an in-depth investigation as some messages contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts, and they feared there could have been a security breach.

'Flirty': Kelley allegedly sent 'inappropriate' emails to Gen John Allen, pictured with his wife and daughter . The catty emails were traced back to Broadwell and, in the process of the investigation, agents also uncovered messages revealing the affair between the biographer and Petraeus. The scandal later dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, after the FBI investigated Kelley's emails from Broadwell. During the probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email correspondence between Allen and Kelley, which officials said were 'flirtatious' and likened them to 'phone sex'. Both Allen and Kelley deny any wrongdoing. But Kelley has been told has been that she is no longer welcome at the military HQ near her Florida home.","First comments from Kelley since her part in Petraeus scandal emerged .

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has spoken out for the first time about the allegations against Gen. John Allen, that he had 'inappropriate communications' with Florida housewife and military social liaison Jill Kelley. Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is under investigation for his correspondence with Kelley, who is also embroiled in the David Petraeus sex scandal. Investigators are looking at 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails between Kelley and Allen, some of which have been described  by Pentagon officials as 'flirtatious.' Allen has denied any wrongdoing. Scroll down for video . Panetta told a press conference that Gen Allen has his continued confidence to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan . Investigators are reviewing between 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails between socialite Jill Kelley and General John Allen . Panetta, speaking at a news conference . in Perth on Wednesday, cautioned against reaching early conclusions . about the veracity of allegations against Gen. Allen, which have added a . new dimension to the Petraeus matter. 'No one should leap to any conclusions here,' Panetta said in his first public comments on the matter when a reporter asked what Allen might have done wrong. Panetta said he supports Allen, who has been in command in Kabul since July 2011. He took over that summer for Petraeus, who retired from the Army to head the CIA. 'He certainly has my continued confidence to lead our forces and to continue the fight,' Panetta said. The Pentagon chief declined to explain the nature of Allen's correspondence with Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite connected to the scandal that led to Petraeus' resignation last week as director of the CIA. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared with Panetta and their Australian counterparts at Wednesday's news conference, declined to comment on the Allen case except to suggest it has not harmed the war effort. Details emerged last Friday that General Petraeus had had an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said there was 'no concern whatsoever' that allegations about Gen. Allen would impact the U.S. mission in Afghanistan . She said U.S. officials have discussed the matter with allied officials. 'There has been a lot of conversation, as you might expect, but no concern whatsoever being expressed to us because the mission has been set forth and it's being carried out,' Clinton said. Panetta announced Tuesday while flying to Australia that he had ordered the Defense Department's inspector general to investigate Allen based on material referred to the Pentagon on Sunday by the FBI. Pentagon officials said the material included at least 20,000 pages of Allen correspondence. Allen told Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he is innocent of misconduct, according to Col. David Lapan, Dempsey's spokesman. President Obama pictured with Panetta, second left, Petraeus, second right, and General Allen, right, at the White House . Lapan said Wednesday that Dempsey called Allen on Tuesday from Perth, where Dempsey attended meetings with Panetta. Dempsey has not commented publicly. Panetta had also announced Tuesday that the Obama administration put on hold Allen's nomination to be the next commander of U.S. European Command and the top NATO general. Allen's Senate confirmation hearing was to have been held Thursday. Panetta said in Perth that putting a hold on the nomination was the 'prudent' thing to do.

Landlord Jax Ayton pictured outside the Darlington home which she has put on the rental market for free . A couple whose house was trashed by a past tenant and stripped bare by thieves have put their three-bedroomed terrace on the market rent free - as long as the occupier doesn't mind renovating the property while they live there. Private landlords Jax Ayton, 30, and her husband David, 46, have made the unusual proposition as they look for a DIY enthusiast to take on their Darlington property. They hope that a new resident can give the end terrace a new lease of life after it was left uninhabitable by a previous tenant. She was evicted after knocking holes in the walls, burning the garage down and allowing her pet cat to defecate all over the floor. But the couple's nightmare didn't end when the tenant finally moved out. Once the property was empty, metal thieves smashed their way in through rear windows and stripped the house of it pipes, boiler and electrical wiring. Repairs will now cost between £17,000 and £23,000. Mrs Ayton said: 'It was a lovely house, it was all done up to a good standard and it was a nice place to live. 'This tenant completely trashed the place so obviously we asked her to leave. 'We couldn't afford to do it up again and slowly but surely people noticed it was empty and it became a target. 'They've taken everything except the floorboards - the circuit board, the boiler and all the piping has gone. 'It's in a desperate state of disrepair.' Jax, originally from Aberdeen, added: . 'We found the property in the state it was in after the tenant fell . into arrears. We were absolutely devastated. 'She . had been a tenant at another of our houses, but it was badly damaged in . a chip pan fire and we re-homed her in another one of our properties. The house was left in a terrible state of disrepair after a previous tenant trashed the place and metal thieves stripped it bare . Jax and David Ayton are now hoping that a new tenant can fix the mess their terrace has been left in, pictured, and give the house a new lease of life . The house will need completely gutting after the previous tenant put holes in he walls, allowed her dog to defecate everywhere and burnt the garage down . Metal thieves smashed into the house through the rear windows, which are seen here boarded up . 'We were carrying out refurbishment to the home she had left, and the one she  moved into was beautiful. 'The previous tenants had really looked after it. We spruced it up for her but it came to light that she'd fallen into arrears. 'We found out the property was ruined in January, so we took steps to evict her. It's a lengthy process and the law is not on the side of landlords, so she left the property in April.' The Ayton's, who own seven properties in Darlington and a further house in Newcastle, will make the house safe to live in by fitting new windows and electrics before anyone moves in - but the tenant will be expected to do all the DIY work to their own taste. Any building materials needed to return the house to its former glory will be supplied by the pair. The Aytons will charge between £425 and £475 per month to rent the house, pictured left, when extensive renovations to damage, right, are carried out . Landlord Jax Ayton says that pretty much all that is left of the terraced house is the floorboards. But even some of those are missing judging by this photo . Thieves even went so far as stealing pipes, cables and the electric circuit board from the house . The property hardly looks like an ideal love nest now, but its owners are hoping that new DIY-loving tenants will breath new life into the house . And once the drastic makeover is complete, they will start to charge the occupiers rent - between £425 and £475 per month, in line with similar properties in the area. Mrs Ayton said that the pair will hold X Factor-style auditions to make sure that they rent the house to a reliable tenant this time around. She said: 'We're expecting an X-Factor audition process where people will talk us through what they want to do to the property. 'We'll find out who is genuine about the property and who just wants free rent. 'The design they choose has to be agreeable and liveable, so we'll come to an agreement over what they are going to do and that will be written into the contract.' Even the ceilings of the Darlington terrace will need a renovation as this picture shows . With some TLC, this space could become a dream living room for the home's new occupants . The carpets will need replacing after the previous tenant let her pet defecate on the floor .","Jax and David Ayton's Darlington terrace was trashed by a former tenant and then stripped by opportunist metal thieves .

This map reveals the startling number of American homeowners drowning in debt after being left locked in negative equity in the wake of the economic crisis. It shows the percentage of people who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth - classed as 'underwater' homeowners - across the U.S. by county. More than 14 million Americans were struggling in negative equity in the third quarter of the year, research has shown. 'Underwater': The map shows the percentage of homeowners in negative equity across the U.S. by county . The red counties on the map have more underwater homes than the national average of 28.2 per cent, while blue counties have fewer. In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area of Florida 41.4 per cent of homeowners are underwater, and 29.1 per cent of those owe more than double what their property is worth. In all 25.5 per cent of the area's underwater owners are 'delinquent' - meaning they are more than 90 days late on their mortgage repayments. Other major cities badly hit hit include Chicago, where 36.6 per cent of homeowners are in negative equity, and Seattle, where 34.2 per cent are classed as underwater. Despite the levels of debt, real . estate specialist Zillow said negative equity had in fact receded in the . third quarter, which saw the biggest quarterly rise in property values . since 2006. In the second quarter, an average of 30.9 per cent - 15.3 million homeowners - were underwater. 'National home values appreciated 1.3 . percent from Q2 to Q3 2012, with much of that appreciation focused in . hard-hit areas, like Arizona, Florida and California,' Zillow told . Businessinsider.com. But the firm's chief economist Stan Humphries said house prices were still not immune to 'shocks' from the broader economy. 'While we're moving in the right . direction, a substantial number of homes are still locked up in negative . equity, unable to enter the existing re-sale market despite the desires . of their owner,' he said. 'While we're moving in the right direction, a substantial number of homes are still locked up in negative equity' Economist Stan Humphries . 'The housing market has found real . momentum of its own, but is not immune from shocks to the broader . economy. If negotiations centred on resolving the fiscal cliff don't . inspire confidence in investors and consumers alike, recent home value . gains - and, as a result, falling negative equity rates - could stall,' Mr Humphries added. The collapse in the U.S. housing market is widely regarded as a root cause of the global economic crisis. Property prices peaked in 2006 in the States before the housing bubble burst the following year. Between 2004 and 2006 the percentage of risky subprime mortgages - those extended to borrowers with poor credit histories - rose to a new high of around 20 per cent. The vast majority were adjustable-rate mortgages, meaning interest rates vary according to the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets. When U.S. house prices began to decline steeply in 2006, owners struggled to keep up with rising monthly payments as their adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates. The numbers of people defaulting on their payments soared as did the number of foreclosures. This, combined with simultaneous crashes in other asset bubbles, saw fears over the soundness of the U.S. credit and financial markets lead to credit tightening around the world.

A father was stunned after council officers asked him to pay rent on a six-foot wide strip of land in his garden. Paul Openshaw, 38, from Royton, returned home from a holiday to find a letter from his local authority, Oldham Council, demanding an annual rent of £50, which he is refusing to pay. Transport manager Mr Openshaw, who has has lived in the Manchester property for 12 years, said he had no idea that the small walkway to the side of his house was registered as council land. It has been fenced to the property for at least 25 years. The row broke out after inspectors at cash-strapped Oldham Council in Greater Manchester carried out an inspection of their assets while Mr Openshaw was on holiday in June. Gathering evidence: Paul Openshaw measuring the six-foot piece of land in contention . It emerged the six-foot wide strip, which houses a gravel path, garden shed and part of his decking, may once have been on the site of a disused public highway. Officials may now seek a court order to 'evict' Mr Openshaw’s shed and gravel path unless he pays rent. They have also charged him £180 in surveyors fees, claiming the council had a 'duty to manage its assets in the interests of the public'. But Mr Openshaw said he had already paid £550 in legal fees to challenge the council’s claim, and would continue to fight to make the land legally his own. He said: 'I bought the house 12 years ago and there was already a fence attaching the land to my property. Contentious: Paul Openshaw's backyard, over which he is in dispute with Oldham Council . 'It’s just a small piece of land around 6ft wide - it’s not like it’s a football pitch. Yet all of a sudden they’re saying they own it and they want rent from me. 'But I’ve never heard anything before and I had all the usual checks carried out before I bought the house. 'Having to spend that kind of money isn’t great for anyone at any time of year let alone in the run up to Christmas. It’s just ridiculous. 'If the council are now claiming they own my land which has been maintained to a decent standard they should give the road outside a proper permanent Tarmac surface so it comes up to a more acceptable standard too. 'There have been potholes in the road outside for years. I didn’t complain about them myself but I know the other neighbours did and I was hoping the council would fill them in. I can’t believe they carried out this inspection instead.' Mr Openshaw, whose wife Michelle, 34, was made redundant from her store assistant job earlier this year, discovered the problem in June when he returned from a week's holiday. He added: 'The letter was from ""Unity Partnerships"" on behalf of the council and it stated that the land wasn’t mine and that I’d have to cough up £50 rent a year and £180 for surveyor fees. 'It stated the council took their assets very seriously and that they needed the money. 'I was absolutely baffled. I sent an e-mail saying how on earth was it their land - it was the most ridiculous thing I’d ever heard. I hired a solicitor and have already paid more than £500 in fees. 'My only option is to stick at it and carry on negotiating with the council or basically let them do their worst and take me to court.' Problem: Part of the land in dispute by Oldham Council, whose officers have laid claim to it . Mr Openshaw had his house fully surveyed when he bought it for £46,000 in 2000. Since receiving the letter from the council, he tried to take 'possessory title' of the land through an application to the Land Registry as he has lived there for more than 10 years. But his plea was rejected on the grounds of a legal technicality. He said: 'It is something I believed I owned for all those years and for them to take it away in an instant is unbelievable. I obviously had my house surveyed when I bought it twelve years ago and this was never mentioned. 'I am prepared to fight this at the moment, but if too much money gets involved it may be a struggle, especially leading up to Christmas.' Dispute: Part of Mr Openshaw's garden may once have been on the site of a disused public highway . Oldham Council, which is battling to save £45m in budget cuts, said officials did not know why the issue of the land had not been flagged up earlier and assumed it must have been 'missed' on previous occasions. Councillor Dave Hibbert, cabinet member for housing, transport and planning, said: 'Oldham Council is the registered owner of the land and during a recent inspection it was noted there was an encroachment that hadn’t been authorised. 'This information is available to the public and solicitors prior to any house purchase. We have quoted our standard garden licence rental and hope we can reach an amicable settlement.'

Guilty: The 76-year-old media mogul wasn't in the courtroom for the verdict on the case stemming from dealings in his Mediaset business empire . Former Italian prime minister Silvio . Berlusconi was yesterday sentenced to four years in jail for tax fraud – . only for his sentence to be immediately cut. The 76-year-old’s prison term was . swiftly reduced to one year because of a 2006 amnesty law aimed at . reducing prison overcrowding. However, legal experts said last . night that, because of his age and Italy’s lengthy appeals process, it . is unlikely that he will spend any time behind bars. Berlusconi and four others, . convicted for their part in what judge Edoardo D’Avossa described as a . ‘significant tax evasion’, were also fined ten million euros. In addition, the billionaire media tycoon was banned from public office for five years. The 76-year-old billionaire businessman, who was among 11 defendants on trial, is expected to remain free until the appeals process is exhausted. In Italy, cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts are final. The conviction was the media mogul's . first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were . thrown out after time ran out to prosecute. Just last week, he appeared in the same courthouse for another trial in which he is accused of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and then trying to cover it up. Scroll down for a timeline of Berlusconi's previous brushes with the law. Sentenced: Judge Edoardo D'Avossa reads out the sentence today in a decision that capped a trial in which Berlusconi was accused of masterminding a scheme to illegally inflate the price paid for television rights . But today, the media mogul wasn't in . the courtroom for the verdict, which comes two days after he announced he will not run in Italy's upcoming elections. Instead, his lawyers denounced the verdict in a statement as 'absolutely incredible'. Prosecutors allege the defendants were . behind a scheme to purchase the rights to broadcast U.S. movies on . Berlusconi's private television networks through a series of offshore . companies and had falsely declared the payments to avoid taxes. Prosecutors further alleged the . inflated the price for the TV rights of some 3,000 films as they . relicensed them internally to Berlusconi's networks, pocketing the . difference amounting to around €250million (£200million). Out on the town: Silvio Berlusconi seen shopping in the center of Milan on the same day he was convicted . Happier days: Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, center, is photographed with two unidentified women in 2004. Today's verdict came a week after he appeared in court for another trial in which he is accused of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and trying to cover it up . Ladies' man? Berlusconi looks on next to Italy's . swimmer world champion Federica Pellegrini  in 2009, left, and poses . for a picture with a supporter in 2010, right . Other . charges of false accounting and false statements in financial reports . were thrown out because the statute of limitations expired. The three-time premier stepped down . last November after Italy came under mounting market pressure to deal . with its high debt load and Berlusconi failed to come up with persuasive . financial reforms. Berlusconi's . designated political heir as the head of the center-right party he . leads, Angelino Alfano, blasted the verdict Friday as 'incomprehensible' and said he was confident an appeals court would throw out the . conviction. Berlusconi is not the first former Italian premier to be convicted of criminal charges. Former Socialist Premier Bettino . Craxi (pictured) eluded an arrest warrant and turned up at his villa in Tunisia in . 1994 after a court in Italy charged him in a massive corruption case. He was tried in absentia, convicted . and sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison, never returned to Italy and died . in exile. Craxi was considered Berlusconi's mentor thanks to his . opening to private television in Italy from a state monopoly. Former . seven-time Christian Democrat premier, Giulio Andreotti, was convicted . of involvement in a Mafia-murder. But he was cleared on appeal and never . went to jail . In this . and other cases against him, Berlusconi has described himself as the . innocent victim of prosecutors he contends sympathize with the left. Indeed, in 2009, he described himself as ‘the most persecuted person in the entire history of the world’. Up . until now, other criminal investigation probes against him on charges . including corruption had ended in acquittal or were thrown out for . statute of limitations. Of . the other defendants, three were acquitted, including a close associate . of Berlusconi, Fedele Confalonieri, chairman of Mediaset. Berlusconi . and three others were convicted, including a Hollywood producer, Frank . Agrama, who received a three-year sentence. Berlusconi, . along with other defendants convicted in the case, must deposit a total . of €10 million (£8million) into a court-ordered fund as appeals, which . could take years, proceed. The . trial began in July 2006, but was put on hold by a now-defunct immunity . law that shielded the Berlusconi from prosecution while he was premier . until it was watered down by the constitutional court. The trial also . faced delays as Berlusconi cited conflicts with his schedule as premier. Berlusconi has been tried numerous times for his business dealings. He has always denied wrongdoing and alleged that the cases were politically motivated. In each case to date, he has been cleared or seen the statute of limitations expire. The . statute of limitations in this case is set to expire sometime next . year. In Italy, cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts . are final. Berlusconi also is on trial in Milan on charges of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and trying to cover it up. Troubles ahead: The conviction was the media mogul's first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were thrown out after time ran out to prosecute . Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17 . Appearing in court last Friday, he said he believed the then 17-year-old . dancer, Karima ‘Ruby the Heartstealer’ El Mahroug, was really 24 when . he was alleged to have paid her for sex in 2010. Mr . Berlusconi told the court that ‘nothing vulgar or scandalous’ had ever . occurred during parties at his villa in Acore, and that the now . notorious phrase ‘bunga bunga’ stemmed from a joke someone had made. He said prosecution claims that the . evenings were orgies in which he paid prostitutes dressed as nuns to . perform strip shows had been made up to discredit him. He . also denied having had sex with Miss El Mahroug, who is Moroccan, or . any of the guests at his parties, adding: 'Everything happened in front . of staff and, at times, my children came in to say ""hello""'. But . several guests have already testified how strippers performed and money . was exchanged for sex. Mr Berlusconi also insisted he was innocent of . abuse of office. Prosecutors . say he lied to the police in May 2010, telling them Miss El Mahroug was . the granddaughter of the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in order . to have her released after she was held for suspected theft. Denials: Ms El-Mahroug who is widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') has always denied having sex with the prime minister when she was 17 - or being a prostitute . The list of witnesses named by Berlusconi are a roll call of the rich and famous and are said to have been guests at one of Mr Berlusconi's parties. They include Real Madrid footballer Cristiano . Ronaldo, Hollywood star George Clooney and his girlfriend, and the . Italian model and TV star Elisabetta Canalis. Who me? Berlusconi's career has been dogged by scandal and criminal probe .

When Katie Newell was 15 months old she was diagnosed with a rare condition that caused painful tumours to grow on the upper half of her body. She was left unable to feed properly and her parents were told she was unlikely to survive past the age of five. Katie Newell with her mother Vanessa. She suffers from tumours that are difficult to remove as they have such a rich blood supply . But the brave youngster battled through and after having several operations in the U.S, she has just celebrated her 18th birthday. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, the teenager from Chelmsford, revealed she had a difficult childhood as her severe case of neurofibromatosis had left her with disfiguring growths. 'It was hard for me as children would whisper about me in the street', she said. 'The growths nearest my lungs affect me the most as I find walking or going up stairs difficult. I get tired. 'Sometimes my condition scares me, like when I was 14 I was told I could die from an operation to remove a growth.' Future plans: Katie hopes to one day become an author . Katie has neurofibromatosis - a genetic condition that causes multiple tumours which affect the nervous system. They are usually non-cancerous but can compress organs such as the lungs and cause facial weakness and deafness. It was reported on This Morning that . scientists have recently speculated that Joseph Merrick, also known as . the Elephant Man, suffered from this condition along with proteus . syndrome. The growths include blood vessels and nerve endings and so are only tackled when they become life-threatening. Sometimes they grow back even once they've been removed. Her mother Vanessa, who suffers from a very mild form of the same disease, said: 'Once she got past five I decided we had to do something, rather than waiting for her to die. 'So we raised money and went to America for surgery, because they tell you the risks of dying but also give you the choice. 'Luckily Katie is very stubborn.' Katie attended Chelmsford New Model Special School but found it tricky going on to an open college. However, not all youngsters with the condition attend special needs schools. 'I felt more left out, as I'm different' she said. 'Katie realised she needed more help than other kids her age. They would be going to the shops, while she would be waiting for a taxi to take her home. She found it quite upsetting,' her mother added. However, Katie, who has received two child of courage awards, is determined to continue with her studies and wants to become an author. 'Katie always says ""I have neurofibromatosis but neurobiromatosis doesn't have me"",' her mother said. NF is caused by a mutation in one of the genes. About half of the people who have NF have no family history of the condition. This is called a spontaneous gene mutation. The other half of people will have inherited NF from their mother or father. It varies from one person to another even in the same family. Some people will be mildly affected with very few health problems. Others will have some serious health problems that mean that daily life is difficult and it restricts what they can do. Richard Taylor, chairman of the Neuro Foundation said: 'I would like to emphasise that NF1 is not the same disease as Proteus Syndrome which Joseph Merrick suffered from. 'NF1 is a debilitating genetic illness that causes benign tumours to grow in 25,000 patients in the UK. 'The condition often leads to social isolation as many people simply do not understand or appreciate the condition. 'Patients like Katie Newell offer hope and inspiration to thousands of patients with NF1 as she demonstrates how possible it is to lead a near normal life with the right type of support.'

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning . A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay £3,103 in costs.

Bans: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is looking at the idea of preventing young drivers from carrying passengers . Young drivers could be banned from carrying passengers for nine months after they pass their test, under proposals being considered by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. Mr McLoughlin said he was looking at ideas put forward by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which it says could cut the number of accidents involving young motorists. He said: ‘I read regular reports where three or four young  people have been killed in a car and it’s a new driver and you  wonder what happened. ‘When I talk to young people who have recently passed their test, they say sometimes that there is peer pressure put on them to go fast, to show off. ‘They are not drivers with a huge amount of experience by the very fact of them being new drivers. I think we have got to look at that.’ Mr McLoughlin said he was considering whether measures should be put in place for novice drivers to carry no passengers other than immediate family members. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘There is a suggestion as to whether you should look at a restriction whether anyone could carry passengers for six or nine months when they have first passed their test. ‘There are suggestions about them only perhaps being allowed to take a family member.’ Peer pressure: Inexperienced drivers say they are sometimes pressured into driving fast or distracted with other people in the car . The ABI says one in eight drivers is under 25, but they account for a third of people who die on UK roads. It also says an 18-year-old driver is three times more likely to be involved in a crash than a 48 year-old driver. In 2011, drivers aged between 17 and 19 were involved in 12,000 crashes, of which more than half resulted in serious or fatal injuries.

William Blything, 41, is alleged to have hurled the insults at Korean Queen's Park Rangers captain Park Ji-Sung and Everton midfielder Victor Anichebe when he was at a match with his wife. Police picked Blything, from Wavertree, Liverpool, out from photographs of the crowd at Loftus Road when a complaint was made after the 1-1 draw on October 21. Merchant seaman Blything, who is an Everton supporter, told Hammersmith Magistrates' court he would fight the claims and defend himself. ‘I’m not guilty to the racial bit, but I fully admit I used offensive language,’ he said. ‘I’m quite clear I didn’t say that. ‘Any one of 4,000 people could have said that, and I’m getting the blame. My wife heard me swear, but she knows I didn’t say anything racial.’ Speaking in a West Country accent, Blything added witness statements referred to the abuser as yelling in a Liverpool accent. The court heard fans claim he called Anichebe, originally from Nigeria, a ‘f***ing monkey’, and shouted ‘Take down that chink' at Ji-Sung. James Dean, prosecuting, said police maintained photographs taken at the game ‘match the defendant exactly.’ Blything is alleged to have shouted 'take down that chink' at Korean QPR captain Park Ji-Sung (centre) during the match .

When her beloved horse Otto died, Sharon Widdows wanted to give the 18-year-old thoroughbred the send-off he deserved. She spared no expense in arranging a private cremation, believing that £920 was a small price to pay to have her loyal companion’s body treated with respect. But a few weeks later, the company she had entrusted with the sensitive task handed her a container just 18 inches long and containing only a heap of ashes weighing 11lb. Knackerman Philip Cooper, 69, pictured left, was . caught out rendering horses instead of getting them cremated when he . sent Sharon Widdows, right, the remain of her thoroughbred in a dog . casket . Suspicions: Horse owner Sharon Widdows, 40, knew something was wrong when the ashes of her thoroughbred were returned in a tiny box, right, that was much smaller than the normal size expected for a cremated horse, pictured left . Distraught: The mother-of-two, pictured riding . Otto on the right, from Stonehouse, near Stroud, contacted authorities . when she realised the casket was too small for her 16.3hh (5'7"") horse . Mrs Widdows immediately suspected that the remains could not be those of Otto, who had stood at a muscular 16.3 hands high (5ft 7in) and weighed around 1,000lb. Her worst fears were finally confirmed when it emerged that the man to whom she entrusted her thoroughbred’s remains had simply dumped them in a knacker’s yard – where they were turned into fertiliser and glue. The ashes she was given are thought to have belonged to an unidentified dog. Mrs Widdows said she was ‘sickened’ when she learned the truth. Following the discovery, trading standards launched an investigation into Philip Cooper, to whom she had entrusted Otto’s body. They have since found as many as 31 grieving horse lovers had been duped by Cooper, 69, who made around £500 profit on each ‘cremation’. Instead of giving them a private burial, he dumped the horses with dozens of other animal carcasses and took them to a rendering plant, where he paid £40 to have them made into glue and fertiliser. Duped: Cooper was contracted to cremate horses by veterinary surgery Bushy Equine Services, used by Mrs Widdows, which had no idea he was not honouring the agreement . Fitting send-off: Sharon Widdows, pictured with thoroughbred Otto, paid £920 to have a private cremation for her beloved horse . Knackerman Philip Cooper, 69, instead took the horse to a rendering plant where he paid £40 to have it made into glue and fertiliser . The fees he charged varied. Some of the money he charged went to veterinary practices with whom he had contracts – and who were not aware of his methods. The fraudster has now been ordered to pay compensation to his victims and was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence. Yesterday Mrs Widdows, a mother of two, said she was referred to Cooper after discussing her wishes with a vet after Otto died in January 2009. After a delay in the ashes being returned to her, she had been horrified to discover that Otto had been taken to a location in Devon which does not have a crematorium, only a rendering plant. Mrs Widdows, from Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, looked after Otto for two years after he retired as a riding horse. ‘He was a part of our family, a special horse,’ she said.  ‘I was absolutely gutted that Otto had died, but believed he would be getting the send-off I wanted.’ She continued: ‘The girl at the vets was shaking as she handed over the casket. I got it home and it was just tiny with a small amount of bone and ash inside.’ She later learned that the box she was given was four times smaller than a horse casket. Cooper, from Chilcompton, was first prosecuted in 2011 after admitting cheating five women by pretending their horses would be cremated individually. A further 26 victims then came forward after the case was publicised. Last week he appeared at Gloucester Crown Court to admit fraud. Judith Kenney, prosecuting for Gloucestershire trading standards department, said Cooper had fraudulently obtained £14,393 from the 26 new cases. Judge Jamie Tabor ordered Cooper to pay £1,000 compensation to each of the 26 victims.","Philip Cooper, 69, took horse carcasses meant for cremation to be rendered .

For £4.4 million, you can buy  a working piece of maritime  history, complete with two beaches, tall ships and an ice cream parlour. Unfortunately, Cornwall's Charlestown Harbour does not come with a house to live in. Charlestown harbour in Cornwall - complete with two beaches and its own ice cream parlour - has gone up for sale for £4.4m . Its owner, Robin Davies, has turned the Grade II listed port into a successful business in its own right, with the quaint quayside becoming a popular setting for film and TV crews . As well as the shipyard business which makes and restores vessels and offers seamanship training, there is huge revenue potential in movie location fees and hiring out the Tall ships . The port was used for the scene in Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland where the heroine (played by Mia Wasikowska, above) sets sail for China . Instead, you can own the waterfront, a car park and roads for offers in the region of £1.5 million. Another £1.4 million buys a marine training and charter business, including two square-rigged tall ships, and a further £1.5 million will secure two acres of land suitable for commercial or residential development, although it does not yet have planning consent. The small port has been in private ownership for nearly 20 years, although members of the public are allowed access on foot or by boat. There is also income in the lease on the restaurant and ice cream parlour, mooring fees and car park charges . The harbour is a popular tourist destination and was visited by Tony and Cherie Blair in 2001 . The port was built in the late 18th century by local landowner Charles Rashleigh. It developed around the fishing village of West Polmear . The quaint Grade II-listed quayside has become a popular setting for film crews. Scenes from The Eagle Has Landed, Treasure Island, The Three Musketeers and Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland have been filmed there, and it featured in an episode of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith – The Curse Of The Black Spot. The port was built in the late 18th century by local landowner Charles Rashleigh. The site was developed around the fishing village of West Polmear. Initially, it capitalised on the China clay trade and fishing - but as these businesses declined, use of the harbour almost ground to a halt. In 1994, Square Sail bought the port and beaches - and it soon housed three square-rigged sailing ships. Owner Robin Davies, 69, is nearing . retirement and has placed the 3.5-acre piece of land and water  up for . sale in the hope that a new owner will take over his business, which . employs 18 people, including a harbour master, engineers and deckhands. As well as the shipyard business, . which makes and restores vessels and offers seamanship training, there . is potential revenue in film location fees and hiring out the tall . ships. There is also income from the lease on the restaurant and ice . cream parlour, mooring fees and car park charges. Mr Davies said: 'We bought the harbour . to keep ships in and have the facilities to repair boats, but a lot of . our business is now focused on film sets. 'It is a vibrant little village and a . spectacular place to live, and we think this is a once-in-a-lifetime . opportunity for someone.' A spokesman for commercial agents .

In recent weeks, Mr Putin has rarely left his official residence, sparking speculation that illness or injury had laid him low. Is it a bird? No, it's a crane! Vladimir Putin has not been seen in public much since he was flanked by migrating cranes during a well publicised flight in a motorised hang glider back in September . But it emerged today that the president's September flight in a motorised hang-glider, in which he got snarled up with several cranes, may have aggravated an old injury, according to newspaper Vedomosti. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the claims. He told the . state news agency RIA Novosti that the president had an old injury, but that it was . not connected to the highly publicised flight. Instead Mr Peskov said Mr Putin's absence from the Kremlin was down to courtesy for the Russian people: he didn't want his . motorcade to disrupt Moscow's notoriously bad traffic. You bird brain: Mr Putin eyeballs one of the Siberian cranes from the safety of his glider. It has emerged that he may have aggravated an old injury .

Given that there are 41 independent coffee shops in the area, there is clearly an appetite for the occasional cappuccino. But when Costa Coffee announced plans to open a branch in Totnes, it left a very bitter taste. Residents feared the arrival of the chain would ruin the south Devon market town’s identity and turn it into a ‘clone’. Storm of protest: Costa Coffee was forced to pull out of Totnes, pictured, after residents in the town fought to preserve its independence . So determined were locals to keep . Costa off their picturesque medieval streets that the town, which has a . population of 8,336, produced a petition of almost 6,000 signatures and . held protest marches and meetings. And three months later, in a rare . triumph of people power over big business, the ‘No to Costa’ campaign . has scored a remarkable victory. Yesterday the chain announced that . fierce opposition from residents had forced it to abandon its plans for . a 70-seat cafe in the town. In a statement on their website, the campaigners said they were ‘absolutely delighted’ by the company’s decision to withdraw. 5,000 local people signed a petition to stop Costa building a coffee shop in the town as residents pride themselves on independent coffee shops, right . They continued: ‘We are impressed . Costa has taken the time to understand our town, its economy and the . 5,700 people who signed the petition asking Costa to reconsider. ‘This is a major milestone for local communities and is a day when the value of localism comes into its own.’ Brasserie owner Tony Kershaw  said: ‘We’re happy with the decision Costa has made. ‘Totnes is pretty independent and different as a town, and we’re seeking to protect that.’ Costa’s climbdown was announced in a . letter from the company which was also signed by Conservative MP Sarah . Wollaston and Totnes mayor Pruw Boswell – who thanked the  coffee giant . ‘for being prepared to  listen to our concerns and showing that they . care’. Dr Wollaston said: ‘Costa have considered all the issues and decided that they will not come to Totnes. Result: Brasserie owner Tony Kershaw said: ¿We¿re happy with the decision Costa has made. Totnes is pretty independent and different as a town, and we¿re seeking to protect that' ‘I welcome that decision and want to thank Costa for being prepared to listen to those concerns.’ The coffee shop had been given . planning permission by South Hams District Council – but that decision . was greeted by a 150-strong group of placard-wielding demonstrators who . marched through the town’s streets. The anti-Costa campaign was also . supported by former resident and author Joan Brady, who once won a . literary award from the Whitbread group which owns the coffee chain. Of Costa’s 2,344 British stores, 19  are in Devon, where it employs nearly 200 people. The chain recently reported its 42nd consecutive quarter of growth, with profits of £36.1million. Earlier this month, the founder of . Costa said it had too many branches. Italian-born Bruno Costa, 70, who . created the company with his brother Sergio in the 1970s, likened the . chain to supermarket monolith Tesco and said Costa had taken over in his . home town of Purley, Croydon, where a sixth branch is due to open. Before the dramatic retreat, a . spokesman for Costa had insisted the company would ‘aim to complement . the local offering and support the local community’ in Totnes. Against Costa: The town boasts 41 independent coffee outlets and is well-known in the South West for its 'alternative' image . But in yesterday’s letter, managing . director Chris Rogers wrote: ‘In all communities in which we operate, we . seek to be a force for good, contributing to growth, creating jobs and . supporting our local community. ‘In making this decision Costa has . recognised the strength of feeling in Totnes against national brands and . taken into account the specific circumstances of Totnes. ‘Totnes is a town with a long and . proud history of independent retailers. It has one of the lowest . percentage of branded stores of any town of its size in the UK, very few . empty shop fronts, as well as a very high proportion of places selling . coffee.’ Campaigner Martin Turner said he was ‘flabbergasted’ by the ‘good sense’ the firm had shown. The manager and owner of Tangerine . Tree Cafe said: ‘We are delighted. We are an independent town and we . don’t want a clone high street.’ Ian Gregory, co-owner of Fat Lemons . Cafe, said: ‘It’s surprising that they’ve made the decision after . everything seemed to be set. I’ve never heard of a big company like . Costa doing anything like this before.’","5,000 residents signed a petition saying no to having Costa in the town .

Demonstrations were held across Britain today in support of five Royal Marines accused of murdering a Taliban prisoner. The troops were charged a fortnight ago after a video was found on one of the Marines’ computers allegedly showing them discussing what to do with a wounded insurgent in a compound in Afghanistan last year. Since the arrests, a swell of sympathy for the Marines has been developing on Facebook, with more than 100,000 online supporters joining calls for them to be cleared. This led to a series of demonstrations yesterday in London, Plymouth, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh, Swansea and Norwich. Protest: Ex-Royal Marines in green berets and members of the public demonstrate outside Downing Street . In support: Hundreds of people walked in the peaceful protest in Plymouth, calling for the five Royal Marines' murder charges to be dropped . Demo: Supporters also gathered in Manchester holding up two giant poppies outside the Town Hall . Details of the incident involving the . servicemen have not been revealed but the Ministry of Defence described . it as ‘an engagement with an insurgent’ with no civilians involved. The groups behind the protests are . wearing green ribbons behind their poppies, and are calling on the Prime . Minister and MoD to stop military police proceedings, or any court . martial. Yesterday – the 348th anniversary of . the founding of the Royal Marines by King Charles II – hundreds of . supporters met at 11am in different locations to make their demands . public. It is not clear whether any relatives . of the accused – who have not been named – were taking part. All serving . Marines have been barred from wearing uniforms to any such . demonstrations. Organiser of the Leeds protest, former . Army private Stef Proietti, 36, said tens of thousands of people . believed troops in Afghanistan were doing a dangerous job and needed to . be free of prosecution. Demands: One man holds up a placard pleading for freedom for the five soldiers charged with murder after an incident involving an Afghan Taliban fighter . He added that the mother and sister of . one of the men accused had spoken to him privately – but said warnings . from the MoD meant they were unable to formally campaign. Mr Proietti . said: ‘We had about 120 people in a show of support next to the war . memorial in Leeds city centre. The American soldiers who shot dead . unarmed Osama Bin Laden haven’t been arrested for murder – so why are we . arresting Royal Marines who were being attacked and shot at?’ Mr Proietti added that the mother of . the accused Marine he had met had told him £1,000 a month was being . taken out of his wages to pay his legal fees. He went on: ‘Military . welfare officers aren’t even letting the families of the five men talk . to each other. The families are scared of speaking out.’ He said his Facebook page – titled . ‘Support the 7 Royal Marines’ because two more men were originally under . suspicion – now had 64,000 supporters. In London, almost 100 former Marines . and family members attended an informal ‘gathering of support’ opposite . Downing Street. A larger London event had been planned, but was . cancelled over fears it would be hijacked by groups such as the British . National Party and the English Defence League. The Daily Mail found a . number of EDL supporters among those linked to the Marines Facebook . groups. Merry march: The crowd was greeted with cheers and beeping car horns when they reached the city centre . No trial: Two female protesters demanding 'Justice for the 5' as they march through Plymouth . Heroes: One woman walking in the protest march holds the flag of the Royal Marines . Former Marine James Grant, 34 – a . veteran of two tours in Afghanistan – said the charges against the five . were unjust. He said: ‘They were doing their job in incredibly difficult . circumstances. Most of our politicians have not been out to Afghanistan . and can never imagine what it is like to be at war.’ As well as wearing their regimental . ties, a number of the supporters were also wearing green lapel ribbons . being sold by the campaign – some bearing the words ‘Free the 5’. Another former Marine, Bob Tucker, 57, . said: ‘These lads were carrying out Government orders and now it feels . like they have been hung out to dry.’ In Plymouth, up to 300 people gathered . to march close to the barracks of the the Royal Marines’ 3 Commando . Brigade, waving ‘Justice for the five’, and ‘British military betrayed’ placards. In Manchester, pub manager Mark Anderson, 42, led dozens of protesters as they gathered outside the Town Hall. The MoD is refusing to comment on the ongoing case. The five Marines are due to offer pleas at a hearing in December. This is the first time UK troops have . been charged with murder during the conflict in Afghanistan. Strict . rules of engagement, largely derived from the Geneva Convention, dictate . how troops treat the enemy.

A Greek journalist was hauled before a court yesterday for revealing the names of more than 2,000 alleged tax cheats. Costas Vaxevanis is accused of violating privacy laws by publishing the details of wealthy compatriots who have HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland. At a time of unprecedented austerity in Greece, his exposure of allegations involving £1.6billion have taken on huge significance. Led away: Kostas Vaxevanis was giving a radio interview in Athens when officers stormed into the studio saying he had to cut the segment short 'to be arrested' Mr Vaxevanis, who edits the magazine Hot Doc, insisted he had acted in the public interest. ‘Journalism is revealing the truth . when everyone else is trying to hide it,’ he said. ‘Everything else is . just public relations. Today, it’s not Hot Doc that’s on trial but press . freedom in Greece, and truth. ‘If anyone is accountable before the . law then it is those ministers who hid the list, lost it and said it . didn’t exist. I only did my job. I am a journalist and I did my job. ‘The public prosecutors’ office has . shown a special interest in its dealings with me. I don’t know why this . is the case.’ Mr Vaxevanis was arrested on Sunday and faces two years in . prison if he is convicted. He is due to appear in the Athens court . again on Thursday. He was backed yesterday by the Greek daily newspaper Ta Nea, which also published the list spread over 11 news pages. The 2,059 named Greeks, who have a . combined £1.6billion in Swiss accounts, include dozens of prominent . business figures and two former ministers. Show of support: Supporters applaud Mr Vaxevanis who likened his arresting officers to Nazi stormtroopers . Vaxevanis speaks: The list, given to Greece by French authorities in 2010, contains the names of 2,059 Greek account holders at HSBC in Switzerland to be probed for possible tax evasion . The list was handed to the Greek government by the French authorities more than two years ago. It has been nicknamed the ‘Lagarde . List’ after Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary . Fund who was the French finance minister when it was handed over. Greek . authorities insist there is no evidence those included have broken the . law. Lagarde List: The list has been dubbed the 'Lagarde List' after Christine Lagarde, pictured, the head of the International Monetary Fund who was the French finance minister when the it was handed over to Greek authorities . Poesy, a union for Greek journalists, . denounced the arrest of Mr Vaxevanis, saying the prosecutor’s actions . threatened free speech in a country where the press is self regulated. Opposition leader Alexis Tsipras said: . ‘It is unacceptable that in Greece, which has been on its knees in . recent years, tax evaders are left undisturbed and those who conceal . possible evasion are not prosecuted but those who make revelations are.’ Court officials say the two politicians on the list have been referred to parliament for investigation. The list has highlighted deep . divisions in a country which is now in its fifth year of recession, and . where austerity measures have taken a heavy toll on poorer sections of . society. Athens is negotiating with its . international creditors over a £10billion package of further austerity . measures, with unemployment standing at 25 per cent. Former ministers have faced fierce criticism for failing to thoroughly investigate those named on the list. In testimony before a parliamentary . committee last week, George Papaconstantinou, who was finance minister . when the list was given to the Greek authorities, said he had asked the . financial crime squad to investigate 20 individuals. Evangelos . Venizelos, leader of the PASOK socialist party and also a former finance . minister, said he had been given a data stick containing the list a . year ago by a senior investigator, but was unsure if this was the . original. Earlier this month, Mr Venizelos said . he had handed the drive to prime minister Antonis Samaras when he . realised no other copy of it existed.

Taxpayers could be landed with a £10million bill to compensate victims of ‘fatal’ Government delays in handling ash dieback disease. More than 100,000 ash saplings have been destroyed in recent weeks, while the import and movement of the trees has also been banned, leaving nursery stock effectively worthless. One nursery is suing the Government for £200,000, while the horticultural trade body says more legal action will follow unless ministers offer adequate compensation to all its affected members. Suing: Simon Ellis was forced to destroy 50,000 ash trees at Crowders Nurseries, Horncastle . Scientists have warned the killer fungus – chalara fraxinea – could wipe out almost all of Britain’s 80 million ash trees within a generation, with new cases now confirmed in Kent and Essex woodland for the first time. The number of confirmed sites has risen by more than 50 per cent since the weekend, up from 52 to 82. Martin Ward, chief plant health officer at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), yesterday acknowledged that ‘we are probably not going eradicate’ the disease. There is increasing anger among plant wholesalers over the Government’s failure  to offer them any financial support, despite warnings from the Horticultural Trade  Association as early as 2009 that action  was needed to prevent dieback from spreading. Killer: New cases of the dangerous fungus, which could wipe out millions of ash trees, were confirmed this weekend in southeast England . The trade body claims the Government initially misdiagnosed the disease, believing it to be the same as one already present in Britain. Tim Briercliffe, director of business development at the HTA, said the delay seemed to ‘ignore common sense’ and warned that it would consider legal action if no compensation was offered. He said: ‘Nurseries and tree growers have £10million of ash that will either be destroyed or no longer has a market. Threat: An ash tree affected by fungus . 'We want the Government to come forward and acknowledge this is a specific case and offer some form of compensation. ‘We asked them to do something as long ago as 2009, and they didn’t. The fault lies at their door for not acting soon enough. ‘If no financial package is offered, then we would be forced to take legal action on behalf of the trade.’ One plant nursery forced to destroy 50,000 ash trees said it would be suing the Government for more than £200,000. Simon Ellis, managing director of Crowders Nurseries in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, said it took the Government three months to tell him what to do after finding trees at the nursery were infected in June. ‘There have been instances, such as foot and mouth, where farmers have been compensated for their loss of stock,’ he said. ‘But despite the Government failing to heed the warnings, we are being asked to foot the bill for the damage done. ‘We have had to uproot and destroy stock which we’ve been growing for six years. 'If they had listened to us in 2009 and acted we wouldn’t have this situation now.’ A Defra spokesman said: ‘It is  our view that resources are best spent on surveillance and other preventative disease management activities.’ Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will chair a summit on ash dieback tomorrow, and is holding twice daily meetings to discuss the problem with experts. He warned that more cases are expected.","Cases of the killer fungus confirmed in Essex and Kent for the first time .

Homeowners may be landed with huge bills if ash trees on their property are infected with killer fungus and need to be felled. It costs up to £1,000 to have a diseased tree cut down and disposed of safely, but people will not be able to claim the cost on their home insurance. The department responsible says there is no prospect of the Government stepping in to offer compensation to anyone affected. Felled for fungus: Homeowners may have to pay up to £1,000 if ash trees on their property are infected with ash dieback (pictured) need to be felled . The disease, ash dieback, has already been found at 29 sites across the country, threatening to scar the landscape for decades. And now it has emerged that the crisis could hit the pockets of ordinary householders as well as farmers and landowners. The Horticultural Trades Association, which represents garden nurseries, says it costs between £600 and £1,000 to chop down a sick tree. They have warned the failure of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to offer compensation could aid the spread of the disease, because there is no incentive to report infected trees on your land. No incentive: The Horticultural Trades Association says that the failure of the Government to offer compensation could aid the spread of the disease because there is no incentive to report infected trees on your land . Tim Briercliffe, the HTA’s director of business development, said it was unfair that farmers whose cattle were infected by foot and mouth disease were offered compensation but there was nothing on offer to those whose trees have fallen victim. Unfair: Tim Briercliffe from HTA said it was unfair that farmers whose cattle were infected by foot and mouth disease got compensation but there is none for infected tree owners . ‘We believe that the control of the  disease will be more effective if compensation is offered,’ he added. ‘People are legally obliged to report the disease but there is no incentive to do so, because if they report it they’ll be landed with a bill of up to £1,000 to remove a single ash tree. ‘If people aren’t reporting this, or are getting rid of trees on the quiet, we can’t get a grip on the disease.’ Farmers in West Yorkshire have been told they will have to pay for a cull – and there would be no compensation. Paul Sykes, managing director of a 2,000-acre estate in Farnley Tyas, was ordered last Friday to destroy 1,700 ash saplings within a week. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘Household policies will cover damage to your property by a tree felled by a storm or flood. But any costs incurred in felling an ash tree or treatment in respect of disease is not something covered under home insurance.’ A spokesman for Defra said: ‘We believe that resources are best spent on tackling the disease.’","Residents will not be able to claim the cost on their home insurance .

Two of the board members who quit Parliament’s expenses watchdog last night accused MPs of  ‘gratuitous hostility’. Charity boss Jackie Ballard and businessman Ken Olisa also said they were leaving the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority because of interference by Commons Speaker John Bercow. This, they said, threatened to undermine their independence and destroy public confidence in the new system to keep tabs on MPs after the 2009 expenses scandal. Fury: Jackie Ballard and Ken Olisa say they quit the expenses watchdog over interference and hostility from MPs . In all, four of the five board members have quit, with Mr Bercow accused of forcing them out of  Ipsa by making them re-apply for their jobs – even though critics maintain that the rules allow for the members to stay in post for another term. Former High Court judge Sir Scott Baker, former Liberal Democrat leadership contender Jackie Ballard, businessman Ken Olisa and Professor Isobel Sharp announced they were stepping down when their contracts expire in January . Mrs Ballard and Mr Olisa were also infuriated that the appointments process will be partially overseen by former Tory MP Peter Atkinson, who repeatedly voted for expenses details to be kept secret. In a stinging letter to Mr Bercow, Mr Olisa said that this was like asking disgraced banker Fred  Goodwin to pick the next Governor of the Bank of England. Labour MP John Mann said the intervention ‘looks like the Speaker’s revenge for the unpopularity of Ipsa among MPs’. Letters released this week revealed that Ipsa chairman Sir Ian Kennedy warned Mr Bercow that his intervention could threaten the credibility of the new expenses regime. Mrs Ballard and Mr Olisa have made little attempt to hide their anger with the Speaker and MPs, who have reacted furiously to the watchdog. Mr Olisa said Ipsa was suffering an ‘absence’ of independence which ‘renders me unable to stand for (re)appointment’. He warned that Ipsa had suffered ‘gratuitous hostility’ from MPs since cracking down on their expenses claims. Mr Olisa added: ‘The fundamental changes introduced by Ipsa were always going to engender opposition and scrutiny. But, the scale of the reaction from within Westminster has been astonishing – especially given that our job was to clean up a mess not of our making.’ Warning: IPSA chairman Sir Ian Kennedy warned Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured) that his intervention could discredit the new expenses regime . Mrs Ballard said she was ‘very concerned’ about the Speaker’s intervention in the board selection process. She added: ‘This goes back over the entire three years of our existence. ‘A small number of MPs was not happy Ipsa was set up and have attacked it at every opportunity. ‘Ipsa has taken decisions that are not popular with MPs. Most MPs have accepted them and decided to get on with their jobs – some have decided to attack the organisation.’ Ipsa’s two other board members, Appeal Court judge Sir Scott Baker and senior accountant Professor Isobel Sharp, are also quitting when their terms end in January. They are said to share their colleagues’ concerns. Last night, however, a key ally of Mr Bercow and his closest friend at Westminster, accused Ipsa of  ‘disgraceful’ behaviour for going public over its concerns. Tory MP Charles Walker called for Sir Ian to back down or resign. He insisted it was ‘total rubbish’ to suggest the Speaker was undermining Ipsa’s independence. Mr Walker told Radio 4’s World at One: ‘It is absolutely independent, but Sir Ian is now suggesting that that independence has been compromised. ‘If he believed independence has been compromised, why is he still continuing as chairman?’But last night Sir Ian said: ‘I don’t propose to get drawn into a slanging match with anyone.’","Jackie Ballard and Ken Olisa accused MPs of 'gratuitous hostility'

Determined: Home Secretary Theresa May wants to reduce the 'pull factors' blamed for attracting jobless migrants . Migrants from Romania and Bulgaria . could be barred from using NHS hospitals if they come to Britain without . a job, Theresa May suggested yesterday. The Home Secretary admitted she would . not be able to extend travel restrictions on the two countries when . these expire at the end of next year. But she said she was determined . to limit the so-called ‘pull factors’ blamed for drawing thousands of . jobless migrants to the UK. Home Office sources said officials . were looking at restricting access to key public services for migrants . who arrive here without a job. Areas being looked at include healthcare, . education, housing and benefits. Detailed proposals will be published . next year but enforcing any ban will be fraught with difficulties. The scheme has echoes of California’s . controversial ‘Proposition 187’ law, which barred undocumented . immigrants from using public services. The law was adopted in 1994 but . abandoned five years later after it was ruled unconstitutional. Mrs May told the BBC’s Andrew Marr . Show: ‘I will be looking at the transitional controls on Romania and . Bulgaria at the end of 2013. 'I will be looking at what we call the pull . factors, what is it that attracts people sometimes to come over here to . the United Kingdom, so looking at issues about benefits, and access to . the Health Service, and things like that.’ Ministers fear that a mass influx of . immigrants from the two ex-communist regimes could derail the already . difficult target of reducing net immigration to under 100,000 by 2015. Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU at . the start of 2007 and remain its two poorest countries. Transitional . restrictions were imposed to prevent the kind of influx of migrants seen . when Poland joined the EU. Influx: Ministers fear they will miss target for reducing immigration . As a result, migrants from these two . countries still require a work permit, and there are strict quotas on . the number who can come to do low-skilled jobs. Only people who have lived in the UK . for the past year can get free NHS treatment but a Panorama . investigation found that a third of 133 hospital trusts that replied to . Freedom of Information requests made no checks. Earlier this year an investigation by . Pulse magazine estimated that over the past three years health tourists . had been given free hospital treatment worth £40million. Mrs May also confirmed she was reviewing the wider question of free movement within the EU. Controls: Mrs May told Andrew Marr she is reviewing free movement in the EU . The Home Office is in talks with other . EU countries about stopping illegal immigrants who enter into sham . marriages with people in other EU countries in order to be able to work . and travel freely across the continent. Mrs May insisted the Government was . still committed to its target of cutting net immigration from well over . 200,000 a year to under 100,000. ‘That is still our aim, that we will . get net migration down to the tens of thousands,’ she said. ‘In the last . figures, which were to the end of last December, we saw 30,000 fewer . net migrants – the first significant fall for many years.’ Tory critics believe the target is . unachievable without restrictions on migration from the EU.

David Cameron’s former ‘back-to-work tsar’ Emma Harrison last night claimed she was ‘bullied’ out of her job following embarrassing revelations that she had paid herself £8.6 million. In an emotional interview Mrs Harrison said she had been unfairly caught up in a ‘political maelstrom’, forcing her to quit her roles as a Downing Street adviser and as chairman of controversial welfare-to-work firm A4e. She did not criticise Mr Cameron directly. But, appearing close to tears, she said: ‘I am a useful face for the political people to have a go at.’ Scroll down for video . In an emotional interview, former A4e boss Emma Harrison claimed she had been bullied out of her job . Her comments came as leaked figures suggested A4e received £46 million from the taxpayer last year for its work on the Government’s flagship Work Programme - despite finding long-terms jobs for fewer than four per cent of its unemployed ‘clients’. Figures passed to Channel Four News revealed that just 3,400 of the 94,000 jobseekers referred to A4e were found a job lasting six months or more during the first year of the Government’s flagship Work Programme. Despite this, the firm was paid £45.9 million for its work on the scheme, which ministers hope will get the long-term jobless back to work and drive down unemployment. On average, each job cost the taxpayer £13,500. The figures - which were disputed by the company - will spark fresh concerns about whether the £5 billion Work Programme can deliver value for money to the taxpayer and cut unemployment. Ministers have argued that the terms of the ‘payment-by-results’ scheme mean that firms will not profit unless they find jobs for significant numbers of unemployed people. But firms like A4e, one of five main contractors, receive a ‘referral fee’ of at least £400 for each jobseeker they take on. Jobseekers considered harder to place attract a fee of £600. A4e then receives £1,200 if a client is placed in a job for six months, with further payments to follow for up to 20 months. The leaked figures suggest A4e’s success rate during the first year of the programme was just 3.65 per cent - well below even the Government’s minimum threshold of 5.5 per cent. Mrs Harrison last night said the figures were ‘all wrong’, but declined to say what the true position is. She said the statistics were part of an ongoing attempt to discredit the operation of the Work Programme. She added: 'I was bullied out of a job that I had been doing for 25 years. 'My staff have been bullied. And do you know what’s worse? Because of the reporting you did my children have been bullied.' Ms Harrison disputed figures showing A4e had a success rate of getting people into work of just 3.65 per cent . She added: 'It’s time this bullying stopped. Bullying entrepreneurs like me, someone like me who has invested tens of millions and employed thousands of people, it’s not good for the UK.' 'We were caught in this political maelstrom. I am a useful face for the politics people to have a go at. 'I am not a politician, I am not a civil servant, I am not experienced in this stuff. But I was really useful to have a go at. And they used me and my organisation and I stepped down as the chairman, which is still incredibly upsetting as it’s something I loved doing. 'When I meet people in the street and they say ""Oh, I recognise you, your lot got me that job. I’m now working at Marks & Spencer, it’s transformed my life"", I bloody love the work I do.' A4e also disputed the figures, which it said it ‘did not recognise’. Mrs Harrison said A4e was a ‘wonderful company’, and insisted she had invested £50 million in building it up. And she struggled to control her emotions as she discussed her spectacular downfall earlier this year. Mrs Harrison quit as the Prime Minister’s adviser two weeks after the Daily Mail revealed she had paid herself an astonishing dividend of £8.6 million, most of it relating to public sector contracts. The following day she quit as the company’s chairman, although she still controls 85 per cent of the firm’s shares. The firm also faced a string of allegations of fraud, although it was later largely cleared of serious abuse by the Department for Work and Pensions. Mrs Harrison said she had been ‘bullied out of a job I loved’ and remained ‘incredibly upset’ about what had happened. She said the firm’s staff, and even her own children, had also been bullied. She went on: ‘Bullying entrepreneurs is not good for the UK.’ In a statement last night A4e said the leaked figures were ‘out of date’, adding that the ‘data does not give a full or accurate picture of Work Programme performance’. The company pointed out that the Work Programme is only 18 months into a five-year scheme. The DWP is expected to publish its own initial figures next month, but has cautioned it is too early to judge the final outcome of the scheme.","The former chairman of A4e was forced to quit in a row about the company's work in helping people into jobs .

Imposing boardroom quotas for women would be 'patronising' and wrong, Women's Minister Maria Miller said yesterday. In a major speech on women's role in the economy yesterday, Mrs Miller dismissed a drive by the European Commission to impose a minimum 40 per cent quota for women on company boards. She said more still needed to be done on both equal opportunities and pay, but insisted policy would not be driven by 'political correctness'. Removing barriers: Women's Minister Maria Miller has called for greater support in helping women reach their goals rather than imposing quotas . 'It makes no sense to stifle the achievement and aspiration of 50 per cent of our society. 'It is absolutely essential that we maximise the contribution that women can make to our economy. 'Not because of political correctness, but because of economic reality. Now more than ever, we need to remove barriers to the workplace. 'The way to do this is not through special treatment or regulation like the European Commission's quotas idea, which patronises women and undermines the business case. 'It is about removing the barriers to achieving their goals, and so that women are supported all the way from the shop floor to the boardroom.' Sources in Brussels last night said the EU was poised to abandon its controversial quota plans because of opposition from Britain and other countries. Mrs Miller also unveiled a £2 million scheme to boost childcare and help more women find a job. Grants of up to £500 will be available from next April for people setting up a nursery or childminding business. The money will help cover legal and insurance costs, health and safety training and equipment, while advice and mentoring will also be offered. Mrs Miller hopes £2million scheme will boost female entrepreneurs . Mrs Miller said the scheme would create jobs and help reverse a decline in the number of childminders, which has been identified as a barrier for women wanting to return to work. She said: 'The childcare industry is already a major employer of women, and this scheme will provide huge opportunities for female entrepreneurs to start up and run their own businesses. 'This is an injection of cash designed to stimulate the sector in tough times, the new scheme will provide more childcare places but will also help get up to 6,000 new childcare businesses off the ground.

David Cameron was at war with his own senior law officer last night after insisting that prisoners would not be given the vote. Attorney General Dominic Grieve was said to be ‘furious’ with the Prime Minister’s stance. Last night there was speculation that Mr Grieve could even resign his Government role if the Prime Minister fails to respect the ‘rule of law’ and do as he wishes. Collision course: David Cameron (left) has insisted that prisoners will not be given the vote, opposing his own senior law officer, Attorney General Dominic Grieve (right) The Prime Minister told MPs that Britain would not capitulate to demands by the European Court of Human Rights for inmates to be enfranchised. He told MPs: ‘No one should be in any doubt – prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.’ His comments were seen as a swift slap-down for Mr Grieve, the Cabinet’s most senior legal adviser. Only minutes earlier Mr Grieve had claimed that Britain’s reputation would be damaged if it did not adhere to the ruling by Strasbourg, which dates back to 2005. Mr Grieve, who claimed it was technically possible for Britain to be booted out of the Council of Europe, said: ‘The United Kingdom has an enviable reputation in relation to human rights standards and adherence. ‘I have no doubt that it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws.’ Slapdown: The Prime Minister told MPs that Britain would not capitulate to demands by the European Court of Human Rights for inmates to be enfranchised . Mr Grieve argued that refusing . inmates the vote ‘would be costly to the United Kingdom’ as Strasbourg . would almost certainly award them compensation worth tens of millions of . pounds. Mr Grieve added that, while the Government could choose not to pay, that ‘would be a further breach of the obligations’. He . added: ‘The issue is whether the United Kingdom wishes to be in breach . of its international obligations and what that does to the reputation of . the United Kingdom.’ The remarks by Mr Grieve infuriated backbench Tory MPs. They . insist it is nonsense to suggest  Britain could be thrown out of the . Council of Europe, which has failed to suspend the membership of . countries such as Russia and Turkey which are guilty of flagrant abuses . of human rights. MPs also . point out that the overwhelming majority of MPs voted last year  to . maintain the UK’s historic ban on prisoner voting and say Strasbourg . must respect the sovereignty of Parliament. The . latest day of drama over prisoner voting was prompted by claims that . the Government was prepared finally to reach a settlement with . Strasbourg. To the anger of . Tory MPs, it was reported that Mr Grieve had persuaded Mr Cameron of . the need to introduce a Bill giving at least a limited number of . convicts the vote. But the claims were immediately rejected by Number Ten and insiders at the Ministry of Justice. Later, . at Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t . want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not have the vote. ‘If . it helps by having another vote in Parliament on another resolution to . make absolutely clear, to help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am . very happy to do that.’ A . Tory source said Mr Grieve had gone public with his concerns after . becoming frustrated with Mr  Cameron’s refusal to accept his advice on . prisoner voting. He is backed in the Cabinet by former Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke. Opposition: David Cameron (left) has said the vote idea makes him feel 'physically sick', while UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage (right) was shocked by ministers even considering giving concessions to the court . The . source said: ‘For Dominic the rule of law is the key issue. The legal . advice is very clear that the UK has to abide by the court’s ruling. There are different ways of doing it, but we cannot just say no – it may . be popular politically in the short term, but legally it is madness and . even the popularity of it may fade when we start having to pay . compensation to murderers.’ A senior Government source insisted that Mr Cameron’s stance did not conflict with the Government’s legal advice. The source said: ‘The Attorney General’s arguments are slightly difficult to penetrate – he says lots of different things. ‘The focus has been on his concerns, but he does point out that parliament is sovereign and that there is flexibility in this.’","European Court of Human Rights ruled prisoners should be enfranchised .

Labour's deputy leader repeatedly refused to say whether the party's deputy chairman Tom Watson was 'justified' in making claims about a senior Tory's alleged involvement in child abuse, which sparked a frenzy of speculation on the internet. 'He thinks it has justified the claim he has made,' she said. Tory critics claim Mr Watson's decision to raise the issue in Parliament rather than discussing it privately with the police has led to the 'smearing' of a number of senior Conservatives on the internet. Mr Watson used Parliamentary privilege last month to claim in the Commons that he was aware of 'clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10'. He spoke of a 'senior aide to a former prime minister' being involved. His allegations are thought to be different from those made by the disastrous Newsnight investigation which led to false claims about the former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine. On the BBC's Sunday Politics show yesterday, presenter Andrew Neil asked Miss Harman if she agreed it was important that 'people don't make wild and unsubstantiated accusations that result in senior people being accused of things which are wholly false ... and the kind of accusations Tom Watson made has encouraged that'.

Mr Watson did not respond to phone calls yesterday.

Jobless couples with more than two children should have benefit payments limited, Iain Duncan Smith suggested yesterday. The Work and Pensions Secretary said there were ‘large numbers’ of couples on welfare having big families – unlike middle-income parents who had to weigh up if they could afford to have another child. Mr Duncan Smith condemned the ‘madness’ of the state subsidising large workless families – saying it would be fairer to the ‘vast majority’ of responsible taxpayers if benefits were limited to the first two children in future. He has agreed to find another £10billion in welfare savings by 2016, having already slashed £18billion from a vast budget that grew by 60 per cent under Labour. As well as cuts to child benefit and tax credits for large workless families, he suggested housing benefit could be stripped for those who expected to go straight from school on to welfare and a state-subsidised house. Liberal Democrat sources, however, warned nothing had been agreed and suggested the proposals were ‘just Tory kite-flying’. A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘It doesn’t even save very much money as we’ve already introduced a benefits cap.’ But Mr Duncan Smith said more reforms were vital as the Government sought to control public finances. He dismissed suggestions the Coalition was ‘hurting’ claimants – insisting the real cruelty was leaving people languishing on welfare for years. ‘We have accepted for far too long in this country that it is possible for people to just stay on benefits,’ he said. ‘It is all about saying, we will give you massive support to find work... But also, we have an expectation, as the taxpayer pays for these bills, that you try your hardest to find work.’ Most controversially, Mr Duncan Smith . suggested the present system encouraged poorer families to have large . numbers of children without worrying about the cost. 'An end to never-ending benefits': The Government plans to restrict housing benefit to the under-25s . ‘When you look at families across the . board, at all incomes, you find the vast, vast majority make decisions . about the kind of numbers of children they have, the families they want, . based on what they think they can afford,’ he said. ‘Where you see the clustering of the . large families is really down at the very lowest incomes, those on . significant levels of welfare, and those on the very top incomes. In . other words, the problem for those who are paying the taxes, paying the . bills – they make the decisions about their lives, even if they . sometimes would like to maybe have extra children, they make decisions. ‘People who are having support through . welfare are often free from that decision. We want to support people if . they have children when they are out of work, of course. ‘But can there not be a limit to the . fact that really you need to remember you need to cut your cloth in . accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have?’ In his speech to the Cambridge Public . Policy think-tank, he suggested only welfare claimants having children . in future would be affected, not existing families. Alison Garnham, of the Child Poverty . Action Group, said: ‘When parents plan their families they’re not . thinking about whether at some point in future they might be on . benefit.’ Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘The truth is it’s working people who are seeing their help axed.’","Iain Duncan Smith to call for further changes to the welfare system .

Britain has bounced out of double-dip recession following the strongest growth figures for five years. The nation's output leapt by 1 per cent in the three months to September, far faster than experts had forecast and boosted by the Olympics and, indirectly, the Diamond Jubilee. Chancellor George Osborne welcomed the news – the best quarterly growth since the collapse of Northern Rock in 2007 – but was careful to warn that the economy still faces serious difficulties. Scroll down for video . Golden summer: Jessica Ennis wins the 800 metres to take the gold medal in the heptathlon event in the Olympic Stadium, Stratford, east London . Today's growth figure of 1.0 per cent comes after three consecutive quarters when the economy shrank and ends the douple-dip recession which began in the second quarter of 2008 . David Cameron used his new Twitter account to welcome the growth figures . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said a . 'one-off boost from the Olympics is welcome' but warned underlying . growth remained weak. Labour renewed its calls for more Government . spending and a cut in VAT. Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean, however, declared that Britain's economy was past the worst. 'Looking at the UK economy, the . expectation is growth should be picking up,' he said. 'There is bound to . be volatile movement from quarter to quarter, but the underlying trend . is for growth.' The Chancellor, who was under pressure . following negative economic figures for the previous nine months, . agreed there were encouraging signs that the economy was healing. 'Britain is recovering from a very deep banking crisis,' he said. 'But . today you can see that the British economy is on the right track.' However he warned against complacency: . 'There are plenty of risks out there. Look at the data from the . eurozone this week that shows us that there is still a difficult . economic situation in the world.' Mr Osborne was scathing about the . advice from Mr Balls, branding him 'the man more responsible than almost . anyone else for what went wrong in the British economy'. Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the GDP figures during a visit to Panorama Antennas in Wandsworth, South-west London today . Mr Cameron, who met tool technician Adam Gorzala, said the growth figures figures 'show we are on the right track' He said: 'The prescription the Labour . Party offers is the same prescription that got us into this trouble. This coalition government is taking a different approach, which is that . Britain has to confront its problems – rebalancing that economy, healing . that economy is what we're all about.' Mr Balls, who last year denied that . Labour had been running a structural budget deficit, yesterday . acknowledged there had been one. The International Monetary Fund . confirmed the Government was running a structural, or long-term deficit . of 5.2 per cent of GDP in 2007, or £73billion – the biggest in the G7 . group of leading nations. The PM posed on the steps of Number to mark the Royal British legion poppy appeal minutes before the Office for National Statistics confirmed Britain was out of recession . On the latest economic figures, Mr . Balls said: 'Our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence. But this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking.' The GDP figures rounded off a good run . of economic news in recent weeks which has seen inflation fall to  2.2 . per cent having peaked at 5.2 per cent last year, unemployment drop to . 7.9 per cent, and employment hit a record high of nearly 30million. The Government has also borrowed far . less than feared so far this year – giving the Chancellor a fighting . chance of hitting his budget targets as he battles to cut the record . deficit racked up by Labour. But economists warned that 'underlying' growth in the economy is not as strong as the latest figures suggest. The sale of Olympic tickets added 0.2 . per cent to GDP in the third quarter. The Diamond Jubilee in June, . although it fell in the previous quarter, also helped indirectly. This . was because between July and September companies clawed back the 0.5 per . cent of output lost because of the extra bank holiday from the Jubilee. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency exchange company World First, said the economy is 'bouncing along the bottom'. He said: 'While this is undoubtedly a . welcome surprise, upon breaking down the numbers we should not get . caught up in a flurry of champagne corks and party poppers. We are not . out of the woods yet.' The ONS figures showed the dominant . services sector rose by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter while . industrial output was up 1.1 per cent. But the construction sector . shrank 2.5 per cent as builders continued to bear the brunt of the . downturn. The Prime Minister bought his poppy on the steps of Number 10 minutes before the GDP figures were published . The economy is still 3.1 per cent . smaller than it was before the crisis struck and just 0.6 per cent . bigger than it was when the Chancellor delivered his spending review two . years ago. Azad Zangana, an economist at fund . manager Schroders, said underlying growth was probably about 0.3 per . cent after the boost from the Olympics and Jubilee was excluded. 'That is not strong enough to shield . the UK from the external risks that partly contributed to the latest . recession,' he said. 'In our view, the UK remains at high risk of a . 'triple-dip' recession in 2013.' Chancellor George Osborne insisted he was 'working hard' to fix the economy . Mr Cameron risked angering the statistics watchdog yesterday when he drops in inflation and unemployment would be followed by more 'good news' VIDEO: 'Economy IS on right track' says Cameron, as economy climbs out of recession .","The economy grew by higher than expected 1.0 per cent in the three months from July to September, the Office for National Statistics said .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 22:52 EST, 1 November 2011 . Years before a breakaway sect grabbed headlines for a string of beard-cutting attacks in Ohio, an Amish community was living in fear of what they now call a 'cult.' Aden Troyer says he and his family were brought into the sect by his wife's father Sam Mullet, who’s believed by many to be the mastermind of the beard attacks. Now, years later, Mr Troyer still does not know what to tell his young daughters when they ask about their mother. Iron fist: Amish bishop Sam Mullet, 66, is accused of stealing the wives of men in the community and forcing them to live in chicken coops or in outside barns . Mr Troyer told CNN: 'I've kind of held back a little bit because they are so young, and I do not want to depress them.' He is among those who claim Mullet’s militant behaviour over his group is in stark contrast to the Amish faith. Mr Troyer told the network: 'The way he's been treating and talking to people, he is not an Amish guy. He is not your typical peaceful, loving Amish person.' He knew he had to get out, so one day, he scooped up his daughters and moved to Pennsylvania, but his wife wouldn’t follow. They later divorced, and Mr Troyer got full custody of the girls. The bizarre attacks last month have thrust this ferociously private community into the spotlight, with horror stories emerging of rape, beatings, brainwashing and kidnapping. Arrested: Lester Mullet (left) and Johnny Mullet (right) were arrested in Ohio for the alleged role in crimes by 'The Bergholz Clan' Arlene Miller said she and her husband helped one of Mullet's sons - Bill - escape from the clan and believes that may have been one of the reasons why he was attacked. Until recently, the sheriff could do little, because the Amish victims chose to shrug off the assaults rather than bring in law enforcement. But with a spate of attacks since September, people began to cooperate. Two of the Mullet's 18 children have been charged in the beard cuttings. Also charged: Levi Miller was also arrested in connection to the crime . Johnny S. Mullet and Lester S. Mullet will go to trial along with Levi and Eli Miller and and Daniel S. Mullet. He is Mullet's nephew. The men hired a lawyer and the case has been sent to felony court after they waived a preliminary hearing on the evidence last month. They were freed on $50,000 bond, which Sam Mullet is said to have paid. Sam Mullet denies his clan is a cult but sees value in punishing those who don't follow church teaching. 'You don't obey the law, you're punished, and it's the same way with the church,' Mullet said. The men are said to have acted at the direction of the 66-year-old over an unspecified dispute about church discipline and practices. In the Amish community, beards on men and long hair on women have spiritual value, and forcibly cutting either is a symbolic assault meant to denigrate. The men are accused of . bursting into an Ohio home on October 4 and holding an Amish man down as they . attempted to cut his beard and hair off with scissors and a . battery-powered shaver. There were more attacks, with victims including children as young as 13, who were targeted by as many as 27 members of the gang. The attacks occurred over the past month in the heart of Ohio's Amish population, one of the largest in the United States. Authorities . are investigating similar attacks in Jefferson, Carroll and Trumbull . counties, all of which Sheriff Fred Abdulla of Jefferson County believes . were orchestrated by Sam Mullet. In court: The five Amish men accused of aggravated burglary and kidnapping who will go on trial . Sheriff Abdulla said he once had a good relationship with Mullet, but the pair have had many run-ins over the years, including when he prosecuted one of his sons, Crist, for raping a 12-year-old girl. The sheriff also claims that Mullet threatened to kill him and some of his own children and was once involved in a custody battle. Sheriff Abdallah told CNN: 'If I were to get a . call right now telling me, ""Sheriff, they're all dead in the community . out there,"" it wouldn't surprise me.' But Sam Mullett has denied he ordered the attack, but admitted the goal was to send a message to Amish in Holmes County, Ohio, that they should be ashamed of themselves for the way they were treating Mullet and his community. Sam Mullet said: 'We'd like to get up in the morning, be left alone, live like normal people. They won't leave us be. 'But I didn't order anything like that. I didn't tell them not to, I'm still not going to tell them not to.' Amish men typically grow beards as adults and stop trimming them when they marry, and the beards are held in high esteem. He said the men hired a driver to carry them to Holmes County and to Carroll County, where a similar attack was carried out. Exposed: The men wore matching denim outfits and hats in court on Wednesday. They have hired a lawyer to fight their case . He said the driver didn't know what the men were doing. Arlene Miller told how her husband Myron was dragged out of their bed by his beard, taken outside and assaulted. Attorney: Andrew Hyde defended the men and said they were 'complete gentlemen with deeply founded Christian beliefs' She . said: ‘The guys came up and surrounded him and cut off a chunk of his . beard. They were unable to get any more because he struggled so hard . against them. 'The [attackers] say this is to uncover sins, and it’s to straighten us out.’ A . 57-year-old woman said her sons and a son-in-law who had joined the . rival group and are involved in a cult attacked her and her husband. After chopping off her husband’s whiskers, they shaved her head. 'They did this to me,’ she said, taking off a bandana to show her baldness.","Sam Mullet accused of beating and brainwashing members of his community .

With viewing figures of almost 10million every week, there's no doubting the popularity of ITV's charming period drama Downton Abbey. And it appears that we are so fixated with the upstairs/downstairs lives of the 1920s characters that we are even starting to copy their wardrobes. Sales of retro styles, including flapper dresses and demure ruffled blouses, are on the rise as we aspire to look like the immaculate ladies of the manor Sybil, Mary and Edith Crawley. Lady Sybil Crawley Lady Mary Crawley and Lady Edith Crawley are our new style icons as 1920s fashion gets a reprise . Figures from Littlewoods show that since the third series started sales of flapper style dresses have increased by 40%, traditional ruffle blouses shot up by 109% and even men are buying in to the trend with tweed and cord blazer sales rising a massive 146%. And over half of those polled by the fashion brand said they would love to go back to the 1920s to sample life during this fashionable period. Driving the trend are the elegant Crawley sisters with 39 per cent of women revealing that it is Lady Mary's . look they most want to replicate. The elaborate costumes and attention to historic detail are a key part of the period drama's charm . The Crawley ladies are inspiring British women to dress up and be more glamorous . Mary was closely followed by her mother Lady Cora Crawley with 25 per cent of the vote and then her youngest sibling Lady Sybil with 23 per cent. 1.     Southampton – 75% (increase in sales of 1920s inspired fashion) 2.     Luton – 73% . 3.     Preston  – 71% . 4.     Swansea  – 68% . 5.     Bristol – 67% . 6.     Edinburgh – 65% . 7.     Reading –63% . 8.     Norwich – 61% . 9.     Preston – 59% . 10.    Bournemouth – 56% . Devious Lady Edith only attracted . 12 per cent of women's style approval and perhaps more surprisingly flamboyantly . dressed newcomer American Martha Levinson received just 8 per cent of the vote. Julie Donnelly, Head of Womenswear Buying at Littlewoods.com said: 'Women's clothing has always sold well at Littlewoods.com, when the seasons change, but in recent weeks we have seen a large increase in the number of women buying items which are inspired by the 1920s. 'It is great to see that such a popular TV show as Downton Abbey has the ability to alter the way women think about fashion and possibly introduce them to different styles they hadn't previously tried. 'It just goes to show how timeless fashion can be and we fully expect that this is a trend which will continue to grow and grow throughout the Autumn months as the series continues.'

According to Sister Mary Michael, it will stand as a ‘symbol of hope’ offering ‘spiritual protection’ to all who look at it. But the nun’s plan to put up a 24ft high illuminated cross at the bottom of her 30ft long garden has left her neighbours, well, cross. Sister Mary, 68, has triggered an almighty debate after lodging a planning application to build the LED-lit cross in the back  garden of her two-bedroom bungalow. She says she plans three hours of prayers at the cross each day. Backyard worship: Sister Mary Michael wants to build a 24ft high cross in her backyard (pictured) saying it won't 'obliterate anyone's view' Godly garden: Sister Michael included an example of what her illuminated cross might look like in her application to council . The nun says the ‘Cross of Love’ would be 24ft high, with the cross beam measuring 4ft, lit in blue and . white which would ‘not obliterate anyone’s view’. She is now ‘earnestly praying for the money to come in’ to fund the structure. It would be a 1/100th scale replica . of the Glorious Cross of Dozule which was proposed to mark claims made . in the 1970s by a woman from the Normandy village of Dozule that she had . seen Christ 49 times. Although the cross was never built, around 4,000 scale-sized crosses are said to have been built around the world. Fiona Billings, who lives at the rear . of Sister Mary’s home in North Hykeham, near Lincoln, said the . structure was not in keeping with a residential area, would be visible . from her property and would cause light pollution. Neighbours object: Nearby residents have objected to the plans saying the shining cross at the nun's house in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire (pictured) will be an eyesore and 'a blight on the skyline' Decision pending: The plans showing the cross' dimensions (pictured) are before North Kesteven District Council . Mark Dingley, objecting on behalf of an elderly relative, said: ‘The light will be shining straight into her bedroom.’ Others, though, welcomed Sister . Mary’s plans. One resident said an illuminated cross would complement . and unite Lincoln and Lincolnshire with a unique identity. Sister Mary said yesterday: ‘I have . spoken to an architect who has come up with  some plans. It would be . made of steel and  we want the light to bring hope and confidence to . people. I have spoken to the neighbours at the back and they did not . have a problem.’ Sister Mary also hit the headlines in . 2006 after travelling from Lincolnshire to the Cannes Film Festival to . protest at the premiere of the movie The Da Vinci Code. She claims to belong to Our Lady’s . Community of Peace and Mercy in Lincoln. But the Roman Catholic Church . has said Sister Mary is not ‘canonically recognised’ even if she does do . ‘good works’. She is known to have spent three years with a closed . Carmelite order in Cornwall, but decided to continue wearing a slightly . modified habit despite no longer being a fully-fledged nun. A spokesman for the Diocese of . Nottingham, in which she lives, said she was now a ‘maverick’ and a . ‘one-woman order’. North Kesteven District Council will make a decision . on the application following a consultation period which ends on July . 21. The omens, however, do not look . promising. Sister Mary’s planning application number is 666 – a number . widely associated with the devil. A council spokesman said it was . ‘entirely coincidental’. Da Vinci Code protest: Sister Michael made international headline when she protested against movie The Da Vinci Code by holding a 12 hour vigil with Gerard Fox, 31, infront of Lincoln Cathedral where scenes were shot . Sister Michael (left) protested about The Da Vinci Code which starred actor Tom Hanks (right at the film's world premier at the Cannes Film Festival) because she believed the story by Dan Brown to be heresy saying 'when I face almighty God at my final judgement, as we all will, I can say I did try my best.

Swedish furniture giant Ikea has begun screening shoppers who arrive at stores in camper vans or mobile homes in a bid to prevent gypsies from setting up home in their car parks. Luke Massey, 27, was astonished when a security guard challenged him on a family outing to their Valley Park store, in Croydon, south London. The guard, who was caught on tape, told him: 'If you had said yes [to being a gypsy] I wouldn’t have let you into the premises.' Mr Massey visited the store with his girlfriend and her mother on Monday, June 4. On . entry to the car park the group, who were travelling in a small camper . van, were flagged down by an Ikea parking attendant who asked whether . they were gypsies. Mr Massey, from Streatham, south London, said: 'We were just aghast and my partner said ‘What?

'We are stopping them because they are coming in and taking things of our loyal customers, that is why I’m here in the car park.' Mr Massey said: 'We were honestly gob smacked.

A woman's skin was burning and appeared to be melting off as she ran out from her father's Brooklyn apartment Saturday afternoon after doused her in a household acid. The wheelchair-bound Jerome Lynch, 69, later admitted to police that he was the one to throw a cup full of drain cleaner onto his 50-year-old daughter Darlene. 'You could see the smoke coming off her body,' neighbor Clarissa Shakespeare told The New York Daily News. 'Everyone was just traumatized and scared. Her skin looked like melting wax. And then her whole eye lid was melted. The whole left side from her face all the way down to her feet.' Scene: Neighbors called for help after they saw Darlene run out of her father's ground floor apartment in this building on Schenck Avenue in Brooklyn on Saturday afternoon after being doused in drain cleaner . Single mother Darlene, whose son is serving overseas in the military, was treated by paramedics when they arrived to help the burning woman when witnesses called for help after seeing her run out to Schenck Avenue around 1.40pm Saturday. She is still being treated for her extensive burns, and while she is expected to live, there is a chance that she will lose her left eye because of the damage from the attack. Dangerous: Jerome Lynch threw a cup of undiluted drain cleaner on his daughter, 98 per cent of which was sulfuric acid . 'She was hollering. I heard the screaming and I just saw her there peeling. One side was peeled off and everyone took her clothes off and was pouring water on her,' witness Lisa Jones told The Daily News. A niece spoke to Jerome, who has been in a wheelchair for the past two years after having a stroke, and he acknowledged that he knew he was going to be arrested. He now faces assault charges. Police cuffed him to his chair when they took him away and he proceeded to admit to the attack at the station after writing a confession by note because his speech suffered in the stroke. Family members said that they do not believe Darlene would have abused her father, and say that he has become delusional recently. On the day of the attack, Darlene had come to his apartment because he told her he needed food. During the visit, she was resting on a couch in his ground-floor apartment when he went into the kitchen and returned with a cup full of what she thought was water. Instead, it was El Diable drain cleanser, which is 98 per cent sulfuric acid. While some relatives are shocked, saying such an attack seems out of place with his 'jovial' nature, neighbors recall a more sinister side. Ms Shakespeare said that he would keep to himself and has been known to pour bleach and ammonia down the hallway of his apartment building to keep children from playing there.","Jerome Lynch, 69, admitted that he threw acid on his daughter Darlene, 50 .

Recluse: Dr Henry Singman's medical notes provide a fascinating insight into the later life of heiress Huguette Clark, pictured aged 24 . The head of the hospital where reclusive heiress Huguette Clark spent the last 20 years of her life said that it wasn't his job to ask questions about why the elderly woman continued to stay in the facility for such a long period of time. Now, as Clark's family brings the battle of the former socialite's nearly half-billion fortune to court, Dr. Robert Newman has testified that he repeatedly asked for large gifts from the copper heiress but didn't feel it was his place to inquire about her health or her reasons for staying in the hospital instead of returning to her massive Fifth Avenue apartment. He 'testified that while he found it unusual that Huguette refused to leave Beth Israel since she was first admitted, and knew that she never left her hospital room, he did nothing to find out why,' court documents submitted by the Clark relatives reveal. Instead, he referred to her as 'the biggest bucks-contributing potential we've ever had'. At the time of her death, the 104-year-old Clark was worth an estimated $400million, but her relatives argue now that said fortune was frequently mined for gifts by her care givers and Beth Israel Medical Center, where she first moved into in 1991 and remained until her death in 2011. 'The record reveals a pattern at Beth Israel of soliciting gifts from Huguette almost immediately after she entered the hospital in 1991 while ignoring its undeniable duty to evaluate Huguette’s psychiatric condition, provide her with any psychiatric care and establish a plan for her discharge,' court documents discovered by The New York Post reveal. In a 2005 email, published by the newspaper, Newman, who is a board member and former CEO of the facility, wrote: 'Madame as you know is the biggest bucks contributing potential we've ever had - but/and without knocking her past gifts, the potential has been overwhelming(ly) unrealized :-)' Care: Huguette Clark first entered Beth Israel Medical Center (left) in 1991 and remained there until her death last year. Former hospital CEO Robert Newman (right) wrote in an email that she was 'big bucks' Her relatives are accusing the hospital where the wealthy heiress spent her later life of rinsing her fortune to the tune of more than $13million in fees, donations and even a priceless painting. As the court case continues, more details emerge about her condition and reclusive lifestyle that was all but a mystery ever since she disappeared off the Manhattan social scene largely after her mid-twenties. According to The New York Post, Dr Henry Singman describes his first, 'most strange' encounter with the daughter of industrialist and senator William Clark in his musings. At a friend's urging, Singman visited her 10-room, 5,000-square-foot New York City apartment in 1991 only to find that she was elderly, emaciated and 'looking like an advanced leper patient' due to skin cancer. Her 75 pound frame was clothed in an old, soiled bathrobe and she appeared to be 'nearly at death's door,' according to newly published medical notes that give a fascinating account of the notoriously reclusive woman's final years. Shut in: Clark was found living in just one room of her 5,000-square-foot apartment at 907 Fifth Avenue, pictured . Once beautiful: The last photo of Ms Clark was taken in 1930 and a doctor recently revealed that when he saw her in 1991, skin cancer had devastated Clark's once-attractive face making her look like a leper . Then 85-years-old, Singman said Clark . was like 'an apparition' when he found her living in just one room of . the lavish 907 Fifth Avenue apartment - one of three the millionaire . owned - using a single candle for light. She . held a towel over her mouth to hide her partially missing lower lip and . ulcers had eaten away at the lid of her right eye and cheek. During the visit, he coaxed her out into the light, persuading her to move to the nearby Beth Israel Medical Center. After a few months at the Upper East Side hospital, the heiress was well enough to return home. She had gained weight and surgeries had improved her appearance and helped her cancer. But she never re-emerged from the facility, and, according to The Post, she never said why. Singman . claims Clark hinted at her reason for remaining locked in dismal . hospital rooms with the shades drawn and the door shut when she read him . a poem about a cricket and a butterfly. Inheritance: Clark, pictured with her father and sister, inherited her vast wealth from industrialist and senator William Clark . 'The . upshot of it was she wanted to remain a cricket rather than to be this . beautiful butterfly that was flying around, because it was basically . safer for her and she felt more secure,' Singman wrote in his account.

He taught the . woman solitaire 'and she learned every game in the book, improvising and . inventing new games. She has a 'steel trap' memory,' he wrote, 'but . remains shy and reticent.' Clark paid his malpractice insurance premiums also left the doctor $100,000 in her will, which is now being disputed. But . according to the Post, Beth Israel hospital made the most out of . Clark's impressive wealth, milking her for more than $13million in fees, . donations and even a Manet painting during her 20-year stay.

Sun Myung Moon has died at the age of 92 . The Rev Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who turned his Unification Church into a worldwide religious movement and gained fame and notoriety in equal measure for his mass weddings, has died. The 92-year-old famously befriended North Korean leaders as well as U.S. presidents. He died on Monday at a church-owned hospital near his home in Gapyeong, north-east of Seoul, according to church officials. His death came just two weeks after being hospitalised with pneumonia, Unification Church spokesman Ahn Ho-yeul said. Moon's wife and children were believed to have been at his side. His youngest son, the Rev. Hyung-jin Moon, was named the church's top . religious director in April 2008 and will now lead the movement. Moon, who was born in a town that is now in . North Korea, founded his religious movement in Seoul in 1954 after . surviving the Korean War. He . preached new interpretations of lessons from the Bible and made . headlines in the 1970s and 1980s for holding mass weddings of thousands . of followers. The ceremonies . often included couples from different countries, whom Moon matched up . in a bid to build a multicultural religious world. The church was accused of using . devious recruitment tactics and duping followers out of money, while . parents of followers in the U.S. in particular expressed worries that . their children were brainwashed into joining. The church responded by saying that many other new religious movements faced similar accusations in their early stages. In later years, the church adopted a . lower profile and focused on building a business empire that included . the Washington Times newspaper, the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, . Bridgeport University in Connecticut, as well as a hotel and a fledgling car manufacturer in North Korea. It . acquired a ski resort, a professional soccer team and other businesses . in South Korea, and a seafood distribution firm that supplies sushi to . Japanese restaurants across the U.S. These, and other, lucrative ventures are at the heart of Hyung Jin Moon's takeover of the church's leadership. Click here to see the video .

Mourning: A woman cannot hide her grief as news of Moon's death spread via extra editions of newspapers . Blessing: Moon and his wife bless the brides and the grooms in a mass wedding ceremony at Chamsil Olympic Stadium in Seoul in 2000 . The Unification Church founded in Seoul in 1954, performed its first mass wedding in 1961 with 33 couples and went on to host many more, including this one in 2010 . Increasingly influential over the . last few years, his leading role in the church has nevertheless failed to offset . divisions in the Moon family over what to do with the movement's . substantial business portfolio. His siblings are more interested in pursuing the family's business interests than getting involved with the church. Dr George Chryssides, of Birmingham University, . recently told the BBC: 'If you look at the history of religious . movements, the person who gets the assets is key to how the organisation . develops.' The . Unification Church claims millions of members worldwide, though church . defectors and other critics say the figure is no more than 100,000. In . 2009, Moon married 45,000 people in simultaneous ceremonies worldwide . in his first large-scale mass wedding in years. Some were newlyweds and . others reaffirmed past vows. He married an additional 7,000 . couples in South Korea in February 2010. The ceremonies attracted media . coverage but little of the controversy that dogged the church in earlier . decades. Unification Church: The movements founder Reverend Sun Myung Moon and his wife Hak Ja Han Moon join hands to bless couples during a mass wedding ceremony . Accusations: During his lifetime Moon was accused of everything from involvement with the Korean CIA to brainwashing his young followers . 'We do': Church became famous for Mass weddings, like this one staged in Seoul  in 2000 . Born in 1920 in . what is today North Korea, Moon said he was 16 when Jesus Christ called . upon him to complete his unfinished work. While preaching the gospel in North . Korea in the years after the country was divided into the . communist-backed North and U.S.-allied South, Moon was imprisoned in the . late 1940s for allegedly spying for South Korea - a charge Moon . disputed. He quickly drew young followers with his conservative, family-oriented value system and unusual interpretation of the Bible. He conducted his first mass wedding in Seoul in the early 1960s. The . 'blessing ceremonies' grew in scale over the next two decades, with a . 1982 wedding at Madison Square Garden in New York - the first outside . South Korea - drawing thousands of participants. 'International . and intercultural marriages are the quickest way to bring about an . ideal world of peace,' Moon said in a 2009 autobiography. 'People should marry across national and cultural boundaries with . people from countries they consider to be their enemies so that the . world of peace can come that much more quickly.' Moon . began rebuilding his relationship with North Korea in 1991, when he met . the country's founder Kim Il Sung in the eastern industrial city of . Hamhung. Moon said in his autobiography that he . asked Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions, and that Kim responded that . his atomic program was for peaceful purposes and he had no intention to . use it to 'kill my own people.' Reputations: Reverend Moon with the late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung . 'Emperor of the Universe': Moon as a young man. He came to fame in the UK as a result of a BBC documentary . 'The . two of us were able to communicate well about our shared hobbies of . hunting and fishing. At one point, we each felt we had so much to say to . the other that we just started talking like old friends meeting after a . long separation,' Moon wrote. He . added that he heard Kim tell his son: 'After I die, if there are things . to discuss pertaining to North-South relations, you must always seek . the advice of President Moon.' When Kim Il Sung died in 1994, Moon sent a condolence delegation to North Korea, drawing criticism from conservatives at home. Kim's son and successor, Kim Jong Il, . sent roses, prized wild ginseng, Rolex watches and other gifts to Moon . on his birthday each year. Kim . Jong Il died late last year and was succeeded by his son Kim Jong Un. Moon sent a delegation to pay its respects during the mourning period . for Kim Jong Il. Moon also . developed good relationships with conservative American leaders, . including former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Still, he served 13 months at a U.S. federal prison in 1984-1985 . for tax evasion. The . church says the U.S. government persecuted Moon because of his growing . influence and popularity with young people in the United States, his . home for more than 30 years. As he grew older, Moon quietly handed . over day-to-day control of his multibillion-dollar religious and . business empire, which included dozens of companies ranging from . hospitals and universities to a ballet troupe, to his children. His . youngest son, the Rev. Hyung-jin Moon, was named the church's top . religious director in April 2008. Other sons and daughters were put in . charge of the church's business and charitable activities in South Korea . and abroad. Notorious: The evangelist applauds the entertainment during his 91st birthday (left) and blesses couples during a mass wedding ceremony famously carried out by the Unification Church . Newlyweds celebrate after their mass wedding ceremony organised by the Unification Church . Thousands participating in a ceremony in a Washington stadium are blessed by Moon and his wife during the arranged marriages of 3.6 million couples around the world, linked by satellite . After ending a . first marriage, Moon remarried a South Korean, Hak Ja Han Moon, in . 1960. She often was at Moon's side for the mass weddings. The . youngest son told The Associated Press in a February 2010 interview . that Moon's offspring do not see themselves as his successors. 'Our . role is not inheriting that messianic role,' he said. 'Our role is more . of the apostles, where we share ... where we become the bridge between . understanding what kind of lives (our) two parents have lived.' Moon is survived by his second wife and 10 children. Although best known for conducting mass weddings involving thousands of couples, Moon was at least as good at attracting dollars as converts. His church amassed lucrative business ventures over the years, including the Washington Times newspaper, Manhattan's iconic New Yorker Hotel, and a seafood distribution firm that supplies sushi to Japanese restaurants across the U.S. It gave the University of Bridgeport $110 million over more than a decade to keep the Connecticut school operating, while in South Korea it acquired a ski resort, professional soccer teams, schools, hospitals and other businesses. Moon, who apparently has 10 surviving . sons and daughters, had hoped to help bring about the reunification of . Korea during his lifetime. His church operates the Potonggang Hotel in Pyongyang, jointly operates the North Korean automaker and has a huge 'peace' institute in the North Korean capital. And yet he also developed a good relationship with conservative American leaders such as former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. One of the more bizarre chapters in Moon's relationship with Washington came in 2004, when more than a dozen U.S. lawmakers attended a 'coronation ceremony' for Moon and his wife in which Moon declared himself humanity's savior and said his teachings have helped Hitler and Stalin be 'reborn as new persons.' Some of the congressmen later said they had been misled. Moon also served 13 months at a U.S. federal prison in the mid-1980s after a New York City jury convicted him . of filing false tax returns.","Rev Sun Myung Moon staged global mass wedding ceremonies, matching couples from different countries to 'build multicultural world'

Despite the attack, it has now decided to print further drawings, including one of the Prophet in a wheelchair being pushed by a Jewish Rabbi. The offices satirical magazine Charlie .

It comes three days after unauthorised demonstrations by Muslims threatened to get out of hand on the Champs Elysee. All were campaigning against what they view as unjustified attacks against their religion by artists and film makers around the world. A spokesman for the prefecture of Paris police confirmed he had made contact with Charlie-Hebdo, and provided increased patrols around the offices, while Interior Minister Manuel Valls had also been informed about the situation. ‘Security has been stepped up to try and avoid any attacks,’ said a police spokesman. The magazine's decision comes three days after unauthorised demonstrations by Muslims threatened to get out of hand on the Champs Elysee . The magazine, meanwhile, insists it has . the right to caricature what it likes, with a spokesman saying they . would not be intimidated ‘by the handful of extremists who stir up . trouble around the world.’ Molotov cocktails were used to burn down the Charlie Hebdo offices in November last year. Yet despite the firebomb attack, the magazine went on to print the image of Mohammed in a special four-page supplement. Satire: The editor of Charlie Hebdo was prosecuted after reprinting cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005, but was later acquitted . The weekly, known for its irreverent treatment of the political establishment and religious figures, bore the headline ‘Charia Hebdo’, in a reference to Muslim sharia law, and said that the issue had been guest-edited by Mohammed. The incident pits Europe’s tradition of free speech and secularism against Islam’s injunction barring any depictions seen as mocking the Prophet. The publication of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005 sparked unrest in the Muslim world in which at least 50 people were killed. While French Muslim groups criticised Charlie Hebdo’s work, they also condemned the firebomb attack. The head of the Paris Mosque, Dalil Boubakeur, said at the time: ‘I am extremely attached to freedom of the press, even if the press is not always tender with Muslims, Islam or the Paris Mosque. French Muslims have nothing to do with political Islam.’ Last week an anti-Islam movie produced by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula - also known as Sam Bacile - inflammed tensions throughout the Muslim World, including the Middle East and North Africa.","Charlie Hedbo's Paris HQ was firebombed last year after it published an issue it claimed had been .

Nicolas Sarkozy will make an audacious bid to become President of France for the second time in 2017, it was claimed today. Bruno Le Maire, his former agriculture minister, is said to have heard the former head of state claim 'moral' reasons for a return to high office. This is despite the fact that the 57-year-old conservative, who lost the presidential election in May after five years in power, is facing corruption enquiries in France. Le Canard Enchaine, the Paris investigative weekly, quotes Mr Sarkozy as saying: 'Given the disastrous state in which France risks finding itself in five years' time, I will have no choice in 2017. 'The question is not whether I return, but whether I have a choice morally in regards to France not to return. Morally I can not discard the French.' Such confidence will raise eyebrows among those who believe that Sarkozy's electoral defeat to the Socialist Francois Hollande was indicative of how little he achieved. After originally styling himself a French Margaret Thatcher who would reform his country, he presided over a period of economic decline.

Jaguar today unveiled its sexy new two-seater F-Type roadster – the spiritual successor to the legendary E-Type sports car of the 1960s. The uncompromising convertible designed to take on the might and performance of Germany’s Porsche is to have its official unveiling at next week’s Paris Motor Show, some fifty years after the car which inspired it. Jaguar Land Rover bosses say their British challenger will  go into direct competition with the likes of  Germany’s Porsche 911 – causing some to dub it the ‘Porsche-buster.’ Scroll down for video . The 'Porsche buster': Jaguar's new two- seater F-Type roadster, the spiritual successor to it's iconic E-Type sports car, has been released 50 years after the original went on sale . Shrouded in secrecy: The new F-type as disguised prototype at Goodwood. The official reveal in Paris next week is heralded as a 'truly significant day' by the motoring giant . The scintillating  sports car with contemporary styling and a particularly cute rear will offer drivers a  choice of two 3-litre V6 or an even more powerful 5-litre V8 engine fitted to an eight-speed gearbox offering blistering performance and superb handling.

The F-Type is being seen as the ‘spiritual successor’ to the E-Type of the 1960s, but is pitched as a truly 21st century car in terms of design, technology and performance. It will sit in size below the  larger XK grand-tourer sports car but is expected to give a massive ‘halo’ effect to the whole Jaguar brand. The higher performance F-Type  models  will accelerating from 0-62mph in less than five seconds and have top speeds well  in excess of 155mph and in some cases nudging 190mph. The open-topped roadster  will cost  from  around £55,000 when they goes on sale in Spring. A hard-topped coupe version  is expected to follow in late summer 2014. Jaguar released some early official photographs after some of the images and details leaked out. Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar global brand director, said the F-Type's launch in France will be a ‘truly significant day’ as the firm returns to the sports car market. He said: 'As its sporting forebears . did in their era, the F-Type will break new ground by delivering . stunning sports car performance while vividly demonstrating Jaguar's . cutting-edge engineering technologies and world-class design excellence. Ian . Callum, director of design who created the car and has promised to buy . one for his heirs out of his own money , added: ‘A true sports car needs . to be pure in both its purpose and its form; to have the opportunity to . produce such a car for Jaguar has been a privilege both for myself and . for my team.’ Iconic: The original Jaguar E-Type was manufactured by the car giant between 1961 and 1974 . A 'proper' sports car: The original Jaguar E-Type was 'pure in both its purpose and its form' Jaguar confirms that it is has agreed a collaboration with singer songwriter Lana Del Rey as part of launch plans for the Jaguar F-TYPE . Seductive pop songstress Lana Del Rey has been chosen to  help ‘collaborate’ in the launch of Jaguar’s sexy  showroom-ready F-Type sports car at next month’s Paris Motor show. In a contemporary twist on the traditional girl on the bonnet, the sizzling 26-year-old American singer-songwriter whose concocted stage-name alone (her real name is Lizzy Grant) evokes Hollywood glamour of a bygone era, will play a part in lifting the covers off the two-seater roadster. Her best known hits from the perhaps less aptly titled album ‘Born to Die’ include the melodiously melancholic ‘Video Games’ and ‘Blue Jeans’ . But Lana has shown her automotive credentials with a track called ‘Driving in Cars with Boys’  and has been photographed driving down Hollywood’s Sunset Strip - in a vintage Mercedes-Benz made by Jaguar’s German arch-rivals. Jaguar’s global brand director Adrian Hallmark said: ’Singer songwriter, Lana Del Rey will collaborate with Jaguar on the launch of the all-new F-TYPE, a two-seater sports car that is a vivid representation of the vitality of the Jaguar brand.’ He said: ‘The C-Type, D-Type and E-Type Jaguars were all sports cars that held true to this principle in their era, and the F-Type will hold true to that same principle in its time, a time that is soon to arrive.’ James Blackwell from the Jaguar Enthusiasts' Club described it as ‘gorgeous’ adding: ’Jaguar built its success on proper sports cars and, after the E-Type, all models had rear seats and were designed to be grand tourers. Seductive advertising: Singer Lana Del Rey has been chosen to help 'collaborate in the launch of Jaguar's sexy showroom-ready F-Type sports car . ‘Now they're bringing it back and the F-Type is very exciting. It looks gorgeous and has a lovely presence with its aggressive styling. ‘I'm sure it is going to be an amazing success, everything Jaguar seems to do at the moment turns to gold.’ Disguised version of the F-Type have been on the road and at exhibitions but this is the first time the undisguised car has been seen by the public. A prototype of the car codenamed  the C-X16 coupe concept was shown at the Frankfurt motor show 12 months ago. The new Jaguar F-Type roadster will be built at booming Jaguar Land Rover’s Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham as part of ambition expansion plans for up to 40 new vehicle variants. In July the firm created 1,100 new jobs at the West Midlands where the new F-Type is being built alongside the new Jaguar XF Sportbrake, the mid-range XF saloon, the XK sports tourer  and flagship XJ models. It also has factories at Halewood on Merseryside and at Solihull near Birmingham, as well as a design and engineering centres in Coventry and at Gaydon in Warwickshire. Now owned by Inida’s giant TATA group, JLR  employs  around 24,000 people and in 2011/12  celebrated record profits of £1.5 billion – up £392m on the previous year. Pre-tax profits rose by  a third ( 32per cent)  to £333 million for the first quarter of the current tax year  with more than 85,000 cars sold in the three months to June 30. Jaguar Land Rover has created  more than 5,000 new jobs in the past two years, while also supporting an estimated 190,000 jobs with UK suppliers. Sales of all models have soared by  20 per cent in the 2011-12 financial year boosted by exports to major markets such China and Russia. It is a remarkable turnaround for the once-loss making Midlands-based car maker  bought by India’s giant Tetley Tea-to –Corus Steel  industrial conglomerate TATA from Ford for £1.5billion in June 2008. The oval grille, such a prominent feature of Jaguar sports cars throughout history, has been axed in favour of a more modern four-cornered mouth. The bonnet has a clamshell design, and there’s a prominent power dome as part of its sculpted shape. The headlights are vertical in design and feature a distinctive LED strip that curves from the outside in. Jaguar has previously confirmed the F-type’s engine line-up will consist of its all-new supercharged 3.0-litre V6 and a new version of its familiar supercharged 5.0-litre V8. The former will be available with either 335bhp or 375bhp. Each of the three petrol engine choices will send power to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. Stop-start technology will also be standard. The F-type is based on a shortened version of the XK’s all aluminium monocoque and body, but the car will be tuned for a greater driver focus. Bosses have previously said that even the entry-level F-type will be ‘a more focused driver’s tool than the XKR-S’. VIDEO: Road test!

Caroline Thomson, departing BBC executive who said BBC senior executives have affairs with each other . A departing BBC chief has criticised the culture of its London-based staff claiming senior executives 'marry each other and have affairs with each other'. Caroline Thomson, who leaves her position as chief operating officer today after 37 years, also warned the BBC could too easily become 'arrogant', 'above itself' and 'forget about everyone else.' Speaking at a conference yesterday, she offered advice to George Entwistle, the man who beat her to become the new director-general. At the end of her speech at the Church and Media conference: 'My advice would be to make sure the BBC is confident but not arrogant. 'That is easier said than done. 'It's quite easy for the BBC to get a bit above itself and forget about everyone else.' Her comment about executives having affairs with each other was in response to a question about the BBC shift from London to Salford. When . Miss Thomson was asked if more of the BBC would move, she said: 'That . was certainly the policy last year, so I assume it 's going to happen.' She . said that units like those in Salford with a few thousand people were . 'much more likely' to be outward-looking that those with 10,000 people . in one building, 'when they all  eat and drink with each other and marry each other and have affairs with each other and so on.' About a sixth of the corporation's output is now made in Salford . It was announced last year that a further 1,000 posts were to be moved north, including the entirety of BBC3. Some senior insiders now fear this might not now take place after a reluctance for employees to move from homes in London and a failure to attract high profile guests on certain shows. MediaCityUK in Salford, where Miss Thomson spoke at the Church and Media Conference yesterday . Miss Thomson - who last year earned almost £330,000 - had been expected to leave the corporation after losing out to Mr Entwistle. However she is leaving the corporation sooner than expected, amid reports of an 'awkward' relationship between her and Mr Entwistle. The 58-year-old’s post is being axed and the bureaucratic Operations Division she ran is being dismantled to save money. The BBC is facing budget cuts of 20 per cent, with around 2,000 job losses, as a result of a tough licence fee deal with the Government. Miss Thomson first joined the BBC after starting as a trainee journalist in 1975 . and was a key player in the licence fee settlements in 2007 and 2010. She will leave next week with a £1.71million pension pot and could get up to 12 months of redundancy pay. George Entwistle, who started his position as director-general last week and is set to reshape the BBC radically . Since the BBC began publishing the expenses claims of its top executives, her taxi claims have received attention with her regular use of cabs costing thousands of pounds of licence fee money each year. In a written transcript of her speech she said: 'It is always when the BBC loses sight of what it is here for that it runs into trouble with Licence Fee payers.' The news comes after MailOnline yesterday revealed that a BBC site offering 'in depth analysis' and research is available to everyone in the world except British licence fee payers. The BBC Future site is heralded as the new international technology, science, environment and health site, but isn't available to people in the UK because it is an arm of the BBC that is not funded by the licence fee. This means, that despite Britons forking out almost £150 a year for a TV licence to fund the corporation, they are excluded from the international content. But BBC Worldwide say it is the same 'genre' of content already provided for UK citizens - though the stories are not the same - and it was created for audiences outside the UK. The BBC Future website can only be accessed from outside of the UK . Mr Entwistle, who started his position as director-general last week, is set to reshape the BBC radically and has been working with the accountancy firm Deloitte in recent weeks. The new BBC boss has hired consultants to help him reduce waste and slash the number of managers at the corporation. He is understood to have spent weeks hold up in an office looking at how to cut unnecessary waste and bureaucracy. Earlier in Miss Thomson's speech she also criticised James Murdoch, of News Corporation. She said: 'James Murdoch complained about government media regulation in the UK. He complained that because it was publicly funded the BBC was a threat to independent journalism, arguing that profit was the only reliable guarantor of independence. A lot has happened in those three years - need I say more?' She added: “At this year’s Edinburgh Television Festival, his sister expressed a different view, calling for profit to be pursued ‘with a purpose’. 'But just because the BBC is a public service broadcaster doesn’t automatically give it the moral high ground either. We have to be clear about our values. 'They define us in our audiences mind, not just in the UK but around the world. The particularly important point is ‘trust’. Lose that and you have lost everything.'",Caroline Thomson said the corporation could too easily become 'arrogant' and 'above itself'
"By . Keith Gladdis and Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 06:48 EST, 1 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:12 EST, 1 October 2012 . THE ex-girlfriend of TV  comedian Justin Lee Collins demanded £20,000 from him after their relationship ended, a court heard yesterday. Anna Larke allegedly threatened to ‘hurt’ Collins and demanded money in return for not going to the police with her claims of physical and verbal abuse. The accusations emerged during the trial of Collins for harassment at St Albans Crown Court. Dramatic claims: The comedian, left, and ex-girlfriend Anna Larke, right, arrive at St Albans Crown Court today . Miss Larke, 38, has claimed the TV . star forced her to produce a dossier of her sexual past and throw out . DVDs with actors she might fancy after they moved in together. The former PR worker also claims . Collins slapped her, pulled her hair and spat in her face during the . nine months they were a couple. Sonia Woodley QC, defending Collins, . claimed Miss Larke had bombarded him with 103 texts in a single day . after they split in July last year. At the time Collins – who found fame . on Channel 4’s The Friday Night Project with fellow comedian Alan Carr – . was recording a show for a radio station. Miss Woodley said: ‘You rang him on . one occasion realising he was not going to come back. You said: “Give me . £20,000 or I’m going to hurt you and I’m going to go to the police”. ‘He said, “I’ve offered you all sorts of help but I’m not getting involved in blackmail”. ‘You wanted money. Is that what part of this case is about, Anna?’ 'Mental abuse': Anna Larke claims Collins told her she was 'riddled with cellulite' and told her to 'look at the f***ing ground' when out in public . Miss Larke replied: ‘I never said . that. No, no, no. Oh my God, it’s absolute lies. If I wanted money I . would have gone straight to the press. Why would I have put myself . through all this?’ Miss Larke has admitted that before . giving evidence, she told a police officer she would go to the PR guru . Max Clifford if Collins was found not guilty. She said: ‘I’m not sure . what I was thinking when I said that.’ Miss Larke also admitted that she had told Collins that a previous boyfriend had compared her behaviour to a ‘monster’s’. Later the court heard from Miss . Larke’s father Jeremy, who said his daughter had looked ‘haggard’ during . her relationship with Collins. He said he had noticed ‘reddish’ marks . on her face and ‘bruises on her arms’ but she had been ‘evasive’ about . how they had happened. Miss Larke returned to her parents’ home in Hertfordshire after her split with Collins last summer. Her father said: ‘She was completely torn apart, I would say. Completely irrational and torn apart. ‘She did say there had been some sort of fiery end to it.’ Miss Larke’s mother Penelope told the . court her daughter had been ‘a bit thoughtful’ and ‘a little bit . unhappy’ during her relationship with Collins. She said: ‘He had a bad temper and . everything had to be perfect. He was pressing her to tell him about her . past. I told her it is nobody’s business. He told her, “If you don’t . tell me you can eff off out of my house”.’ She also said her daughter had told her Collins had slapped her in the face on one occasion and grabbed her hair. He also allegedly told Miss Larke to close down her Facebook account, stop using Twitter and abandon her email address. The court was told he even banned her . from looking at other men, saying: ‘When you’re with me you look at the . ****ing ground, you look at a tree... you don’t look at any other . ****ing human being.’ Miss . Larke said he had abused her for being overweight calling her a ‘fat, . ****ing dog’ and said she was ‘riddled with cellulite’. Under cross-examination, Miss Larke . admitted Collins had showered her with gifts including a laptop, digital . camera and diamond ear rings. She . also told how Collins had paid for her to take three months off work as . a Christmas present and had taken her on ‘expensive and luxurious’ holidays. Asked why he . had bought the computer, Miss Larke – who gave evidence from behind a . curtain – said: ‘I imagine it’s because he was very guilty. He also . abused my cat, he’s an animal abuser as well.’ Miss . Larke also claimed Collins bought her clothes, including a $1,000 . leather dress from New York, because he wanted to control what she wore. Miss . Larke said Collins had given her ‘thousands’ of bruises’ and some could . be seen in pictures taken of them on holiday in Miami last year. Despite . numerous visits to her GP, she said she had not shown the doctor her . bruises because she did not want to get Collins into trouble. Supportive family: Miss Larke's parent Penelope and Jeremy are due to give evidence against Collins later today . A tearful Miss Larke said: ‘Justin was the love of my life. I still loved him. I’m not going to grass up my boyfriend.’ The jury of nine women and three men has heard Miss Larke went through menopause at the age of 36 and ‘despised herself’ because she couldn’t give Collins children, they were told. Mrs Larke agreed Collins had been . generous to her daughter – a bankrupt and recovering alcoholic – in . giving her gifts and holidays to America. She also claimed her daughter had not . drunk during the relationship and bought a breathalyser device to prove . she had not been drinking. The court was also shown cards Miss . Larke had written to Collins during their relationship. Part of one . read: ‘My darling I missed you so much, I love you. I can’t be without . you, please think about us both making small changes for an amazing life . together.’ A series of text messages between the . two after their split were also read to the court. In one Collins said: . ‘I’m going to get the help I need my gorgeous girl. I am sorry I hurt . you baby. I love you so much.’ Another said: ‘You walked out on me. You were supposed to worship me.’ Bitter feud: Collins allegedly repeatedly threatened Miss Larke, 38, and forced her to detail her sexual history . Looking cheerful: Collins in January 2011 with Miss Larke, shortly after he left wife Karen . Miss Larke's father Jeremy today said she became ‘nervous’ and appeared to be ‘walking on eggshells’ when she started dating Collins. He told the court she had stopped . wearing make-up and started looking ‘haggard' and he had noticed a red . mark on her face and bruising on the back of her arms. Mr Larke said: 'I tried to ask her if she was okay and she would just fob me off. 'Eventually I noticed marks on her arms and her face. I questioned her about it but she dismissed it again.' He . told jurors he did not know about the extent of some of her problems, . including the fact she was diagnosed as being a chronic alcoholic prior . to dating Collins. 'It’s all a great shock to me. I’m very upset about it, very upset,' he said. Prosecutor Mr Shaw opened the case by saying that the relationship was 'characterised by this defendant exerting control over her, verbally abusing her and physically assaulting her.' He went on: 'He engaged in a campaign of verbal and physical abuse against Ms Larke. He was very controlling of her and took a prurient interest in her past sexual history, which he then used against her, again and again in arguments and assaults against her.' Collins, of Kew, south west London, denies the single charge of harassment by causing Miss Larke fear of violence. The case continues.

American Airlines has blamed improperly installed clamps for rows of seats coming loose mid-flight, forcing two planes to make emergency landings. Seats have come loose on three separate flights in the past week sparking a federal investigation into the airline, America’s third biggest carrier. Seats on 36 of the airline's Boeing 757 planes were inspected and fixed with another 11 are still to be checked, the carrier said. Hear pilot's emergency distress call below . Inspecting: Aviation officials inspect the questionable seats from one of the suspended American planes after seats came loose on three separate flights, causing two to make emergency landings, in the past week . The airline, whose parent AMR Corp filed for bankruptcy protection in November, said that they have been working with federal safety administrations to make sure that all of their planes are up to par. American Airline vice president of safety David L. Campbell said that the clamps may have been installed incorrectly during maintenance work by American crews and outside contractor Timco Aviation Services. The problems began on Saturday when a . Miami-bound flight took off from Boston and a row of seats became . unhinged. They slid around the cabin, forcing the plane to make an . emergency landing at New York City's JFK Airport. A second plane was discovered to have loose seats on Monday after taking off for Miami and was forced to return to JFK. Flight 443 left Kennedy at 7.11 am and . returned to the gate around an hour later. After a delay of two hours, . passengers continued on their journey. Another plane flying from Boston to Miami on Saturday diverted to New York after seats loosened in mid-flight. Remove and repair: Seats on 35 of American Airlines' Boeing 757 aircraft have been inspected and fixed, with another 11 to be checked . Spencer Nam, a stock analyst from Boston who was on the flight, said the flight was delayed after boarding passengers noticed that the seats in one row were leaning against another. He said: ‘When it comes to flying, I don't like unexpected events. ‘I'm 42, I've been flying more than 20 years, and I've never seen where seats weren't screwed down.’ The debacles came as reports of smoke in a plane cabin forced an American Airlines flight from Chicago to London to be diverted to Shannon Airport in Ireland on Tuesday. The airline blamed a faulty fan in an entertainment system for the smoke. The combination of the safety issues has raised questions about the safety of the airline with aviation industry experts claiming that bad publicity could lead passengers to avoid the carrier. Matt Ziemkiewicz, president of the safety-advocacy group National Air Disaster Alliance, said passengers could be hurt or killed in an otherwise survivable crash if seats break loose from their moorings. He said: ‘What if it's a little kid or an old person in the row behind them? ‘That seat becomes a projectile with people on it.’ The planes in the Saturday and Monday incidents were serviced in the last two months, with the seats removed and reinstalled, American Airlines said. Up to par: The airline's parent AMR Corp filed for bankruptcy protection in November and is now working with federal safety administrations to make sure all their planes are up to par . Mr Campbell said new seats on some of the airline’s 757s had different fastening systems that required precise positioning of the seats so they could lock into place. The new system holds seats in place using two bolts at the back that are tightened with wrenches and two in front that are tightened by hand. Previously, the four bolts were all wrench-tightened. He said: ‘It's a very temperamental job.’ The work was done at the airline’s base in Tulsa, Oklahoma and a Timco facility in North Carolina. Airline spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said in both cases the airline’s employees were the last to touch the seats, a comment which drew a fierce response from the Transport Workers Union which represents the airline’s maintenance employees. Union official John Hewitt said: ‘Our workers were the last to touch the seats only in the sense that after the seats came loose we were dispatched (to fix them).’ The union blamed Timco and criticised management at the airline’s parent company AMR Corp for cutting costs by outsourcing maintenance work. Fright: On Saturday, a Miami-bound flight took off from Boston when the row of seats became unhinged and slid around the cabin, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing at New York City's JFK Airport . A Timco spokesman said the company is investigating the incidents. American Airline and government officials say the safety issues were not related to other difficulties with union workers who are unhappy about pending layoffs and cuts to pay and benefits as it tries to turn around under bankruptcy protection. The delays and cancellations have . annoyed passengers, but even the hint of mechanical issues could . frighten them away and even threaten American's existence, experts said. Robert Mann, an aviation consultant who once worked at American, said delays, cancellations and bad publicity about broken seats could create an opening for rivals United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to poach American customers in competitive markets like Chicago and New York. He said: ‘I'm struck by how close this company is to losing its way.’ George Hobica, founder of travel website airfarewatchdog.com said: 'These things can kill an airline. 'With a delay or cancellation, you're sitting on the ground. (With loose seats) if the plane hits turbulence, people go flying.'","On three separate flights rows of seats came loose .

The editor of the BBC’s flagship news programme Newsnight has also been criticised for pulling an investigation into the abuse claims. In a letter to Leveson, Mrs Main said the allegations of a BBC culture of silence were ‘very serious’ and ‘at, the very least, of the same gravity levelled at some newspaper groups about which your inquiry has heard extensive and lengthy evidence’.

An Iowa couple are celebrating becoming millionaires after winning the $202.1 million jackpot on the Powerball. Mary Lohse, 42, from Bondurant, thought she had only won $100 before realising the full extent of her massive windfall. She called her husband Brian, 43, straight away with the incredible news. But Mr Lohse, who was out of town on business and thinking the whole thing was some sort of joke, refused to believe her, saying 'If you’re telling the truth, go see our attorney'. Scroll down for video . Winners: Mary Lohse (second left) and Brian Lohse (second right) were presented with their winning check at a press conference on Thursday . It is unsurprising that this was his advice as Mr Lohse . himself is an attorney. His wife works as a medical technician. But they . may well not be in their jobs for long, as they plan to retire early . and bask instead in their new found wealth. At . a press conference on Thursday, at the Iowa Lottery headquarters, Mrs . Lohse pumped the air with a giant sponge finger as she and her husband . were presented with their giant cheque. Crowds threw hundred-dollar-bill confetti on the couple as the strode down a red carpet, hand in hand, to meet Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich. They looked entirely overwhelmed as screams and whoops filled the room, looking around with giant beaming smiles on their faces. Mrs Lohse told of her shock at the sudden landfall, since at first she thought just three of the numbers matched. 'I saw it the next day on the news,' she said. 'I caught the last three numbers as I was walking out the do and I thought I'd better have a close look when I get to work. 'did and I had the last three numbers and I was like well crap I think I won at least $100.' Mary and Brian Lohse are showered with $100 bill confetti as they arrive at the press conference . Never having won before and not . really knowing how these things work, Mrs Lohse telephoned the Powerball . helpline and was gobsmacked to learn that all of her number matched. It was a fluke that she even bought the ticket, having heard on the news the day before filling up her car at the gas station that the jackpot was to be more than $200 million. 'I was like ""I gotta remember to buy one,"" and I did,' she said proudly. The couple chose a one-time payment, instead of a 30-year annuity, which reduced the gross prize to $129.8 million. After taxes, the Lohses walked away with $90.9 million lump sum. Their win is the second largest in Iowa Lottery history. But despite their new found wealth, the couple are adamant that their . three children, aged 15, 11 and eight, will not lose sight of their . values. 'Basically, they’re going to get a lot more dates, which was important to the 15-year-old,' Mr Lohse said. Make the most of it: Mr and Mrs Lohse said they are considering quitting their jobs . Casey's General Store, where Mary Lohse bought the winning ticket . 'But don’t change the way we’ve raised you. You’re still the same person. You still have the same values. 'Obviously, things are going to change.' Their first big spend was at a . wedding they went to out of town in the days after learning of their . good fortune, choosing not to tell anyone about it until they got back . home. $365 million was won on February 18, 2006 by a single ticket in Nebraska, shared between eight co-workers. In a July 29, 1998 draw $295.7 million was won by 13 machinists, state unknown. The West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million on October 19, 2005. A jackpot worth $314.3 million was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio on August 25, 2007. In November 2011, three male Greenwich, Connecticut financial executives won $254.2 million. 'Their wedding gift got a lot better,' Mrs Lohse joked. Next on the list is paying off their student loans, which Mr Lohse said 'we’ve struggled with our whole lives'. They want to buy new cars and build a new house. And Mr Lohse has already splashed out on a new pair of designer shoes. But they are also keen to give back to their local community. Both Mr and Mrs Lohse said they are considering quitting their jobs, he as an attorney, she a medical technician. Mr Lohse also serves on the City Council, described by mayor Keith Ryan as 'our voice of reason.' 'We're both on leave of absence,' Mr Lohse said. 'I've told my boss he might want to start looking for my replacement.' Mary Lohse bought the winning ticket at Casey's General Store in Bondurant, Iowa in the days leading up to the Powerball draw on Wednesday September 26. No more need for that! A sign seeking the lucky winners lies discarded outside the garage . The Lohses didn't go public at first, keeping quite about their epic win, prompting speculation about who it might be . The couple don't play regularly, she said, and only buy tickets on occasion when they stop off for gas. 'You'll be filling up less often if you buy a bigger car,' quipped Mr Rich good-naturedly as he presented the Lohses with their cheque. Needless to say they won't be needing much more cash in a hurry. 'We’ve certainly been blessed beyond what we ever thought we would be,' Mr Lohse said. Spreading their good fortune, the couple plan to establish a charitable foundation and hope to make donations to benefit their church, their childrens' school district, Bondurant-Farrar, and cancer research.","Mary and Brian Lohse won the Powerball jackpot in Iowa's draw on Wednesday September 26 .

Private schools should be doing more to attract ‘skinheads with tattoos’ for their bursary places amid a lack of white working-class ambition, a leading headmaster has claimed. Richard Russell said the white working class does not seem to be as ‘spontaneously interested in success and upward mobility’ as Asian, Afro-Caribbean and Eastern European families are. But the head of Colfe’s School in Lee, South-East London, a  co-educational day school for three to 18-year-olds, argues that more needs to be done to engage with this group. Headmaster Richard Russell says there are young clever white working class children who are missing out on private school bursaries . He spoke out as it emerged that elite private schools are struggling to recruit clever white working-class boys to their means-tested bursary schemes because of a lack of parental aspiration. Some of London’s leading independent schools have already taken out newspaper advertisements, telling parents they could claim bursaries if their children pass the exams. Mr Russell said he saw ‘a lot of aspiration’ from Conisborough College – the state comprehensive that Colfe’s School supports in Catford – ‘but it’s 90 per cent Afro-Caribbean’. He added: ‘It’s these little skinheads with the St George’s Cross tattoos who come from families where maybe nobody has worked – I don’t think we are getting to the white working class as successfully as we should.’ Mr Russell said his local area had a large immigrant population, so applicants were partly reflecting its social make-up – only 39 per cent of school-age children in the London borough of Lewisham are white. He added: ‘I see them around. There are plenty of white kids out there. Some of them must be bright. 'We see lots of white working-class boys and girls around the place, but a genuine concern is they are not aiming high enough.’ Mr Russell was speaking following a social mobility seminar at the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) in Belfast on Tuesday. Dr Joe Spence, headmaster of Dulwich College, South London, which sponsors an academy on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, a predominantly white working-class area, told the seminar: ‘Shouldn’t we be talking about aspiration? In June, Ofsted warned that white working-class boys risked missing out on a decent education or career because of an 'anti-school culture' ‘We have masses of Asian candidates for our scholarships, Afghan refugees, but it is difficult to find white working-class boys.’ His concerns were backed up by David Levin, headmaster of the City of London School, whose eight full means-tested bursaries for Year Sevens received 268 applicants this year. He said: ‘The biggest group of applicants is Sri Lankans, followed by the Indian subcontinent.’ In June, Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, warned that white working-class boys risked missing out on a decent education or career because of an ‘anti-school culture’. Referring to a newspaper article that highlighted the lack of ambition in white, working-class areas, he said that historically there used to be a ‘real respect for education’ in these communities. He said: ‘We need to bring back ambition to communities that lack aspiration. Schools too often have to try to pick up the pieces where society has failed.’ A 2007 report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that white working-class British boys accounted for almost half of those leaving school with low qualifications or no exam successes at all.","London headmaster Richard Russell says clever working class children miss out because they don't aim high enough .

The export of live farm animals from the UK to the Continent has been suspended after two sheep drowned and 42 had to be shot at Ramsgate. The incident happened after 500 sheep bound for France were unloaded from a lorry to an area of the port normally used for washing vehicles. Six fell into an underground water tank. Four were rescued but two drowned. Other sheep then got stones stuck in their hooves and a vet ordered that 42 were lame and should be shot immediately. Stopped: UK trade with livestock, such as sheep, has now been suspended since the incident in Ramsgate last month where 44 animals died . Farmers have been appalled by grisly pictures of the animals posted on the internet and have questioned the qualifications and expertise of those who slaughtered the lame sheep. Ramsgate had been the only port in the country which exported animals abroad for slaughter. Following the suspension – by Thanet District Council – the operation was moved to Ipswich but that was also halted due to a lack of suitable facilities. The decision has delighted animal welfare organisations such as the RSPCA which have campaigned for years to ban the controversial trade. The shipment, on September 12, had originally been stopped after an inspection found one sheep had a broken leg, another was injured and that there were faults on the lorry. Incident: The 500 sheep were unloaded from a lorry to an area of the Ramsgate port (pictured) normally used for washing vehicles . Two French hauliers have been arrested and bailed while inquiries continue. According to Compassion in World Farming, fewer than 100,000 animals are exported from Britain each year, down from 2.5 million 20 years ago. The National Farmers’ Union has demanded a ‘full and frank’ inquiry into the incidents. But Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: ‘There is no place in a civilised society for this vile trade that causes so much suffering.’ Thanet District Council said that live exports had been ‘suspended until further notice’. Last night, Farming Minister David Heath said:  ‘I have ordered an immediate review into the  unacceptable events at Ramsgate.’","A lorry with 500 sheep bound for France unloaded the animals in a vehicle washing area .

Actor Hugh Grant directed a four-letter outburst at a senior female adviser to Harriet Harman while discussing his campaign for good conduct and ethics in the media. Mr Grant called Ayesha Hazarika a ‘f****** a*******’ as they talked through his demands for sweeping new controls on the press following the phone hacking scandal. Ms Hazarika, chief of staff to the Labour deputy leader, hit back, telling Mr Grant he was ‘f****** rude’. Mr Grant later apologised. Hugh Grant, pictured left giving evidence at the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions last year, has apologised for being rude to Ayesha Hazarika, right, an aide to Harriet Harmen . The incident happened in a crowded bar at the Midland Hotel in Manchester at about midnight last Tuesday when, in his role as head of the Hacked Off campaign into press practices, the actor visited the Labour conference to lobby party leader Ed Miliband. A well-placed Labour source said: ‘Grant and Ayesha were having a discussion about the next stage in press regulation. She was trying to explain something to him and he didn’t like it. He suddenly got angry and called her a f****** a*******. Ayesha hit back and told him he had been “pretty f****** rude”. He  made a fulsome apology which she accepted.’ Afterwards, the two carried on talking and posed for a photograph together. Ms Hazarika told a friend: ‘We did have a spat. He thought I was being patronising and was rude to me.  I gave it back to him. He was massively apologetic afterwards and was charming. He has been in touch with me since.’ According to a friend of Mr Grant, the actor felt Ms Hazarika ‘seemed patronising towards him’ by asking if he knew about a recent report into media regulations by former Press Complaints Commission director Lord Black and fellow Tory peer, PCC chairman Lord Hunt. The friend added: ‘As he [Grant] has been at the centre of the debate over press freedom in such a prominent way, he felt she was condescending as he had of course read in great detail the report by Lord Black and Lord Hunt. 'This was why he spoke in rather more robust language than he should have done. It was a momentary flash of irritation which was meant in a conversationally jokey way. He instantly regretted it and apologised. Hugh Grant, pictured with Labour's Harriet Harmen at the Hacked Off Campaign Rally, in London in May, was offended when asked if he was up to date on a media regulations report . ‘He thinks she [Ms Hazarika] is a great woman and they agree a great deal over press regulation and they talked for an hour after the flare-up. They have both put it behind them and are on good terms.’ Mr Miliband, Ms Harman and other Labour figures were staying at the Midland Hotel during the conference. Several hundred delegates, MPs, union officials, Labour aides and journalists were drinking there until the early hours. Earlier in the evening, Mr Grant had attended a dinner in Manchester hosted by the Hacked Off group. The following day, Ms Hazarika was present in her role as a Labour adviser on media ethics when Mr Grant met Mr Miliband and Ms Harman. The exchange of four-letter words took place in the bar at Manchester's Midland Hotel last week, during the Labour party conference . Mr Grant, famed for his roles in Notting Hill and Love Actually, has recently stepped up his involvement in the controversy over press conduct. He has made donations to the Hacked Off campaign and has been its public face. Last month he became a director of the organisation, which recently opened an office in Westminster. The group is recruiting extra staff to raise its profile as Lord Justice Leveson, who is chairing an inquiry into media ethics, prepares to publish his recommendations. Mr Grant forecast last month that Leveson’s report on the future of the press will start a ‘war’ which will divide Britain. He said he expected Leveson to propose an independent press regulator, triggering a ‘battlefield’ in which popular newspapers and their supporters would oppose the move. Mr Grant said the inquiry had been told of ‘a nightmarish pattern of mistreatment of innocent people, the cynical covering up of wrongdoing .  .  . all of it in pursuit not of news that might serve the public interest, but of corporate profit’. Media companies with ‘daunting’ power would fight the reforms, he said. Former TV star and civil servant Ms Hazarika, 36, is a second generation Indian immigrant brought up  in Scotland. Her success in the sharply contrasting worlds of Whitehall and showbusiness helped her win the Young Achiever title at the 2005 Asian Women of Achievement Awards. She was chief press officer to Labour Trade and Industry Secretary  Patricia Hewitt and worked at the Home Office and Downing Street. Previously, she was a stand-up comedienne and was a semi-finalist on Channel 4’s So You Think You’re Funny competition in 2003. She also appeared in the BBC Asian Network radio soap Silver Street, playing the character Manisha. When Mr Miliband became Labour leader, he appointed Ms Hazarika as his head of press. Last year, she became Ms Harman’s chief of staff and is now the deputy leader’s senior adviser on press regulation. Mr Grant is to meet David Cameron at the Tory conference in  Birmingham this week.","Hugh Grant called Ayesha Hazarika, an adviser to Harriet Harmen, a 'f**** a***' in crowded hotel bar during Labour party conference .

Environmental health officers sent to look at a 'filthy' takeaway were swamped by a swarm of flies when they opened its kitchen door. The walls, floors, appliances and surfaces of the curry and pizza shop in Royton, Oldham, were also covered in dirt with some even splattered with blood, inspectors found. Naz’s Ltd, who own Royton Tandoori and Pizza Centre, has admitted nine breaches of food hygiene regulations in court. Poor: The cleanliness of the kitchen, as this photo shows, was awful, with inspectors fearing what could have happened to customers had they not intervened . The company was ordered to pay £5,515 - £500 for each offence plus £1,015 costs - by Oldham magistrates. Ruth Crimmins, prosecuting on behalf of Oldham council, described the shocking scene that greeted the inspectors when they arrived on August 2. 'In the kitchen, there were flies swarming around the premises. They were dropping on to work surfaces. A fly dropped on the head of [one] inspector as she was walking underneath. There was also no fly screen to the rear door and the door frame was filthy,' she said . Mrs Crimmins added that walls, floors, freezers - one with a blood-splattered lid - sink, chopping boards, cloths and staff uniforms were dirty. 'An extractor had not been repaired for a year and a can opener was encrusted with debris. 'The customer waiting area was very hot and smoky.' Disgusting: The owners admitted nine breaches of food hygiene regulations in court and were fined £5,000 . Manager and chef Mohammed Ullah was in court to hear the catalogue of failings read out. Mrs Crimmins added: 'No anti-bacterial cleaners were available and when asked, Mr Ullah said they must have run out. A member of staff then produced a can of furniture polish. 'Packets of frozen fish were defrosting next to a bucket of lettuce and raw meat left next to pizza bases. 'Mr Ullah was not aware of the possibility of cross- contamination. 'He had attended a safer food workshop in September 2007 and had been trained in food hygiene but clearly that training was not being put into practice. 'If these premises had not been inspected by the food hygiene people, I dread to think what could have been the outcome.' Dirty: A swarm of flies greeted environmental health officers when they arrived to inspect the dirty kitchen of Royton Tandoori . Inspectors served a hygiene improvement notice and returned a week later to find the premises had been cleaned. Atiyah Malik, defending, said the company accepted things had not been up to the standard required by law. But he said it had been a temporary deviation - adding that the takeaway had enjoyed a three-star hygiene rating since February. She said: 'Mr Ullah and his daughter had been subject to harassment which resulted in criminal proceedings against an individual. 'Mr Ullah spent less and less time at the premises and the running of it was left to his second-in-command.' She said a health and safety consultant had been hired, a steam cleaner bought and a cleaning rota put in place. Jacqui Knowles, chairwoman of the bench, told Ullah: 'We are pleased that, since the inspection, standards have improved. 'We hope you will maintain and improve these standards.'","Royton Tandoori and Pizza Centre in Oldham was caked in dirt, shocked inspectors found .

Paul Ryan hopes to deliver a knockout blow to President Barack Obama's hopes of re-election if he prevails in tonight's debate in Kentucky. While the Romney campaign has been publicly playing down the chances of Representative Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, scoring a major victory in the vice-presidential debate, privately hopes are high that he could do very well. And if the pictures in the next edition of TIME magazine of the vice-presidential candidate working out in December 2011 are anything to go by, he's pumped up for the 'Thrill in the Ville', in Danville. Tough guy: Paul Ryan, pictured here demonstrating his workout technique last year, is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to Obama's re-election hopes tonight. PHOTO CREDIT: Gregg Segal for TIME . High stakes: College students act as stand-ins for Vice President Joe Biden . and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan as Biden and Ryan . prepare for their first debate. PHOTO CREDIT: Gregg Segal for TIME . Biden, who was a Senator for 36 years, is legendarily verbose and prone to verbal slips which have been a boon to the Romney campaign - most particularly when he said Republicans wanted to 'put y'all back in chains' and when he said the middle class had been 'buried' under Obama. Ryan, just 42, is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new Republican generation, a policy expert steeped in the minutiae of the economy and who entered Congress in 1999 when he was just 28 - two years younger then Biden was when he became a Senator in 1972. Feeling good: Republicans are more confident than Democrats going into the vice presidential debate . A new Pew Research Centre poll has found that voters view Biden less favourably than Ryan and much worse than they did when he debated the 2008 Republican vice- presidential candidate Sarah Palin. By a 40 per cent to a 34 per cent margin, voters expect Ryan to beat Biden at their Thursday debate in Danville, Kentucky. Among independents, 42 to 25 per cent believe Ryan will win. This could create an expectations problem . for Ryan - much as was the case for Obama, who was heavily favoured by . voters before he was trounced by Romney in the first presidential debate . in Denver. At the weekend, Ryan said of Biden: . 'He's fast on the cuff, he's a witty guy. He knows who he is and he's . been doing this for 40 years. So you're not going to rattle Joe Biden.' Betting big: Expectations are high among voters that Ryan, 42, will win the debate against Biden, 69, even though Ryan has far less debate experience than the vice president . Hedging expectations: Trying to tamp down expectations that he will beat Biden in the debate, Ryan said of his opponent, 'He's been doing this for 40 years. So you're not going to rattle Joe Biden' Romney tried to damp down Ryan's . experience, telling CNN: 'I don’t know how Paul will take on the debate. Obviously the Vice President has done 15-20 debates in his lifetime—he . is an experienced debater—I think this is Paul’s first debate. I may be . wrong, he may have done something in high school, we don’t know. 'But, . it will be a new experience for Paul, but I am sure he will do fine. Frankly, he has policy, facts, and results on his side. So I think you . find in the analysis people make the assessment on these debates not so . much on the theatrics or smoothness of the presenter, but the policies . and pathways being described.' Popularity contest: A new Pew Research poll has found . that voters view Biden less favourably than Ryan . Hoping for the best: Romney is also trying to tamp down expectations of Paul's debate performance, saying, 'I think this is Paul’s first debate. I may be . wrong, he may have done something in high school, we don’t know' Charmer: Ryan is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new Republican generation . In fact, according to ABC News, Ryan has taken part in at least eight debates during his 14 years in Congress - though none of them anything like as high-profile as Thursday's clash, which could be seen by as many as the 67 million who watched Romney and Obama in Denver.

He said: 'Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy: I knew Jack Kennedy; Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. … Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.' Quayle responded lamely that this was 'really uncalled for' and his political career arguably never recovered . But in the November election, the Bush-Quayle Republican ticket was victorious over Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and Bentsen, the Democratic ticket.","Expectations are high that Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan will win the debate against Vice President Joe Biden .

Eyewitness Rita Olsen, a Danish tourist who has only been in England for two days on a holiday, said: 'Someone screamed and I couldn't see what was happening, but thought that maybe there had been a car crash or something but when all the police showed up I realised someone had died. 'I left soon after because there was too much business, but I heard someone say that a man had fallen from the building. 'It is really sad and I'm still in shock.

A mother-of-two was jailed for life today for killing a woman with a kitchen knife hidden inside her bra.

A woman and her boyfriend were shot to death in cold blood by a lone gunman in the parking lot of a Bronx motel early Saturday, according to police. Witnesses said the female victim, identified as 38-year-old Tracy Bennett, of Elmont, was heard wailing, 'Don't do it! Don't do it!' before the shooter pulled the trigger, killing her outside the Holiday Motel at 2291 New England Thruway. The incident took place after the gunman approached her 50-year-old boyfriend, reggaeton singer Wayne Hamilton, outside the motel office at around 3.15am, police said. Slain: Reggaeton singer Wayne Hamilton, 50, was gunned down along with his girlfriend outside a Bronx Motel Saturday . Singing career: Hamilton, left, who went by the stage name Captain Barkey, was a Jamaica native who lived in Wisconsin . The perpetrator shot Hamilton, who goes by the stage name Captain Barkey, several times in the back of the head as the victim tried to run way. The killer then turned his attention to his 38-year-old girlfriend standing near a parked Toyota Camry with the motor running and shot her in the head as well. Witnesses who were celebrating a birthday in a room upstairs said they overheard four to five gunshots break out, 1010 WINS reported, before running to see what was happening. 'I looked out my window and saw a lady standing there,' party guest Ricky Gugliotta told the New York Daily News. 'She was begging him not to shoot her, but then he shot her twice and she went down.' Both Bennett and Hamilton were pronounced dead at the scene by EMS. The suspect, described as a bald man, fled the scene in a blue or green sedan, sources told the Daily News. Motel patron Augustine Mawugbe, 45, told DNAInfo he was asleep in his room when he heard gunshots. Crime scene: The cold-blooded murders took place in the parking lot of Holiday Motel in The Bronx . Mawugbe said he looked outside and saw a tall man in a brown polo shirt firing a pistol. ‘He jumped into the car and drove away. He drove fast,’ he added. He said the man fired about ten times, and got into a light green Toyota Camry or Ford Taurus. According to the New York Post, the shooter may have been the woman's ex-boyfriend. Hamilton's friends who stopped by the crime scene Saturday afternoon said he was originally from Jamaica but was now living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ‘I saw him last night at Memories playing dominoes,’ said Oneil Taylor, referring to a Bronx nightclub. Another friend, an shuttle driver, said he had picked up Hamilton Friday from the airport and brought him to the Fenton Avenue club.

A dangerous patient at maximum security Broadmoor Hospital was able to attack a nurse and leave her needing £8,000 of dental work. Paranoid schizophrenic James Smith managed to knock over the nurse shattering her teeth despite being in the highest security unit and being subject to 'an incredibly high level of medication'. Smith was flanked by two male members of staff, both holding his arms, as he appeared at Reading Crown Court, Berkshire, via a video link from the mental hospital charged with assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and three counts of assault by beating. Dangerous: Paranoid schizophrenic James Smith punched a nurse just weeks after attacking other staff members despite being in Broadmoor Hospital's highest security unit . The court heard that the convicted burglar, who was transferred to Broadmoor in Berkshire after starting a fire at a hospital in London - had already launched three attacks on members of staff just weeks before he punched nurse Melisa McKintosh in the head knocking her out cold. Miss McKintosh fell face first on to the ground and was left with serious damage to her teeth that needed £8,000 worth of work. A judge ruled that Smith was not fit to stand trial so a jury decided on the evidence that he had carried out the attacks but did not rule whether he was criminally responsible for the offences. Rubin Italia, defending, urged the judge not to move Smith. He said: 'He is in a high-dependency unit, his progress has been minimal, if any, there are very high-levels of security surrounding Mr Smith at all times. He has electro-convulsive therapy regularly.' Smith was told he would continue to be detained under the Mental Health Act at the hospital. In court: Smith appeared via video link at Reading Crown Court, pictured, where he was told he would continue to be detained under the Mental Health Act . Judge John told Smith: 'The victims of each of these cases were staff at Broadmoor, where you have been detained since October 7, 2010. 'All the attacks were caught on CCTV, which we all saw in court. Even you were visibly upset by some of the footage. 'All four of these attacks were wholly unpredictable in their nature and took place despite you being very closely watched by staff and on some occasions when you were in seclusion. 'All these attacks were extremely sudden in their nature and the attack on Staff Nurse McKintosh was particularly violent and caused her great pain and injury.' The judge added: 'My conclusion is that you are volatile, unpredictable and violent, despite what is described as the 'incredibly high level of medication on which you are maintained'. 'I'm satisfied it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm should you be set at large, that a restriction Order is set in place.' He imposed a Section 41 Order, which removes the decision to release Smith from the hospital, and places it in the hands of an external Mental Health Review Tribunal.","Paranoid schizophrenic and convicted burglar James Smith was transferred to Broadmoor in Berkshire after starting a fire at a hospital in London .

After more than £7million was spent evicting travellers from Dale Farm in Essex, the site was supposed to be turned back into greenbelt fields. But one year on council bosses have failed to uphold their pledge, leaving the six-acre empty space a dumping ground for fly-tippers. Rotten food, mounds of rubble and stained furniture now cover what used to be Europe's largest illegal travellers' site. Aftermath: One year after the contentious and costly eviction of travellers from the site, the land in Essex has become a dumping ground for fly-tippers . The six-acre site is littered with rubbish and debris as council bosses have failed to uphold their pledge to turn the land into greenbelt fields . A woman is pictured holding a cross as police and bailiffs move in on Dale farm, Essex, in October last year . Burnt out sofas, broken tables, used mattresses and industrial waste of all shapes and sizes lie scattered on the barren wasteland. This week marks the one-year anniversary of the controversial clearance of hundreds of travellers from the site near Crays Hill in Essex, following a bitter decade-long legal row. More than 300 riot police . and hundreds more bailiffs dramatically swept onto the former scrapyard . during an early morning operation that led to bloody and violent . confrontations. The anticipated campaign to fight the . eviction, which some feared could last months, was all over within 36 . hours as the activists who had pledged to support the travellers 'to the . death' gave up their campaign and walked from the site. Basildon Council, which led the £7.1million eviction, pledged to uphold planning law by removing 80 families from illegal plots and returning the land back to greenbelt fields. But photographs captured in recent days have revealed that the clear-up of Dale Farm has failed to happen - with the abandoned site overrun with rubbish from fly-tippers. Burnt out sofas, broken tables, stained mattresses and industrial waste of all shapes and sizes lie scattered on the wasteland . Nearby residents claim there is a shocking lack of progress being made in transforming the site into greenbelt land . Rotten, smelling rubbish is piled up to . head-height and mounds of rubble have been dumped on the land. Sofas lie . in the mud alongside broken, rusting, washing machines. Aerial photos taken from the air this week revealed the shocking lack of progress made since police and bailiffs employed by the council stormed onto Dale Farm, supported by hundreds of riot police from forces across the country in October last year. Officials from the Environment Agency have been carrying out tests on the soil amid concerns that the land is toxic and a report is expected within weeks. But those neighbouring the . six-acre site have expressed concern that many of those who lived on . Dale Farm have simply moved to an adjacent site just yards away on Oak Lane, exceeding its . authorised capacity. This means a second bout of enforcement action to remove those living there illegally remains likely. This site is authorised for some travellers plots but it is currently thought to be over-occupied by more than 100 people. Len Gridley, 53, the most outspoken of the homeowners affected by the continued occupation, said: 'There have not been any positives to come out of this for me - it has just been a joke - the travellers are just yards away and now the site is overun with rats and dumped rubbish.' The property developer, whose garden backs onto the site, is considering legal action against Basildon Council for the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the value of his property. Officials from the Environment Agency have been carrying out tests on the soil amid concerns that the land is toxic and a report is expected within weeks . Caravans are pictured parked along the entrance road to the illegal site in Essex this week . He fumed: 'I have no sympathy for the council - they should have gone in there as soon as it was clear and put it back to greenbelt land as they promised they would - it is as simple as that. 'Instead, they have achieved nothing in the past year. 'I feel that the whole thing has been a huge waste of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money and you have to wonder why it even happened because the travellers are now just a bit further down the road and still living illegally.' Many of the travellers who left Dale Farm are still living illegally on Oak Lane just yards from where the eviction took place. Noreen Sheridan, 47, slammed Basildon Council for spending millions of taxpayers’ money on the eviction then allowing it to become a 'toxic dumping ground'. The single mother had lived at Dale Farm for years before last October’s costly eviction but has since moved just yards away to a one-bedroom trailer on the side of a small lane leading into the illegal site. She said: 'They have spent £7m and what for? We’re still here but now we have no toilets, no showers, no electric. This place looks like something you see in that film, Slumdog Millionaire, not a green belt site. The legal side of the site is now crammed full of travellers from the illegal site, including many caravans parked on the entrance road . No 'ethnic cleansing': Travellers and supporters last year campaigned against the removal of 80 families from the farm . 'We’re scared to sleep at night ‘cause people come in the middle of the night to tip their rubbish where we used to live. 'The site’s become a toxic dumping ground which is dangerous for our little kids. 'They think it’s a playground but there’s asbestos and everything down there so we have to try to keep them out. 'The whole eviction has been an utter shambles. It’s 11 years on and we’re no further on.' Just last week she rushed to hospital after suffering a severe asthma attack which she blamed on stress caused by the threat of a new eviction from the lane. Looking back at the eviction, she added: 'On the day there were woman and children running and screaming everywhere. It was like something out of the Titanic as everyone was panicking. 'I managed to get out before the riot police started attacking our homes. I was one of the lucky ones as a lot of people were injured.' The results of an Environment Agency investigation into potentially dangerous pollutants - including asbestos and engine oil - allegedly dug up by council contractors during the eviction - is expected within the coming weeks. Travellers originally refused to leave the site, which many had lived on for years . Basildon Concil spent £4.8million on the clearance although it had budgeted to spend up to £8m had the eviction dragged out into the winter months. Essex Police splashed out £2.4million on supporting the council. A council leader who oversaw the . clearance of the site has defended the eviction despite the concerns the . site has become an eyesore. Tony Ball, leader of Basildon Council, said: 'Doing nothing was simply not an option.' 'At the moment, we know that the site is not something that people would recognise as a green belt site. 'However it must be remembered that the 6.5 acres that made up the illegal settlement remains in the ownership of the travellers and the state of the site is their responsibility at the current time. The council simply does not have the legal right to enter the land. 'Since the site was cleared in November 2011, the council has been working tirelessly to deal with the continued breaking of planning and civil law on Oak Lane. I am clear that this is the right thing to do, just as clearing Dale Farm was the right thing to do. 'Let me be clear. Every single issue in the Oak Lane area at the moment has its origins in the persistent law-breaking of the traveller community over the last ten years. Violent confrontations eventually led to the travellers being removed from the site after a decade-long battle . 'We are dealing with these issues and we are working through the legal and planning process which does take time and has to be done step by step.' Mary Flynn, a former Dale Farm resident, said: 'The way we're treated, it's like we're not human beings - we're seen as a problem that they need to get rid of. 'There are more travellers than there are sites, so where do they expect us to live? It's so hard to tell my children that we're never going to get to go home.' Referring to travellers living on the Oak Lane roadside, council leader Mr Ball added: 'They are breaking the law and we remain committed to taking the appropriate action, and will follow the correct process to do this. 'This will take time, but we remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding the law.' Protesters are planning to target the Department of Communities and Local Government offices in London on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the eviction. The group said it would 'disrupt operations'. Oscar Farrell, a supporter who resisted the eviction at Dale Farm, said: ;Last year I couldn't believe I was seeing 83 families made homeless by the Government; but it's not just Dale Farm, it's happening all over the UK.'","Council bosses promised the site in Basildon, Essex would be turned back into greenbelt fields to be enjoyed by locals .

He seized the 3ft by 2ft Nazi flag in the Western Desert in North Africa in 1942, allowing his comrades to draw the elite . squadron’s badge and the ‘He Who Dares, Wins’ motto on the material. Now the flag has emerged after 70 years hidden away in the loft of Tpr Mullen's relatives, after he brought it back to Britain with him. Piece of history: Trooper Henry Mullen seized the 3ft by 2ft Nazi flag in a German officers' mess in the Western Desert in North Africa in 1942 . Memento: The flag was signed by him and 20 SAS members who added the names of fallen comrades to it . Although against the law in some European countries, the sale of Nazi memorabilia is legal in the UK. In March, MPs called on the Government to ban the sale of Nazi memorabilia after items belonging to Holocaust victims were sold at a public auction. Nazi memorabilia sales are illegal in France, Germany, Austria and Hungary. The money from this auction will go to pay for a commemorative window at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The stained glass window will be engraved with the names of SAS members who lost their lives in World War II. And it's now up for sale in a bid to raise funds for SAS veterans after kindly relatives allowed it to be sold on. Two years after Tpr Mullen captured the flag he was executed alongside 30 other commandos after they were caught on a post-D-Day raid behind enemy lines in France. The Swastika flag remained in his family but was kept in the attic of their Glasgow home for the next six decades. It is now being tipped to sell at auction for £3,000 after it was given to the SAS Association in 2001. Proud: The men also added to it the elite squadron’s badge and the 'He Who Dares, Wins' motto . Comrades: Men of the Long Range Desert Group (the SAS) returning from a 3-month trip behind enemy lines during war in North Africa - is was in the same area that Trooper Henry Mullen seized the Nazi flag . Keith Hartwell, from Mullocks . auctioneers of Ludlow, Shrops, which is selling it, said: 'This is a . fascinating relic from the war, taken as it was by the very early SAS. 'It is thought it was taken from a German officers’ mess and subsequently signed by 21 men. 'They . also wrote on it the places where they had been and seen action and the . names of two of their fallen comrades; Private Thomas Sillett and a . Private Kendall. 'Henry Mullen brought it back with him. His family found it in their home in Glasgow and donated it to the SAS Association, which is now selling it to raise funds. Remembrance: The men signed their signatures on the back of the flag which can be seen here fading . 'It is a remarkable survivor and lists the names of some of the very first men who formed the SAS.' The . Special Air Service was formed in 1941 by David Sterling and was . originally called 'L' Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade. It was conceived as a commando force to operate behind enemy lines in the North African Campaign. Their orders were to attack enemy airfields and harass the Germans in any way possible. Its . first mission was a disaster but its second in Lybia was hugely . effective and destroyed 60 aircraft without loss.

With his team struggling in the playoffs, the New York Yankees' highest-paid benchwarmer Alex Rodriguez was certainly not feeling the pressure as he flirted with two women in the stands. One of them clearly caught A-Rod's attention at at time when Yankee fans would have preferred he be more focused on baseball. The third baseman, who has been called out numerous times over the years for failing to hit when it matters the most, traded his terrible batting average for another set of digits on Saturday night.

Even mouthy real estate mogul Donald Trump couldn’t resist taking a few jabs, posting Twitter musings that called A-Rod a ‘$30m/yr rip off’ and that 'it was only drugs that made him great.' He was referring to Rodriguez's 2009 admission that he took performance-enhancing drugs while he played with the Texas Rangers.

In the dugout, A-Rod smirked, waved and mouthed 'hi mom' when TV cameras were fixed on him. It’s clear that Rodriguez, 37, is not the dangerous hitter he once was, and with another five years and $114million left on his contract, the Yankees may be suffering from buyer’s remorse.

Greg Coffey, pictured, whose fortune is estimated at more than $700million, has resigned to spend more time with his family . A flamboyant hedge fund trader nicknamed the Wizard of Oz has announced his retirement at the tender age of 41 – with a fortune of £430million to enjoy. London-based Greg Coffey also has a portfolio of luxury properties dotted all over the world. The Australian, who famously walked away from a $250million (£156million) golden handcuffs deal in 2008, said he was ending his 20-year career to spend more time with his wife and three young children. He revealed his decision to retire in a letter to investors of Moore Capital Management which is run by American billionaire industry pioneer Louis Bacon. Mr Coffey, once tipped as a possible successor to Mr Bacon, wrote: ‘After nearly 20 years in the financial markets I’ve decided to leave the industry. ‘The demands of my growing family mean that I am unable to commit to the market with the same intensity going forward. ‘I plan on seeing much more of my wife and children and spending time in my home country, Australia.’ The obsessional trading style of ‘The Wizard’ was the stuff of legend. He would have his trading terminals flown to his hotel wherever he was on holiday, then re-assembled to allow him to trade through the night while his wife and children slept. He apparently demanded a cup of coffee be delivered to his desk at the same time every day, even if he was not in. In 2008, Mr Coffey stunned traders when he turned down a seemingly irresistible $250million deal to stay with his then employer, hedge fund GLG Partners. Passionate: A source said that Mr Coffey often spent day and night working and after 20 years in the business it was time to leave. He has said he now plans to spend more time in his home country of Australia . Picturesque: The top City trader owns a sprawling estate on the island of Jura, Scotland, pictured .

Suicide: Wendy Harries, 39, had been targeted by a mystery person over Facebook and email for two years before she committed suicide . A woman hanged herself six weeks after receiving a voodoo doll from an anonymous stalker, an inquest heard. Wendy Harries, 39, had been targeted by a mystery person over Facebook and email for two years before she committed suicide. She was harassed ‘every couple of days’ with strange messages that started by telling her where she had been and what she was doing. The mother-of-three became so paranoid she put extra bolts on her garden gate and ensured she always locked the doors when at home, the inquest heard. Miss Harries, an infant school teaching assistant, received a voodoo doll through the post on December 12 last year as did her former-boyfriend Steve Cock. She was found hanging at her house in Poole, Dorset, on January 28 this year. Mr Cock told the inquest: 'Early in 2010 she started to get odd emails from unknown sources trying to split us up. 'One of the emails said they’d seen her out in Poole when she was on a hen party and we were seen out together on the harbour front. 'It seemed like we were being watched.' Susan Austin, Miss Harries’ best friend, said the messages were disturbing. She said: 'She was getting them all the time, every couple of days, she locked the doors straight away behind her and put extra locks and bolts on the back gate.' No one has been prosecuted over the messages despite a police investigation. Detective Inspector Rebecca Riggs, from Bournemouth CID, said: 'Sadly, the police have not been able to identify anyone responsible for sending the communications to Miss Harries. 'Therefore this will be filed as undetected.' Tragedy: Upton Infant school where Wendy Harries worked. She received a voodoo doll through the post on December 12 last . year as did her former-boyfriend Steve Cock. She was found hanging at her house in January . The Bournemouth inquest heard that Miss Harries had also been distressed after her son went to live with ex-husband Mark Harries. Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth, Poole and East Dorset, said there was insufficient evidence to tie the harassment to Miss Harries’ death. He said: 'There is not a clear enough or recent enough link to suggest she decided to take her own life because of this. 'I think there were other things going on that persuaded her that her life was not worth living.' He recorded a verdict of suicide.","Wendy Harries, 39, had been targeted by a mystery person over Facebook and email for two years before she committed suicide .

The body of Cassandra Gittens-Bishop lay in a field for hours after she lost control of her car following a boozy internet date . A young mother lay undiscovered in a field for hours after she drunkenly crashed her car and died. Cassandra Gittens-Bishop, known to . her friends as Cassy, had spent the evening with a man she had met on . the internet but when she became drunk, date Tom Westley dropped her . home. After the 22-year-old said goodbye to Mr Westley and he drove away, she began to scream loudly inside her home in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, so much so that worried neighbours called the police. Officers left after she calmed down, only for her next door neighbour Tracy Watmore to notice that Miss Gittens-Bishop was trying to drive off in her car and she heard the woman stall the vehicle several times. Mrs Watmore called police to warn them that she thought Miss Gittens-Bishop was trying to drive drunk, and although officers arrived in the street almost immediately and began their search, it was not until nearly six hours later that her body was discovered by a passing cyclist. She had lost control of her car and span off a road, crashing into a field with the vehicle spinning nearly three times before coming to rest on its side. The cyclist who discovered her dialled 999 and paramedics rushed to the scene but they found that she was already dead. Blood tests revealed that her blood alcohol level had been 225mg in 100ml of blood - around three times the drink-driving limit. She also had traces of cocaine in her blood, although police scientists could not tell if Cassy had taken a small amount of the drug shortly before her death, or a larger amount earlier. Happier times: Miss Gittens-Bishop with friends on a night out. She asphyxiated in her car after crashing in a field . The inquest at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was told that the evening before her death, in the early hours of Friday, November 25 last year, Cassy had been out with Mr Westley, who she had previously met up with around six or seven times. Mr Westley had driven, and so had not been drinking, but said that his date had drunk most of a bottle of wine, two Jaegerbombs, a glass of Champagne and a double vodka and coke. 'She was drunk,' he said. Mr Westley confirmed that Miss Gittens-Bishop had asked him to take her to a friend’s house in Bedford but he had refused and instead took her home before he drove away at around 12.15am. Neighbour Mrs Watmore said that police were called to the house shortly afterwards as they had heard her screaming and throwing items around her home. Location: Her car was picked up on an automatic number plate camera at 1.36am on the A600 road (pictured) towards Bedford . 'It sounded like there was fighting going on, or she was throwing stuff - things were getting thrown around. There was a lot of banging,' she said. Police arrived and Mrs Watmore said that Miss Gittens-Bishop seemed to calm down and could be heard laughing with the officers. The officers then left, when Mrs Watmore saw her neighbour get into her car, and pull out of the driveway, only to stall. 'It was like the handbrake was on, she couldn’t move the car forward,' she said. 'I wasn’t sure if she had been drinking, you don’t drive off with a handbrake on. I wanted reassurance so I rang the police as I was worried whether she should be driving.' Officers returned to the street after Mrs Watmore’s call, but Cassy had already driven away. Her car was picked up on an automatic number plate camera at 1.36am on the A600 road towards Bedford, but there was no further sign of her until shortly before 7am when her body was discovered, still in the car, in a nearby field by the cyclist. Troubled: The inquest heard that Miss Gittens-Bishop had been a regular user of cocaine in the month prior to her death and had a history of mental health problems and erratic behaviour, causing police to frequently be called out to her home . She still had the seatbelt on and was in the driving seat, although the car had flipped onto the passenger's side. A post mortem examination revealed that Cassy had died from asphyxia due to the position she had ended up in inside the car but that she had been unconscious prior to this, with her alcohol level a contributing factor. Road traffic investigators concluded that Cassy, who was travelling at the 60mph speed limit, had lost control on a gentle bend and had come off the road when she tried to compensate and over-steered. The inquest heard that Cassy had been a regular user of cocaine in the month prior to her death, as well as a history of mental health problems and erratic behaviour - causing police to frequently be called out to her home. Hertfordshire deputy coroner Graham Danbury recorded that the death had been an accident, adding that the crash had 'distressing results'.","Cassandra Gittens-Bishop's body was found in a field  by a cyclist .

Pulled: The recall includes products like UltraMist Sport, UltraMist Ultra Defense and UltraMist Kids . The maker of Banana Boat sunscreen is recalling some of its spray-on products after reports that a handful of people have caught fire after applying the lotion. Energizer Holdings is pulling nearly two dozen varieties of UltraMist off store shelves due to the risk that the lotion can ignite when exposed to open flame. The recall includes products like UltraMist Sport, UltraMist Ultra Defense and UltraMist Kids. A company spokesman said there have been five reports of people catching fire after applying the sunscreen in the last year. Four burn cases were reported in the U.S. and one in Canada. More than 20 million units have been sold since UltraMist launched in 2010, the spokesman said. Energizer said in a statement that the problem appears to be with UltraMist's spray valve, which is over applying the product. As a result, the lotion is taking longer to dry, which raises its flammability risk. 'If a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite,' the company said. Consumers who purchased the products are being told not to use them. More information is available from the manufacturer at 1-800-SAFESUN. Energizer said it has notified the Food and Drug Administration about the voluntary recall. Scary: Three separate UltraMist brands have been recalled, including the Kids and Ultra Defense varieties. At least 20 million bottles have been sold since UltraMist's 2010 launch . UltraMist's label warns users: 'Do . not use in the presence of a flame or spark. Keep away from sources of . ignition - no smoking.' But dermatologists say most people don't read such labels. Dr Michele Green, a dermatologist at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, said: 'So many people put this on outside, while they're on their way to activities, so I just don't think people are aware of that.' Dr Green said aerosol sunscreens have become popular in recent years because they're faster and easier to apply, but not necessarily more effective.

Exciting arrival: Igor Vovkovinskiy the tallest person living in America, speaks with a reporter about his new custom made size 24 Reebok shoes .

"By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 12:18 EST, 21 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:46 EST, 21 August 2012 . Rating: . Every Dog has its day. But Sleeping Dogs will have many of them. For this is a game with a bite that’s just as ferocious as its bark. A peek into an organisation bound by honour, blood and respect. An unflinching look into the gritty underworld that rewards loyalty with riches, and punishes betrayal by death. Human shield: You'll often have to use any means necessary to get out alive . Enter Detective Wei Shen from the San Francisco PD – who’s been seconded to the Hong Kong Police Force. Wei’s tasked with the (unenviable) task of going undercover and infiltrating the Sun On Yee Triads and take them down. But as Wei goes deeper into the underworld, the lines defining good and evil blur, testing both his honour to the mission and to the triad. Indeed, there’s a clear nod to Asian cinematic masterpiece Infernal Affairs in the storyline. And that’s no bad thing. Sleeping Dogs portrays a sense of isolation and fear like no other game of recent years. You’ll constantly be worried if your actions will blow your cover, whilst the characters are all so well-developed, you’ll feel emotionally-distraught when you’re forced to betray them. Sleeping Dogs is an open-world game, played in an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective. And although the inevitable comparison with Grand Theft Auto will be made, it has got a very different feel to it than Rockstar's masterpiece. A large reason for that is the brilliant hand-to-hand combat - strongly influenced by Batman: Arkham City's 'Freeflow' system. Chase is on: Expect some fantastic vehicle combat . Press the attack button and Wei dishes out a series of kicks and punches. If an enemy flashes red, a tap of a button sees Wei counter. Unlike Arkham City, though, Wei can use the environment to dish out some lethal takedowns. These include impaling enemies on swordfish heads, throwing them off buildings, amd crushing them with car engines. A clever levelling up system, where you find certain statues to unlock more moves, stops the combat feeling repetitive. Then there's the gunplay, which plays like Gears of War spliced with a bit of Max Payne. Primarily cover-based, you'll get to use a variety of weapons from pistols to machine guns, and can turn on slow motion when performing certain manoeuvres - such as skidding over a table or vaulting over a ledge. This makes for very stylised combat, although it’s not quite as rewarding and precise as you would want. You'll often accidentally leap out of cover, only to be blasted into oblivion and aiming can be quite fiddly at times. AI is sharp, and enemies will flank you, but they’ll often bob up and down and expose the tops of their heads from cover. Driving around the city is huge fun. Cars handle well and really come into their own in car chases and races. There's a clear Need For Speed and Burnout influence on show here. You can ram cars off the road, shoot out their tyres and pull off high-speed car-jacks. However, the arcade feel of the car chases can take away from the serious (and often harrowing) storyline. Burnout: There's more than a bit of Need For Speed about the street racing . It can jar when Wei's confronted with, say, a massacre, only to watch him jump into a car with dodge 'em style-handling and the damage threshold of a small tank. But that's not to say the driving isn't fun. There’s a clever experience point system in place, too. This is broken up into Triad XP, Face XP and Police XP. After each mission, you're awarded points to spend on both police upgrades - such as disarming enemies, and triad upgrades, often involving neat combat manoeuvres. Go through a mission mowing down innocent people and your police points will suffer, so you'll have to play sensibly to maximise the chance of getting all the upgrades. Face XP is a measure of his reputation - the higher the value, the more clothes and flash cars become available. Non-playable characters will react differently to you, too. There's also plenty of side missions. You can take part in car-jacking, street races, karaoke, gambling, street fighting and taking girls out on dates to name just a few. Each one offers up its own unique reward. Then there's the presentation. Voice acting is spot on, featuring brilliant performances from Tom Wilkinson and Lucy Liu. Graphics are sharp but poor draw distance is issue. Lip synching is not great at times, too (especially during the karaoke sections). On the whole, though, the game looks stunning. Lock and load: Wei will get to use a variety of different, high-powered weapons . Gameplay is helped along by a classy soundtrack serving up techno, classics, jazz and disco. It’s a shame developers Square Enix haven’t added a multiplayer component to take advantage of their beautiful recreation of Hong Kong. Especially because the single-player game clocks in at a (quite modest) 14 hours. It may be tempting to see Sleeping Dogs as a stop-gap before GTA V hits the shelves. But do so at your peril. Because this is a masterpiece. A brilliant Far East adventure that deserves to be appreciated in its own right.

Mobile phones have become an integral part of going to a gig, with instagram, Facebook and other services overloaded with gig pictures, while waving phones about has become the modern equivalent of holding a candle aloft. However, US musician Dan Deacon has taken things one step further, and created an app which becomes part of the show. The musician, currently on tour in the US, can remotely control the phone screen, changing its colour and background in time to the music. Scroll down for video . The free Dan Deacon app for iPhones and Android handsets create a light show to accompany the music . The musician asks users to download the free app before going along to a show. 'When I first started performing “Take a Deep Breath” (a piece of chamber music where the audience are the performers and given written out instructions as notation) a few years ago I included several uses of cell phone interaction for the audience,' he said. 'The results really pleased me and also seemed to really engage the audience. 'I thought more and more about how we are living in a time where much of the concert going audience has smart phones, that are basically computers, that can be used as both sound making machines and lighting devices. 'The thought of an audience being the light and the sound source for a show became one of my main goals.' However, the team struggled to make the idea work, as most music venues do not have wifi networks. Instead, they decided to use audio. 'Keith Lea, the main programmer, had the genius idea to use audio to communicate to the phones and create 'calibration tones' that would unlock the apps inner working and make it possible for us to communicate from the stage with all the apps running in the audience. The free app syncs all the smartphones in the room to create a light show, in a similar way to Coldplay’s LED wristbands. The handset can also be programmed to 'play along' to the music. Audio tones 'hidden' in the music control the smartphone screens, display colours and creating patterns.","US musician Dan Deacon uses custom app to display colours and play sounds of concert goers mobile phones .

A baby girl whose father was killed in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan is being denied compensation because her mother cannot prove the child’s paternity. Private Daniel Wade 20, of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, died with five comrades on March 6, three months before his daughter Lexie-Mai was born. But the Ministry of Defence is refusing to award a payout to Lexie-Mai’s mother Emma Hickman, 19, because she cannot prove Pte Wade, her fiancé, was the girl’s father. Paternity row: Private Wade (left) was killed on March 6, three months before Lexie-Mai was born. Emma Hickman, pictured right at Private Wade's funeral, is fighting for her daughter's compensation . Now David Cameron has vowed to intervene in what he termed a ‘dreadful situation’. He pledged to step in after the case was raised by Miss Hickman’s MP David Mowat, a Tory backbencher, in the Commons. Pte Wade, from Warrington, Cheshire, was killed alongside Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19,  Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all also of 3 Yorks, and Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of  1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment. The soldiers, who had been in Afghanistan for only a few weeks, died when their armoured vehicle was blown up by a massive improvised explosive device about 25 miles north of the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah. It was the single biggest loss of life suffered by the Army since the war began in 2001. Emma Hickman (right) the fiancee of Private Daniel Wade, holds their daughter Lexie-Mai .

Miss Hickman, who also lived in Warrington, was six months’ pregnant with Lexie-Mai – the name the couple had chosen together. Since their daughter was born she has become embroiled in a complicated legal wrangle. Defence chiefs have refused to award cash because Miss Hickman cannot prove Pte Wade was the baby’s father. Mr Mowat told the Commons: ‘The Army will not accept paternity without evidence, nor will they release the DNA without a court order. As a consequence, Lexie-Mai received nothing.’ Even if the MoD held a sample of Pte Wade’s DNA, it could not release it unless given permission by his legal representatives. But Mr Mowat said the Army did not consider Miss Hickman as next-of-kin, and there were difficulties persuading Pte Wade’s legal representatives to allow access to the DNA. Mr Cameron said he was ‘shocked’ by the case. He added: ‘This is an absolutely dreadful situation and it cannot be allowed to continue.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘There are complicated legal issues affecting this case. We remain in close contact with Miss Hickman and have advised her on how she can take her case forward.’","Private Daniel Wade died three months before Lexie-Mai was born .

A Toronto writer has lashed out at people in the fashion industry, calling them 'd***s' after a few 'badly behaved' guests at a plus-size runway show barely concealed their snide sniggers at the curvier than normal proportions on the catwalk. Disgusted: Writer Kevin Nualls overheard people laughing and making jokes at the models . At an Allistyle event hosted by Canadian designer Pam Shainhouse last week, Kevin Nualls was disgusted to overhear people laughing and making jokes at the expense of the models. ‘Are we so unwilling to accept plus-size fashion shows because it is a reminder of who we could become?’ He wrote in Monday’s Toronto Standard sparking an explosion of similarly impassioned reactions from readers. Mr Naulls was quick to admit in his story that he used to weigh 300lbs and worried excessively about being perceived as fat. But after jumping on the healthy living bandwagon and shifting 80 lbs, he recalled the moment he realised he might never entirely lose his slightly rotund gut and stopped worrying. The writer was excited to take a friend to one of the shows during World Mastercard Fashion Week and chose the Allistyle because of its special platform. Pam Shainhouse launched the clothing line in tribute to her daughter Alli in 2006 who as a victim of Hogkin’s Lymphoma at the time was battling with fluctuating weight gain. Alli passed away and Mr Naulls saw the runway show as a moving legacy to Alli and a fun introduction to fashion week. His friend, he wrote, was ‘was excited, and yet, not one person outside of me and the Globe’s Tiyana Grulovic was excited for him. “You brought him to this as his first fashion show?” was the general consensus from people we spoke to.’ During the event, Mr Naulls noticed one man hiding behind his line sheet to cover his face as he laughed and others whispering and chuckling together. A model walks the runway wearing Allistyle spring 2013 collection at David Pecaut Square . Mr Naulls, who attended the fashion show, admitted in his story that he used to weigh 300lbs and worried excessively about being perceived as fat . Some of the models admitted to becoming 'tearful and angry' when they learned what had happened . ‘Even four different people were overheard talking about how poorly the women walked because they were bigger women on high heels,’ he recalled. Outraged by the tactless response and shocked that a woman who isn’t rail thin might be considered a laughing stock by the fashion elite, Mr Naulls ranted: The next time I hear or see someone laughing at a plus-size model on a Toronto runway, I’m going to get up and walk that person out of the room. ‘If you can’t behave, you’re going home.’ His article has fuelled its own response by angry readers who share his disappointment in the fashion line. ‘It's not just fashion week in Toronto that brings the ""D***"" out in people,’ wrote one. ‘I am plus sized and not a model - imagine what that brings out in people.’ ‘I wish I had been at this show and could have celebrated the talented designers and beautiful models who were involved!’ Wrote another more optimistic reader. One of the models in the show also weighed in with a personal post. ‘The first time I read this piece, I teared up,’ she wrote. ‘The second time, a rage began trembling in my gut. I was a model in the Allistyle show... I was honoured to be walking in World Mastercard Fashion Week, and to be representing not only a cause I believed in, but a generation of women and girls who have been told that  - as is - their bodies are not good enough. ‘I’m a size 10. And I’m still a damn model. 40” hips and all. And I’d challenge the gentleman hiding his snickers behind the line sheet to call me on it.’","Kevin Naulls noticed one man covering his face as he laughed .

Her life was cut tragically short 16 years ago when she was found bound and gagged with duct tape in her parent’s basement, bludgeoned to death. But for six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, there could be new clues into the horrific murder that has fascinated America for more than a decade. The former detective on the case is officially breaking his silence, saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child’s toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high-profile cold case. Scroll down for police video from 1996 . New clues? JonBenet Ramsey, a child beauty queen, was brutally murdered in her home in Boulder, Colorado; a former detective says that overlooked clues may solve the cold case . Basement case: This 1996 police video shows the basement hours after JonBenet's body was discovered; at the top of the frame is the window in question . Curious case: The detective says a faint cobweb along the window hints that there was never an intruder who entered the house . In his self-published book, Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet Ramsey?, former detective Jim Kolar reveals thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports. He told the Daily Beast that he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain, and has a theory that a children’s toy could be responsible for the marks on JonBenet’s back. The child’s father, John Ramsey, told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement. But in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after JonBenet was found dead, Koler points out that there are wispy cobwebs, moving ever so slightly. Koler speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the Ramsey’s residence, and thus JonBenet’s killer would have already been inside the house. Child beauty queen: JonBenet Ramsey was found bludgeoned and strangled in her family's home in Boulder on December 26, 1996 . On Christmas Day of 1996, the family received a ransom note saying they had kidnapped JonBenet and were demanding $118,000 - the amount of a bonus Mr Ramsey had recently received - or else she would be beheaded. But it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house. Her wrists were tied above her head, and she had duct tape over her mouth. An autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death. Within hours, the Ramseys themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticized for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including JonBenet's brother Burke - instead of following up other leads. Cold case: Left, JonBenet's grave is often adorned with small tokens and right, James Kolar's self-published book, Foreign Factions, which tells of overlooked clues in her murder . Target: John Ramsey, pictured left with his late wife Patsy, has remarried and found happiness again since police cleared the former couple of any wrongdoing . For the next 12 years, the blame for their beautiful daughter's death - who was given the name Little Miss Sunshine - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer. Eventually, Boulder district attorney’s office completely cleared the Ramseys of any wrongdoing in their daughter’s slaying, and issued an apology in 2008. Since then, John Ramsey has kept the memory of his daughter alive, despite losing his reputation, a thriving business, and Patsy to ovarian cancer in 2006. Mr Ramsey eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer Jan Rousseaux, who he married at a private ceremony in Charlevoix, Michigan, last July. But he hangs on to hope his daughter's killer will be found and meet justice, and says he still 'would like to know' who is responsible. 'Everybody has a burden, and I wanted to tell people it doesn't last forever,' he said. 'There is light at the end of the tunnel.'","Former detective on cold case says some clues could have been overlooked .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:31 EST, 29 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:34 EST, 29 September 2012 . The golden years were shaping up nicely for accountant William Van Note. The 67-year-old retiree had several boats and a waterfront vacation home at central Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks. He could jet off to a winter getaway on Florida's Gulf coast, and had plenty of money in the bank after a career preparing taxes and renting out downtown office space in Liberty, a country town 15 miles north of Kansas City. Scroll down for video . Killed: The daughter of William B. Van Note, 67, pictured with his then girlfriend Sharon Dickson, 59, faces first degree murder and forgery charges in connection with his death during a home invasion in 2010 . And soon, after 20 years together, he and longtime companion Sharon Dickson were going to wed, hoping that the union would be a new start after previous failed marriages. They never got the chance. In October 2010, an intruder shot the couple in their lake home, killing Dickson and leaving Van Note critically wounded with a gunshot wound to the head. He died four days later, after his daughter told doctors that he would prefer to die rather than be kept alive by medical intervention. What happened next set the stage for a unique legal case: Van Note's daughter, Susan, was accused by prosecutors of pulling the trigger and forging her father's signature on the document doctors relied on to end his medical treatment. The case, which essentially accuses her of 'death by forgery,' has captivated the small Missouri community since her September arrest. Legal experts say it's a case with little, if any, precedent. 'He died as a result of them removing life support, not as a result of the gunshot,' Camden County prosecutor Brian Keedy said. 'If you commit a felony, and somebody dies as a result, there is a criminal responsibility for that death.' Susan Elizabeth Van Note, who goes by Liz, is a 44-year-old attorney who specializes in end-of-life issues, and advertised herself for offering 'compassionate representation of clients.' Deadly intent: Susan Van Note, 44, is accused of forging her father's signature to make herself a durable power of attorney so she could pull the plug on him days after just barely surviving the shooting . She's jailed on a $1 million cash bond, facing charges of felony forgery and first-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty, and if convicted could face a lengthy jail sentence or the death penalty. She has not been charged in the death of her father's girlfriend; prosecutors say they are pursuing the cases separately. Friends of both victims and the suspect describe a troubled father-daughter relationship weakened by the divorce of Susan Van Note's parents three decades ago. The couple had two children, but William Van Note's only son and namesake died as a teenager. They are now buried next to each other. But the relationship appeared to have recovered somewhat, at least enough that Van Note felt comfortable letting his daughter handle some of his affairs. Liz Van Note, who lived with her mother and teenage son in the Kansas City suburb of Lee's Summit after a 2006 divorce, helped her father manage his commercial rental properties on Liberty's historic downtown square, said floral shop owner Brenda Toates, a Van Note tenant. Van Note built his payroll and accounting businesses from modest beginnings, said Joseph Frederick, a retired airline mechanic in Kansas City who first started getting his taxes done by Van Note more than four decades ago, when Van Note's office was in a basement. Van Note's jovial demeanour didn't fit his profession's buttoned-down stereotype, according to Frederick. Estate: One of Van Note's lavish lakeside homes is seen with the accountant leaving behind a $1.6 million estate that would have benefited his long-time girlfriend if she had survived . 'Income tax season isn't always the happiest time of the year,' he said. 'But he'd always make you feel better when you walked out of his office. He was just an all-around, good-natured guy. I've never seen him down. He was always upbeat.' Van Note had sold several of his businesses years ago, but continued to work during tax season when not vacationing at the lake or his home in Port Charlotte, Fla., Toates said. His daughter, meanwhile, was struggling to make ends meet. Records reviewed by The Associated Press show that Liz Van Note filed for bankruptcy in federal court in September 2009. She listed $254, 938 in assets and $374,072.86 in debt owed to 10 creditors, including American Express, Wells Fargo Bank and a children's hospital. She'd previously worked for Merrill Lynch before attending law school, and listed a monthly income around $3,300. When the shooting happened, fearful friends and neighbours initially wondered whether the crime was committed by a pro. The crime scene was clean and there were no signs of forced entry into the home. Some whispered that the assailant might have gotten away by boat. Keedy, who is prosecuting the case, declined to discuss whether Liz Van Note's alleged forgery was premeditated, or a response to her father's unexpected survival from the attack. Prosecutors have also declined to discuss specific evidence about the shooting. But they have said that Liz Van Note enlisted a high school classmate and her spouse, Stacey and Desre Dory of Shawnee, Kan., to act as witnesses to the forged documents. Accused: Van Note is pictured left of Desre Dory and Stacey Dory, who prosecutors say aided in the couple's killing . The Dorys were indicted on felony forgery and second-degree murder charges; they have pleaded not guilty and their attorney, Milt Harper, says they are 'going to be vindicated.' The document she's accused of forging is known as a durable power of attorney. People can use a power of attorney to dictate whom they want making medical decisions for them in emergencies or if they are near death and unable to speak for themselves. Dickson was slated to inherit Van Note's cash and several homes. But her death would have likely meant that Van Note's daughter would get most of the estate's proceeds, which were likely worth millions of dollars more than the partial estimate on file. William Van Note's estate was valued at $1.6 million. The will leaves Van Note's personal property, such as cars, jewelry and furniture, to his daughter, along with life insurance proceeds and the three rental properties in Liberty. Four months after her father's death, the Florida home was sold by Liz Van Note for $238,000, records show. Three days after her arrest, Dickson's adult son filed a court petition to remove Liz Van Note as the principal beneficiary and will executor, citing the criminal cases. Toates, the tenant who knew Van Note, said that his daughter's arrest didn't come as a surprise to many in Liberty. 'It happened on a Saturday, and she unplugged him on Wednesday,' Toates said. 'A lot of people did not understand that.' Legal experts said the prosecution's unusual strategy could make obtaining a murder conviction more difficult. 'If this is all they have to go on, it's pretty thin,' said University of Missouri law professor Rod Uphoff, a former public defender who represented accused murderer Terry Nichol after the April 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building. 'Maybe the prosecution's got more (evidence). But by itself, it seems they've got a lot of work ahead.'

The end of unwanted calls and texts from marketing firms could be in sight after two men responsible for millions of spam texts to mobile phone users were told they face a £250,000 fine. The case, the first of its kind, is part of a wider crackdown by watchdogs on marketing texts and recorded message calls sent at random and without permission. Tens of thousands of people have complained about being subjected to a constant stream of nuisance texts, often from claims firms promising to pursue personal injury claims or payment protection insurance refunds. Seen this before? Many have been annoyed by the amount of nuisance texts promising payment protection insurance refunds . The messages are sent in breach of . legislation that should stop mobile phones and landlines from being . targeted unless permission has been granted by an individual. The Information Commissioner’s Office . has received more than 30,000 complaints about spam texts in the past . six months and is calling on victims to help identify the culprits by . registering the details on its website. Separately, the ICO, the telecoms . watchdog, Ofcom, and consumer groups have launched a new guide to . stopping the nuisance texts and calls. The ICO's director of operations, Simon Entwisle, said: 'The public have told us that they are increasingly concerned about the illegal marketing texts and calls. 'These are often made by rogue companies claiming to offer pay-outs for accidents a person has never had or payment protection insurance (PPI) claims that they are not necessarily entitled to. 'While companies can phone people to sell them the latest product or service, the law states that individuals should not receive unsolicited texts or automated marketing calls unless they have given their permission. Phone owners should not receive unwanted automated calls - but many companies flout the law and ring them anyway - much to the anger of many . 'We know many companies are failing to do this and two individuals responsible for sending millions of illegal marketing messages are now facing six-figure penalties unless they can prove otherwise.' The two people have 28 days to provide a reason why the fine should not be imposed under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. If they fail to offer a satisfactory defence, the fine will go ahead and they will be named and shamed - but until then, they cannot be identified. Warning . that this was just the first of many fines, Mr Entwisle said: 'We are . already working to identify other individuals and companies involved in . these unlawful practices.' Simon Entwisle and the ICO are cracking down on those behind the nuisance texts . Eight companies are currently under investigation and they have been put on notice that they face action, including fines, unless they can prove they are not issuing unwanted marketing texts. Mr Entwisle described the decision to start imposing large fines as an important step. 'This shows those who blatantly break the law will be in line for a sizeable six-figure penalty from the ICO,' he said. 'While honest mistakes can occasionally be made, we will look to take action against individuals and companies that continue to break the law.' The ICO says tens of thousands of unwanted spam messages are sent out every day. A spokesman told the MailOnline that the same message will be sent out to numbers that are generated on a computer and, if people respond, confirms the number is active and is worth contacting again. If someone was to respond with their details - for example, explaining about an accident in response to a PPI text message, the company that sent the spam message has more valuable information about the recipient. The companies can then send details of the active numbers, and any details about the person, to other companies. The spokesman said: 'This is a hugely profitable and lucrative business, and one that we are trying to stamp out.' Complaints about cold-calling telemarketing firms and spam text messages rose more than 40 per cent last year. In July figures revealed there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year. A Panorama investigation in July claimed that the Government-regulated service, the Telephone Preference Service, intended to allow people to block cold callers, was being ignored by some telemarketing firms. An exact total of 7,095 complaints were received under the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR), which govern electronic marketing, last year, up from 4,953 in 2010/11, the ICO's annual report showed. If you receive a text from a company . you know, or from an anonymous five digit short code, you can prevent . any repeat by replying with the word 'STOP'. If the text message is from an . unknown company, or from an organisation you are not familiar with, the . telecoms watchdog OFCOM recommends that you do not reply. Responding will confirm that the number is active and might result in more messages, or even voice calls. Instead, you should report the text . to your network operator, which may be able to prevent further messages . from the originating number. If the texts continue, complain to . the Information Commissioner's Office – . http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints.aspx or 0303 123 1113. To stop unwanted sales calls, . register your phone number – either landline or mobile – with the . Telephone Preference Service on its website  http://www.tpsonline.org.uk . or 0845 070 0707. This service is free and takes some 28 days for the ban to come into effect. Alternatively, some telephone . companies offer services to block unwanted calls. For example, BT offers . 'Privacy at Home', 'Choose to Refuse' and 'Anonymous Call Rejection'.","The Information Commission is trying to bring an end to the modern plague of unwanted messages .

Sgt Miskell told the congregation that PC Bone was 'a perfect police officer'. He said: 'Fiona was wonderful. She . was wonderful at keeping colleagues' spirits high with her bubbly . nature. She was wonderful about caring for others. 'Fiona represented the best that humanity has to offer the world but that makes her loss even greater.' PC Bone joined Greater Manchester . Police as a volunteer special constable in November 2005 and became a . full-time officer in 2007 posted to Tameside division. The Chief Constable of Greater . Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, said: 'It is clear that helping . people and building community spirit was at the heart of what she did. Floral tribute: Flowers from the Greater Manchester Chief Constable, Sir Peter Fahy, who spoke at the funeral of PC Fiona Bone at Manchester Cathedral . Shocked: A fellow police officer wipes her eyes as the coffin of Greater Manchester Police constable Fiona Bone arrives at Manchester Cathedral . A mournful lament: A single bagpipe was played as the funeral cortege entered the cathedral . Guard of honour: The congregation at the hour-long service was told how PC Bone 'represented the best that humanity has to offer' Farewell: The funeral cortege of Greater Manchester Police constable Fiona Bone leaves Manchester Cathedral . 'In the force she quickly gained recognition as an officer who set the highest standards for herself and others. 'Like most police officers Fiona absolutely loved her job and felt privileged to serve the public.' He said she had received a chief . superintendent's commendation in 2009 for her outstanding contribution . in an investigation into a series of burglaries and robberies which . secured convictions. 'Fiona treated everyone with dignity, compassion and respect whatever their background,' he said. She 'undoubtedly had great promise for the future'. He added that PC Bone was 'small in stature but big in personality'. Like PC Hughes, Sir Peter said her 'great sacrifice' would not be forgotten. Victim: Fiona Bone, left, with partner Clare Curran.

When the hour-long service came to a close, police officers again formed a guard of honour as PC Bone's coffin was carried outside, with her hat, black leather gloves and Queen's Diamond Jubilee medal on top. Her partner and her daughter held hands . as the coffin was placed in the hearse while PC Bone's sister and . parents stood close-by, stony-faced, never taking their eyes off the . coffin. Again a piper played a lament - PC Bone, though born in England, had strong connections north of the border and regarded herself as Scottish. As the hearse pulled away, followed by the other cars in the cortege, officers stood to attention and bowed their heads. The silence was pierced by applause from members of the public who had come to pay their respects. PC Bone will have a private burial in Scotland, attended only by close family and friends.

The funeral of an 18-year-old college freshman was held today as her boyfriend appeared in court charged with her murder. Family, friends and fellow students packed the church in New Hartford on Thursday to remember the short life of Alexandra Kogut. Her family urged mourners to 'celebrate her love and her life, rather than remember the few tragic moments that took her from us'. The teenager was discovered beaten to death in her dorm room last Saturday at the State University of New York College at Brockport, near Rochester, New York. Tragic: The funeral of Alexandra Kogut, 18, was held today in her hometown of New Hartford while her boyfriend appeared in court charged with her murder . Tributes: Kelly Kogut and Victor Gerace, the godmother and godfather of Alexandra Kogut, read a statement at her funeral service at St John the Evangelist Church . Purple ribbons drawing attention to . domestic violence draped the trees outside St John the Evangelist Church . on Thursday while hundreds of people attended the funeral. Relatives of Miss Kogut said the community support, which has been evident in vigils, signs and an outpouring of purple, has sustained them. 'Every purple blouse, ribbon, Facebook post, balloon and even the tiniest purple painted fingernail reminds us of our dear Alex,' read a funeral program note signed by the Kogut family. Miss Kogut's boyfriend Clayton Whittemore, also from New Hartford, was due to appear in Sweden Town Court on Thursday. The 21-year-old had pleaded not guilty to an initial charge of second-degree murder. Monroe County prosecutors said a grand jury voted to indict Whittemore but formal charges have not yet been decided. Members of the New Hartford High School swim team, which Kogut captained . before graduating in June, wiped tears away as they entered the church . behind the casket. The Reverend Paul Drobin said that if Kogut were there, she would tell those gathered: 'Care for each other, love one another as I have loved you.' A photograph of the young woman's face was displayed in front of the church as her godparents, Victor Gerace and Kelly Kogut, wept and spoke on behalf of her parents, The Utica Observer-Dispatch reported. 'We are comforted by knowing Alex was at a very good time in her life – so happy and optimistic – because some people never achieve the happiness she had,' Mr Gerace read from their statement. Holding on: Family members of Alexandra Kogut cling to each other for support following the young woman's brutal death last week . In remembrance: Family and friends packed the church for the funeral service of Miss Kogut . 'Our message to you today is please don't let anger cloud your memories of Alex,' Kelly Kogut read. 'It's very important to us that you . do not harbor any hatred. Our hope is that you will celebrate her love . and her life, rather than remember the few tragic moments that took her . from us.' Miss Kogut was one month into her . first year at college, majoring in communications, when authorities say . she was killed during a visit by Whittemore, an accounting student at . Utica College. Whittemore told state troopers he intentionally killed Kogut, according to a criminal complaint. No motive was given. Hours before Miss Kogut was brutally . beaten to death in her dorm room, she . wrote a final, chilling final tweet: 'Should have known.' The . teenager had been carrying on a long distance relationship with . Whittemore, 21, after she went to school 150 miles away from their . hometown of New Hartford. Police say Whittemore admitted to battering his girlfriend, whom he had been dating for about a year, after he was arrested at a rest stop between Brockport and New Hartford. The couple exchanged dozens of messages with each other over Twitter. Most were . playful and affectionate. Loss: Family and friends embrace at a remembrance service for the college student in upstate New York . True colors: A purple ribbon in support of stopping domestic violence is displayed on a tree in front of St. John the Evangelist Church at the funeral service . Bearing the pain: Pallbearers take the casket of Alexandra Kogut out of the church at the conclusion of her funeral service today . 'So excited for @Whittemore21 to come . to Brockport Saturday and bring me half moons,' she tweeted to her . boyfriend in early September. 'Not if I eat them all first yummm,' Whittemore responded. 'You better not eat my half moons or tomato pie!!!!' was her retort. 'Half moon' is another name for black and white cookies. Kogut and Whittemore lived in New . Hartford, in central New York about two and a half hours east of . Brockport, and attended the same high school. Kogut's childhood friend Mary Kate . Heaton said the two had appeared 'perfectly content' in the . relationship, which began last year. 'I know she loved him a lot,' Ms Heaton said earlier this week. Heaton and Kogut, along with their . mothers, had taken a trip to New York City just before heading off to . college, Heaton said. Kogut gave no hint of trouble as the group shopped . and saw 'Phantom of the Opera' on Broadway in New York City, she said. 'She was texting him throughout the whole trip,' Heaton said. Brutal death: Alexandra Kogut was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend Clayton Whittemore in her NY college dorm room . Caught: Clayton Whittemore (left) has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder . Kogut's body was found early Saturday . in her dorm at the State University of New York campus after her mother . called them concerned because she couldn't reach her, Monroe County . sheriff's spokesman John Helfer said. Whittemore, a student at Utica . College near his hometown, was arrested at a Thruway rest stop near . Syracuse, 100 miles east, about an hour later. The cause of death was ruled blunt . force trauma, Helfer said, but he declined to say whether a weapon was . used. Her injuries were extensive and mostly focused on her upper body, . the campus police chief said. Whittemore pleaded not guilty last weekend to a second-degree murder charge and is being held without bail in Monroe . County Jail. Telephone messages left at his family's New Hartford home . and at his public defender's office weren't immediately returned Monday. Happiness: Miss Kogut (bottom left) was found in her dorm room after the brutal attack at the school in upstate New York . On the run: Though he apparently confessed to police when they found him, that happened at a highway rest stop more than 100 miles away from the dorm room where the young woman's body was found . School shock: Whittemore is not enrolled at SUNY Brockport, but his girlfriend was a student at the school . Whittemore lives in his hometown of New Hartford and was a promising hockey star during high school. He was featured as an 'Athlete of the Week' by WKTV Utica in 2010. He is being held under the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff and has yet to be issued bail. 'It's tragic when anyone loses their life,' campus police chief Robert Kehoe told ABC affiliate WHAM.

Nuisance: Unemployed William Irvine, 63, has been given an Asbo for disturbing his neighbours after admitting inviting noisy prostitutes to his home . An unemployed 63-year-old has been given an Asbo for disturbing his neighbours after admitting inviting noisy prostitutes to his home. William Irvine, of Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, was handed a two-year Asbo  after residents complained to the police about the noise levels. Irvine, who is unemployed and said he couldn’t work due to ill-health, admitted having prostitutes at his home at various times of the night but said he never had more than two girls around at any one time. He is now banned from allowing two or more people, other than family members, to be in his property between the hours of midnight and 7am daily. After the hearing he said: 'I was having girls round, they were knocking on my door at various times of night. 'Working girls, ladies of the night. It’s not a crime is it? 'I’ve never had wild parties. There was never more than two girls around.' Irvine claimed that some of his neighbours 'had it in for him' due to a personal 'vendetta'. He said: 'I expected the Asbo  to be harsher than it was actually, so I didn’t dispute it. 'My brief said usually Asbo's are a lot more intricate and involved than mine was, so I got off fairly lightly. 'A lot of it was exaggerated. I never play music very loud anyway. 'I said to them ""no problem"". I’m 63. My days of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll are well over. 'The only thing I was bothered about is that it lasts two years. I feel that is a fairly lengthy period of time. 'I’ve only just come back. I’ve already paid the price of being out of my house for three months.' After . the hearing a neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said several . residents had contacted the police after deciding ‘enough was enough’. In the dock: Irvine admitted at South Ribble Magistrates' Court, pictured, to having prostitutes at his home at various times of the night . She . said: 'As neighbours we weren’t putting up with it. We’re quite a . strong community along here, we all know each other, and we want it to . be a nice place. 'There is no animosity between us, there are just certain things you can’t put up with in your life. 'The problems were mainly noise and people coming round, knocking on his door late at night.' Another woman who lives in the street said Irvine was not to blame. Irvine’s home was previously made subject to a closure notice, during which time he said he moved in with his sister. South Ribble Magistrates’ Court was told there were 'reasonable grounds for believing that a person has engaged in anti-social behaviour on the premises and that the use of the premises is associated with significant and persistent disorder, or persistent serious nuisance to members of the public'. Under the terms of the order, Irvine is banned from acting or inciting others to act in an anti-social manner, or a manner that causes or likely causes harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household. This includes using abusive, threatening and racial language, swearing or making rude hand gestures, and being drunk and disorderly in a public place. He is also restricted from causing any noise nuisance by 'unreasonable use of amplified equipment at a volume that causes disturbance' to members of the public.","William Irvine was handed a two-year Asbo after residents complained to the police about the noise levels .

A cheating Nigerian-born GP who led a double life with two women for seven years and promised to marry both of them one month apart hanged himself when his secret was exposed, an inquest heard. Dr Festus Ojagbemi, 49, known as ‘Wally’, who had a surgery in Strood, Kent, lived with long-term partner Jackie Hammond in the week and lover Bamidele Ayeni on weekends - for seven years. He fathered a child with Miss Ayeni - a popular Nigerian singer known as Dele Achiever - and said he would wed them both, while racking up thousands of pounds worth of debt taking them on holidays. Lover: Dr Festus Ojagbemi, 49, known as 'Wally', who had a surgery in Strood, Kent, lived with long term partner Jackie Hammond in the week and Bamidele Ayeni (pictured) on the weekends - for seven years . But when the secret was discovered by Miss Hammond he stabbed himself twice in the chest at his surgery, St Mary’s Medical Centre, the inquest was told. But he survived that attempt on his life. While recovering in hospital he told police and both women he was attacked by a stranger. But he eventually confessed the truth to officers - only to take his own life four days later on February 12. Performer: Bamidele Ayeni is a popular singer from Nigeria, who was having an affair with Dr Ojagbemi . Miss Hammond later found him at the detached house they shared in Hempstead, Kent. A note signed with his nickname was on the TV cabinet near where he was found in the conservatory. The cost of leading the double life emerged after his death, the inquest in Maidstone, Kent, heard. Miss Hammond said a credit card firm phoned after he died, claiming he owed them £10,000. She said: ‘I started phoning and everyone told me how much he owed them. By the time we got to the 10th or 11th, the bill was huge. We just couldn’t get our heads around it. ‘I work, I get paid, so we don’t talk about finances. If we go on holiday he would be the one that pays.’ The couple had planned their wedding for this May after almost 20 years together. Miss Hammond said he killed himself because he felt guilty after the double life was uncovered, adding: ‘He just wanted me to notice he was hurting because of what he had done to me.’ Miss Ayeni did not appear at the inquest but the hearing was told of evidence she gave to police. She claimed Dr Ojagbemi proposed last October and that they were planning a wedding in April. They had a child, he rented a flat for them, visited on weekends and they would talk six or seven times a day, she said. Miss Ayeni, who sings Juju and pop music, said she knew about the other partner, but he told her he ‘did not love her any more’. She told officers: ‘I would call him “baby” because he was my baby. I would also call him my ""husband"". Failed attempt: When the secret was discovered by Miss Hammond, Dr Ojagbemi stabbed himself twice in the chest at his surgery, St Mary's Medical Centre, in Strood, Kent (pictured) ‘He’s intelligent, loving, caring, he buys me lots of things. Why would he do this to himself? Wally told me not to give anyone the news that we were getting married in April because everyone would go on about it.’ 'He’s intelligent, loving, caring, he buys me lots of things. Why would he do this to himself?' Bamidele Ayeni . The court heard how the doctor, who also had two other children to two other women, had been off sick from work since December 2011, suffering from high blood pressure and vertigo. The inquest was also told he had called Miss Ayeni on the day he died to tell her he loved her - and even discussed a wedding photographer with Miss Hammond on the morning he killed himself. Recording a verdict of suicide, assistant deputy coroner Gail Elliman, said: ‘I am satisfied Dr Ojagbemi took his own life. I won’t go into any speculation about the reasons for doing so.’","Dr Festus Ojagbemi, 49, known as 'Wally', had a surgery in Strood, Kent .

The charge alleges they ‘conspired together and with others to defraud such persons as could be persuaded to make transfers of funds by whatever means to Nouveau World Wines for the purposes of investment in good quality wines on their behalf’. It is alleged they did not invest the cash as stated but instead used it ‘for their own purposes’ despite issuing customer with documentation claiming they had bought wines on their behalf.

Tax avoidance: Anne Robinson, pictured, has avoided paying £4million after joining the Liberty tax strategy, it was claimed . Anne Robinson avoided paying tax on £4million after joining an aggressive scheme to shelter earnings from the Treasury, it was claimed yesterday. The BBC Watchdog presenter was one of the largest participants in the Liberty tax strategy which enabled investors to pay just 7p in the pound to the company rather than 40 per cent income tax. Take That stars Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen were also reported to be among the 2,000 who tried to shelter a total of £1.2billion from the taxman in the scheme between 2004 and 2008. It is the latest revelation about legal but aggressive tax avoidance schemes used by celebrities and the super-rich which the Prime Minister has described as ‘morally repugnant’. HM Revenue and Customs believe that personal tax avoidance costs the economy £4.5billion a year. Liberty exploited a loophole to buy and sell dividends offshore to generate more than £1billion in artificial losses which members could offset against their tax bills. It meant higher-rate taxpayers could earn £1million a year tax free by paying £70,000 in fees to Leeds company Mercury Tax Strategies, which provided the scheme. Miss Robinson, 68, was reported to have avoided tax on about £4million through Liberty after paying £280,000 in fees. Barlow attempted to shelter at least £3million after paying £210,000, Owen attempted to shelter at least £1.4million after paying £101,500, and Donald attempted to shelter £2.1million after paying £147,000. In total, Liberty was used to shelter an average of £300million a year between 2004 and 2008. It was first investigated by the Inland Revenue 2006 and was eventually shut down in April 2008 when legislation was brought in to close the loophole. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is taking it to a tax tribunal in spring, but it is unclear whether any of the beneficiaries will be made to pay any avoided tax. Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based avoidance scheme called K2, which cut the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent. The BBC, pictured in Salford, hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax . Miss Robinson has hosted BBC’s Watchdog for more than a decade, presenting herself as a crusader for ordinary consumers. She reportedly earned £6million for a two-year contract with the BBC for presenting The Weakest Link. Yesterday it emerged that the BBC hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax. The arrangements include 148 news presenters such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman. Mercury Tax Strategies, the provider of the Liberty scheme, declined to comment yesterday. Miss Robinson, Barlow, Donald and Owen all failed to respond to requests to comment. HMRC said it couldn’t comment on individual cases. A spokesman said: ‘It does sometimes take a long time for cases to be investigated. This is why we advise anyone who thinks about using a tax avoidance scheme that they should be prepared to be subject to an in-depth enquiry.’",Presenter was one of largest participants in Liberty tax strategy .

Phil Hogan lost at least €100,000 in the fire sale of a ­controversial Dublin 4 house to the Fine Gael Chief Whip. The Environment Minister sold the house to his Fine Gael colleague Paul Kehoe for €355,000 – almost €100,000 less than the mortgage he took out on it from Michael Fingleton’s Irish Nationwide. The sale of the property was revealed in the Irish Mail on Sunday in May, when we reported that Mr Kehoe had omitted the property from his register of interests but had then altered the register when contacted by the MoS. It has subsequently been claimed in . media reports that the loan Mr Hogan used to buy the property, and . another villa in Portugal, was approved personally by Michael Fingleton, . the disgraced chief executive of Irish Nationwide. The . report claimed that Mr Fingleton had approved mortgages totalling . €900,000 with inadequate supporting documentation and advantageous . terms. One of these loans was used to buy the Dublin 4 house, 17 Haddington Square, which was sold to Mr Kehoe in 2010. The 2004 mortgage, for €453,000, was ‘interest-only for over a decade’, it was claimed. Last . night Mr Hogan did not deny the claims when contacted by the MoS. His . spokesman also refused to comment on the sale of the house to his . colleague, or explain why he chose to complete the sale at a loss of at . least €98,000. He . refused to explain how Mr Hogan had succeeded in having Irish Nationwide . remove its security on his house at the time of the sale, given the . sale price could not cover the amount borrowed. Even . if the Nationwide loan was a 100% mortgage with no deposit, he would . have lost €98,000 on the sale. If it was a 90% loan, he would be down by . €144,000. Mr Hogan’s . relationship with the bank, which was bailed out by the taxpayer at a . cost of over €5bn and is now part of the Irish Bank Resolution . Corporation, will now come under increased scrutiny. There were four separate charges from Irish Nationwide registered against two properties in Mr Hogan’s name since 2004. Three . of the four charges against Mr Hogan’s homes total over €1.3m. The . fourth has no amount registered. In addition to his property in Kilkenny . and Dublin 4, the minister also owns a luxury apartment in Portugal, . apparently bought with some of the money loaned by Nationwide and . secured on his Irish properties. Deals: Michael Fingleton of Irish Nationwide, above, and FG Chief Whip Paul Kehoe, below . FG Chief Whip Paul Kehoe . Both . Mr Hogan and Mr Kehoe refused to reveal the purchase price until now, . but it is contained in the Property Price Register, which was unveiled . this week. Having owned it for four years, Mr Hogan – a former estate agent – put the house up for sale. The 2008 auctioneers’ brochure advertised it as ‘a superb townhouse in this brilliantly located period courtyard development’. But . it failed to sell and the asking price was reduced several times. It . was put on the market in June 2008 for €625,000, but adverts on Daft.ie . show he was soon asking for €575,000. Later . it was on the books of Hamilton Osborne King for €549,000. The . revelation that Mr Kehoe and his wife bought it for almost €200,000 less . than that will raise further questions about the transaction. The . sale came in the same month that Mr Hogan acted as a key ally to help . Enda Kenny survive a leadership heave by Richard Bruton and his . followers. Earlier this year, the MoS revealed that Mr Kehoe failed to declare rental income for the house. However, . the junior minister retrospectively changed his Dáil register of . interests to include the Dublin 4 house after he was challenged about . the omission. In contrast, Mr Hogan had registered the house in his name. In . his 2007 TD’s declaration of interests, Mr Hogan recorded that he was . part-owner of a holiday apartment at Vilamoura, Portugal. A spokesman for Mr Hogan said: ‘We won’t be making any comment on the financial circumstances of the minister.’ Phil . Hogan’s borrowing spree topped €1.2m at one stage. His first loan from . Michael Fingleton’s Irish Nationwide was for €330,000 for his Kilkenny . home, but in 2004 his exposure to the bank spiralled. Property: Hogan¿s D4 house .

The pair were no longer on speaking terms when he called in locksmiths, making it clear that he feared losing ownership of the house. Shortly afterwards, on September 5th, Saad was killed alongside his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, as they sat in their BMW car close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France. The couple died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire which also killed Mr Al-Hilli’s 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila al-Allaf, as well as Sylvain Mollier, a passing cyclist and father-of-three. Now Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud has revealed that a Taser was discovered in the Claygate house. Detectives are trying to work out whether it was kept as a self-defence precaution against the threat of attack. ‘It could be like a woman who carries tear gas in her bag, more as a precaution than because of a specific concern,” said Mr Maillaud. Illegal: The Taser self-defence weapon, such as this model, is prohibited in Britain and anyone found in possession of one can be sent to prison for up to 10 years . Dispute: Mr Al-Hilli and his brother Zaid were no longer on speaking terms following an argument over who owned this £1m property . On Friday a judge in Geneva – less than an hour’s drive from the crime scene – suggested that Saad had visited the city where he had access to a private bank account containing a ‘sizeable amount of cash’. Dario Zanni, who was appointed by French investigators, is working on the theory that the bank account is linked with the murders. While Saad was an engineer on satellite and electronics projects, Zaid works for the Burhill Group, a golf and leisure company, at its head office in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey. The brothers became joint-registered owners of the family home in Claygate after their father, Kadhim, died in Spain last year. A published legal document shows that Saad had attempted to block the terms of his father’s will being carried out. The wealth of the family is said to be worth many millions, with reports of properties in Spain, France and Iraq, as well as in Surrey. Murdered: Saad Al-Hilli was shot dead on September 5th alongside his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, heis 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila al-Allaf, and Sylvain Mollier, a passing cyclist and father-of-three . Zaid al-Hilli has spoken to police on a number of occasions to deny he was in dispute with his brother. Detectives are treating him as a witness and not a suspect in the case. Zaid Alabdi, a dentist who trained alongside Mrs Al-Hilli, has told the BBC’s The Report that he spoke to Saad the day before he headed off on holiday to France last month. ‘Saad said his brother had sacked his solicitor and he had no communication with [his brother] anymore,’ Mr Albdi told the programme, adding: ‘Since I have known Saad the only problem in his life is this recent disagreement with this brother.’ Zaid wanted the money for his share of the house, which was around half-a-million pounds, and friends also confirmed to the BBC that Saad had changed the locks of the Claygate house to stop him getting in. Zaid has not spoken publicly about the murders, but is said to be ‘devastated’ by his brother’s death. The Al-Hilli’s four-year-old daughter, Zeena, survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother’s corpse, while her seven-year-old sister, Zainab, was badly injured, suffering serious head injuries and a bullet wound in a shoulder.","Pair were in dispute over ownership of £1m property in Claygate, Surrey .

A North Korean soldier killed two of his commanding officers and absconded to South Korea earlier today. After shooting his platoon and squad leaders the soldier used a loudspeaker to let South Korean guards know his intention to defect, before crossing the heavily armed border. South Korean officials have confirmed that the rare crossing led to an immediate increase in border patrol security. Absconded: The soldier shot two superiors before announcing to the South Koreans that he was crossing the border (file photo of the North Korean side) The unnamed soldier shot his command before crossing the western side of the Demilitarized Zone at around noon, near the North Korean town of Kaesong. A Defense Ministry official confirmed the man was taken into custody by South Korean border guards. He said South Korean guards heard six gunshots before the North Korean soldier used a loudspeaker to let South Korean guards know his intention to abscond. The official said the motive behind the defection was unclear. No unusual military movement was detected from the North Korean side of the border after the crossing, but South Korea immediately instructed its border troops to step up their guard, a South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official said. He also declined to be named, citing office rules. There was no immediate comment from communist North Korea's state-run media. Under observation: South Korean soldiers look at the North Korean side in the demilitarized zone which has separates the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s . Crossing the border: The soldier defected near the North Korean town of Kaesong . Defections across the land border are rare, though North Koreans occasionally come to the South by boat. Last year, a North Korean civilian defected to the South across the land border. The last defection across the Demilitarized Zone by a North Korean soldier occurred in 2010, officials said. Another soldier and an officer also defected to the South across the border in two separate crossings in 2008. The vast majority of North Koreans fleeing their homeland travel through China and Southeast Asia before arriving in the South. More than 24,000 North Koreans have arrived in the South since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. The area where Saturday's defection took place is along the route to a South Korean-financed industrial complex in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, officials said. Border security has been tighter than usual along the border in the past few years as military and political tensions between the rival Koreas soared. In 2010, a South Korean naval ship sank and 46 of its sailors died in an incident blamed on North Korea, though Pyongyang denies involvement. Later that year, North Korea bombarded a South Korean front-line island, killing two marines and two civilians.","South Korean border patrol heard six shots before the soldier announced he was absconding .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 03:37 EST, 9 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:17 EST, 9 October 2012 . Distressing allegations by Radio 1 DJ Liz Kershaw that her breasts were regularly groped live on air by a colleague were today dismissed by a fellow broadcaster as a 'practical joke', 'mucking around' and schoolboy 'joshing'. Breakfast presenter in the 1980s, Mike Smith, has accused Ms Kershaw of smearing 'an awful lot of innocent, hard-working people' at the BBC, which he called a 'heinous crime'. It came as more than 100 people are now believed to have been sexually assaulted by former Radio 1 and Top of the Pops presenter Jimmy Savile, and yesterday the corporation's Director General George Entwistle apologised to victims and promised a full inquiry into the scandal. Smears: Mike Smith, left, has urged victims like Liz Kershaw to 'name names' and dismissed her claims that she was groped on air as a 'practical joke' 'I don't know which of the schoolboys . stuck his hands where they shouldn't be. And, frankly, I don't know why . Liz can't name him. But if this ""trick"" happened, it was a specific . case,' he wrote on his website. Later on 5Live he said: 'I think she’s guilty of generalising from the particular, which is a heinous crime. Mr Smith said that Savile was a 'strange guy' but added the atmosphere at Radio 1 - where many attacks are alleged to have taken place - was 'more camp than predatory'. Today it was also claimed that Savile molested five girls in the days before he died - while he waited to do a voiceover at a Leeds radio station. One woman in her 20s told the Daily Star: 'Here was someone I looked up to. He was a national treasure and he had just grabbed my breasts.' Discussion: Liz Kershaw will meet the Director General tomorrow to recount her experiences of being regularly groped by a fellow presenter - but Mike Smith says she is smearing innocent staff . Abuse: Rumours about Jimmy Savile's inappropriate behaviour were an 'open secret', according to Liz Kershaw . 'There’s a danger here that an awful lot of innocent, good people are going to be smeared by the comments of Liz Kershaw. 'This witch hunt has got to stop. 'I’ve opened myself up now to the feminists attacking me – is it a crime? 'If Liz was genuinely threatened by this and couldn’t deal with it, yes that was a crime and that should be dealt with.' When asked why it wouldn't be a crime he said: 'When you’ve got consenting people mucking about, you know, that’s when it’s not a crime. 'If that happened it’s absolutely appalling and I’m not supporting it in any way. Those sorts of practical joke. Stars: Mr Smith, with his wife Sarah Greene, said the atmosphere at Radio 1 was 'more camp than predatory' 'I’m not saying this is a good thing, what I’m saying is that there was a lot of joshing around that went on and quite often you would have male DJs trying to put off other male DJs.' Mr Smith, who joined Radio 1 in 1982 married fellow star Sarah Greene in 1989, said anyone who was attacked at the BBC must 'name names', adding that Savile was seen as an 'untouchable' 'god' 'The problem is you haven't got enough pages to debate this; it has been blown out of all proportion,' he went on. David Cameron raised the prospect today of Sir Jimmy Savile being posthumously stripped of his knighthood in the wake of allegations of sexual abuse against young girls. The Prime Minister stopped short of revealing whether he felt the former DJ should lose the honour, but suggested that the case should be considered by a Whitehall committee which has the power to recommend forfeiture. His comments came after the chairman of the BBC Trust gave his backing to inquiries by police and the corporation. Lord Patten said the allegations against Savile could not be excused as behaviour from a time when 'attitudes were different'. The radio and TV presenter and charity fundraiser, who died in 2011, has been accused by a growing number of women in the last few weeks of sexual abuse over a number of years. Mr Cameron told ITV1’s Daybreak programme today: 'These stories are deeply, deeply troubling and I hope that every organisation that has responsibilities will have a proper investigation into what happened, and if these things did happen, and how they were allowed to happen, and then of course everyone has to take their responsibilities.' Asked if Savile should lose his knighthood, Mr Cameron said: 'We have something called a Forfeiture Committee. It is not chaired or sat on by me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours, and obviously they have to do their job too.' 'And of course we're missing, as ever, the real nub of this story, and that is tracking down the poor people affected by Jimmy Savile. 'It has been blown into something else by other people. It's going to get confused and lost in the mists of time if we don't watch it.' Liz Kershaw said this week she was looking forward to telling BBC boss George Entwistle ‘everything that I know’ after revealing how the male colleague had repeatedly ‘fondled her breasts’ on air in the late 1980s. She declined to identify the groper, described as a former household name, but said she would also name other male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and Top of the Pops fans. Miss Kershaw, 54, who now presents a  programme on BBC Six Music, said she was ‘intimidated’ by the atmosphere at Radio 1 when she joined 25 years ago. She said: ‘I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones on, my back to the studio door, live on air. I couldn’t hear a thing except what was playing in my headphones. Then I’d find these wandering hands up my jumper, fondling my breasts. ‘And I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t even exclaim because I was broadcasting to the nation. And when I complained to somebody, they were incredulous, and said “What? Don’t you like it? Are you a lesbian?” ‘The culture at Radio 1 then was something I had never encountered before. I’ve always said it was like walking into a rugby club locker room.’ She said rumours about Jimmy Savile’s behaviour were an ‘open secret’ when she joined Radio 1, mainly about his adventures on the Radio 1 roadshow. She said: ‘It was massive then. It was rather like the X Factor going around the country. Can you imagine the X Factor judges rounding up the contestants and asking for sexual favours after the show? I don’t think so.’ Miss Kershaw joined Radio 1 shortly after Savile’s departure, but said colleagues constantly joked about his behaviour. She said: ‘With all the piety about him when he died last year I was rather sickened, and I thought “why don’t people say what he was really like?” DJ Dave Lee Travis, nicknamed The Hairy Monster, is another star from the 1980s facing accusations. In an article written after interviewing Travis in June, Sunday Times reporter Camilla Long, described how ‘over 90 minutes I don’t think there was a part of my body he did not grope’.","Mike Smith says Liz Kershaw's claims about being sexually assaulted on air is 'smearing' innocent BBC staff .

A 22-stone teenager who shed nine stone in twelve months in a bid to find a girlfriend is now fighting off attention from the ladies - after becoming a Justin Bieber lookalike. William Cookson, 17, from Liverpool, was a virtual recluse and had never been kissed when he tipped the scales at 21st 9lb and struggled to squeeze into his XXXXXL school uniform. Taunted by his classmates and desperate to find love he embarked on a drastic diet and exercise regime. After slimming down to 13 stone he discovered a previously hidden uncanny resemblance to teen pop star and heartthrob Justin Bieber - and is now deluged with attention from adoring girls. From blubber at age 14 (left) to Beiber at 17: William's dramatic weight loss has not only greatly boosted his self esteem, but also increased his luck with the ladies. He admits he now enjoys 'lots of female attention' Mr Cookson confesses ‘I must admit I never saw the resemblance when I was bigger but when I lost the weight, I started getting compared to him on my Facebook profile.’ ‘People would comment on my pictures suggesting I look like him, I just used to laugh it off, but being compared to somebody who is adored by millions of girls isn’t a bad thing. ‘I used to get no female attention whatsoever. I knew a girl would never have looked at me when I was 21 stone and instantly have fallen for my personality, so I knew I had to do something. ‘I don’t think I would have even . kissed a girl if I stayed the way I was, so I’m really glad I decided to . lose weight. I’ve had three serious girlfriends and a few flings . since.’ Mr Cookson, who grew . up in Liverpool, saw his weight balloon during his teenage years by . gorging on fish and chips, Doritos and chocolate. Uncanny: Mr Cookson (right) may not have Justin . Beiber's (left) wealth or chart success, but his weight loss and . resemblance to the star means he is now amassing his own legions of . adoring females fans . He was bursting out of his school . uniform which, with a 48-inch waist, had to be specially ordered, and . watched enviously as his peers began to date girls. Mr Cookson admits is weight was beginning to affect his social life self-esteem. ‘I always felt like an outcast because at an early age I was always bigger than my peers,' he said. ‘My weight seemed to spiral out of control and I was too young to even notice. William, here aged 9, gained weight by over indulging on junk food such as Doritos and chocolate . ‘When I was fat I didn’t really used . to go out, I was too scared of being insulted and what other people . would think so instead I sat at home, watched television and used to eat . instead of socialising. ‘Harsh comments at school about how large I was really affected me, it was then I decided to do something about it. ‘All of the people around me were in relationships and I was always the one who was left out. ‘I . was sick of hearing girls moaning about how badly lads treat them, so I . thought if I lost the weight I could show them that not every guy is . the same.’ Mr Cookson, who . is completing his A-Levels at Liverpool Community College, enlisted the . help of his uncle - a personal trainer - to help him lose the weight. He embarked on a strict gym regime, cut out all snacks and eats three balanced meals a day. Mr Cookson is now regularly stopped by strangers who mistake him for teen pop sensation and heartthrob Justin Bieber. ’I . must admit I never saw the resemblance when I was bigger but since . shedding the pounds I’ve been told lots of times that I’m the spitting . image of Justin. ‘I think it’s the hair, although he has cut his differently now, he always used to have long hair and wear a hat like I do. Breakfast: Usually skipped . Lunch: Sausage and chips or fish and chips from a chip shop . Dinner: Burger, sausage rolls or other frozen fast food, always served with chips . Snacks: Three packets of crisps- usually Doritos, two or three chocolate bars, MacDonalds, and several fizzy drinks . Exercise regime: . None. William found it difficult to walk even short distances and could only manage two minutes on the cross trainer when he started loosing weight. Breakfast: Cereal such as Special K . Lunch: Chicken and salad sandwich on brown bread with low fat butter . Dinner: Low-calorie Weight Watchers ready meals or homemade meals like Spaghetti bolognaise made from scratch with fresh ingredients . Snacks: Up to five pieces of fruit a day . Exercise regime: . Gym sessions 4 to 5 times a week for an hour and a half at a time. This usually involves one hour of cardio such as running and then 30 minutes of weights. ‘I . take it as a huge compliment. He has millions of female fans all over . the world and is dating one of the most gorgeous girls in the world, so . obviously he must be doing something right. ‘Most . lads would find it hard to admit but he’s an attractive guy, he’s . dating a beautiful girl and he literally has enough money to do whatever . he wants. ‘Now I look like Justin Bieber my confidence has gone through the roof and I get lots female attention too.’ Mastering the pout: Mr Cookson says he is now regularly stopped in the street by passersby mistaking him for Beiber .

A mysterious figure known as the 'mountain man' has been caught on surveillance camera after police believe he is now responsible for at least two dozen armed burglaries. Troy James Knapp, 44, was spotted in Sanpete County, Utah a . week ago with a gun slung over his shoulder, using binoculars to scope . for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in. The recluse was only identified in February, three years after his fingerprints were lifted from holiday . homes near Zion National Park in the Utah wilderness. It is believed that he has been stealing camping equipment, guns and supplies from cabins for the past seven years. Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last week in Sanpete County, Utah . Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist . Last week, police tried once again to track him down but the survivalist evaded authorities. He has been compared to Davy . Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of . the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of . wilderness. Knapp is a . virtual ghost in the woods, stocked with stolen gear, food and guns. Authorities have so far revealed little about him or how he ended up . wandering the mountains of southern Utah. Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented. Police . fear now that elk hunting season is under way, Knapp will find it . easier to blend in with others in the woods and move around undetected, . according to Deseret News. One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'. Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, pictured in December 2011. It is believed that he is responsible for a series of burglaries at holiday homes in the Utah wilderness . Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor . Charges were filed against Knapp in Kane County, Utah on January 27 as the key suspect in . a series of burglaries. Knapp's . fingerprints, taken from one cabin in 2009, were allegedly matched . to a 2000 theft arrest in California. He was convicted previously on . charges of assault with a weapon and burglaries . ‘This guy is probably about as true a . survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time. Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name . Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities. Detectives have warned the public not to approach Knapp but to take a photo of him and note his GPS coordinates. Knapp is 5ft 11', weighs 160lb, has blue eyes and short, red hair. He has tattoos on his neck, chest, arms and back of his left hand. In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp. It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food, . alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies. In . February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin . after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. It . turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin . was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the . fingerprint match. There . have been no violent confrontations but detectives call Knapp a time bomb. He has left some cabins tidy and clean, but others practically . destroyed - defecating in a pan on the floor in one home. Lately . he has been leaving the cabins in disarray and riddled with bullets . after defacing religious icons. A recent note left behind in one cabin . warned: ‘Get off my mountain.’ Targets: Knapp was spotted on the surveillance camera outside of a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir in Utah (pictured) In . the January 27 court filing, authorities said Knapp had left behind . even more threatening notes aimed at law enforcement. ‘Hey Sheriff... Gonna put you in the ground!’ read one note. From the beginning, the suspect's lore . grew, leading to theories that he might have been two separate men on . the FBI's Most Wanted List. It was even suggested he could be a . castaway from nearby compounds of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus . Christ of Latter Day Saints, the polygamous sect run by jailed leader . Warren Jeffs. Early on, investigators thought his . unattended camps they came across during their search were left . behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse. This . was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns, . radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a . name, but the man remains in the mist.

The model is accurate right down to the number of flagstones on pavements around the building and even includes a tiny 2cm model of Brian's beloved pet dog Casey outside his room. Residents can gaze into miniature versions of their flats, and see tiny workmen fixing gutters - which are made of straws. Brian, a lifelong modeller who starting making scenery for his railway set as a child, said he decided to make the replica because he enjoyed living there so much.

How it looks today: The fronts of the houses look remarkably alike, although the roofs on the model are red . Happy: The 75-year-old said he loves living in the complex so much he 'just wanted to do something to commemorate the place' Yesterday the retired stationary shop worker, said: 'I've done bits of scenery for my model railways over the years but never anything to this scale. 'I just love living here so much that I wanted to do something to commemorate the place, which would last a long time. 'Maybe I will keep extending it out until I've made an entire replica of Birmingham city centre. I might need a bigger house for that though. 'I enjoyed making it as people used to come to watch me. The usual question was ""have you made my flat yet?' or 'where is my flat going to be when you get round to doing it?"". Community: Brian even crafted small figures of people living in and visiting the complex as well as miniature cars . Labour of love: The mini version of Brian's home is complete with trees and gardens . Keeping the peace: An ambulance and police officers are on hand in Brian's model . Better than the real thing? Brian, a retired stationery company rep, has lived in the complex for the past 11 years . 'The building was made from Bells whisky cartons and the roof from cereal packets. The rest is stuff I have lying around. 'The only things I have bought ready-made are the people and the vehicles. It's only cost me about £30 in total. 'This is my legacy to the place which will hopefully be around for a long time even when I'm gone.' His local councillor Victoria Quinn described Brian's model as a 'work of art, made from old rubbish.' She added: 'The level of detail really is amazing.'

"Mother of ex-Navy SEAL says Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is exploiting her son's death on the campaign trail . By . Hayley Peterson . PUBLISHED: . 14:16 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:34 EST, 10 October 2012 . Mitt Romney’s campaign has said he will stop talking about his meeting with a former Navy SEAL killed in last month’s terror attack on the . U.S. consulate in Libya after the victim’s mother protested his use of her . son’s death. Barbara Doherty, the mother of 42-year-old Glen Doherty, who was killed alongside the U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens and three others last month, said: 'I don’t trust Romney. He shouldn’t make my son’s death part of his political agenda.’ ‘It’s wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama,' she added. Scroll down for video . Respect: The mother of slain ex-Navy SEAL Glen Doherty has . asked Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to stop talking about . her son on the campaign trail . After Mrs Doherty's complaint was broadcast on  WHDH-TV in Boston, Romney's campaign said the election hopeful will no longer mention Doherty’s name in public. ‘Gov. Romney was inspired by the memory . of meeting Glen Doherty and shared his story and that memory, but we . respect the wishes of Mrs Doherty,’ said Romney campaign spokeswoman . Amanda Henneberg. Until this week, Romney hadn't mentioned Doherty's name on the campaign trail. But in recent days, Romney revealed on several occasions while campaigning that he had met Doherty several years ago near his home in La Jolla, California. Reflection: Romney remembers meeting Glen Doherty at a holiday party near his home in La Jolla, California . Killed: Doherty was one of four Americans killed in last month's attacks against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi . 'He came from Massachusetts, where I’d been governor, had family there,' Romney told factory workers in Mount Vernon, Ohio. 'He also had skied in some of the places that I had found during the Winter Olympics in Utah. And we had a nice chat together.' He told the crowd that Doherty was working in Benghazi as a private security contractor when he was killed. 'And you can imagine how shocked I was to learn that he was one of the two Navy — former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi, just a couple of weeks ago,' Romney said. 'And I read on CNN International that when the report came that our consulate had been attacked, that he and the other SEAL that was killed with him, that they were in a different place, they were about a mile away, an annex somewhere else in the city. 'And when they heard that the consulate was under attack, they went to the attack. They didn’t hunker down and hide themselves. No, they went there. That’s what Americans do. When there’s a challenge, when there’s a threat, we go there. When things are tough, we don’t give up, we keep fighting. There’s a saying that I’ve found pretty compelling. Clear eyes, full heart, can’t lose.' Wreckage: Doherty exemplified the unwavering courage of American troops when he rushed to the site of the attack in Benghazi, Romney says . One of Glen Doherty's best friends says the former Navy SEAL remembered his meeting with Romney much differently than the way Romney described. Elf Ellefsen, who said he has been friends with Doherty for more than two decades, told MyNorthwest.com that Romney unknowingly reintroduced himself to his friend several times throughout the evening. 'He said it was very comical,' Ellefsen said. 'Mitt Romney approached him ultimately four times, using this private gathering as a political venture to further his image. He kept introducing himself as Mitt Romney, a political figure. The same introduction, the same opening line. Glen believed it to be very insincere and stale.'","Mother of ex-Navy SEAL says Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is exploiting her son's death on the campaign trail .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:17 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:31 EST, 11 October 2012 . Renowned career soldier and war hero Basil L. Plumley - one of a select few to have fought in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam - has died at 92. Plumley is a legend in the . U.S. Army for his exploits and was awarded a medal for making five parachute jumps into combat. He gained more widespread fame after his 1992 Vietnam War book and the 2002 movie 'We Were Soldiers', based on it. The film starred Mel Gibson and Sam . Elliott played Plumley. Friends said Plumley, who died in hospice care in Georgia on Wednesday, never told war stories and was known to hang up on people who called to interview him. American hero: Renowned career soldier Basil L. Plumley has been described as an icon in military circles . Plumley fought in World War 2, Korea and Vietnam - an extremely rare achievement . Plumley didn't need a Hollywood portrayal to be revered among soldiers, said Greg Camp, a retired army colonel and former chief of staff at neighboring Fort Benning who befriended Plumley in his later years. 'He's iconic in military circles,' Camp said. 'Among people who have been in the military, he's beyond what a movie star would be. His legend permeates three generations of soldiers.' Debbie Kimble, Plumley's daughter, said her father died from cancer after spending about nine days at Columbus Hospice. Although the illness seemed to strike suddenly, Kimble said Plumley's health had been declining since his wife of 63 years, Deurice Plumley, died last May on Memorial Day. A native of Shady Spring, West Virginia, Plumley enlisted in the Army in 1942 and ended up serving 32 years in uniform. In World War II, he fought in the Allied invasion of Italy at Salerno and the D-Day invasion at Normandy. He later fought with the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment in Korea. In Vietnam, Plumley served as sergeant major - the highest enlisted rank - in the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment. 'That puts him in the rarest of clubs,' said journalist Joseph L. Galloway, who met Plumley while covering the Vietnam War for United Press International and remained lifelong friends with him. 'To be combat infantry in those three wars, in the battles he participated in, and to have survived - that is miraculous.' In the 2002 movie 'We Were Soldiers', Plumley was played by the actor Sam Elliott . Plumley, right, has been described as a tough man who had a very big, warm heart that he concealed very well . It was during Vietnam in November 1965 that Plumley served in the Battle of la Drang, the first major engagement between the U.S. Army and North Vietnamese forces. That battle was the basis for the book 'We Were Soldiers Once ... And Young,' written nearly three decades later by Galloway and retired Lt. Gen. Hal G. Moore, who had been Plumley's battalion commander in Vietnam. In the 2002 film version, Mel Gibson played Moore and Elliott played Plumley. Galloway said several of Elliott's gruff one-liners in the movie were things Plumley actually said, such as the scene in which a soldier tells the sergeant major good morning and is told: 'Who made you the (expletive) weather man?' 'Sam Elliott underplayed him. He was actually tougher than that,' Galloway said. 'He was gruff, monosyllabic, an absolute terror when it came to enforcing standards of training.' That's not to say he was mean or inhuman, Galloway said. 'This was a man above all else who had a very big, warm heart that he concealed very well.' Plumley retired with the rank command sergeant major in 1974 at Fort Benning, his last duty station. He then took a civilian job doing administrative work for the next 15 years at Martin Army Community Hospital. Plumley co-wrote the book 'We Were Soldiers Once ... And Young' with Hal G. Moore, Plumley's battalion commander in Vietnam. Mel Gibson played Moore in the 2002 movie . Camp said Plumley remained strong until just a few weeks before his death. He helped open the Army's National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning in 2009. Camp, who now works for the museum's fundraising foundation, said Plumley helped him get Elliott to come narrate a ceremony dedicating the parade ground outside the museum. When Camp mentioned the actor's name, Plumley handed him Elliott's cellphone number. After Plumley became ill, Galloway mentioned his worsening condition on Facebook. Fans of the retired sergeant major responded with a flood of cards and letters. The day before he died in hospice, Camp said, Plumley received about 160 pieces of mail. 'He was dad to me when I was growing up,' said Kimble, Plumley's daughter. 'We are learning every day about him. He was an inspiration to so many. He was a great person, and will always be remembered.'","Basil L. Plumley was a career solider who miraculously survived three major conflicts .

Ohio’s Miami University is taking heat after the discovery of a flier advising how to rape women was found last weekend in freshman co-ed dorm bathroom. Titled “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape,” the flier tells readers that 'practice makes perfect. The more you rape, the better you get at it.' It also says: 'If you're afraid that the girl will identify you, slit her throat,' and to 'never take pictures or give your phone number to the girl you rape.' Anger: A flier posted in a freshman dorm at Miami University has caused outrage, as it lists the top ten ways to get away with rape . Trouble: A flier posted in the men's restroom at a Miami University freshman co-ed dorm offered pointers on the Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape' The offending typo-filled top ten list hardly caused a stir among Miami University officials, but has some students up in arms. 'It could have been a joke, but the fact of the matter is that those thoughts are crossing someone’s mind,' said Miami University junior Kate Van Fossen, vice president of Women Against Violence and Sexual Assault (WAVE). 'There are girls living in a hall where someone came up with that. It’s just disturbing,' she told told Cincinnati.com. A resident assistant at McBride Hall found the flier over the weekend and reported it on Monday, Van Fossen said. Barbara Jones, Miami’s vice president for student affairs, chose not to alert students of the incident because it didn't pose an immediate threat, the report said. 'All of our evidence shows it was confined strictly to McBride Hall,' she's quoted as saying. 'I read the flier. I was shocked. It has no place on our campus or any other campus,' she said, adding that it was 'reprehensible.' After the discovery, Miami officials . held a mandatory meeting for male students at McBride Hall, launched a . campus police investigation, and increased campus police presence at . McBride Hall.

'If I wasn’t involved with WAVE I wouldn’t have known about this incident,” Van Fossen told Cincinnati.com Friday. “The university is brushing this issue ... under the rug.' Van Fossen said university officials denied her request to send out a notice to students. She also questions whether Miami is serious about sexual assault prevention on campus -- the university’s sexual assault prevention coordinator position has been vacant for a year, she said. According to the report, a campus crime alert online indicates a recent attack involved a female student who reported being raped near a school construction site on September 23. On Miami University's campus police website, 27 sexual assaults have been reported on the campus between 2009 through 2011, 19 of them were alleged to have happened in dorms. No numbers were released for 2012.

Saturday Night Live took inspiration from Thursday’s fiery debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan. In fact, the clash between the two politicians was such good fodder that many lines from the cold open were taken verbatim from last week’s exchange, focusing on Biden’s constant snickering, gesturing, and grinning. Biden, played by long-time SNL veteran Jason Sudeikis, called one of Taran Killam’s statements a ‘bunch of malarkey.’ When Ryan explained that it was an Irish expression, Sudeikis responded: ‘No, Irish is I come over there and smack that dumb look off your face.’ Scroll down for video . Clash: Joe Biden, played by Jason Sudeikis, left, was all atwitter during the debate while Taran Killam, right, played a more sombre Paul Ryan . Exaggerated: Sudeikis mimicked the vice president's gestures, including the giggling and frustration . Training day: Olympic 100m gold medalist Usain Bolt made a cameo appearance, telling off Killam for saying Ryan won the sprint . The long-running NBC show relied heavily on the debate itself, using lines about stuff, malarkey, and beans as springboards. Kate McKinnon played ABC News’ Martha Raddatz, beginning the debate by telling Killam and Sudeikus: ‘As a reminder, your performance is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the election.’ She also set the two men in their place, asking at one point, ‘Do I look like Jim Lehrer? Do I talk like Jim Lehrer? Then don’t try to f*** me like Jim Lehrer,’ referring to the PBS anchor’s timid performance during the presidential debates the week before. In the skit, Sudeikis and Killam discussed several talking points, including the fact that both men came from small towns – Ryan is from Jamesville, Wisconsin, and Biden heralds from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Killam asked Sudeikis if he knew the unemployment rate is now 10 per cent in Scranton, to which Sudeikis responded: ‘Things may be bad where you live, but it’s a paradise next to the burning coal-heap that is Scranton. 'If you went to the lowest circle of hell, you’d still be 45 minutes outside of Scranton.’ Bunch of stuff? Kate McKinnon played ABC News' Martha Raddatz, beginning the debate by telling candidates: 'Your performance is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the election' Thirsty Thursday: The sketch mocked how much water Ryan drank during the 90-minute debate; in the skit, Killam drank a comically-large class of water, then going to a water bottle meant for pets . Following another question of bi-partisanship, Sudeikis said that his much younger debate partner didn’t scare him, with his ‘shark eyes.’ Referring to Ryan’s gruelling PX90 workout regime, he said: ‘There’s gym strong, and there’s old man strong. You want to know my work out? When my Amtrak breaks down on my morning commute, I strip down to my tighty whities and pull the train to Washington.’ While Sudeikis was speaking, Killan chugged a comically-large glass of water, and was then given even more water through a pet's water bottle. Asked to be more specific on his tax plans, Killan responded: ‘No, I can’t be specific, but let say the same thing, with hand gestures.’ McKinnon also asked Ryan to stop looking directly into the lens because he was ‘scaring small children.’ Cool and collected: Huffington Post creator Arianna Huffington, played by Nasim Pedrad, joined Seth Meyers to talk about Martha Raddatz's performance as moderator . For a closing statement, Killan said that he won the 100m race during this summer’s Olympic games in London. He said: ‘If you don’t believe me, ask my runningmate, Usain Bolt.’ Right on cue, the gold medallist sauntered onstage. ‘Please tell them who won the 100m,’ he said.‘I did,’ Bolt deadpanned. During Weekend Update with Seth Meyers, the head writer discussed the vice president and vice presidential candidate’s varying strategies ahead of the debate. Meyers said that while Ryan prepared for Thursday’s debates by practicing foreign policy, ‘Biden prepared by shotgunning Redbull and watching Yosemite Sam cartoon. In fairness,’ he added, ‘a bunch of stuff is the entire economic part of the Romney/Ryan plan.’ He also jibbed Romney’s shifting stance on abortion, conceding that the procedure was appropriate in cases of rape and incest. Geek squad: Christina Applegate, far left, hosted a panel of tech editors to talk about the flaws of the iPhone 5 . Sob story: Little did they know, their complaints were given to FoxConn 'peasant workers' who had little sympathy for the editors' problems . Meyers said that Romney still wants to be seen as a pro-life president, but he noted, ‘Romney defines life as anyone making over $250,000 a year.’ Arianna Huffington, played by Nasim Pedrad, joined Meyers to talk about Martha Raddatz’s much-talked about performance as moderator. But before she talked shop, Pedrad sneaked in a compliment to Meyers, calling him 'the cabana boy I never had.' On Raddatz, she offered: 'It’s wonderful to have a woman moderating. Only a woman would call someone a friend and then b*** about them for 90 minutes.’ In another timely skit, SNL poked fun at iPhone 5 enthusiasts who were less than wowed by the new Apple product. In the skit, host Christina Applegate played host to a panel discussion between experts from Wired and C-Net and workers at the embattled FoxConn corporation in China. The panellists whined about glitches and design flaws, as well as having to wait in line to purchase the coveted smartphone. But the three FoxConn workers didn’t seem to care. ‘Talk about Apple map, you want Starbuck (sic), it take you to Dunkin’ Donut (sic), that must be so hard for you!’ one worker said. ‘We don’t need map because we sleep where we work,’ another chimed in.","Saturday Night Live opened on Thursday's VP debate, showing Biden chuckling throughout and Ryan as extremely thirsty .

A masked thug has taken to YouTube to threaten boxing champion Amir Khan and crow about allegedly 'knocking him out' when he reportedly attacked the boxer and his brother. Police are investigating the video which followed reports Khan, 25, and younger brother Haroon, 20, had beaten off six would-be car-jackers in Digbeth, Birmingham, in the early hours of Monday morning. The pair were allegedly targeted by a gang of six, and the former world light-welterweight champion reportedly knocked one of them out with a flurry of blows, before he and his brother drove away. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The masked thug threatened boxer Amir Khan and held up a wallet, which he claimed was the former world champion's . The thug dangled some Porsche car keys that he claimed were Khan's - but then goes on to say that the champion drove away from the scene . Boxer Amir Khan has refused to comment on the claims . In a video posted on social networking sites yesterday a masked man gave his own foul-mouthed version of events and shrieked a series of threats to the Bolton-based champ. He screams into the camera: 'I'll rip your f****** head off. You know the truth, we know the truth. You got knocked the f*** out. 'Next time you can bring an army. Who gives a f*** if you're Amir Khan. You're not a hero here, you're a zero.' The video, which looks like it was filmed in someone's living room, came after the reported punch-up in Adelaide Street, Digbeth, when the boxing brothers were said to have been targeted by robbers, who were trying to steal Amir's £100,000 Range Rover. In the two-part video, the masked man holds aloft belongings including a bag, wallet and car keys, which he claims belong to the former world titleholder. The footage has led to a West Midlands Police's now investigating the incident, after they originally said they had been called to reports of a disorder but had not found any sign of an assault. A spokesman said: 'We originally said we are not investigating the alleged incident, but have now revised our position.' Officers are trying to untangle the details of what exactly happened. Amir Khan's representative refused to comment on the allegations. On . the day of the alleged fight Amir Khan tweeted a comment which seemed . to dismiss the story that he was attacked that said 'silly rumours pple make up.' He laughed off reports about the attack in a press conference about his future fights the day after the alleged attack, by showing his undamaged hands and face. The thug, who filmed it in what appears to be a living room, told the boxer that he would 'smash him up' if he came back to Birmingham . The thug points to a video of the boxer being beaten in a match and accuses him of having 'wobbling legs' Amir Khan was born in Bolton, Lancashire in 1986. He began to box competitively at just 11-years-old. The 2004 Silver medal Olympic podium Amir Khan has become Britain's highest-profile boxer . He became the World Light Welterweight Champion in July 2009  after beating Andreas Kotelnik. In 2007 Khan was convicted of careless driving and given a six-month driving ban and a £1000 fine. He was punished for hitting and breaking the leg of Geoffrey Hatton in 3006. Mr Hatton was using a pelican crossing in Bolton while Khan was travelling at 47 mph in a 30 mph zone and overtaking in the wrong lane. Another version of events that night, which reported that the gang were defeated by the Khan brothers, clearly rankled the man on the video, who wore a balaclava to conceal his face while he shrieked into the camera. He screeched: 'Ask him to explain this: Why have I got his f***ing Porsche keys, you waste, why have I got this Louis Vitton f***ing wallet - it's yours, you waste, and it's got your €500 in it.' At one point, the man points to video footage of Khan's being hit by Breidis Prescott in 2008 and taunts: 'Look at those legs wobble. Does this man look like he can knock out six men? He looks like a samba dance. Your chin looks big on TV. 'You're not welcome in Birmingham, every time you come we're going to smash you up.' In an official statement last night, a West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'Police are investigating reports of an alleged criminal incident on Adelaide Street, Birmingham at around 1.23am on Monday, October 8.' Detective Inspector Dawn Miskella said: 'Police are investigating reports of an alleged criminal incident on Adelaide Street, Birmingham at around 1:23am on Monday 8 October.'

Jailed: Child molester Alfred Palmer, 55, has been allowed to appeal his five year jail term after his lawyers found a legal loophole . A paedophile who was jailed after fleeing to Turkey could be freed because he was on the run during his earlier court hearing. Child molester Alfred Palmer, 55, has been allowed to appeal his five year jail term after his lawyers found a legal loophole. Palmer and his boyfriend preyed on teenage boys but in 2006 their trial collapsed and he was allowed to go on holiday - because he was ‘stressed’. He went on the run in Turkey and in 2007 he received an indeterminate sentence for imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and was jailed in his absence at Plymouth Crown Court. But when a judge realised Palmer’s offences pre-dated the legislation which introduced the IPP, he changed his sentence to five years in jail. Now Palmer's lawyers argue that the second sentence was illegal because such a change must be made only by the Court of Appeal, and crucially, in the presence of the defendant. So because he was 1,000 miles away, reportedly in the Turkish holiday resort of Marmaris, they say he should be allowed to appeal his jail term. Palmer was found guilty of four indecent assaults against two teenage boys and the judge passed the indefinite sentence in absentia because he posed a serious risk to the public. He had spent two years fighting extradition before being returned to Britain to start his five year sentence in November 2011. Palmer, of Stoke, appeared at Exeter Crown Court on Friday where the original trial judge sent the case to the Court Of Appeal. Bolt hole: Palmer was reportedly staying in the resort town of Marmaris on the Mediterranean coast in south west Turkey . Mr . Malcolm Hawkes, defending, said Palmer will also argue that the two . years he spent in a Turkish prison while fighting extradition should . count as part of his sentence. That . would mean Palmer would almost certainly be due for immediate release - . after police spent hundreds of thousands of pounds and years bringing . him to justice. The partner: Palmer and boyfriend Daniel Tapper (pictured), 56, preyed on teenage boys who were looking for a home after leaving council care . Mr Hawkes said: 'A sentence pronounced . in court can only be changed by the Court of Appeal, and they should . also consider if the time spent in custody in Turkey should count . towards his sentence. 'This case needs to be listed for an urgent hearing at the Court of Appeal.' Palmer and boyfriend Daniel Tapper, 56, preyed on teenage boys who were looking for homes after leaving council care. They ran a lettings agency and used their position to bully the young tenants who were forced to strip off and take part in sex acts. But Palmer went on the run in May 2006 after Judge Gilbert QC allowed them leave the country mid trial. Palmer and Tapper were both traced to Turkey and arrested in 2009 following an appeal by BBC’s Crimewatch. In their absence Palmer, of Plymouth, Devon, had been found guilty of four counts of indecent assault on a male person over a five year period and jailed for five years. Tapper, of Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, had been convicted of one charge of indecent assault on a male person and jailed for three years. Tapper was brought back in early 2010 and sentenced to a further 36 months for jumping bail. Mr Andrew Maitland, prosecuting during the latest hearing, said the case had to go to the Court of Appeal because any correction of a sentence has to be made within 28 days and with the defendant present. Judge Gilbert said he hopes the Court of Appeal confirms the five-year sentence. Palmer also faces an additional sentence for jumping bail, but that case was adjourned indefinitely.","Alfred Palmer, 55, has been allowed to appeal his five year jail term after his lawyers found a legal loophole .

He said: ‘Having just received a speeding fine from South Wales Police for going at 35mph in a 30mph zone - which was quite shocking to me this morning, I might add - may I say that this news of electrification is a great encouragement to me to use the railway in future.’ Transport Minister Simon Burns told him: ‘It just goes to show the old adage is always the best adage: let the train take the strain.’ Mr Fabricant, who has become a prolific user of Twitter since his liberation from the Whips’ Office, wrote earlier: .

England's baby boom is being driven by a triple whammy of immigration, recession and thousands of older mothers anxious to have families before it is too late, an official analysis said today. It pointed to a catch-up generation of mothers in their late 30s and 40s who delayed having children for the sake of education and careers as partly responsible for pushing birth numbers up to their highest level in 40 years. Alongside older mothers, birth rates are rising because of high numbers of mothers born abroad and the impact of recession and the efforts of politicians to cope with it, the Office for National Statistics said. Up and up: Last year's baby count was 22 per cent higher than the 594,634 recorded in 2001 . The report, which carried the final tally of numbers of children born in England and Wales last year, said there were 723,913 babies. This was a slight increase - 0.1 per cent - on the 723,165 in 2010. Older mums: A catch-up generation of mothers in their late 30s and 40s have been anxious to have children before it's too late . Births have gone up every year for a decade that has seen the total rise by more than a fifth. Last year's baby count was 22 per cent higher than the 594,634 recorded in 2001. The last time more children were born in England and Wales in a year was 1972. 'There is no single explanation underlying the overall increases in fertility since 2001, which are likely to have resulted from a combination of factors,' the report said. 'Possible causes may include women born in the 1960s and 70s who postponed childbearing in their 20s catching up in their 30s and 40s, and increases in the numbers of foreign born women with above average fertility rates.' It suggested a further cause may be 'government policy and the economic climate indirectly influencing individuals' decisions around childbearing and therefore affecting numbers of births, although this does not have a clear impact on fertility in a particular direction.' Among state policies that can . influence couples' decisions on children are tax and benefit changes, . such as the introduction of tax credits for mothers or the cutbacks in . child benefit for higher earners. According . to the breakdown, the number of mothers in their 40s has risen more . than fourfold over the past 30 years, from 6,860 in 1981 to 29,350 last . year. Over a decade numbers of 40-something mothers went up by 61 per cent those aged between 35 and 39 by 51 per cent. Baby boom: The last time more children were born in England and Wales in a year was 1972 . The shift towards older motherhood means the average age of a new mother is 29.7, up from 26.4 in 1973, in the last period that birth numbers were so high. 'The overall rise since 1973 reflects the increasing numbers of women who have been delaying childbearing to later ages,' the ONS said. 'Possible influences include increased participation in higher education, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainties, and instability of partnerships.' The difficulties faced by many women in . forming a stable partnership with a man were underlined by the figures . for births inside and outside marriage. At work: Mothers in their late 30s and 40s have delayed having children for the sake of education and careers . Last year the share of babies born to . unmarried mothers went up to a record 47.2 per cent, up from 40.0 per . cent in 2001. Many of these babies are born to cohabiting mothers, whose . relationships are much more likely to break up than marriages. 'Possible influences include increased participation in higher education, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainties, and instability of partnerships' Office for National Statistics report . Just over one in four babies, 25.5 per cent, were born to a mother who was herself born abroad. This figure has gone up from 11.6 per cent in 1990, and the ONS said that 'recent rises in the number of births to non-UK born women can be mainly attributed to the increase in the population of women born outside the UK.' Latest ONS figures say the population of England and Wales has gone up by around four million in a decade, with immigration responsible for the great majority of the extra numbers. The report said that a high proportion of foreign-born women are of childbearing age and they have on average higher fertility rates than British-born women.","Catch-up generation of mothers in late 30s and 40s waited to have children .

Savage attack: Patricia Pearson, 81 (left) was left bleeding in a brutal road-rage attack in June by Usman Yasin (right), who was jailed for four months last week by Burton Magistrates . Mrs Pearson relived the horror of a vicious road-rage attack which left her covered in blood and fearful for her own safety. She said: 'He leathered into me. He got hold of my face and pulled my hair. He really set to me and was still using foul language. 'He got his hand and pushed it down the left-hand side of my face. I was bleeding then.

Facial scars: Mrs Pearson was left with head injuries after Yasin took issue with her slow driving . 'He wanted to do what he wanted to do - regardless of me.' Mrs Pearson told how she was travelling down All Saints’ Road to see her husband, Thomas, an 81-year-old dementia sufferer who lives in a Winshill Care Home, when Yasin roared up behind sounding his horn. 'My friend, Jimmy, said ""there’s somebody at the back of you who wants to get around,""' said Mrs Pearson, then of Uxbridge Street, Burton, who has since moved. 'I said: ""I don’t know if he’s trying to damage his car or mine"". 'I could not go any faster because . there were vehicles both sides. If I had I would have knocked people’s . wing mirrors off.' Yasin, of Broadway Street, Burton, eventually pulled . in front and stopped. 'When I stopped, I got out of the car and went to his,' Mrs Pearson said. 'I opened his passenger door and leaned towards him and said ""whatever is the matter with you?""' Yasin responded with a volley of abuse, prompting his victim to say ‘less of your language’ and touched his nose with her hand. In . the attack, which happened on June 17, Mrs Pearson sustained injuries . including a cut on her forehead and top lip, and grazes to her face, . cheek and elbow. She was treated at Burton’s Queen’s Hospital. Jailed: Usman Yasin arriving at Burton Magistrates court last week where he was sentenced to four months . Four months after the attack she still suffers pain in her lips and neck, as well as psychological trauma. 'Now I’m a bit afraid that if I go to Burton I’m going to bump into him again,' Mrs Pearson said. Yasin was jailed last week following a trial at Burton Magistrates’ Court. He had claimed self-defence.Mrs Pearson said his sentence was ‘neither a punishment nor a deterrent’. 'Everybody knows he will only do half. 'Half of 16 [weeks] is eight, so he will be home by Christmas,' she said. 'It’s a farce, an absolute farce - a waste of people’s money. My time was wasted and he’s now able to appeal.

Primary school teacher Elen Meirion, had got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet when she accidentally stumbled on the landing and fell, an inquest heard . A school choir conductor who won a major award on BBC’s Songs of Praise was killed after she drank wine and plunged down a flight of stairs at her home. Primary school teacher Elen Meirion, had got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet when she accidentally stumbled on the landing and fell, an inquest heard. The inquest was told she fell from 'top to bottom', hitting her head on a desk at the foot of the stairs. A friend who was in the house and heard her slip and call out, said she found Mrs Meirion in the hallway with head injuries. The 43-year-old died two days later in hospital with her family by her bedside. Tests on her blood showed she would have been two and a half times the legal limit for driving. A verdict of accidental death was recorded after the hearing was told she suffered from an 'unsurvivable' head trauma. The tragedy occurred in April, a year after the divorced mother of one - sister of Welsh opera singer Rhys Meirion - directed pupils at Ysgol Pen Barras school in Ruthin, North Wales at the Songs of Praise junior school choir of the year title for 2011. The hearing in Llandudno was told she had been visited by her on-off companion David Tudor at her house in Ruthin and he said she was 'jolly and bubbly'. It heard she had been drinking white wine and Cava whilst he drank vodka and they spent a 'chilled and relaxed' evening together before going went to bed. 'Later I heard her get up,' said Mr Tudor in a statement read to the hearing. 'I thought she was going to the toilet. I recall her making an ‘oo’ sound and I heard a light fall. I was almost asleep. I thought ‘Has Elen just fallen down stairs?’ Mr Tudor went downstairs to investigate found her with back and bottom on the wooden floor and her legs slightly up the stairs. Elen Meirion (right) and brother Rhys (left) pictured with a relative . He said: 'I heard a gurgling sound. Putting the light on, I saw she was lying on her back with her head . resting against a desk. I realised the noise was coming from her . throat.' He dialled 999 . and helped paramedics carry Ms Meirion on a spinal board out through the . patio doors because the other doorways were too narrow. He travelled in the ambulance with her to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital where she spent two days in the intensive care unit. But her condition deteriorated and it was 'too late' for neurosurgery. She died on April 17 at 7.28am. A . pathologist found she had 207 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 . millilitres of blood. The legal driving limit would have been 80mg. Mr . Tudor added: 'I can’t believe this has happened. I have lost someone I . care for very much about and who I loved spending time with. She was a . completely lovely person in every way and very special.' Mrs . Meirion's daughter Gwen, 15, arranged for her mother’s kidneys, liver, . pancreas and heart valves for transplant - which save the life of five . other people. Shortly before her mother died the teenager worked with her mother on a school project about the pros and cons of organ donation. Up to £15,000 was raised at Mrs Meirion’s funeral in aid of the Welsh Air Ambulance and Intensive Care Unit at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. At the time of her death Mrs Meirion’s family spoke of their pride for the teacher and told how Ysgol Pen Barras were the first choir from Wales to win the Songs of Praise competition.

A statement from the family read: 'Elen’s passing leaves an irreplaceable void in the family and the community as a whole. 'She loved her family life and her life was music. She ws a loving daughter and sister, as well as a devoted mother.' Mrs Meirion’s ex-husband, Rob Boyns, 44, who runs an IT company added: 'When Gwen did her school project, Elen helped her with the research and they had both come to the conclusion that organ donation was a good thing. 'Gwen’s teacher read her work and he said it had brought a tear to his eye. When Elen was in hospital, the team at the ICU worked with Gwen, whose suggestion it was to donate Elen’s vital organs before the imminent loss of her life. 'When unexpected circumstances dictate that a member of your family suffers in this fashion, it hits everybody hard and having a generous team like the team at Glan Clwyd looking after you is paramount. 'They were very kind and understanding. They provided facilities which made the family’s stay more comfortable and took time, love and care to explain the processes involved.” Tenor Rhys fundraised in memory of his sister saying: 'Elen really was a very popular person and she was very special. She did a huge amount for so many people. 'We are pulling together as a family to support each other and help Gwen as much as we can.” Rhys Meirion has performed worldwide for companies, including Welsh National Opera and English National Opera, as well as on TV and at the National Eisteddfod.","Elen Meirion had got up in the night to go to the toilet when she fell .

After being cut up and studied, the bodies of murderers, robbers and the poor were discarded into a secret 19th century grave yard on the hospital's grounds in Whitechapel, London. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: Archeologists discovered a mix of bones with evidence of dissection as well as skulls cut in two, after a dig at the Royal London Hospital uncovered a secret 19th century burial ground . Discovery: The team found bodies of criminals and the poor, which had been discarded into unmarked graves on the hospital's grounds in Whitechapel, London after being cut up and studied by surgeons .

The unmarked graveyard, in use between 1825 and 1841, lay undiscovered for 165 years until an excavation team from the Museum of London Archaeology department stumbled across it by mistake in 2006. They discovered a mix of bones with extensive evidence of dissection, autopsy and amputation. There were skulls with their crowns sliced in two, bones wired for teaching, bits of tattooed skin, and even a slice of brain suspended in a glass jar. Altogether, the team uncovered 262 burials, but believe they have found the remains of 500 people. ID markers: After poring over hospital records, the Museum of London archaeologists were able to trace these pieces of tattooed human skin back to London grave robbers Thomas Williams and John Bishop .

Criminal activity: The pair murdered a youngster known only as 'the Italian boy' after abducting him from Smithfield, a crime which helped bring about the 1832 Anatomy Act . After years of painstakingly matching bones and body tissue to hospital records, the gruesome find has gone on display in the Museum of London's Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men exhibition. In the 1800s, London was awash with aspiring surgeons, keen to learn their trade. This created a huge demand for bodies. Well-trained surgeons were essential to the capital, then the . most populated city in the world. Yet the only legal source of bodies . for dissection were executed criminals. Unable to get a steady supply of corpses, respectable . surgeons turned to unsavoury grave robbers who . ‘resurrected’ newly-buried bodies from the city’s graveyards to sell to . medical and anatomy schools. It was such a lucrative business that some grave robbers turned to murder in order to keep up with supply. The exhibition includes a fragment of brain from Edinburgh grave robber William Burke, who along with partner William Hare, resorted to murder to keep up with demand. It also includes an iron coffin from the vaults of St Bride's church in Fleet Street, which once closed was designed to be impossible to open. The coffin, would have been vastly expensive at the time, and reflects the fear people had of being dug up once that had been buried.

The tattooed skin of either Thomas Williams or John Bishop, two London grave robbers, is also on display. The infamous pair murdered a youngster known only as 'the Italian boy' after abducting him from Smithfield. When the horrific revelation of the case was revealed, . public fears peaked. Voluntary body donation seemed unlikely to meet . surgeons’ needs. Equally no one wanted to be operated on by a bad . surgeon. Freedom: Whereas only executed criminals could be dissected on a table like the one pictured, the Anatomy Act ruled that bodies 'unclaimed' or 'friendless' could be given up for dissection .

The toyboy fiance of Denise Welch has today been cleared of carrying out an alleged £12,000 fraud. Lincoln Townley, 39, was accused of brokering a deal under a fake name to supply FM Conway Ltd with a fleet of vans in 2009 through his firm Master Fleet. It was alleged he cheated the engineering firm out of £12,164 before fleeing to the sun-drenched island of Majorca. Not guilty: The toyboy fiance of Denise Welch, right, Lincoln Townley, left, has today been cleared of carrying out an alleged £12,000 fraud . Prosecutors had claimed that Townley, who is 15 years younger than Loose Women panelist Ms Welch, struck the deal under the alias David Green because ‘right from the start Mr Townley was not conducting a genuine transaction’. Townley admitted he had not supplied the vehicles and that he had travelled to Majorca shortly after the deal collapsed. But he said he had no intention to defraud Kent-based FM Conway and had attempted to return the money when he flew back to the UK. He said he had employed Green as a contractor to generate business for his firm but had lost contact with him when he jetted out to Majorca. Today, after just over four hours of deliberation, a jury at Southwark Crown Court cleared Townley of fraud. Speaking outside court, where he hugged his barrister and supporters, he said: ‘I’m just very happy with the outcome’. Cleared: Townley, 39, was accused of brokering a deal under a fake name to supply FM Conway Ltd with a fleet of vans in 2009 through his firm Master Fleet . Asked how he planned to celebrate he said: ‘I’m going out with Denise and the family’. Prosecutor Daniel Bunting alleged Townley negotiated with FM Conway ‘in order to get the deposit but he never intended to supply the services to them’. Townley, however, told the court Green had agreed the deal with the firm while he worked on sourcing vehicles from hire company Leaseway. He accepted that the vehicles were never provided saying his deal with Leaseway had collapsed. ‘The communication there was very poor,’ he said. ‘I was in a lot of distress and FM Conway were telling me they wanted the vehicles very quickly. ‘I was under pressure, Leaseway were telling me I need to wait longer for the vehicles and the deal just fell flat. ‘I found it very hard to cope with this. ‘It started to create a lot of pressure for me mentally and I had a breakdown over it. ‘At the time I regrettably spoke to some friends out in Majorca and I went out to see them at the end of August for a week. ‘I went to my doctor about this I was suffering with anxiety and depression and to be honest I was drinking too much at the time. It got too much for me.’ He said that when he returned from Majorca he contacted Ian Gay at FM Conway. ‘It was a complete nightmare,’ he said. ‘He showed no empathy with regards to me wanting to give him a repayment schedule.’ Welch and party organiser Townley met in April 2011, while her now estranged Tim Healy was having an affair with current girlfriend Joan Anderton. The couple announced their 23 year marriage had broken down in February this year, with Denise going public with Townley the following month, before getting engaged in August. According to its website Lincoln Townley Entertainment is a ‘boutique agency’ providing PR and publicity services for a ‘select number of high-end London businesses and celebrity clients’. It also claims the firm host some of ‘the most incredible parties for an exclusive clientele of high-net worth individuals, celebrities and leading brands in the world of art, high performance cars, luxury goods and fashion’. Townley, of Kentish Town, north London, denied one count of fraud between July 1 and August 31, 2009.

Hospital car parks have raked in more than £1billion from patients, relatives and staff in the last ten years, figures revealed yesterday. Drivers are now stumping up £160million a year in charges – more than double the amount of a decade ago. One in four hospital trusts raise at least £1million a year in fees, with some pocketing nearly £4million. Critics describe the charges as a ‘tax on the sick’ and have called for them to be abolished. Worst offender: The Heart of England Hospital Trust in Birmingham brings in the most in parking charges a year in the UK . England is the only country in the UK where hospitals still charge for parking – Scotland and Wales outlawed the practice in 2009. Figures obtained by Tory MP Chris Skidmore show that an average hospital trust now collects £1.055million a year from parking, more than twice as much as in 2001/2 when it was just over £400,000. Top of the list is the Heart of England NHS Trust in Birmingham, which last year raked in £3.9million. Leeds Teaching Hospitals collected £3.4million, closely followed by Nottingham University Hospitals on just over £3million. Worry: Tory MP Chris Skidmore said the NHS needs to look at time spent in hospital less stressful by slashing charges . Mr Skidmore, who is a member of the . Commons Health Select Committee said: ‘Attending a hospital can be a . difficult and stressful experience without having to worry about being . heavily charged for parking or fined. Many patients will need repeated . treatment and require frequent visits to hospitals. ‘Many trusts have found effective . local solutions to ensuring patients and their families are not . penalised, but it is clear that the NHS as a whole should look at what . works in the best trusts in order to ensure that hospital visits are as . comfortable as possible.’ Robert . Oxley, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Parking charges are a . disgraceful tax on the sick and their visitors. They target the most . vulnerable and those who are often already under increased financial . pressure that illness can bring. ‘The . huge increase in money generated by the charges suggest hospitals are . using them more and more as a revenue-raiser rather than just paying for . parking facilities.’ Katherine . Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘Parking . charges hit patients hard – particularly the elderly or those who are . vulnerable and unable to use public transport. ‘Also . affected will be those with chronic conditions who go to hospital . regularly. It’s the last thing patients, relatives and carers need.’ Mr Skidmore obtained figures from two-thirds of hospital trusts. Based . on the average charges, hospitals in England last year collected more . than £160million compared to £63million ten years ago. And in the last decade they have pocketed just over £1billion, the figures show. Labour . had promised to scrap the charges in 2009, but the following year the . Coalition announced they would stay, claiming the NHS could not afford . to lose the income. Separate figures from the Department of Health show that 45 trusts – more than a quarter – have increased their fees. At Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, they went up from 83p an hour to £2.50. The most expensive rate is found at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, which charges £3.50 an hour. But some trusts have broken ranks and scrapped the charges in spite of the loss of income. In 2010, Trafford Hospital in Manchester announced parking would be free as fees were an ‘unnecessary stress, expense and hassle.’ Others have caps including Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire, where patients only pay a maximum of £2.50 no matter how long they stay.","The Heart of England Hospitals Trust in Birmingham pockets the most in charges a year at nearly £3.9million .

Banned: Teresa McKenzie admitted unacceptable professional conduct at the Teaching Agency misconduct hearing . A deputy head teacher cleared of having sex with a special school pupil has been banned from teaching indefinitely. Teresa McKenzie, 41, admitted unacceptable professional conduct at the Teaching Agency misconduct hearing while working at a special needs school in Cheshire. The hearing last month found that the mother-of-two sent more than 600 text messages and two letters to a troubled 16-year-old pupil and wrote letters to him calling him her ‘gorgeous pirate’. In the communications Ms McKenzie is claimed to have said: ‘I won’t be able to concentrate in the meeting thinking about your beautiful eyes, strawberries and cream hair, soft hands, gorgeous laugh, strong-shoulders, delicious lips.’ She admitted sending them to the pupil between December 2007 and July 2008, calling him her ‘seafaring sweetie’ and saying she would ‘love (him) forever and ever’. Ms McKenzie, of Meifod, Powys had previously been found not guilty of seven counts of sexual activity with the pupil during a trial at Chester Crown Court in 2010. The panel at the hearing found that she engaged in inappropriate communications with the pupil and that she failed to maintain professional boundaries with the boy. No allegations were made of any sexual relationship between the teacher and pupil during the hearing and the findings did make it clear that she is not alleged to have had any kind of sexual relationship with the boy. During the 11-day-trial in 2010, Ms McKenzie was cleared of sexually abusing the special needs teenager in her care, claiming her letters had been to ‘make him laugh’, ‘calm him down’ and ‘bring him back from the brink of suicide’. She also claimed that many of the words in the letters were taken from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and were sent to encourage him as part of a school project. 'Gorgeous pirate': Ms McKenzie leaving court in 2010 after being cleared of having sex with the pupil. The Teaching Agency have still enforced the ban after she admitted sending more than 600 text messages and two letters to the pupil . The teaching panel took into account she was of previous good character and felt passionately about teaching. It concluded the school had ‘ineffective management’ and she was given roles of key care worker and head of care, for which she had no previous experience, training or qualifications. Boundaries: Education Secretary Michael Gove welcomed the decision saying she 'failed to observe professional boundaries' The panel heard Ms McKenzie joined the school as a teacher in late February 2006 before being appointed deputy head teacher. Recommending . a Prohibition Order, the panel said: ‘Ms McKenzie was in a senior . position and one of considerable trust in relation to this highly . vulnerable adolescent, who became dependent on her. ‘In her efforts to support him, she lost her objectivity and this impacted on her professional judgment. 'She mismanaged the situation and by her own admission was out of her depth.’ Giving the decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: ‘Ms McKenzie failed to observe professional boundaries, and in failing to observe those boundaries she abused the position of trust that she held with a vulnerable pupil. ‘Her behaviour also set a poor example to her colleagues and placed others in the school at risk. ‘The language used by Ms McKenzie in her communications with Pupil A was inappropriate and the amount of these communications was excessive. ‘I consider that it is in the public interest to support the recommendation of the panel that Ms McKenzie is prohibited from teaching.’ Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove welcomed the panel’s decision saying: ‘Ms McKenzie failed to observe professional boundaries, and in failing to observe those boundaries she abused the position of trust that she held with a vulnerable pupil.’","Teresa McKenzie has been banned from teaching indefinitely .

Ordeal: Kayley Howson, 18, endured a three year legal ordeal culminating in her testifying against her alleged assailant in court only to see him cleared by a jury . A teenager hanged herself while suffering from severe depression after a man she accused of rape was acquitted, an inquest heard. Kayley Howson, 18, endured a three-year ordeal to bring the alleged assailant to court but he was cleared by a jury. The college student and budding poet was said to have taken the verdict ‘very, very hard’. Two years later her mother found her hanged at her home. Yesterday, more than four years after the tragedy, a coroner described the rape investigation as a ‘catastrophic episode’ in her life. East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor added: ‘She was a normal, slightly shy 14-year-old who was subjected to what the  psychiatrist described as a catastrophic episode when she said she was sexually assaulted. The effects were traumatic. ‘We must never ever forget that this was a young girl, just trying to be normal, trying to grow up.’ When Miss Howson was 14 she told a teacher she had been raped, the inquest heard. The case went to court in 2006 and Miss Howson gave evidence via video link. Her mother Janet Mitchell, 52, told the inquest: ‘Giving evidence was hard for her. Kayley started self-harming after revealing what had allegedly happened. She was a completely different person from before, overcome with waves of depression. ‘She’d go to her bedroom and write. Deep poetry was her way of expressing herself.’ Troubled: Kayley Howson, right, celebrates her 18th birthday party with sister Jayde, left. The college student slipped into bouts of depression after making her allegation to police . Wanting answers: Kayley's mother Janet Mitchell, left, and sister Catherine arrive at Burnley Town Hall for the inquest into her death. Following the acquittal Miss Howson went on a downward spiral and took 12 overdoses of painkillers. ‘Kayley was totally traumatised,’ her . mother said in an interview. ‘The police officers felt terrible, too. They said they felt they’d let her down. ‘Kayley blamed herself. She believed everyone would think she was a liar. ‘It was heartbreaking watching my little girl crumble.’ The inquest was told Miss Howson, who . had hopes of becoming a psychiatric nurse, was also prescribed the . controversial drug Depakote. Its makers have faced lawsuits in America over claims it was used improperly for schizophrenia and autism. The inquest heard Miss Howson’s dosage . of Depakote had to be lowered after she started suffering side effects . including stomach cramps and backache. Nine days before her death she  abruptly stopped taking the drug after seeing her doctor. Mrs Mitchell told the inquest, which . was delayed due to difficulties assembling witnesses: ‘It was . immediately noticeable there was a change in her. Her mood swings became . worse.’ Popular: Kayley, pictured left with a friend, began taking overdoses and self harming after her alleged attacker was charged . Questions: Around . two weeks before her death Kayley had stopped taking the drug Depakote, . more commonly used for treatment for epileptics, after a consultation . with her doctor . In March 2008 Miss Howson  was found hanged at home  in Burnley. A note was found and her diary showed she had been experiencing suicidal thoughts. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict. He added: ‘Her diary is private and . not for public consumption but I have seen it and it describes an . intelligent person with rational thoughts trying to work out what was . happening to her.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Kayley Howson, 18, endured a three year .
