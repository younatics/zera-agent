"By . Joe Bernstein . The last thing Liverpool need when Luis Suarez goes is a repeat of Tottenham’s post-Gareth Bale trauma. Spurs raked in a world-record £86million for Bale a year ago and then wasted it on seven underwhelming signings, like £25m flop Erik Lamela. To avoid the same pitfalls, Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers has already done his homework and made plans to rebuild a Liverpool team that can challenge in the Premier League and Champions League. VIDEO Scroll down for Liverpool target Lazar Markovic scoring sublime goal for Benfica . Poitning the way: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has already been very busy in the market this summer . Heading for the exit: Last season's star man Luis Suarez is set to join Barcelona . Southampton’s England World Cup players Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert have already arrived. So has 20-year-old defensive midfield player Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen. Even bigger fish are set to follow. Benfica winger Lazar Markovic is due for a medical on Thursday before completing his £20million move from Portugal. Belgium’s World Cup striker Divock Origi is in advance talks. A left back, possibly Swansea City’s Ben Davies, is needed. Dejan Lovren wants to join from Southampton. The average age of the new squad will be among the youngest in the Premier League which perfectly fits the profile demanded by owner John W Henry. There will be some familiar faces. Steven Gerrard will continue as captain albeit Rodgers will not play him every week so he lasts the season. Lucas, Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson will have parts to play. But overall as the washing powder commercials go, this Liverpool will be new and improved – even without Barcelona-bound Suarez. At least that is what Rodgers is counting on. Lazar quest: Benfica forward Markovic is expected to join Liverpool in a £20million deal . VIDEO Liverpool set to seal double signing . ‘NEW AND IMPROVED’... HOW LIVERPOOL COULD LINE UP 2014-15 . GOALKEEPER – SIMON MIGNOLET . Made an immediate impact at Anfield last season with a match-winning penalty save on his debut against Stoke City. Now 26, he should be coming into his prime as a goalkeeper. RIGHT BACK – JON FLANAGAN . Just 21, local boy Flanagan has filled in across the defence to help the team but this could be his breakthrough season in his favoured position with Glen Johnson showing the first signs of decline. CENTRE BACK – DEJAN LOVREN . The Croatian World Cup defender has made it no secret he’d like to join the Rodgers revolution at Anfield from Southampton. But a fee still has to be agreed with the St Mary’s club. Shoring up: Southampton's Dejan Lovren was one of the outstanding defenders in the top flight last season . CENTRE BACK – MAMADOU SAKHO . Uncomfortable first season but excelled in the World Cup for France – where he was picked ahead of Arsenal’s Laurent Koscielny – and now ready to show The Kop what £17m was spent on. LEFT BACK – BEN DAVIES . Rodgers has been searching for a left back ever since he arrived at the club. Liverpool have been linked with plenty but £6m Davies would be right up their street if Swansea sell. CENTRAL MIDFIELD – EMRE CAN . The German has just signed in a £10m deal from Bayer Levekusen and doesn’t lack confidence – agreeing to wear the No 23 shirt made famous by Jamie Carragher. Just 20, he is improving each year. Yes we Can: Liverpool have already signed Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen for £10m this summer . CENTRAL MIDFIELD – STEVE GERRARD/PHILIPPE COUTINHO . Rodgers knows Gerrard can’t play every week as he did last season, particularly with the club also back in Europe. When he wants to go for it, the excellent Coutinho can provide genuine trickery, with Can dropping back in to Gerrard's deeper role. CENTRAL MIDFIELD – ADAM LALLANA . Liverpool’s most expensive signing of the summer so far at around £25m, Lallana’s ability to keep the ball moving and pick a pass means he will be essential to Rodgers’ plans. RIGHT WING – RAHEEM STERLING . One of the few England players to return from the World Cup in credit. Hard to believe he’s still only 19, the ultimate modern forward with pace, technique and courage on and off the ball. Sterling work: The England winger was a standout performer for the Reds last season . CENTRE FORWARD – DANIEL STURRIDGE . 35 goals in 49 games for Liverpool is an astonishing return for a player who didn’t make it at Manchester City or Chelsea. Sturridge will be desperate to show he can score goals without Suarez. LEFT WING - LAZAR MARKOVIC . The 20-year-old Serbian is rated one of the best young talents in Europe and Rodgers hopes his signing from Benfica will give Liverpool a genuine threat down both flanks. Striking it rich: Sturridge (left) finished as the top flight's second highest goal scorer behind Suarez last season . SUBSTITUTES . MICHEL VORM – Rodgers wants cover for Mignolet in goal and Swansea’s Dutchman Vorm is his No 1 target. GLEN JOHNSON – Not the force he once was but in a youthful squad, Johnson’s experience will be vital in Europe. MARTN SKRTEL - Found it hard to adapt to the passing style being imposed by Rodgers, but he decided to stay at Anfield and was one of their most consistent performers last season. JOE ALLEN – Rodgers’ first signing, for £15m from Swansea, the Welshman is among the most accurate passers in the Premier League and a growing influence on the pitch. Case for the defence: Johnson (left) and Skrtel (right) will still have a role to play next season . JORDAN HENDERSON – One of few Kenny Dalglish signings to survive and thrive under Rodgers. Possesses a fantastic midfield engine and is versatile. RICKIE LAMBERT – The Liverpudlian had a roundabout route to Anfield via Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton but he’s happy to be back ‘home’ after a £4m summer move from Southampton. DIVOCK ORIGI – One of the new stars to emerge from the World Cup, Origi’s pace and trickery make him a natural replacement for Sturridge if the England man ever needs a rest. Options: Origi (left) and Lambert (right) would allow Rodgers to mix it up up front . VIDEO Liverpool confirm Lambert deal .","Luis Suarez set to leave Liverpool for Barcelona this summer .

"By . Deni Kirkova . He's probably just as famous for his luscious flowing hair as he is for his football but now Robbie Savage has chopped off his ponytail in favour of a smooth, short back and sides style. The footballer, 40, claims he decided on the change after arriving at . the airport ahead of the World Cup with his wife's passport - because . they both shared the same hairstyle in their pictures. The Strictly Come Dancing star also admits he wants to 'grow old gracefully' with his new modern haircut - and his hairdresser reveals how the pair decided to change his hair. Scroll down for video . Robbie on Strictly Come Dancing sporting his long hair, and right, after his brand new haircut . The former Manchester United and Leicester midfielder was famed for his flowing blonde locks, but there's no denying his new style makes him look miles better and perhaps a tad younger. Many women deicde to go for the chop around 46 in favour of 'a more mature style' according to new research, and it seems Robbie's decided to do the same now he's approaching his 40s. He bravely posted an image on his Twitter account showing off the results. Speaking to The Mirror, Savage said: 'I turn 40 in October, and although age is only a number, there comes a time when you have to grow old gracefully. 'I’ve left the 1980s and 1990s behind, and finally I’ve caught up with the modern world - and I feel liberated. It’s literally a big weight off my shoulders!' Robbie Savage looks nervous as he sits in the barber's chair at friend Howard Yuill's salon . Femail caught up with Robbie's hairdresser Howard Yuill, who has a salon in Altrincham, and discussed the hair change. 'I've been cutting Robbie's hair for a little while now and we'd been talking for some time in regards to changing it,' he said. 'I do a lot of Man City players [hair], cyclists, cricket celebrities and other sporting people because of the area that the salon is in... 'The day Robbie got the chop was a big day for him. He's so well known for his hair and that particular style, being so long and so blonde - it's not something that he took lightly. 'It was more Robbie's decision to go for it. We had a few consultations of which way to go and how short to go. UTV posted this long forgotten picture of Savage before he grew his famous long hair . 'My job is to make people look good so the challenge was to come up with something that would suit his face shape. He has a love of fashion as well as hair. The quiff and the 1950s pompadour styles now are really big these days, so we used that influence but kept his hair sharp as well as it being able to mess about... with that style you can dress it up and scruff it up as well. 'He was nervous but a good client to have in the chair. I think he's getting to that age now where he's looking for a change, but at the same time you don't want to lose your identity. I'm 47 and the one thing I've realised is as you get older you should do what you feel. 'Robbie's hair had been the same for a while... no-one's really wearing that shape any more, almost a bob style. I was telling him at the end of the day that hair was passé - I was reinfocring what he wanted to do. 'We are going to be tweaking it and changing it... we didn't want to do too much at once because he was attached to it for so long. Not everyone likes change.' Robbie's hair had been the same for a while, pictured mid-00s. He's now gone for a modern change . Celebrity and runway stylist, Matthew Curtis, whose clients include Cheryl Cole and Dita Von Teese: . 'In some cases, getting the chop on long hair can help men look younger because generally, going for a tighter style on the sides slims down the face and accentuates the jaw line, giving a more handsome look. 'I don't necessarily think there's a definitive age men should go for a chop; it's all down to suitability taking into consideration factors such as face shape, weight and quality of hair. For example if the hair is ageing, thinning and generally in bad condition then it makes sense to go for a style that gives the impression of  thicker hair. A great way to make the hair appear denser is to go for a shorter style just as Robbie has.'

"By . Sarah Dean . Prince Harry has photobombed New Zealand Commonwealth Games officials in Glasgow - and they were so chuffed one of them made it their profile picture on Facebook. The Prince gave a cheeky thumbs up in the background of a selfie taken by New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens, Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer and Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson . The three men in the their black and white New Zealand team kits leaned in with their arms around each other as the Royal popped up in the background in a white shirt. They were watching the 800m women's swimming freestyle in Glasgow on Monday night, which saw Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin win gold. Scroll down for video .

The Queen photobombed a selfie taken by two players from the Australian women's hockey team on the first day of the Commonwealth Games . Special moment: Shailer posted the photo as his profile picture on Facebook, he was inundated with comments from friends . The royal seemed thrilled to be introduced to the triumphant athletes at the Glasgow National Hockey centre, and posed for photographs with the Aussie team, nicknamed the Hockeyroos. Despite England's loss, Harry, 29, seemed in a jovial mood and smiled as he mingled with the players, who are favourites to win gold in the games, having taken the top spot in Delhi in 2010 and Melbourne in 2006. Royal welcome: Members of the Australian hockey team - or the Hockeyroos - smile as Harry seems to crack a joke after their victory in Glasgow . Posed up: Members of the team, which beat England 3-0 today and are favourites to take home a gold medal for their performance . After shaking hands with the winning players, Harry went on to pose for photographs with his arms around them. The Prince, presumably in a gracious mood, also commiserated with the England team. Jodie Kenny and Emily Smith, who between them scored their teams' goals, looked particularly thrilled in the aftermath of their victory. The team took the royal visit as further proof of their world domination, later tweeting: 'Prince Harry is on board the #roovolution as meets @Anna_Flanagan and the girls after today's win over England' Giving some tips? The Australian team took home a gold medal at the games in Delhi in 2010 and Melbourne in 2006 . Laughing along: Prince William, left, was also in the frame today meeting the players after their game against England . Happy days: The two princes smiled in the sunshine today as they shook hands and posed with players from both teams . The game means Australia is safely through to the last four, securing the top place finish in Pool B with four wins from four and a goal record of 25 scored and 0 conceded. England began brightly as birthday girl Susannah Townsend found Ellie Watton and tried to attack the goal, but were blocked by Australian keeper Rachael Lynch. Two quick scores, however, had England on the back foot as first Kenny converted from a penalty corner on 17 minutes, before Smith capitalised on a mistake from captain Kate Richardson-Walsh shortly afterwards. Maddie Hinch in the England goal was forced to save two shots from Kenny before the break, while Lily Owsley fired a shot just wide of the mark. A green card for Laura Unsworth proved costly 13 minutes into the second half as shortly after she left the field, Kenny slotted home from another short corner. England kept pressing and earned two penalty corners of their own but on both occasions they couldn’t find the target – Sam Quek seeing an effort deflected behind. Georgie Twigg also made her return for England after missing their last game against Malaysia through the injury she sustained in the opening game. After the match, England coach Danny Kerry said: 'Australia were better than us defensively and offensively in both circles but I actually felt for large periods of the game we were playing the more constructive hockey. 'The reality is that we need to be much tougher in both circles and their corner execution was superior to ours today.' Group shot! Harry later posed with the England team, who were soundly defeated by their antipodean rivals . Undeterred: Harry looked pleased with his company today after the hockey game, which was part of a busy day in which he also watched boxing and gymnastics .","The royal, 29, photobombed a selfie between New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens, Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer and Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson .

Cars are left teetering on the brink while other vehicles are washed away in a mountain mudslide in Japan . An evacuation advisory has now been issued to 550,000 people in the Kochi, Tokushima and Ehime regions. Devastation has struck across parts of south and eastern Asia in the last few days, with 410 killed in a devastating earthquake in China, while a landslide in Nepal has claimed the lives of at 19 people with more than 150 still missing. Rescue workers were forced to urgently evacuate tens of thousands of people in eastern India following the deadly landslide in neighbouring Nepal which blocked a river that could burst its banks and submerge scores of Indian villages. Authorities in Nepal said there was no hope that more than 150 missing people are still alive after being buried by piles of rocks, mud and upturned trees in Saturday's landslide in Mankha, about 75 miles east of Katmandu. Nineteen others are confirmed dead. But as disaster workers continued to clear the debris yesterday, the danger area moved downstream to eastern India, where 125,000 people are in peril. The landslide blocked a mountain river in Nepal, causing it to back up and form a massive lake that was threatening to overflow and flood the Indian villages. Guests at the YMCA Anan Kokusai Kaiyo Center were left trapped after the hostel's car park collapsed in the landslide . 'We are keeping our fingers crossed right now,' said Aniruddh Kumar, a senior disaster management official in India's Bihar state. He said it was not clear how much water might come down from the lake. The annual monsoon season, which runs from June through September, is vital for the largely agrarian economies of South Asia but every year also brings floods and landslides that kill thousands and submerge hundreds of villages. Another landslide hit in a village in eastern Nepal yesterday, killing four people and leaving six others missing. And the death toll from a massive landslide in western India last week rose to 108, according to rescue official Sandeep Rai Rathore. Meanwhile, some 10,000 troops used pickaxes and backhoes to clear roads and dig residents from collapsed homes today following an earthquake in southwest China that killed 410 people. Volunteer Jackson Zeng joined about two dozen classmates who headed to Yunnan province's Ludian county, where Sunday's 6.1-magnitude earthquake collapsed thousands of homes in an impoverished region of mountainous farmland. 'I grew up around here and these are my people. I'm not sure what I can do, but I will help any way that I can,' said Zeng, a third-year student at Kunming University of Science and Technology.

Zeng's black T-shirt contrasted with the scores of green fatigue-clad troops along the main road into the quake zone. Paramilitary personnel with a backhoe and other heavy equipment pushed earth from a stretch of road affected by a landslide while Zeng and other students used their hands to push rocks over a cliff. Many hundreds of volunteers have converged on the nearby city of Zhaotong en-route to the quake-hit areas - a typical phenomenon during disasters in China. Many came empty-handed but some were formed into company-sponsored units complete with uniforms and their own relief aid to distribute. The government also has sent thousands of tents, quilts, sleeping bags and cotton coats to the region, as well as folding beds, chairs and tables, and mobile toilets. The quake struck an area of steep hills and narrow roads not suited to all the traffic of the massive relief effort and heavy rain today added to the complications. Much of the damage was due to landslides.

The Yunnan Civil Affairs Bureau said that 410 people had been killed and 2,373 injured, with 12 people still missing about 48 hours after the quake. Rescuers pulled dozens of trapped people from the debris in the first couple of days. A five-year-old boy was dug from a collapsed home on Monday and state media today released a photo taken in a hospital of two pregnant women who comforted each other while trapped in the rubble before they, too, were rescued. Many of the homes in Ludian, which has a population of about 429,000, were rudimentary mud-brick structures that collapsed easily in the quake. Further from the worst-hit areas, landslides created barrier lakes where water levels were rising to pose a new threat to about 800 residents and seven power stations downstream, where sudden flooding could prompt power cuts, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.","One person confirmed dead and 550,000 people have been told to evacuate .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Dire forecast: Rising property prices will kill off the middle classes within 30 years and create a vast 'impoverished' proletariat, David Boyle has warned . Rising property prices will kill off the middle classes within 30 years and create a vast ‘impoverished’ proletariat, a government adviser has warned. David Boyle, who is also a fellow of the New Economics Foundation think-tank, said home ownership will be beyond the means of many of today’s children, leaving them at the mercy of rising rents. He predicted that by 2045, the average house price will reach £1.2million, meaning only the very rich will be able to  afford a property. It would leave Britain with a ‘tiny elite and a huge sprawling proletariat’ who have no chance of ‘clawing their way out of a hand-to-mouth existence’, he said. Speaking at the Hay literary festival in Wales, Mr Boyle said that the time of Britain being a nation of home owners was heading into decline. He said the traditional middle classes would need three or four jobs just to be able to pay soaring rents. And while in the past the middle classes have been characterised by their love of culture to foster self-improvement, their new harsh lives will leave little time to pursue these interests. ‘The really scary thing is if in the next 30 years house prices rise as much as they have done in the last 30 years, then the average house in Britain will cost £1.2million,’ he said. ‘We cheerled the rise of property prices not realising that it would destroy if not our own lives, but the lives of our children. ‘The place where this is heading is a strange society with a tiny elite and a long struggling, straggling line which is the rest of us, a new  proletariat, who will be in hock to Landlord PLC. ‘We won’t own our own homes, we won’t be able to afford it. ‘It will constrain our dreams and constrain the dreams of our children. It’s a new kind of economy where there are no middle classes at all. Out of reach: Mr Boyle, who is also a fellow of the New Economics Foundation think-tank, said home ownership will be beyond the means of many of today's children, leaving them at the mercy of rising rents (file picture) ‘Nobody in society will have the kind of space in their lives, space in their homes, space in their careers for any kind of culture at all, because we will have three or four jobs to make ends meet. ‘I think it will impoverish society, make it more intolerant and make it more difficult to live.’ Mr Boyle was a member of the Liberal Democrats’ federal policy committee and was commissioned to write a report into access to public services by the Government, which was published last year. Criticised: Mr Boyle also attacked Margaret Thatcher for abandoning the Supplementary Special Deposit Scheme, which set banks' mortgage boundaries . Yesterday he attacked Margaret Thatcher for abandoning the Supplementary Special Deposit Scheme, which set boundaries on how much banks could lend for mortgages. But he admitted that although the mechanism kept house prices low in the 1970s, it was unlikely that today’s buyers would accept having to wait for a long time to get a mortgage. Instead, he said a radical solution is needed whereby new homes are sold at their initial price for 100 years. Mr Boyle added that the dissatisfaction of the middle classes was already showing, and had led to a rise in popularity for parties such as Ukip. ‘You saw this huge revolt. I think what happens when you suppress the dreams of the middle classes is you get rather peculiar and very dangerous political movements beginning to emerge,’ he argued. ‘That doesn’t forgive people voting in the neo-fascists but it does somehow explain it. ‘Very unequal societies are very inflationary societies and in the end it drives out those other degrees in society until it becomes very flat and very desperate. ‘The middle classes have to wake up to prevent it happening and to create a political movement that will do it. I don’t think Ukip is it. ‘You could say that it doesn’t matter and that a more classless society would be a good thing. ‘I think if there is no place in the middle where anyone can go to claw their way out of a desperate hand-to-mouth existence then that condemns us all to a precarious existence, because there is no ladder.’","David Boyle said rising house prices will kill off middle class within 30 years .

"By . Jamie Milligan . Jamie and Shelly Scobbie, pictured with their boys Connor, Callum, Cameron and Findley, who had moved to Australia to start a new life . A mother of four who emigrated from Scotland with her family to start a new life in Australia  has been killed in a car crash. Shelly Scobbie died in a head-on collision with a Toyota Landcruiser 4x4, which left three of her  four children trapped in the wreckage of her vehicle. The 31-year-old’s Glasgow-born husband, Jamie, witnessed the tragedy from  the vehicle in which he was travelling ahead of them. The three youngsters with Mrs Scobbie – who was originally from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire – were  rescued from their Hyundai Lantra by emergency workers. However, their mother died at the scene in the Henley Brook area of Perth, Western Australia, the city to which the family moved earlier this year. The children were taken to hospital, where one had to undergo an operation on his leg, following the accident on Saturday morning. They were said to be making a good recovery. Distraught widower Mr Scobbie now faces bringing up the boys – Connor, Callum, Cameron and Findley – alone. He has spoken of his heartbreak and paid an emotional tribute to his wife who he refers to as his ‘angel’. In a post on Facebook, Mr Scobbie said: ‘Thank you all for your kind words, thoughts, wishes and prayers. I will take strength from them all at this hard time. My angel will never leave mine and my boys’ hearts. ‘I know she is with us and will live on through the beautiful children she gave me as well as the happy memories that still remain. ‘Rest In Peace my darling, you touched the lives of so many.

"By . Anna Edwards . Former Met police officer Ian Scouler, could face jail again after he admitted stealing a suspect's phone . A shamed police officer who stole cash during a house search is facing a return to prison for taking a suspect's iPhone. Former PC Ian Scouler was jailed for 12 months last November after being secretly filmed pocketing £400 while on duty in 2011. But Scouler was back in court today to admit stealing a suspect's iPhone and another handset while employed by the Metropolitan Police. The former cop - who walked into Westminster Magistrates Court after being released from his prison sentence - was warned he now faces a swift return to jail. He pocketed an iPhone after it was seized during the search of a suspect's home on October 28, 2010. 'At the time this theft occurred, Mr Scouler was a serving police officer with the Met,' said prosecutor Emma Scheer. 'When officers went to restore the property to its owner, they found some of the items were missing. 'The iPhone was found to have been sold by Scouler shortly after the date of the search.' Scouler had set up an account under his own name at website fonebank.com to sell on the stolen handset. He admitted selling the phone but initially tried to pin the blame on one of his fellow officers. 'He said he didn't in fact take the iPhone but it was given to him by a colleague and had no idea that phone was stolen', said Ms Scheer. Investigators also discovered he had stolen another phone in May 2010 which had been handed in to police. He again sold it online, but was 'very vague' when investigators asked where he had got it from, the court heard. Scouler's career was destroyed when a jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of theft following a trial. He . was caught taking money in a sting operation set up following . allegations of thefts by officers from Greenwich Borough's Disruption . unit during searches. Scouler . was filmed removing the cash from a leather jacket left in a flat in . New Eltham, south east London, and putting it into his pocket. He was also taped joking 'It's not divisible by three' when a colleague found 200 Euros. Westminster Magistrates Court heard that the former officer had previously stolen £400 and was found to have taken an iPhone . Scouler and colleagues were filmed browsing pornography and playing music while they were supposed to be searching the flat, which had been wired with hidden recording devices. He later claimed to have forgotten about the money which he took home, but a jury convicted him of theft. Judge Michael Gledhill QC branded Scouler a 'rogue officer' when sentencing him to 12 months in prison. 'The trust that society places in their police officers is vitally important to everyone', he said. 'When that trust is broken by rogue officers, as you became, public confidence is eroded, it makes the job of honest officers far more difficult, and it seriously undermines society.' Ms Scheer said Scouler's theft of the phones only came to light in September last year, when the victim asked police for his seized possessions back. She said it was only after he was jailed for stealing the money that he owned up to his other crimes. 'It appears that only after having been convicted of the maters at crown court that he subsequently admitted he was guilty in relation to these matters', she said. District Judge Nicholas Evans freed Scouler on unconditional bail until a sentencing hearing on March 28. 'I have indicated that the court has custody in mind', he added. Scouler, of Borough Green, Kent, pleaded guilty to two counts of theft.","Former PC Ian Scouler was caught taking £400 in a sting operation in 2011 .

"By . Anna Edwards . and David Wilkes . Their lighthouse home on the tiny island occupies one of the most ruggedly beautiful spots in Britain. There, cut off from the outside world, Giselle Eagle and her boyfriend Richard Brown will live with more than 100,000 birds for company. Their electricity supply will be intermittent and communication with the mainland dependent on the whims of the weather as they are relying on solar power. Giselle Eagle and Richard Brown were chosen by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales from hundreds of applicants for the job of wardens . Mr Brown has lived on small islands off the Welsh coast for the past seven years and was was studying at the University of East Anglia when he met RSPB volunteer Miss Eagle . The couple successfully applied to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales for the job of wardens on Skokholm Island, 2.5 miles off the tip of Pembrokeshire and as such will be its only full-time residents. Their days will be spent counting the internationally important colony of seabirds that nest there. Some of them, such as Manx shearwaters and storm petrels, could fill the pair’s nights too with what Mr Brown, 32, calls ‘ghostly howls and shrieks’. But to he and Miss Eagle, 27, the castaway life is their idea of 'paradise'. Miss Eagle said: 'Skokholm will be paradise for us - we love the joys of island life and wouldn't have it any other way. 'We're both very passionate about wildlife, particularly seabirds and island ecology. 'We love being surrounded by thousands of storm petrels, Manx Shearwaters and puffins all to the backdrop of Skokholm's beautiful red sandstone cliffs.' Mr Brown and Miss Eagle were chosen by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales from hundreds of applicants for the job of wardens. Mr Brown said: 'We were picked because of our experience of living in remote locations. 'We couldn't be happier just sharing our lives with birds and wildlife.' Skokholm Island, where the couple will continue renovations including repairs to the UK's first purpose-built seabird observatory on the island . The couple will be wardens of the tiny island, and will have only the birds for company in their remote home . The couple met on an reserve three years ago while Giselle was trying to track down a lost colony of migrating terns . What a view! Mr Brown said: 'We couldn't be happier just sharing our lives with birds and wildlife' Skokholm Island Locator.jpg . Mr Brown, originally from Northallerton in North Yorkshire, has lived on small islands off the Welsh coast for the past seven years. He was studying at the University of East Anglia when he met RSPB volunteer Miss Eagle of Great Yarmouth. They met on an reserve three years ago while Miss Eagle was trying to track down a lost colony of migrating terns. The couple later moved to Bardsey Island - almost two miles out in the Irish Sea off the coast of North Wales - where they lived beneath a lighthouse. Now they have moved to Skokholm where they will continue renovations including repairs to the UK's first purpose-built seabird observatory on the island. Miss Eagle said: 'When we first met I'd never been on an island before - it'd never entered my head that I'd end up living on one. I've always loved wildlife. 'But now I'm hooked on both island life and Richard, he's my boyfriend and I'm glad to share his way of life with him.' Puffins roam the island, which his home to many birds . Skokholm is Norse for 'Wooded Island'. It's name bears a striking similarity to the Swedish capital Stockholm, named by the Vikings who visited the Bristol Channel. An undated charter shows William Marshal the Younger, Earl of Pembroke 1219-31, granting Gilbert de Vale land in Ireland in exchange for land in Pembrokeshire, including the 'Scoghholm' island. Skokholm last changed hands in 1646, when it was bought for £300 by one of the founders of the Dale Castle Estate, William Philipps. The family estate owned it until 2005, when they offered it up for sale. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales was given the first refusal to buy, and after a huge hundraising drive, raised £650,000 ad bought it. The remote island is of huge importance as it is home for thousands of birds and has a slew of designations given to it. Skokholm is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, part of the Skomer and Skokholm Special Protection Area, part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, falls within the Marine Nature Reserve and is a part of the Pembrokeshire Islands Special Area of Conservation. The island is also home to 4500 Puffins and around a 2000 Razorbills and Guillemots breed on its cliffs. The two islands populations of Manx shearwaters is probably the third largest in the world, containing some 5o percent of the world population. Grey seals are present in the waters around the island throughout the year, and seen basking on rocks at low water daily. The island is probably the most intensively studied ever, with much of the work being carried out in the 1950s, and made famous by the books of pioneer naturalist and former island tenant Ronald Lockley, the founder of the West Wales Naturalist Trust, which was the forerunner of the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales today.Source: The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales .","Couple head to Skokholm Island to be wardens of the isolated wildlife colony .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . This summer's Commonwealth Games saw a number of rising young stars step up to the plate to achieve success in front of a British crowd. One of them was sprinter Jodie Williams, 20, who a won silver medal in the 200m and a bronze in the 4 x 100m relay. As a former World Junior champion, Welwyn Garden City born Jodie has been well-known in athletic circles for years. But it's her performance in Glasgow that has put her on the map. Scroll down for video . Success: Jodie won silver in the 200m at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, as well as bronze as part of England's 4x100m relay team . Toned: Jodie said anyone can get super abs like hers with the right diet and exercise . Now she's in demand with the media and, making time for the MailOnline, she said it's her abs as well as her medals that have been gathering attention. She welcomes the interest as she thinks it's great more people are aspiring to be fit rather than thin. She said: 'People are now always asking me about my . figure and how I get my abs which shows people are striving for a healthy look rather than . just trying to be skinny.' When it comes to those amazing abs, she said it's not just about exercise but eating well by following a healthy, protein-rich diet. Great atmosphere: Jodie, right, pictured here with teammate Bianca Williams, left, said she loved competing in front of a British crowd in Glasgow . Role model: Jodie said she has often felt self-conscious about having a muscular physique but wants to show other girls it's better to be fit than thin . Breakfast: Porridge with a protein . shake in it and added berries. Mid morning: An amino acid . shake . Lunch: Prawn stirfry . Dinner: Steak with potatoes and vegetables . She said: 'A lot of people think you can get abs . just through sit ups but it's more about diet. 'Everyone has abs so once you get down to a lower level of body fat they . will start to show. To make them look better you can then do sit ups.' Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill admitted she used to suffer from some name calling over her athletic build when she was growing up. Jodie said she has been lucky to have never experienced any similar bullying. But even though her Hertfordshire school and local running club, Herts Phoenix, were fully supportive of her athletic talent -  she admits it can be difficult growing as a sporty girl. She explains: 'It's hard doing sport from the age of 12 . upwards if all your friends have stopped doing it. I was determined so I . managed to keep it going but a lot of my friends stopped doing sport. It's hard when you are doing something on your own.' She added that she often felt self-conscious about having a muscular physique - but took inspiration from role models in athletics like U.S. sprinter Allyson Felix. Inspiration: Jodie, celebrating her success in Glasgow, right, says she's always looked up to Allyson Felix of USA, left, as she's proved women can be feminine and elegant as well as strong and athletic . Young talent: Jodie has been running since childhood as a member of Herts Phoenix Athletic Club . 'Often young girls don't want to get into sport so I think it's important they have strong role models to inspire them. I've . always looked up to Allyson Felix,' she said. 'She always looks so graceful on the . track, she has a really elegant running style. She also looks so . feminine. I think that was something I was conscious of growing up in . sport - you don't want to look too manly.' Now in turn, she hopes she can inspire other young girls by showing them that a fit physique is much better than a skinny one and that you can be feminine as well as strong. She added that it helps that the 'sporty look' has become for fashionable since London 2012. Not just with people trying to tone up but with sports brands developing more stylish kit. 'I wear Adidas Boost trainers casually . as well as when training because they're in bright, trendy colours,' she said. 'Sports clothing . has also become more fashionable with bright, patterned designs. It helps because it makes you want to put on the kit and work out.' When she's not in her sports gear doing running sessions and weight training, Jodie describes her style as 'edgy' and she's mostly likely to be found browsing the rails of Urban Outfitters. Jodie joined her local running club at a young age and she hopes the Commonwealth Games, and forthcoming European Champs, will encourage others - both young and old - to do the same. Aside from joining a local club or gym to keep fit, she recommends finding 'community walking or cycling routes in your area'. She added: 'Even if you don't want to go the gym, . there are workouts you can do at home without any equipment like squats . and lunges. Instead of buying weights you can just use a bag of sugar.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A website has been ordered to remove a claim that the MMR jab could cause autism in children by the Advertising Standards Agency. The children’s immunisation service, babyjabs.co.uk, claimed experts believe the vaccine 'could be causing autism in up to 10% of . autistic children in the UK'. It also said: 'Most experts now agree that the . large rise (in autism) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis, but . also by a real increase in the number of children with autism.' The babyjabs website says it enables parents to make an 'informed choice' about child vaccinations . It added that parental fears the jab caused autism . were 'supported' by the fact that the the vaccine strain measles had . been found in the guts and brains of some autistic children. However, the ASA said both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MMR and autism. The ASA ruled: 'Consumers were likely to infer from the claim, that the ‘real increase in the number of children with autism’ was not just down to increased diagnosis, but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase.' They added: 'Because we had not seen supporting evidence that that was the case, and understood that that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion, we concluded that the claim was misleading.' BabyJabs Ltd denied a breach citing previous scientific research which had concluded: 'We cannot rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated'. But the ASA said: 'The Cochrane review, looking at the general evidence available, could find no significant association between MMR immunisation and autism. 'We noted that the evidence provided by the advertiser included studies and an article which looked at the increased prevalence of autism, but did not include evidence that any increase was due to the MMR vaccine.' They added: 'We considered that consumers would understand from the (advert) that the MMR vaccine was likely to have caused autism in up to 10% of autistic children in the UK, namely between 300 and 400 children a year. 'We noted we had not seen any evidence, such as a clinical trial or study, which actively showed that the MMR vaccine was likely to cause autism in between 300 and 400 children a year. 'Because we did not consider that we had seen sufficient evidence to support the claim we concluded it was misleading.'",The World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MMR and autism .

"By . James Rush . Two Crown Prosecution Service employees have admitted making more than £1 million worth of bogus claims for taxi fares. Finance manager Lisa Burrows and officer worker Tahir Mahmood were warned to expect 'inevitable' jail terms after pleading guilty to fraud by abuse of position at Birmingham Crown Court. Burrows, 41, of Oldbury, West Midlands, and Mahmood, 50, from Hodge Hill, Birmingham, are believed to have used the proceeds of the five-year scam to pay off a mortgage and fund trips to Dubai. Jailed: Burrows and Mahmood were given six-year jail sentences as Birmingham Crown Court, pictured . The pair, who will be sentenced in July, showed no obvious sign of emotion as they admitted conning the CPS out of £1,021,475 by producing invoices for a fictitious cab firm purporting to cater for witnesses. Prosecutor Brian Dean told the court that investigators were still attempting to trace the proceeds of the fraud. Asking Judge Nicholas Webb for the case to be adjourned until July 4, the barrister said ongoing inquiries into international bank accounts were being made by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Mr Dean added: 'There is not, at the moment, any explanation for where the money has gone. 'A financial analyst is considering all the information so that a sentencing judge can be given a very clear idea of precisely what has happened to the money.' It was possible, Mr Dean said, that Mahmood had used £120,000 to clear a mortgage, while Burrows was thought to have visited Dubai on many occasions. 'These things need to be run to ground so that the sentencing judge has a full and accurate picture of the precise nature of the spending and the whereabouts of the money,' Mr Dean said. Burrows and Mahmood were charged last month after an investigation by police acting on a complaint from the CPS. The pair admitted making more than £1 million worth of bogus claims for taxi fares (file picture) Mahmood, thought to be a former taxi driver, worked for the CPS as an administrative assistant. An earlier hearing at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court was informed that he opened bank accounts using a different surname to facilitate the fraud. The hearing at the lower court also heard that inquiries into Burrows’ finances found evidence of expensive purchases of designer clothes, jewellery and holidays. At the time of the previous hearing on February 28, no more than £1,400 had been found in accounts connected to Mahmood, who claimed no funds were left from the extensive fraud. The CPS colleagues, both of previous good character, were remanded in custody pending the preparation of pre-sentence reports. Judge Webb told them: 'You have both pleaded guilty to what is a serious offence and both of you recognise that the court will impose a custodial sentence when you come back to be sentenced.'","Lisa Burrows and Tahir Mahmood warned to expect 'inevitable' jail terms .

"By . Leon Watson . A U.S. diplomat's husband has been stabbed to death in the Philippines after intervening in a row outside the exclusive residential compound where he lived. Major George Anikow, a 41-year-old inactive U.S. Marine, was attacked as he walked into the development in an upmarket district of Makati City, part of Metro Manila, early on Saturday morning. Police said three businessmen and one student were charged today with killing the father-of-three, who had served as a civil officer in Afghanistan before being posted to the Philippines. Major George Anikow (right), and inactive Marine, was stabbed to death in Manila at the weekend. Here he is pictured earlier this month in uniform at a ball with his wife Laura, a U.S. diplomat, and Jacob one of his three children . Mr Anikow had got involved in a row as he approached the development. He saw security guards at its gates checking the identification of four men, who were inside a luxury Volvo, NDTV.com reported. The men were refused entry because they did not have a pass for the compound, triggering an argument and a brawl, city police chief Senior Superintendent Manuel Lukban said. 'The men were about to leave when he rapped their vehicle. The suspects then got off the vehicle, and mauled and stabbed him to the back and shoulder,' Lukban told reporters. He said the American, whose wife Laura is a staff member at the U.S. embassy, died in hospital. The assailants tried to escape but nearby police, alerted by the security guards, caught them, Lukban said. A blood-stained military-style knife was recovered from them, he said. Stabbed:  U.S. Marine Major George Anikow (left) served as a civil officer in Afghanistan's Helmand Province in 2009 before moving to the Philippines, where he was killed at the weekend . (File picture) The attack happened in Makati City, an exclusive district of Manila, capital of the Philippines . All the suspects - three businessmen . and a university student - were in their 20s, according to Lukban, who . said they had all been charged with murder. The U.S. embassy in Manila confirmed the incident in Makita City's exclusive Bel-Air Village subdivision in a short statement,  NDTV.com reported. The killing is the first of a foreign diplomat's family member in the Philippines since the famous Hultman-Chapman case. Claudio Teehankee Jr, son of the late chief justice Claudio Teehankee, was convicted of murdering two people, one of them the son of a U.S. Embassy employee, inside Dasmariñas subdivision also in Makati. Teehankee Jr served 17 years in jail and was granted a presidential pardon in 2008. The latest Crime and Security Report . issued by the Regional Security Office of the U.S. Embassy says that . crime is a significant concern in urban areas of the Philippines. Typical criminal acts include pick pocketing, confidence schemes, acquaintance scams, and, in some cases, credit card fraud. It also says that carjacking, . kidnappings, robberies, and violent assaults sporadically occur . throughout metro Manila and elsewhere in the Philippines. In June, The Manila Times reported that Metro Manila remains the country’s crime capital with nearly 13,000 criminal incidents recorded during the first four months of the year. Police figures reveal that from January to end of April, the index crime volume recorded by the police throughout the country reached 45,028. Of this number, 12,952 cases occurred in Metro Manila. 'The embassy condemns the violent . attack. The victim was the beloved spouse of a US embassy staff member . and a father of three,' embassy spokeswoman Tina Malone said in a . statement without releasing his name or further details. Foreign . Affairs Department spokesman Raul Hernandez said the killing appeared . to be an 'isolated incident' and not targeted at anyone in particular. Following news of his death, friends of Mr Anikow have begun posting messages of condolence on the Facebook page for the 4th Civil Affairs Group, the Marine corps he served in. As . part of this group, Mr Anikow was trained in 'Tactical Conflict . Assessment Planning and Framework,' a technique that was designed to . assist Marines foster relationships with local populations. Mr Anikow is believed to have been a first tour officer on a consular assignment to the embassy in Manila. Public records indicate that the embassy had solicited a quotation for a service apartment - believed to refer to temporary accommodation -  for Mrs Anikow and her family. The request included her spouse and their three children aged 12, 10 and six, and a 50lb Labrador, for 40 nights ending on September 24. It is believed the family then moved to the Bel-Air apartment. In Afghanistan, Mr Anikow was a Civil Affairs detachment executive officer deployed with Regimental Combat Team 3. He was pictured in 2009 joking with local children during a patrol in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. His mission was to interact with the local population in order to understand their concerns and identify possible reconstruction and development projects.","Four men charged over murder of father-of-three George Anikow, 41 .

The world's largest social network is constantly tweaking its newsfeed - the main page users look at on the network - often by reducing clutter, especially from advertising, and bringing to the surface or revealing the posts deemed most relevant to any particular user. Facebook began rolling out the ‘Unfollow’ button and a related change to its users on Monday. It added a ‘Following’ button next to the usual ‘Like’ button on a page or next to the ‘Friends’ button on a personal timeline, which will also enable users to block posts.

"By . Rachel Quigley . and Daily Mail Reporter . Sleeping pills: Last week Kerry Kennedy blamed a July 11 car accident on a seizure but now blood tests show she was on the sleeping pill, Ambien . Kerry Kennedy pleaded not guilty in court tonight and blamed Friday’s car accident, where she careered into a truck and was later found slumped over the wheel, on a seizure. Speaking outside court, JFK's daughter claimed numerous neurological tests show that she suffered a 'partial seizure' which was the result of a previous head injury. 'I want to apologise to the driver of the truck who I apparently hit and all those who I apparently endangered,’ she told reporters outside North Castle court in Amonk, New York, this evening. The 52-year-old twice repeated that no drugs or alcohol were found in her system after the crash. On Friday, the ex-wife of Governor Cuomo, was . found by police slumped over her wheel of her 2008 silver-white Lexus RX . 350 at one of the exits of the highway and charged with driving while . ability impaired by drugs. Surrounded by relatives this evening, Kennedy also detailed how she underwent an MRI and 'a comprehensive battery of neurological tests' at Mount Sinai medical center after the crash. ‘A MRI showed an area of hypo-density which appears to be the result of a head injury sustained some time ago,' she said. Kennedy concluded that doctors believe the accident was caused by a partial seizure. She added that this was the only seizure she had ever suffered and would continue to get treatment over 'the months ahead and, perhaps, indefinitely.' Recalling Friday's accident she said, 'I remember getting onto the highway and then I have no memory until I was at a traffic light and a police officer was at my car door.' 'I have never had any history of drug or alcohol abuse and in my discussion with the police officer I was confused and erratic,' she continued. She told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem.

The Kennedy family have been accused of behaving like an 'organised crime' clan following her arrest . Remorse: Kennedy apologised to the truck driver and everyone else she 'apparently endangered'. She finished her speech by asking for privacy and thanking her supporters and family . Heartbroken: Ms Kennedy speaking before the funeral of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary Richardson Kennedy, in Bedford, New York in May . The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy . crashed into on Friday spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's . daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the . Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered . off the interstate. He told . the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really . drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody. 'I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I’m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated. 'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.' He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes. 'She started . coming at me, like she didn’t see me. She was starting to nod off, . her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said. 'I hit the horn. I couldn’t go back into . the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could . either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do. 'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me. 'When she hit me, my left tire tore up . her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.' Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said. Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really . drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled . out of bed. Kennedy gave blood and urine samples at a nearby police barracks, which she said Tuesday evening showed that she had no alcohol or drugs in her system. On Sunday, one of Kennedy's family claimed she had had a seizure behind the wheel, which caused her to crash. Friday's collision came just two months . after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after . struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse. Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left . Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006 . Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig . about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged . her car and left it with a flat tire. Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway. They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers. Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash . The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions. However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas. Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy. Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002 . Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign. She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010. The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage. Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated. Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.

"By . Freya Noble . An Australian-born Cossack is reportedly being monitored by ASIO after he flew to Ukraine to support pro-Russian separatists. Simeon Boikov from Cabramatta in Sydney's west is the ataman, or leader, of The Zaibakal Cossack Society of Australia, and put a call out for others to join him in the fighting overseas, according to The Daily Telegraph. The 24-year-old would not confirm to the publication whether he had been in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, but insisted it was irrelevant as he is 'not breaking the laws of Australia by going overseas to help people.' Scroll down for video . Simeon Boikov is said to have taken up arms overseas fighting with pro-Russian separatists, the same rebels accused of downing MH17 . The separatists he claims to have flown overseas to assist have been blamed for the downing of fatal Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 which was shot down over eastern Ukraine almost two weeks ago. They have also been fighting in the areas surrounding the crash site making it impossible for any further investigation or retrieval of the victims' bodies to go ahead. Ukraine intelligence are said to have intercepted a phone call just days after the tragedy and heard the firing attributed to 'those Cossacks who are based in Chernukhino.' Boikov's closest friend said he believed Boikov had been in Donetsk with a two-star Russian general . The 24-year-old, seen here shooting, is reportedly aware that ASIO are keeping tabs on him but has insisted he is not a threat . Historically, the Cossacks are East Slavic people found mostly in Ukraine and southern Russia, who formed democratic and semi-military communities. Father Alexander Paramonov, a Russian Orthodox Priest and Boikov's closest friend said he believed Boikov had been in Donetsk with a two-star Russian general. Boikov claimed to have fired machine guns, and been at the controls of tanks, but Paramonov said this had only taken place during training exercises. What exactly his friend was training for he did not know. Boikov is the head of The Zaibakal Cossack Society of Australia, which is said to have around 150 members . He lives in Sydney and reportedly frequents the Russian Sports and Social Club at Kemps Creek, in Sydney's west . ASIO have apparently been keeping an eye on Boikov, but the 24-year-old is aware of this and insisted he is not a threat. The government have also been keeping tabs on any Australians going to fight in the Middle East, and have said anyone who goes overseas to fight could face a length jail term on their arrival back in Australia. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Boikov for comment. The Cossack society which Boikov is the head of is said to have around 150 members, and its headquarters are at the Russian Sports and Social Club at Kemps Creek, in Sydney's west. A staff member at the Russian Sport and Social Club told Daily Mail Australia: 'I do not know what he is doing.' Fighting in the area surrounding the MH17 crash site has halted any international investigation . MH17 was shot down from the sky nearly two weeks ago killing all 298 people on board the plane . The Zaibakal Cossack Society of Australia is recognised by the Trans-Baikal Cossack Army in Siberia. It is connected to other groups nationwide, including three in Victoria and one in Tasmania. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is currently in Kiev involved in ongoing negotiations with investigators to gain access to the crash site. More than 100 extra Australian Federal Police Officers were deployed to the area earlier this week but are yet to have visited the site due to fighting in the area.","Australian-born Cossack Simeon Boikov is said to be fighting with pro-Russian rebels .

"By . Rebecca English . With its bright orange roof and a conservatory-style garden room, it bears something of a resemblance to 'Beckingham Palace', one-time home of David and Victoria Beckham. This is Anmer Hall, the new country seat of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as it nears the end of what is believed to have been a £1.5million-plus refurbishment. The glass-roofed 16ft by 16ft garden room will host a large dining table, allowing William and Kate to look up at the stars as they dine. Anmer Hall is on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. The previous tenant was asked to move out by Her Majesty and the house has been converted for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Around £500,000 was spent putting new tiles on the roof which some have complained are too bright. According to an expert, they will weather after five years . Before: The old house had a much duller grey roof. The wood store (top left) has now been converted into a nanny flat, while the garage block (bottom right) is now accommodation for police protection officers . It also links the house to an old wood store which has been transformed into a ‘nanny flat’ for Maria Borallo, who was recently employed by the couple to look after Prince George. The couple already have a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, which has been brought up to scratch with the help of £1.5million-worth of taxpayer-funded improvements. But the Queen decided to give the couple the 200-year-old Grade II*-listed mansion on her Sandringham Estate in Norfolk after asking her existing tenant, who still had several years left to run on his lease, to move out. Work on the ten-bedroom house began in September after King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council agreed a series of planning applications that were never published ‘for reasons of national security’. Royal sources say Kate plans to use the rest of her ‘maternity leave’ to focus on finishing the house. One said: ‘She is going to spend a great deal of time there over the next few weeks with a view to being able to move in this summer. 'The family will spend most weekends there, although Kensington Palace will remain their primary residence.’. The works also included building a 'garden room', which is 16ft by 16ft and will house a new dining table. It also has a glass roof so guests can dine under the stars . The country home also includes a tennis court (left) and an outdoor swimming pool (above the main house) though these were in place before the renovation started . The most noticeable difference at the . Georgian mansion, which already has an outdoor pool and tennis court, is . the new clay pantiles roof, estimated to have cost in excess of . £500,000. According to . Tony Passmore, managing director of Passmore Group, a Yorkshire-based . group specialising in refurbishments, the tiles are actually ‘rather bog . standard’. ‘Surprisingly, they aren’t . much different from the kind of tiles you and I would have on our houses . and are actually in keeping with a traditional-style house,’ he said. ‘The colour is rather bright but they will weather and in five years or so will look as if they have been there for ever.’ A further £100,000 will have been spent on replacing the dormer windows which have been rebuilt in timber with lead roofs. The . most eye-catching addition is the garden room, estimated to have cost . £250,000-£300,000 and designed by Charles Morris, one of Prince . Charles’s favourite architects . The original plans showed it with a . tiled roof, but a second application requested a glazed roof, allowing . more sunlight to flood in. The 200-year-old property had rotting window frames replaced on the upstairs windows, while more money was spent beefing up security to keep the Royal couple safe . Signs have been put up warning that the area is strictly private. All the work at Anmer Hall has been paid for by the Royal Family as it is privately owned by the Queen . According . to Mr Passmore, a member of the Federation of Master Builders, the . conservatory jars with the rest of the building. ‘It looks like it has . been rather stuck on and doesn’t really fit with the rest of the . property,’ he said. ‘They . have incorporated columns to match those on the door to the building but . the roof tiles don’t even match. Prince Charles would probably describe . it as a carbuncle anywhere else, although I wouldn’t go that far. But . it just doesn’t flow with the rest of the property.’ Other . major works include rerouting the main driveway to sweep across a field . in front of the house to give the family greater privacy. The main gate to the house has been re-sited further down the driveway to keep away onlookers. A garage block has been converted into accommodation for the couple’s personal protection officers and the front lawn dug up to create extra parking. Although the cost of the works is being met privately by the Royal Family, Norfolk Police is recruiting extra armed officers to guard the property round the clock.","Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, has been renovated for Duke and Duchess of Cambridge .

"By . Arthur Martin . A senior counter-terrorism detective who claimed she wanted to blow the whistle on the phone hacking investigation was jailed for 15 months yesterday. Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, rang the News of the World to discuss Scotland Yard’s decision to launch a new investigation into phone hacking. She claimed she made the call because the public should know that counter-terrorism officers were being used to investigate phone hacking instead of ‘saving lives’. Jailed: April Casburn, pictured left arriving at court today, has been sentenced to prison for offering to pass sensitive information to the News of the World, whose headquarters are pictured right . But a jury found her guilty of misconduct in a public office. Jailing her at the Old Bailey . yesterday, Mr Justice Fulford said it was ‘a corrupt attempt to make . money out of sensitive and potentially very damaging information’. He said he would have sentenced Casburn to three years had it not been for the fact that she is adopting a vulnerable child. Casburn was in charge of the National . Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit within Scotland Yard’s SO15 . counter-terrorism command when she made the call to the paper on . September 11, 2010. She told journalist Tim Wood that six . people were under suspicion, including the News of the World’s former . editor, Andy Coulson, who by that time was Downing Street communications . chief. Sentence: Casburn, pictured earlier this month, begged to avoid prison for the sake of her adopted child . Casburn added that detectives were . under pressure from Lord Prescott to pursue the inquiry, and that the . operation was a waste of resources that should be spent fighting . terrorism. During the trial, Mr Wood said he wrote an email to two . colleagues after the call stating that a ‘senior policewoman’ wanted to . ‘sell inside information’. Casburn tearfully denied asking for . money, and said she had been angry at resources being taken away from . battling terrorism on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. No money changed hands and the officer was convicted largely on the contents of Mr Wood’s email. The officer, who carried out work for . both MI5 and MI6, told the court that during a meeting of senior . counter-terrorism officers the day before she made the call ‘there was a . palpable excitement regarding who would get to go and see Sienna . Miller’, a victim of phone-hacking. She said working in the Met’s terror . command was like working in a ‘21st century Life on Mars’ after the BBC . television show that depicts sexist police attitudes in the 1970s. In 2011 she was off work for two . months with ‘situation stress’ following claims of bullying by male . bosses within SO15. One superintendent admitted that he sent her text . messages signed with kisses. Arrested: Former editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks are among those who have been arrested in relation to the long-running investigation . When she was arrested at her home in . Essex in December 2011, the toddler she was trying to adopt with her . third husband had only lived with her for a few days. Patrick Gibbs, QC, defending, had . asked the judge to suspend the sentence, arguing that what she had done . did not amount to a ‘breach in relation to counter terrorism’ or ‘a . breach in relation to hacking’. He added: ‘It was about being very . unhappy at work and making a mad telephone call.’  But the judge said . that such a phone call ‘was a truly dire step for a police officer to . take’. He added: ‘If the News of the World . had accepted her offer Mrs Casburn would have taken the money and . therefore posed a significant threat to the integrity of the . investigation. ‘We are entitled to expect the very highest standards of probity from police officers, particularly those in senior positions. ‘It is a very serious matter that men . or women who have all the privileges and responsibility of public office . use their position for corrupt purposes. ‘No money changed hands but she revealed the actions of the police and current details of their thinking.’ Casburn is the first person to . convicted as part of Operation Elveden, the multi-million pound . investigation into whether journalists illegally paid public officials . for information. So far, 59 people have been arrested. The latest arrest was yesterday when a . 33-year-old Metropolitan Police specialist crime and operations . officer, based in central London, was held on suspicion of misconduct in . a public office.","April Casburn sentenced to 15 months for misconduct in public office .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Michael Zennie . and Daily Mail Reporters . Captured: Delta Force commandoes pulled al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi off the streets of Tripoli after a 15-year manhunt . America's two most elite commando teams have carried a pair of dramatic raids against terrorist targets in two African nations, killing members of the Somali group al-Shabab and capturing a mastermind of the 1998 embassy bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, who has avoided justice for 15 years. Before dawn on Saturday, Navy SEAL Team Six - the same unit that killed Osama bin Ladin - swam ashore outside the villa of an al-Shabab leader in Baraawe, Somalia, a coastal stronghold for the al-Qaeda-backed terrorist group. It is believed the raid was carried out in response to al-Shabab's Westgate mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, which left more than 60 civilians dead two weeks ago. In shades of Black Hawk Down, a disastrous U.S. military operation in Somalia's capital 20 years ago, the SEALs encountered significantly heavier resistance than they anticipated and were driven back after a fierce 15 to 20-minute firefight - before they could complete their objective. At least one al-Shabab militant was killed. Hours after the operation in Somalia, Delta Force - the Army's most elite Special Forces unit - pulled al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi off the streets of Tripoli, Libya, as he was arriving for morning prayers. Al-Libi had a $5million price on his head after he was indicted by federal prosecutors in 2000. He is believed to have suggested bombing the Nairobi embassy and performed surveillance in advance of the attack. Scroll down for video . Twin raids: American special operations troops launched raids just hours apart in Somalia and Libya. The Libya raid was successful, the Navy SEALs in Somalia were pushed back by strong resistance . Al-Libi's son Abdul Moheman al-Raghie, bottom, and brother Nabih al-Raghie (top) spoke out about the moment the wanted terrorist was snatched off the street . The twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 4,0000 in August 1998. Al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden, carried out the attacks in response to the American peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu, Somalia. No U.S. troops were inured in either raid. American officials said they told the Libyan government about the raid in Tripoli, but Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said he was never informed about the operation. He called the capture of al-Libi a 'kidnapping' and said he should have been tried in Libya. The pair of daring operations in Africa, carried out by the best-equipped and most heavily trained commandos in the United States, come a week and a half after al-Shabab terrorists slaughtered 67 people during a massacre at the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. They were also staged as President Barack Obama's credibility in the world has taken a dramatic hit. A deadlock in Congress has shut down the federal government. He was also forced to reverse course his position of launching missile attacks on Syria after the British withdrew their support and Russia proposed destroying the country's chemical weapons stockpiles. Secretary of State John Kerry, attending a conference in Bali, Indonesia, trumpeted the raids, saying 'members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations literally can run but they can’t hide.' Al-Libi's sons Abdullah al-Raghie and Abdul Moheman al-Raghie, point out where a convoy of Delta Force commandos stopped their father and took him into custody . It has been reported that the Somali compound that was attacked once was home to  Sheikh Ahmed Abdi Godane, a top leader of al-Shabab . He added: 'We hope that this makes . clear that the United States of America will never stop in it’s effort . to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror.' The town of Baraawe, about 110 miles south of Mogadishu, was the last known . home of Ahmed Abdi Godane. He is the leader of al-Shabaab, the terror . group that claimed responsibility for the attack on a mall in Nairobi . that killed more than 60 civilians between September 21 and 24. An . unnamed Somali government official said a Chechen member of the terror . group was the target and he was injured and his guard killed in the . attack. According to The Guardian, a Somalian radio station named the rebel as Abu Diyad, also known as Abu Ciyad. Baraawe police have estimated the number of dead to be seven. SEAL . Team Six attacked a beachfront house, where high-level members of al . Shabaab were known to stay, exactly two weeks after the Westgate Mall . Attack. They approached before dawn, using silencers to drown out their . weapons, but the operation soon turned into an open firefight as the . Somali combatants engaged them, according to reports. As many as 12 al-Shabaab fighters were staying there at the time of the assault before heading to a mission abroad. The battle lasted no longer than 20 minutes, according to a US official. There were no American casualties. After . the fight, an al-Shabaab spokesman said it was British and Turkish . forces who raided the home, but both countries quickly denied their . involvement. US officials have since confirmed Navy SEALS took part in the daring assault. Kenyan attack: Surveillance footage from the Westgate Mall shows one of the terrorists involved in the attack that killed 60 shoppers last month . Responsible: Somalian-based terrorist organization al Shabab took credit for the attack while it was going on . A spokesperson for the terrorist organization initially reported one member of their group was killed . 'Westerners in boats attacked our base at Baraawe beach and one was martyred from our side,” an al-Shabaab spokesman told Reuters. 'No planes or helicopters took part in the fight. The attackers left weapons, medicine and stains of blood, we chased them.' Al-Shabaab militants tightened their grip on the seaside town soon after the Navy SEALs disappeared from their two-story compound, searching home to home for evidence a spy turned evidence over to Americans, according to witnesses. 'We woke up to find al-Shabab fighters had sealed off the area and their hospital is also inaccessible,' said one witness, adding that 'the town is in a tense mood.' 'We were awoken by heavy gunfire last night, we thought an al Shabaab base at the beach was captured,' another local Sumira Nur said, adding that she heard shells but was not sure where they landed. This was the first publicly-announced raid by U.S. special ops in Somalia since the rescue of two charity workers from the country in January 2012, after they had been kidnapped by Somali pirates and held hostage for three months. Hours later the Tripoli raid was aimed at a specific Al-Qaeda target. Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known more commonly as Anas al-Libi, was taken from his car by U.S. Army Delta Force commandos while parking after morning prayers, the Pentagon has confirmed. His sister-in-law described the attack as she saw it from her bedroom window. Three cars closed in on him, foreign-looking commandos smashed the car's window and took hold of his gun before racing away from the scene with the wanted man, she said. The terrorist 'is currently lawfully detained by the U.S. military in a secure location outside of Libya,' a Pentagon official said. Anas al-Libi is said by US officials to be a senior member of al-Qaeda. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had a standing $5million bounty for information leading to his capture.","Navy SEAL Team Six swam to shore in Somalia and attacked the compound of an al-Shabab leader .

"By . Meghan Keneally . 'Master': Frank Bourassa claims that he is the best counterfeiter working globally today . A Canadian counterfeiter who made up to $250million in fake American cash has been released from jail after only a month and a half behind bars and a minimal fine. Frank Bourassa has delved into the details of his operation with 20/20 and told how the process was startlingly easy. 'It was like, screw you,' Bourassa said of his message to the U.S. government. The paper was made in Swiss and German mills that made the specific cotton and linen blend used in the U.S. currency under the guise of being for a different- legal- operation. 'You have to start with that...It’s got this crisp feel. If you don’t have that you’ll have nothing,' Bourassa told ABC's Brian Ross. From there, he sourced the ink and the detailed security features added to each bill in China and had the different parts shipped to a Canadian town outside Quebec. The $20 bill is thought of by counterfeiters as one of the easiest to emulate because it was last updated in 2003 and all of the parts of the creation process can be sourced online. Caught: Investigators were tracking his fake $20 bills for four years before he finally ended up behind bars, briefly . A skilled printer helped him put ink to paper and from there, he claims to have sold the batches of fake bills in bulk. The criminal groups that he sold the counterfeit bills to made out well, getting $1million in fake bills for $300,000. Bourassa's operation has been going on for years and ABC reports that the first one of his counterfeit bills was spotted in Michigan in 2010. From there, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team and the U.S. Secret Service worked together to track him and his bills. Sourced online: He arranged to have the paper necessary- with the correct mix of linen and cotton- made at a mill in Germany . He eventually got a lawyer and struck a deal with investigators that led to a $1,500 fine in Canadian dollars and spent just six weeks in jail before being released in late March. The Secret Service says that Canadian officials led the investigation and Bourassa is not currently wanted in the United States so he will not be extradited. One factor that still has investigators worried is that Bourassa may be taking credit for leading the operation- and calling himself the best counterfeiter currently working today- in order to cover for other criminals who actually led the operation. On top of that, he has avoided answering whether or not he has hidden more stacks of bills. 'It takes a network of people to pass all these bills, it’s a huge quantity so you can‘t just trust a couple of people,' Mounted Police investigator Dan Michaud said.

"By . Margot Peppers . Instagram users were outraged this weekend when the photo-sharing website appeared to have taken down a picture of two men kissing on their wedding day. Celebrity hairdresser Alberto Guzman posted the picture of himself and his husband Janeiro on Sunday in honor of Gay Pride Day, using a series of hashtags including #happy, #gaypride and #equalrights. But shortly after the photo went up, another user apparently flagged it as inappropriate, prompting the site to take it down - much to the disappointment of the couple and their followers. Reaction: Instagram users were outraged when this picture of celebrity hairdresser Alberto Guzman (right) and his husband Janeiro (left) on their wedding day was taken down . Pride: Mr Guzman (pictured left with his husband, whom he married in May after 16 years of dating) posted the photo using a series of hashtags including #happy, #gaypride and #equalrights . Mr Guzman, who married his make-up artist boyfriend of 16 years in May, voiced his outrage in a post on Instagram. 'I posted this photo of my wedding yesterday and Instagram took it off my . album for being ""inappropiate"", and on gay pride day of all . days,' wrote the hairdresser, who has worked with stars including Pink, Emily VanCamp, Bridget Moynahan and Molly Sims. The post attracted 160 'likes' and prompted dozens of people to re-post it and spread the word. 'Stunning photo,' wrote one friend. 'I don't see anything wrong with two people in love - amazing.' Another person said of the photo removal: 'Outrageous. Love you two! #love #pride #bestcoupleever'. Outcry: After someone apparently flagged the photo as inappropriate, prompting the site to remove it, supermodel Karen Elson was one of the people to jump to the couple's defense . Double standard: Many pointed out that Instagram has allowed pictures that are far more inappropriate . Even supermodel Karen Elson, who has more than 48,000 followers, jumped to the couple's defense, sharing the photo along with the caption: 'These 2 people just got married and the photo captured the moment, how can you find an expression of love offensive? #allyouneedislove'. 'The photo captured the moment, how can you find an expression of love offensive?' Others pointed out that the site has allowed far more inappropriate pictures. 'Crazy...especially when there's a gazillion half naked selfies on here daily!' commented one person. Instagram has since apologized and restored the original photo, calling the removal a 'mistake'. 'When our team processes reports from other members of the Instagram . community, we occasionally make a mistake,' a spokesperson told MailOnline. Unfair: Ms Nelson (pictured in November) wrote to her 48,000 followers: 'These 2 people just got married and the photo captured the moment, how can you find an expression of love offensive? #allyouneedislove' 'In this case, we wrongly . removed content and rectified the error as soon as we were notified.  We . apologize for any inconvenience.' According to Instagram's community guidelines, users are not allowed to post pictures that contain 'nudity', 'mature content,' 'prohibited or illegal content' or 'extreme violence or gore'. 'If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram,' states the website.",Instagram has since apologized and restored the photo. A spokesperson said: 'We wrongly removed content and rectified the error as soon as we were notified.  We apologize for any inconvenience'
"By . Miles Goslett . A former British diplomat has revealed he was ‘warned’ by the senior civil servant running the Iraq Inquiry not to mention the late biological weapons expert Dr David Kelly when giving evidence. Carne Ross, the UK’s Iraq expert  at the UN Security Council between 1998 and 2002, said he was told by the ‘very aggressive’ official that if he discussed Dr Kelly during his testimony, he would be silenced. It is understood the official who delivered the order was Margaret Aldred, secretary of the Iraq Inquiry chaired by Sir John Chilcot. A former British diplomat said he was 'warned' not to mention the late biological weapons expert Dr David Kelly (pictured) The inquiry was set up in 2009 to examine why Tony Blair took Britain into war. Mr Ross was a close friend of Dr Kelly, a Ministry of Defence employee and world-renowned scientist who was found dead in an Oxfordshire wood in 2003. Dr Kelly had been named as the prime source of a BBC report accusing the Blair Government of lying to take Britain into the war. Having worked with Dr Kelly for several years, Mr Ross intended to say a few words about him as a tribute which he submitted in earlier written evidence. A 2003 public inquiry found Dr Kelly committed suicide. But successive governments have refused to hold a full coroner’s inquest, making him the only person in modern English legal history to be denied a proper inquest and fuelling claims of a cover-up. Last month a group of doctors wrote to the chief coroner of England and Wales, Peter Thornton QC, urging him to resume the inquest which  was halted in 2003. This was rejected.  The revelation that a witness was informed by an inquiry official what they could and could not discuss before giving evidence raises serious questions about its impartiality. Sir John Chilcot, The head of the Iraq War Inquiry, was 'incredibly tense' when evidence was being submitted . And this weekend a senior MP who asked to remain anonymous has revealed that when he offered to submit evidence about Dr Kelly’s death to the inquiry in 2009, he was told by Chilcot personally that he ‘did not want to touch the Kelly issue’. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Ross, who now runs New York-based diplomatic advisory group Independent Diplomat, recalled the day he gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry in July 2010. He said: ‘I was taken into the room where witnesses sat and shortly before I was to testify an official came in and said, “You are not to speak about David Kelly.” ’ He was told that if he did the videolink of his evidence to the press would be cut and he would have to leave. Having been warned, he kept quiet. He said: ‘I wasn’t happy about it. I felt very strongly about David. He was a man of honesty and integrity. The inquiry in 2009 to examine why Tony Blair took Britain into war . ‘I wanted to remember him in that setting and they prevented me for no good reason. What difference would it have made? It’s pure control freakery. It was weird. Chilcot was incredibly tense. Clearly he feared I was going to say something.’ When asked if he thought Dr Kelly killed himself, Mr Ross said: ‘I don’t know. I would like to see the people who hounded him to his death brought to account. It was as good as murder, what they did. If you publicly humiliate a man, and you drive him to his death, it’s as bad as putting hemlock in his soup.’ An Iraq Inquiry spokesman refused to comment.","Carne Ross told if he discussed Dr Kelly in testimony, he would be silenced .

"By . Ray Massey . and Suzannah Hills . A crane driver has told how helicopters often flew within a few feet of a London crane just weeks before it was struck by a chopper last week. The driver, who didn't wish to be named, even captured an image of an army Chinook helicopter flying close to the crane on The Tower at St George Wharf, Vauxhall, just a month before the tragic crash. Pilot Pete Barnes, 50, died from multiple injuries when the helicopter he was flying hit the high-rise crane and crashed down into Wandsworth Road at around 8am last Wednesday. The pictures taken by the crane driver in December have now emerged on the same day an Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report reveals Mr Barnes was twice urged not to fly because of the poor weather conditions on the day he died.

View from the sky: This crane driver claimed to even be able to see the eyes of pilots they flew so close . The . crane driver claimed he had been worried a helicopter would hit the high-rise structure months before the accident occurred. He said he could almost see the eyes of some pilots as they . came so close to the crane above the River Thames. He added: 'It was very close. It was difficult to tell . how close they were but you could almost see the whites of the pilot’s . eyes.' 'When the first one came by I had no idea what it was. There was the sudden loud noise and it whipped right passed the cab. 'They . came by pretty frequently and it was a bit worrying.

Aftermath: Debris lies on the ground after the helicopter crashed into a construction crane in central London . The scene of the wreckage after the helicopter hit The Tower St George Wharf in Vauxhall, central London . Warning: Pilot Pete Barnes decided to fly his plane despite the bad weather even if it meant ' landing in a field' Mr Barnes had . been scheduled to fly from Redhill, Surrey, to collect restaurant and . clubs tycoon Richard Caring from Elstree, Hertfordshire, on January 16. A . report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed that . Ivy owner Mr Caring suggested the journey be postponed because of poor . visibility. But father-of-two Mr Barnes responded that he was 'coming anyway' and would 'land in a field' if necessary. The . pilots comments were made just half an hour before he was diverted to . Battersea heliport due to the bad weather and clipped the high-rise . crane. The AAIB released today revealed the details of that morning's conversations between the pilot and his client. ‘At . 0718hrs, the client called the pilot to discuss the weather. The pilot . said he thought the weather might clear earlier than forecast. The . client said he would drive to Elstree and call the pilot to keep him . advised. ‘At 0731hrs, . having noticed how poor the weather was during his journey, the client . called the pilot to suggest that he did not take off until he (the . client) had reached Elstree and observed the weather. The pilot replied . that he was already starting the engines. ‘The client stated that he repeated his suggestion that the pilot should not take off,' the report said. Details . of text messages sent and received by the pilot have also been . revealed. At 6.30am he told the client: 'Weather OK up north but . freezing fog at Elstree and Luton not clearing between 8-10am I've got . same at Redhill keep you posted.’ He sent the client another message at 7.29am which stated: ‘I'm coming anyway will land in a field if I have to.’ Another . pilot, who was aware of the journey planned by Mr Barnes, sent him a . message which read: ‘Give me a call as I have checked weather and . freezing fog around at the moment.' Mr . Barnes was on his way to collect his client when he was forced to . change his route because of the bad weather. His final conversation was . with air traffic control seven seconds before the crash. Tragic: The scene of a helicopter crash on Wandsworth Road, Vauxhall, London last week . Twisted metal: The damaged crane on St George's Tower in Vauxhall, shortly after the crash . Mr Barnes requested to land at London Heliport in Battersea. He asked: ‘Is Battersea open, do you know?’ After being told the heliport was open, he replied: ‘If I could head to Battersea that would be very useful.’ Just . 15 seconds before hitting the crane, air traffic control told the . pilot: ‘Battersea diversion approved, you're cleared to Battersea.’ His final words were: ‘Thanks a lot.’ The . AAIB report stated: ‘This exchange ended at 0759.18 when G-CRST (the . helicopter) was approximately 150 metres south-west of Vauxhall Bridge.

At 0759.25 it struck a . crane on the south side of the river 275 metres from the south-west end . of Vauxhall Bridge.’ The initial ‘special bulletin’ report by the AAIB also suggested that the solar-powered red warning lights on top of the crane were not switched on during the crash because the official requirement was that ‘the obstacle be lit at night only.’ It notes: ‘The crane was lit at night with red lights, both on its tower and jib.’ ‘The tower lighting consisted of mains powered steady red lights at approximately 50m intervals. ‘The jib lighting was provided by solar powered lights. ‘The Air Navigation Order requires the lighting to be of  medium intensity (2000 candela) and that the obstacles be lit at night only.’ But an official ‘notice to airmen’ warning had been issued about the structure.

He had flown as an air ambulance pilot and in several films . during his career including Oscar-winning Saving Private Ryan and Tomb . Raider II. Pedestrian Mr Wood, from Sutton, Surrey, died from severe burns and a leg injury. A spokesman for the MoD confirmed that the Chinook pictured is an army aircraft but added it posed no risk to cranes and was flying a perfectly safe and approved London air route. He said: 'There are air lanes which run through central London which the RAF does use and will continue to use. 'There are no cranes allowed within in this space and aircrafts using these routes pose no risk to crane drivers.'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Hundreds of homeowners have been told their £400,000 properties could have been built on 'contaminated' land - and it's not safe for their children to play in the area. Environment officers at Tunbridge Wells Borough Council have warned residents of three streets in  Paddock Wood, Kent, they may be at risk. They say 'potentially dangerous' chemicals including asbestos and creosote could have seeped in to the ground. The substances could have 'an impact on human health', they added. Residents of three streets, circled, in Paddock Wood, Kent have been told their homes could have been built on contaminated land. They have been warned not to let their children play with soil in their gardens also . The area used to be a timber yard which built sheds and greenhouses until the early 80s. The area includes three streets of homes built more than 20 years ago, including The Ridings, Dimmock Close and Le Temple Road. Experts will now take soil samples from homes to check whether the soil is 'toxic' - while residents have been told to ensure their children don't play with soil in gardens. Locals have been told to make sure anyone coming into contact with soil should wash their hands and that pets should be 'prevented from digging' in soil. One local, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said she was 'furious' that hundreds of people have been exposed to the risk. The 51-year-old, who asked not to be named, said last week: 'The first we knew about it was when we got a letter through the door saying the council needed to take soil samples. 'When I looked into it further I found out that the soil could be full of chemicals. 'I've brought up three children here and they used to make mud pies and help me do the gardening all the time. Homeowners in The Ridings, Paddock Wood, pictured, were told chemicals such as asbestos could have seeped in to the ground when the area was a timber yard . 'It beggars belief to think they could have been playing in mud which is filled with poisons.' Another mother-of-three Toni Williamson, 37, told her local paper, the Kent and Sussex Courier: 'It terrified me when I got the letter. 'It's horrible to think that my kids can't play in the garden without being at risk. 'I feel like now I have to watch them like a hawk 24/7, which is stressful. And I don't understand how you can be expected to stop your pet from digging in the garden.' A statement from Tunbridge Wells Borough Council said the site was used to make sheds and greenhouses and 'involved treating wood with substances like creosote and used tar like chemicals to preserve them' It stated: 'These are substances that might still be in the ground. 'There are possible health effects from taking in large amounts of these substances.' Experts are now being brought in to take soil samples around the area, including Le Temple Road, pictured, to see whether the soil is toxic . It added: 'This area was the site of a former works that we believe may have carried out timber treatment and we will be looking for a number of different chemicals, but mainly for hydrocarbons associated with timber treatment substances like tars and creosotes. 'We have also heard that the site might have been involved in making barns with asbestos material in them so will be looking for that too.' Residents have also been told by the council that the investigation will mean it 'might make it difficult to sell a property' before the results are known. It stated: 'While the investigation is being carried out it might make it difficult to sell a property and we know that the possibility of contaminated land on the site has already caused some problems for house sellers.' Residents of Dimmock Close, pictured, have said today they are 'furious' hundreds of people have been exposed to risk . Head of environment for the council Gary Stevenson said: 'We understand how sensitive this matter is and it is important to us that we keep residents and home owners fully informed. 'We have been in contact with residents and homeowners personally and by letter, and have held two drop-in information sessions. 'We will continue to keep them informed and answer any further questions that they may have.' Council workers are set to start taking soil samples in June this year and report back to locals in August.","Homes in Paddock Wood, Kent, may have been built on toxic land .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ed Miliband said he would create a Secretary of State for Women if he wins the next election . Labour would have a Secretary of State for Women if it won the next election, Ed Miliband said yesterday. Mr Miliband also pledged his party’s Cabinet would be 50 per cent female. It follows Culture Secretary Maria Miller’s resignation over expenses, leaving just three women in a Cabinet of 22. But Tory MP Tracey Crouch called the plan ‘patronising’. Hours after Mrs Miller stood down, David Cameron was plunged into a row for handing her role as women’s minister to Nicky Morgan – who will not be made a full Cabinet member, despite also taking on the powerful position of Financial Secretary. Downing Street had already raised eyebrows by suggesting new Culture Secretary Sajid Javid would retain responsibility for women’s issues. The suggestion was later withdrawn. Labour said the ‘demotion’ of the role was further evidence of David Cameron’s ‘women problem’. Mr Miliband said: ‘If there’s a Labour government, the post of women and equalities minister will be Cabinet rank.’ This could be a Secretary of State for Women, he said. The Prime Minister pledged in 2010 that his cabinet would conain a third women by the end of the parliament. Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, left, has called the Labour leader's plan 'patronising'. Since Maria Miller, right, resigned there are only three women in the Cabinet . Labour has for several years used controversial all-women shortlists to increase numbers of female MPs, who now make up over 40pc of the shadow cabinet. Mr Miliband said if he won office, his target would be a cabinet of 50pc women. He said 30 years ago only 3pc of MPs were women. ‘To believe that was the best person for the job you woud have to believe that men were 30 times better at being MPs than women’, he said.","Labour leader promises Cabinet will be 50 per cent female if they win next election .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . An enterprising pair of best friends are launching a range of high-quality unisex watches priced at $95, in hopes of taking on the luxury market. Chris Chon, a recent MBA graduate from the Kellogg School of Management, and his childhood friend Jeff Leung, both based in New York, had the idea to design their own watches after a frustrating hunt through an industry in which they found it standard for retailers and middle-men to mark watches up by 1,000per cent. 'We started Leonard & Church to create a new way to buy a luxury watch,' the company writes on its Kickstarter page, which has already raised $231,000 in launch funding. 'We want to offer meticulously crafted, handmade luxury watches at a radical price point.' Time for a new standard: Entrepreneurs Chris Chon and his best friend Jeff Leung have launched Leonard & Church, a line of high-end quality watches priced at a reasonable $95 each (pictured) According to FastCompany, the founder duo were originally both on the lookout for their own 'first entry-level high-quality watch,' something in the region of $500 to $,1000; from mid-range luxury brands including Movado or Bulova. 'We saw a wide disparity in pricing, even for watches that had the same movement, the same components,' reveals Mr Chon; pointing to brokers, middle-men and high-end retailers as those responsible for the heavy markups. 'The closer we got to the luxury watch industry, the more we were turned off by what we were learning.' Spot the difference: As a point of comparison, a mid-range luxury Movado watch for $450 (left) Leonard & Church's $95 offering (center) and a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Submariner worth nearly $8,000 (right) Affordably priced: Leonard & Church (pictured, other watches from its 15-piece range)  hope to stand out with timepieces  that are of the same quality as luxury brands, but without the significant mark-ups . Clean design: The idea struck the founders while they were both on the lookout for their own 'first entry-level high-quality watch,' something in the region of $500 to $,1000, but were put off by the senseless pricing . So the team hit the drawing board, and spent a year with high-ranking designers, manufacturers and key influencers, to arrive at a set of 15 watches priced at only $95, that seek to change the face of the market. 'We saw a wide disparity in pricing, even for watches that had the same movement, the same components' And these founders may be fresh out of business school, but their partners are no novices. According to the company, one of the Leonard & Church manufacturers also produces a watch that President Obama wears in office. 'No middle-men. No retail mark-ups. An obsessive focus on the details,' their campaign reads. 'We're so confident in the quality of our timepieces we are offering a ten year limited warranty on all of our watches.' Strong partners: One of the manufacturers that works with Leonard & Church also produces a watch worn by President Obama. Exactly which one is unclear, but it could be this $695 timepiece . Drawing board: The founders spent a year with high-ranking designers, manufacturers and key influencers, with the aim of 'meticulously' perfecting their creations . Design tweaks: The eclectic range of watches are housed in surgical grade stainless steel cases, and are designed to be extremely thin yet durable (pictured, a work in progress) Durable: They boast scratch-resistant sapphire crystal lenses, Miyota Quartz movements, are water resistant up to 50 meters, and come with a ten-year guarantee . The eclectic range of watches are housed in surgical grade stainless steel cases, designed to be extremely thin yet durable, boast scratch-resistant sapphire crystal lenses, Miyota Quartz movements, and are water resistant up to 50 meters. Variations in addition to the smart Chronograph Collection include The Classics; available with leather, tweed or nylon-striped straps, as well as a black-faced option, and the New Classics, which include a stainless steel strap option. 'The closer we got to the luxury watch industry, the more we were turned off by what we were learning' Mr Chon is certainly passionate about his offerings, and based on the success of his Kickstarter campaign - which aimed to raise $75,000, but has raised over three times that amount with nine days left on the clock - Leonard & Church appear well on their way to becoming a storming success. The company remains committed to avoiding certain partnerships, and opening its own retail store for example, in order to keep their price point 'fairly consistent.' 'If you want to buy a Patek Phillippe watch for $50,000, if that item makes you feel good, that’s great,' Mr Chon remarks. 'But... at a certain point, the watch is what the watch is, and all that premium, all that extra you’re paying for, is the brand name.'","Leonard & Church hopes to change the way we buy luxury watches with its transparent pricing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Heartbreak: Megan Renfroe, right, holds her little sister Katie who suffers from megalencephaly at their home in Paxton, Florida . A little girl born with a rare genetic disorder has been offered hope through a series of life-altering surgeries. Katie Renfroe, four, was diagnosed with megalencephaly before she was born, causing some of her facial features to be abnormally large. She also had part of her brain removed as an infant to control the seizures that were happening as often as 50 times a day. 'All we know is we give her all the . love, all the attention we know how to give her,' says her mother Angie . Renfroe. 'We've never treated her like she has a handicap.' Katie . is the sixth of Angie and Danial Renfroe's eight children, the one who . came along after doctors told them Angie wouldn't be having any more . children. In the first trimester, doctors noticed anomalies on her ultrasound. The baby's head was 'oddly shaped,' her parents were told. At three and a half months, a . specialist told her parents that Katie's head was three times larger . than normal. He gave them the name of Katie's rare disorder, but it . meant nothing to the rural Paxton couple. He also told them what her life - and their life - would be like. 'He . was trying to help us understand that she might be a vegetable,' Danial . says. 'She ain't nowhere near what they said she was gonna be.' The specialist told them to come back . in two weeks after they had decided what they were going to do. The . couple drove home from Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola. As soon as . they got there, Angie went into their room, got into bed and cried. Beloved: Angie and Danial Renfroe hold their daughter Katie whose condition had caused her to have seizures as much as 50 times a day . 'I tried to figure out how we were going to deal with this,' she said. And then she realized she had choices. 'You can lay here, you can cry or you can leave this in God's hands, which is where she belongs,' Angie remembers thinking. Next, she talked to God. 'If you let me have her, I'll raise her and take care of her the best I know how to do for as long as you give her to me.' Having made peace with her decision, she talked to Danial. 'I told him, ''If you can't handle it - they're telling us it's going to be bad - go now,''' she says. He recalls looking at her like she was crazy. He wasn't going anywhere. Katie . was delivered by cesarean section at Sacred Heart on January 28, 2008. Angie doesn't remember much about the delivery except seeing her . daughter's 'big, pretty cheeks'. Loving family: Megan Renfroe, left, Jessica Renfroe, center, and Emmalee Renfroe watch over their sister Katie . Danial remembers getting his first peek at his 'Katie-Bug' while she lay in an incubator right after the delivery. 'What it looked like was a small little body hooked to these two grapefruits —her cheeks,' he says. In . a portrait taken when Katie was two- months old, she is curled up, . sleeping, her cheeks nestled in the lace and satin of her pale pink . dress. As Katie has grown, so have her cheeks. Extra skin on top of her cheeks gives them a mottled brown look. Her ears are also deformed and she has some hearing loss. Her tongue doesn't fit in her mouth, but ever resourceful, she has still figured out how to suck her two fingers and her thumb. She doesn't have seizures anymore but her muscles tighten up, causing a stiffness that rolls from one side of her petite frame to the other. When that happens, whichever family member is closest pats her back, rubs her arm or pinches her feet to help her snap out of it. Despite her disabilities, in many ways Katie is just one more child in a big family. Over Thanksgiving break, the older girls entertained themselves with face painting. Katie got a flower on her cheek, too. 'I've learned a lot,' says 13-year-old Megan of having Katie as a sister. 'I have learned how to cope with things. When we see other people like her, we actually know how they feel.' The family takes Katie wherever they go but have never gotten accustomed to the way strangers respond to their little girl. A few are kind; most stare. Some make comments that hurt. Danial says when they go out he puts up an imaginary line around him and his family, and hopes no one crosses it. 'Kids are cruel,' he says. 'And it isn't only kids. It's just hard. If you have a kid like that, you have got to get your head straight.' The family lives outside of Paxton in a mobile home that has been expanded as the family grows. Each older child has his or her own room. The beds are neatly made and possessions, most donated by kind strangers, are arranged on dressers and shelves. The three youngest children sleep with Angie and Danial, piling into their king-sized bed. In addition to the five older kids, Katie has two younger siblings, three-year-old Kenneth and one-year-old Emalee. The older children - who are eight, 11, 12, 13 and 14 - go to schools in Paxton and Laurel Hill. Katie attends preschool at Richbourg School in Crestview. Neither Angie nor Danial work, although he receives disability. But they don't ask for help and are almost entirely self-sufficient. On Tuesday, they will pile into their van and drive to Hollywood, Florida, where a surgeon at Memorial Hospital will perform the first of as many as seven surgeries on Katie. 'They're going to downsize her cheeks, fix her ear, shorten up her tongue,' Danial says. 'Once she gets rid of this weight, she'll be able to stand better.' The family will stay in one room, with two beds, at a nearby facility that reaches out to families of hospital patients. They will be in South Florida for at least two weeks for the first surgery. Christmas, when it comes, will be modest, with a few gifts for the children from Catholic Charities. They don't need much to be happy, except for each other. 'I'm grateful for my family, my kids, no matter how wild they get sometimes,' Angie says, smiling. 'I still love them.' And since making her decision to go forward with her pregnancy five years ago, she has never looked back. 'I'm a firm believer,' she says. 'If God gives you something, don't throw it away.'","Katie Renfroe, four, diagnosed with megalencephaly before she was born .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Pointless? Research has found taking flu tablets could prolong your illness and make you more contagious . Cold and flu remedies may make you feel better but your friends and colleagues won’t thank you for taking them. Scientists say that while aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen make the person taking them feel better by lowering their temperature, they may also make the bug easier to spread. As a result, more people will catch it. The Canadian researchers calculated that tablets taken to ease the sweats and chills of flu are to blame for at least one in 20 cases of the illness – and many deaths. They say that rather than taking pills to lower their temperature, people with flu should stay at home, get plenty of rest and have some hearty soup. However, British experts questioned their sums. The researchers, from McMaster University in Ontario, first gathered together studies on the biology of flu. This included one which showed that ferrets release more of the flu virus and are infectious for longer after being given drugs to lower their temperature. It is thought that the high temperature of a fever triggers the immune system into fighting the infection. Without it, the amount of the flu virus in coughs and sneezes increases, making it easier for the bug to spread. Although ferrets may seem an odd choice of animal to study, their flu symptoms are most similar to those in people. The researchers then added in figures on use of paracetamol and other drugs to estimate how much they affect the spread of flu. They calculated that in a typical winter in North America, the pills are to blame for 5 per cent of cases and more than 1,000 deaths. If same held true for the UK, it would equate to some 200 deaths a year. Lead researcher, David Earn, said: ‘When they have flu, people often take medication that reduces their fever. The researchers from McMaster University in Ontario found high temperatures trigger the body into fighting the illness . ‘No one likes to feel miserable but it turns out that our comfort might be at the cost of infecting others. ‘Because fever can actually help lower the amount of virus in a sick person’s body and reduce the chance of transmitting the disease to others, taking drugs that can reduce fever can increase transmission. ‘We’ve discovered that this increase has significant effects when we scale up to the level of the whole population.’ The journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reports that factoring in the impact of people who take the medicines feeling well enough to go back to work means the impact is likely even greater. Professor Earn said: ‘People often take – or give their kids – fever-reducing drugs so they can go to work or school. ‘They may think the risk of infecting others is lower because the fever is lower. ‘In fact, the opposite may be true: the ill people may give off more virus because fever has been reduced.’ British research: Scientists at Reading University also advised it is better to stay home than take medication . Co-researcher Dr Paul Andrews said the same could be true when the pills are used to ease the symptoms of a heavy cold. He said: ‘Don’t take anti-fever drugs; stay home and avoid contact with others; get plenty of rest and eat chicken noodle soup.’ David Price, professor of family medicine at McMaster, said: ‘As always, Mother Nature knows best. ‘Fever is a defence mechanism to protect ourselves and others. ‘Fever-reducing medication should only be taken to take the edge off discomfort, not to allow people to go out into the community when they should still stay at home. ‘People are often advised to take fever-reducing drugs and medical texts state that doing so is harmless. ‘This view needs to change.’ However, British experts said that while the Canadians may have a theoretical point, the spread of flu is much more complex than their calculations allowed for. Professor Ian Jones, a Reading University flu expert, said: ‘This may be one factor that influences influenza spread but there are so many factors overall it is difficult to imagine people stopping taking cold cures because of it.’","Canadian researchers found tablets to blame for 1 in 20 cases of illness .

"By . Associated Press . When birds and planes collide, the results can be deadly. That's why airports around the world work hard to keep birds away, even resorting to shooting or poisoning large flocks. One Ohio airport is now experimenting with a new, gentler way to avoid bird strikes: planting tall prairie grass. Heavy birds like geese - which cause the most damage to planes - are believed to avoid long grasses because they fear predators might be hiding within. So officials at Dayton International Airport are converting up to 300 acres of the airfield's 2,200 non-aeronautical acres into prairie grass. Novel idea: Terrence Slaybaugh, director of aviation for Dayton International Airport, poses in one of the airport's prairies in Vandalia, Ohio . The goal is, by the end of this year, to plant the tall grass under the takeoff and landing paths. There are more than 10,000 airplane bird strikes a year in the U.S. Most do little or no damage to the plane. The most frequent problem is damage to the engines. The FAA estimates that such damage costs the industry $950 million a year. But some cause catastrophic damage. The forced landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in 2009 - often called The Miracle on the Hudson - occurred after Canada geese were ingested in both engines, causing the plane to lose power. Nobody died when the plane glided into the river. The passengers of Eastern Air Lines Flight 375 in 1960 weren't so lucky. The plane struck a flock of European starlings during takeoff. All four engines were damaged and the aircraft crashed in Boston harbor; 62 people died. Globally, wildlife strikes have killed more than 250 people and destroyed over 229 aircraft since 1988, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. In the past 23 years, there were 25 fatalities and 279 injuries linked to wildlife strikes in the U.S. A little more than half of bird strikes occur from July to October, which is when young birds leave nests and fall migration occurs. Heavy birds like geese, which cause the most damage to planes, are believed to avoid long grasses because they fear predators might be hiding within . Between 2001 and 2013, there were 218 wildlife strikes at Dayton. The majority involved doves, pigeons, sparrows and other small birds that didn't cause severe damage. The airport sees 56 commercial planes landing and taking off each day. Two-thirds of those are smaller regional jets. Airports often buy large parcels of adjacent land to create a buffer zone and limit the number of local residents affected by loud jet engines. Newer airports tend to be built next to tracts of empty land. Those large fields happen to make great rest stops for migrating birds. 'We operate airports in a smaller and smaller environment,' says Terrence G. Slaybaugh, director of Dayton's airport. 'If we are going to protect the long term use of airports in an increasingly populated area we need to be less intrusive and find ways to contribute in a positive way to our surroundings.' The thick grass has other benefits: preventing water runoff, taking carbon dioxide out of the air and requiring only one mowing every three years. Bird lovers are also excited about the use of non-lethal methods to keep birds away from the airport. The airport's neighbor, the Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm, has been working closely with aviation officials on the tall grass project. 'It's a watershed moment. Our airport is embracing it,' says Charity Krueger, executive director of the center. Still, Dayton airport has to prove that the tall grass is the best approach. The tactic could backfire: in the past, the FAA notes, such grasses have led to increased rodent populations, a food source for raptors. Dayton's initial test will run for three years. Preventing bird strikes often requires . multiple approaches. Airports need to plan out what type of trees and . landscaping they plant, selecting vegetation that doesn't produce fruits . or seeds attractive to birds. Waste from airport restaurants needs to . be properly secured and irrigation improved to avoid large areas of . standing water. Gentle approach: Officials at Dayton International Airport are converting up to 300 acres of the airfield's 2,200 non-aeronautical acres into prairie grass in a bid to keep birds away . Then there are design factors. Light posts can be fitted with anti-perching devices. Tubular steel beams for terminals and hangars are also much-less desirable as resting spots, compared to traditional I-beams with flat surfaces. Some locations take more drastic measures. Airports use chemically-treated food baits that birds eat and then send out distress call that frighten away other birds in the flock. At other times, birds might be captured and relocated. Then there are poisons and shotguns used to kill birds, or specialists who are brought in to break eggs and remove nest materials. Such efforts to cull bird populations often draw protests from animal rights groups and bird watchers. Dayton airport has had a policy for at least 14 years of not killing birds. But it does try to scare them away with loud noises from non-lethal pyrotechnics and recordings of geese in distress. Maybe with this new grass, even that harassment won't be necessary anymore. The industry has been looking for a solution for a long time. After all, the FAA notes that the first reported bird strike was by Orville Wright, back in 1905.","There are more than 10,000 airplane bird strikes a year in the U.S. with the most frequent problem engine damage .

"By . Julian Robinson . Lager drinkers find it difficult to taste the difference between big name beer brands, blind testing has revealed . Lager drinkers find it difficult to taste the difference between big name beer brands, blind testing has revealed. A number of European pale lagers were used with volunteers given blind samples of Budvar, Heineken and Stella Artois to see if they could tell them apart. Researchers found that those taking part could not distinguish between the varieties when two of the samples were the same product and the other one was different. Nearly 140 volunteers aged 21 to 70 were given three blind samples of European lager. Two of the samples were the same product and one was different. After tasting all of them, each volunteer was asked to select the one that was different from the other two. Researchers claimed that this revealed customer loyalty to certain brands of beer was the result of marketing rather than taste. Tests were carried out by Johan Almenberg and his wife Anna Dreber, of the Stockholm School of Economics, and Robin Goldstein, author of 'The Beer Trials' and the upcoming book 'Blind Taste'. Mr Goldstein said: 'I think basically what we're looking at is a commodity industry - the products are interchangeable. 'It also means that the beer industry has perfected pale lager beer, which is my favorite style of beer. Global brewers such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, which makes Budweiser and Stella Artois, and Heineken have taken the world's most widely consumed style of beer, a brew that has been around since the 1500s and perfected it, according to Mr Goldstein. 'They have a good product, a good manufacturing method and it can be sold at a good price,' he added. 'So if you're in a bar and they don't have the lager you usually drink, have a different one. They will pretty taste much the same.' Sean Lewis, author of the book 'We Make Beer,' which will be published next month, said the finding was good news for beer lovers. Volunteers were given blind samples of Stella Artois, left, Heineken, right, and Budvar to see if they could tell them apart . 'It means they (the global brewers) are probably doing their jobs right if they all taste the same. They're aiming for a specific flavor profile and they've got it down at this point.' But although the taste has been perfected, the big beer companies have seen their sales go flat, or even decline, over the last few years in the United States. Last year in Germany beer sales slumped to a 25-year low. Meanwhile, sales of craft beers have continued to rise and are estimated to reach £12billion in 2014, according to the research firm Mintel.","Lager drinkers struggle to distinguish between big  beer brands, study finds .

"By . Lydia Warren . A 17-year-old high school football player has passed away after drinking too much water during practice. Zyrees Oliver, a star student and athlete at Douglas County High School in Georgia, drank two gallons of water and two gallons of Gatorade to stave off cramps last Tuesday, his relatives said. He felt better that evening but on Wednesday morning - just hours before he was set to start his first day of his senior year - he collapsed in his Douglasville home and was rushed to hospital. Doctors said Zyrees was brain dead after suffering devastating brain swelling from water intoxication, family members told WSB-TV in Atlanta. Loss: Zyrees Oliver, 17, collapsed last week after drinking four gallons of fluids during football practice. The amount of water consumed in a short space of time left him with water intoxication and brain damage . At 1am on Monday, after five days in the hospital, his family took him off life support. 'The water flooded his system and his brain started to swell,' his cousin Bryant Stewart explained to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His aunt, Tammy Chavis, added: 'You think with dehydration, the more water you give, the better you're making it. No, not in all cases, it does the opposite.' He had consumed the liquids after suffering cramps, which he believed were due to dehydration during practice the day before school began. He had been suffering from the cramps for months, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. In mourning: He was just hours from starting his senior year at Douglas County High School in Georgia (pictured), where he was a talented football player and a good student, with a GPA of 3.8 . Proud: Zyrees, who was on life support for 5 days before it was turned off, had hoped to play football at college . Water intoxication, or hyponatremia, occurs when too much water is consumed in a short period of time. It causes the body's other nutrients, such as sodium, to become too diluted, making it impossible for them to function properly. There is no universal rule about how much water is too much, but the Mayo Clinic suggests drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, but exercise calls for an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups. Warmer temperatures and pregnancy also call for a higher consumption of water. Water intoxication is extremely rare, but babies and athletes are most susceptible. Symptoms include headache, changes in behavior, confusion, drowsiness. It can lead to seizures, coma or death, but if it is caught, it can be treated with diuretics to increase urination or IV fluids to replace electrolytes. The high school principal, Tim Scott, informed students of Zyrees' death on Monday and said grief counselors were at the school to help. 'We are saddened to inform you of the death of Zyrees Oliver, a senior at Douglas County High School,' the statment to students said. 'He passed away early this morning.' Zyrees, who regularly shared photos showing him posing in his football uniform to social networking sites, hoped to play football in college and held a 3.8 GPA. His family moved from New Jersey to Georgia for a fresh start a year ago, but Zyrees quickly settled in and was a natural leader on and off the football field, his relatives said. He is survived by his parents and three brothers. His family is now raising money on a gofundme page to fly his body to New Jersey. An autopsy will be conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations to determine the cause of his death. While rare, water intoxication is caused when too much water is consumed in a short period of time, diluting other nutrients in the body and putting pressure on the brain. If not treated, it can lead to coma or death.","Zyrees Oliver's family switched off his life support on Monday .

Zakiam, 18, and Mohammad Ali, 21, now live together following their nuptials, but they still need round-the-clock protection for fear that they might be attacked by those who oppose the marriage. The couple, who grew up on neighbouring farms have been together for four years, but eloped because her family did not approve of their marriage. A young couple dubbed 'Afghanistan's Romeo and Juliet' from different ethnic groups fear for their lives after getting married. Zakiam, 18, and Mohammad Ali, 21, now live together following their nuptials . They were so fearful of Zakia's family's reaction that they even had their honeymoon in hiding - they stayed in the homes of friends and they slept rough in caves. Her parents were reportedly angered that Zakia, an ethnic Tajik, and a Sunni Muslim, would bring shame on the family by marrying Mohammad Ali, an ethnic Hazara, and Shia. After their marriage Zakia's parents reportedly threatened to kill her to defend the family's honour, claiming that Zakia was already married (without her consent) to a relative. Mohammad was arrested for 'kidnapping' Zakia and after a high-profile case he was acquitted of the charges. The couple, who grew up on neighbouring farms have been together for four years, but eloped because her family did not approve of their marriage . The couple now live with Mohammad Ali's extended family. His father who initially opposed the marriage now supports the union. 'I witnessed my sons' suffering. Zakia's family are still threatening us,' his father told the BBC. But Zakia's father told the media all he wants is for his daughter to return. The couple are not convinced and Mohammed Ali's father and brothers take turns patrolling outside their room at night to protect them from the alleged death threats. Human Right's Watch says that the couple's plight illustrates how abusive and pervasive the interpretation and punishment of moral crimes remains in Afghanistan. The organisation says that some 95 percent of girls and 50 percent of women imprisoned in Afghanistan had been accused or convicted of 'moral crimes,' such as running away from home or(sex outside of marriage). These moral crimes usually involve flight from unlawful forced marriages or domestic violence.","Zakiam, 18, and Mohammad Ali, 21, now live together following their nuptials .

A six-year-old boy hit by a car and killed on his way to school may have run out onto the road because he was upset he had been denied sweets, an inquest has heard. Jayden Nash died of severe brain injuries 10 days after he raced out into the road moments after stepping off a bus. His mother Jordan Johnson said Jayden was normally very careful when crossing the road but may have run ahead that day because he was in a strop after she refused to buy him sweets. Dawn Jolleys was driving past with her husband and children when she saw something out of the corner of her eye but, despite braking instantly, could not prevent the car hitting Jayden and throwing him nearly 30 metres down the road. His mother, Jordan Johnson, did not see the crash but heard a bang and then ran screaming into the road when she realised what had happened. Jayden was airlifted to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital where doctors spent 10 days battling to save his life, but their efforts were in vain and he died on February 15 from a severe traumatic brain injury. Delivering a verdict of accidental death yesterday, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter described it as a 'tragic' incident. Mr Salter said: 'It’s many parents’ biggest nightmare, this type of situation. 'All that parents can do is educate and remind children about the dangers of crossing the road, but of course children are impulsive by nature.' Jayden left his home in Marlborough Close, Faringdon, Oxfordshire, at around 7.45am on February 5 with his mother and two siblings and were joined by a neighbour’s child. After dropping one of the children at nursery, the group went to catch a bus to Watchfield, Oxfordshire. Arriving in Faringdon Road, Watchfield, at about 8.20am, Jayden and the neighbour’s child got off the bus ahead of his mother, who was struggling with a pushchair. The two children walked to the back of the bus just as Mrs Jolleys was driving down the road in her white Audi Q5 with her husband and their two young children. In evidence, she told the inquest in Oxford, Oxfordshire, that she was driving under the 40mph speed limit past the bus when she saw movement out of the corner of her eye. Although she hadn’t yet seen Jayden, she automatically started braking. Mrs Jolleys said: 'As I was braking I then clearly saw a young boy run across the road from behind the rear of the bus. I remember shouting ‘stop’ but he kept running out. He did not seem to look at me, as if he did not see my car. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion, there was nothing I could do.' The accident occurred on Faringdon Road, Watchfiield, when Jayden suddenly ran out from behind a bus . Jayden was hit by the front of the car, thrown nearly 30 metres down the road as the Audi screeched to a halt. On the pavement, Ms Johnson was just a few metres away from Jayden. She said in evidence: 'As I got to the back end of the bus I heard a bang and saw something flying across the road. It looked like something you would see on TV. I left my daughter in the pushchair and ran across the road. I then realised it was Jayden on the ground and he had been hit by a car.' Mrs Jolleys’ husband Guy rushed to Jayden’s side while she remained in the car 'shocked and traumatised'. Medical teams spent days trying to save him but by February 14 it was clear his injuries were not survivable and he was pronounced dead at 4.24am the next day. An investigation into the crash placed no fault on Mrs Jolleys, who was travelling at around 36mph and had less than a second to react to the incident. Police constable James Henderson told the inquest: 'There does not appear to be anything that the driver of the Audi could have done to avoid the collision.'","Six-year-old Jayden Nash was hit by a car and killed on his way to school .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Not installing anti-virus and security software on new devices such as laptops and mobiles means that almost half of us are at risk from cyber attacks. That is the view of the National Crime Agency (NCA), which is launching a new campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of not protecting yourself online. The campaign is calling for internet users to be 'cyber streetwise' and take steps to better protect themselves. The initiative is being led by the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) in partnership with a Government campaign. Scroll down for video . The campaign is calling for internet users to be 'cyber streetwise' and take steps to better protect themselves . According to the Office of National Statistics, there were more than 10,000 victims of computer viruses in the UK last year, with most being preventable had adequate security software been in place. The new campaign wants to improve cyber common sense and cut down on the amount of security breaches that occur from opening malicious emails or using infected USB sticks - both of which are cited as common issues among web users. Jamie Saunders, the director of the NCCU, said: 'The internet is a great place to explore the world and do business, and the majority of people won't experience any problems. But for the minority who leave themselves unprotected, not downloading and updating their security software can be very costly. 'It's tricky to put exact figures on the cost of cyber crime to the UK and the number of people who don't protect themselves, but what we do know is that far too many people continue to put themselves and others at risk online. 'However, the cost to individuals not only hits their pockets but also their personal and family life, which is why it's important that everyone takes steps to protect their computer, tablet and mobile.' The NCA is offering four key tips to users in order to improve web security; encouraging users to install security software, not open emails from unknown sources, take caution with USB sticks and CDs, and buy software from legitimate sources only. The year 2014 has seen a series of high-profile cyber security issues, including the Heartbleed bug that affected the encryption and protection of personal data online, as well as the hacking of eBay's servers that saw passwords and user names compromised. These incidents have increased the focus on web security, particularly when paired with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden's continued calls for users to do more to protect data from government snooping, as well as hackers. According to statistics, almost 40 per cent of adults rarely install or update the security software on new devices, leaving them at risk. It is these sort of statistics that have prompted this initiative, say the Government. According to statistics, almost 40 per cent of adults rarely install or update the security software on new devices, leaving them at risk . Organised crime minister Karen Bradley said: 'The internet has radically changed the way we work and socialise, but cyber crime now poses a serious threat to the UK, and the Government has taken action to transform the way we respond. 'Through the National Cyber Security Programme, we have dedicated £860million over five years to make the UK one of the most secure places in the world to go online. The NCA works with police forces to pursue those involved in criminal activity. 'This campaign, which draws on the NCA's experiences in fighting cyber crime, sheds light on some of the ways in which malware can operate. But it also shows there are a few simple steps that we can all take to reduce the chances of falling victim to cyber crime and ensure we can keep enjoying the benefits of the internet.' However, Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge University  Computer Laboratory is highly critical of the security industry that has grown up around so-called cybercrime. Prof Anderson believes that attempts to regulate the internet are doomed to fail and are a waste of time and money. In 2011 a report was issued claiming that the UK was losing £27billion a year to cybercrime.  Prof Anderson and his colleagues decided to carry out an investigation into the real cost of cybercrime to the state, businesses and citizens. Their report completely demolished the official figures and found out that the cost of fighting cybercrime was greater than the cost of the crimes themselves. Prof Anderson said that true cost of cybercrime to each citizen is about £1 a year while the cost of fighting crime is more than £10 each a year. 'Almost all the cost of cybercrime is the cost of anticipation,' he added. Apache web-server guru Ben Laurie, the pioneer of SSL – the 'secure sockets layer' that keeps web transactions secure, decries the use of anti-virus software, which he says 'doesn't really work, It has a high false negative rate .'","National Crime Agency is launching new campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of not protecting yourself online .

Producers Hat Trick said the decision to film in Kent was for budgetary reasons. 'Whilst Boomers is set in the fictional town of Thurnemouth in Norfolk, the seaside scenes were actually shot in Herne Bay in Kent,' a spokeswoman said. When asked why, she said: 'Simple budgetary reasons I’m afraid.'

Hunstanton Mayor Carol Bower said: 'It’s a real shame that it’s not being filmed in Hunstanton. 'We are massively different to Kent and it would have done wonders for us.' She added: 'Hopefully the BBC have done their research - it would bug me a little if the show is misleading. 'We are a very proud Victorian style town, so for people here it would be odd if the place looked nothing like Hunstanton.'

"By . Martin Robinson . Case: Nick Venn was unfairly dismissed from his job running security for a company who used their technology to spy on him, a tribunal heard . A security expert has been handed £38,000 in compensation after his bosses used the CCTV system he ran to spy on him before giving him the sack, a tribunal has ruled. Ex-Army bomb disposal man Nick Venn had worked at the £230 million Princesshay shopping centre in Exeter, Devon, until he was unfairly dismissed after three years there. The 51-year-old earned commendations from the police and planned security for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee visit but then fell out with his bosses at Europa Facility Services Ltd. They wrongly used CCTV to monitor his movements, but were unable to find him doing anything wrong, it emerged during the case. Mr Venn told his employment tribunal that his problems started when a fellow security worker made threats against him because of an issue over paternity leave. 'It came to my attention that X had threatened to go to the local gypsy camp to pay people to beat me up, wreck my car and burn my house down. Naturally I was extremely concerned by these threats and accordingly reported them,' he said. He said there was no investigation by the company, Europa Facility Services Ltd, into his allegation, the worker was not suspended and so Mr Venn reported the matter to the police a week later. The tribunal judge ruled that the outcome of this was that Mr Venn was himself 'on the wrong end of the disciplinary procedure' and suspended from work before he was sacked in February 2013. The worker X made counter allegations which 'were then pursued to the exclusion of the original complaint', said the judge. Mr Venn claimed unfair dismissal and the judge ruled that it was not a fair dismissal and awarded him the £38,000 compensation. He had told the tribunal that his former bosses said that most of the security team were 'useless' and 'needed replacing'. He said: 'I was held responsible for acting on a ""hit list"" compiled by the company . 'Despite the pressure from management to dismiss security officers for little more than their face was not fitting, I ensured that I only investigated where there were credible issues to be investigated.' Workplace: Mr Venn was handed £38,000 in compensation after losing his job at the £230million Princesshay shopping centre in Exeter, Devon (pictured) He said the 20 strong team gave him the nickname 'hatchet man' but said most of the people on the hit list were still working there when he was sacked. Mr Venn said he suffered ill health after his sacking and said his marriage almost broke down due to the financial strain. He said: 'I went from hero to zero. My name ended up on that his list. There was a culture of getting rid of people. There was massive turnover of staff, crazy dismissals.' His Exeter based solicitor Terry Falcao who represented him at the tribunal which Europa Facility Services Ltd did not attend, said: 'Europa's senior management failed to act when he blew the whistle on a subordinate who made serious threats to assault him and to burn his house down. 'Instead management pursued trivial complaints against him by one of his subordinates, misused the CCTV in Princesshay to spy on him and other employees and unjustly dismissed him. 'This was a very difficult year for my client who was brave enough to take on and win a claim against a company employing 4,500 workers and turning over £180million. 'He lost his career and his life was turned upside down. Yet Mr Venn was by all accounts a model employee.' Europa Facility Services Ltd has so far failed to comment.","Nick Venn, 51, won awards for his security work but was unfairly dismissed .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . June Whitfield, star of comedy show Terry and June, has criticised BBC executives for turning middle class into a 'dirty word' She made her name as the star of a quintessential middle class sitcom. So June Whitfield is more than qualified to defend such shows amid claims that BBC bosses think there’s too many of them. The Terry and June actress, now 88, has attacked the corporation for turning ‘middle class’ into a ‘dirty word’ by concentrating too much on blue collar comedies. Miss Whitfield, who appears in new BBC1 show Boomers, said it was ‘extraordinary’ that bawdy comedies such as Mrs Brown’s Boys are preferred to gentler shows such as Miranda. She criticised a recent BBC Trust report which accused BBC1 of ‘playing it safe’ and found viewers from ‘lower social grade audiences’ considered its comedy to be too middle class. Appearing at the launch of Boomers – which follows the lives of a group of retired friends – Miss Whitfield was asked whether she agreed with the BBC Trust report and felt the middle class should be ‘written off’. She replied: ‘No I don’t. It’s one of my big bugbears. There are so many middle class folk about the place that it’s almost become a dirty word. [When they say] “Oh no, it’s too middle class”, what do they mean? They are people.’ Last month the BBC Trust said Miranda, starring Miranda Hart, was an example of the sort of sitcom audiences found too middle class ‘in focus and target audience’. It highlighted Mrs Brown’s Boys, which stars Irish actor Brendan O’Carroll as a foul-mouthed matriarch, as an example of a successful working-class comedy. But Miss Whitfield said she disliked such brash and crude comedies. She said: ‘It’s quite extraordinary that everything has to be in your face.’ Speaking at the same event, TV executive Jimmy Mulville – whose production company Hat Trick made Boomers – said the BBC Trust’s findings were ‘very unhelpful’. Scroll down for video . Miss Whitfield objected to 'in your face' comedies such as Mrs Brown's Boys, which a recent BBC report highlighted as a successful working class comedy . He said: ‘To legislate for drama and comedy by saying it is too middle class, too common, too posh – on that basis you’d be doing comedy by slide rule. You’d have no Downton Abbey, you wouldn’t have Outnumbered.’ Miss Whitfield found fame in the 1970s and 1980s in Terry and June. She once supported Tony Hancock and Frankie Howerd, starred in Absolutely Fabulous and has made appearances in Doctor Who and Midsomer Murders. Miranda was narrowly beaten in the ratings by Mrs Brown’s Boys when the shows went head to head last year. Miranda averaged 7.1million viewers, just short of the 7.3million who watched Mrs Brown’s Boys half an hour later. The BBC Trust said its report reflected viewers’ opinions and it did not endorse the view that BBC comedy was too middle class. Boomers starts this Friday on BBC1 at 9pm.

Sportsmail revealed on Friday that the Toffees had arranged for the Ghana international to spend the 2014/15 campaign at Goodison Park, something Martinez has now confirmed. The details of the loan agreement have been sorted between the two clubs, with a work permit the only thing preventing Atsu from becoming Everton's fifth signing of the summer. On the move: Chelsea and Ghana winger Christian Atsu is set to join Everton on a season-long loan deal . Busy: Everton boss Roberto Martinez is still keen to sign another striker before the transfer window closes . Martinez told the Liverpool Echo: 'Everything has been agreed with Christian - it's just a matter of finalising little details more with his work permit and personal situation. 'That will probably take a couple of days to get sorted but we have an agreement in principle to make the move as a loan deal until the end of the season.' Atsu, who spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem, will join new recruits Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway. The 22-year-old could be eligible to face Leicester City at the King Power Stadium this weekend, but he will be unable to face Chelsea when Jose Mourinho's side visit Merseyside on August 30.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . It was a one-of-a-kind First World War prototype fighter plane, armed with a 45 horsepower engine, a 20-foot wingspan and a Lewis gun. Now, the Port Victoria P.V.8 Eastchurch Kitten has been brought back to life - 100 years after the war began. But while the replica has been built using an original wooden frame, it also includes recycled materials, such as the engine of a Citroen 2CV. Back to life: Volunteers Brian Watmough (left) and Grant Sparks (right) pose with a replica of the Eastchurch Kitten prototype. The aircraft has been built using an original wooden frame and the engine of a Citroen 2CV . Framework: Around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the Yorkshire Air Museum, working from only two photographs and faded plans. Above, the reproduction's original wooden framework . Powering up: Mr Sparks works on the plane's 500cc twin-opposed engine, featuring twin-opposed cylinders . Armed: Mr Watmough poses with the aircraft's Lewis gun, which was mounted on to the aircraft's top wing . Around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the Yorkshire Air Museum - working from only two photographs and faded A3 plans. They created the replica using a wooden frame covered in linen, as well as specifically-made materials, such as the engine cowlings, and recycled materials, including the 500cc Citroen engine. Ian Reed, manager at the museum in Elvington, York, said the £10,000 restoration project had been 'very exciting'. 'This is the only plane of its kind in existence. It would have disappeared from history if we hadn't brought it back to life with this project,' he said. Prototype: The Eastchurch Kitten, featuring a 45 horsepower engine, made its first flight in September 1917 . Fighter plane: It was designed as a 'high altitude' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the Zeppelin Airships. However, the one-seater aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production . 'It's been quite tricky as we've been working from faded plans so it's important that we've got people with specific knowledge. 'It's also been a very interesting build because it's so tiny, with a six-metre wingspan and measuring five metres in length. Weights . Take-off weight - 266kg . Empty weight - 154kg . Dimensions .

The Eastchurch Kitten, which made its first flight on September 1, 1917, was designed by the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain. Established by the British Royal Naval Air Service in 1915, the Depot created and tested a range of experimental aircraft - not all of which were flown. Featuring a 45 horsepower engine, the . Eastchurch Kitten was designed as a 'high altitude' fighter to tackle . the threat posed by the Zeppelin Airships. It was planned to be launched from platforms on battleships, cruisers of even torpedo boats. However, the aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production. The framework of the replica was crafted in the 1980s, before being abandoned and taken up again four years ago. To create it, volunteers sourced the twin-opposed Citroen 2CV engine, which features similar twin-opposed cylinders. Historic: Volunteers used instruments from the national collection archives for the replica's cockpit (pictured) Prepared to fire: The Lewis gun (pictured) was a key feature of the original First World War fighter plane . They then stripped these down to make the equipment light, before removing any 'unnecessary' parts, such as the cooling fans and starter motor. They also managed to acquire a propellor from one of the museum's local flying clubs. However, many of the aircraft's parts had to be specially crafted, such as the cowlings covering the engine, which have to be made out of spinning aluminum. Instruments . inside the cockpit were acquired from the national collection archives, . while the seating and padding around the controls were made with . leather. A Lewis gun, mounted on to the top wing of the aircraft, was also designed to measure. Four years' work: The replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum's Thunder Day shows on April 6 . Mr Reed said: 'The Eastchurch Kitten was to be a disposable, one-operation aircraft - to simply go up, intercept and shoot down the airship, then ditch in the sea. 'When you work on it, you think this must have been quite a frightening prospect. Somebody had to get into this tiny aircraft and get up to ten or 15,000 feet with such a small engine, shoot at the huge airship, then crash into the sea and get out as soon as they could. 'But there were people willing to do it - some very gutsy people.'

"By . Sarah Michael For Daily Mail Australia . The richest man in China is expanding his commercial property empire into Australia with plans to invest $1.7 billion in local real estate developments. Wang Jianlin's Hong Kong-based conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has announced the launch of Wanda Australia including a major $971 million investment in The Jewel resort on the Gold Coast, and is on the hunt for property in Sydney. In a statement the company said it would purchase a controlling 60 per cent stake in The Jewel at Surfer's Paradise where it would build the city's first five-star hotel and apartment complex on the beachfront. Wang Jianlin became the richest man on mainland China last year, according to Forbes, with an estimated wealth of $US15.9 billion ($17.1 billion) Chinese company Wanda Commercial Properties announced the launch of Wanda Australia as well as a major $971 million investment in The Jewel resort on the Gold Coast (pictured) Roland Evans, director of Gold Coast-based Canford Property Group, has been working closely with Wanda and said the company is also looking for property in Sydney . 'With a planned gross floor area of 146,000 square meters, the project will comprise three towers, one of which will be a five-star hotel, while the other two will house serviced apartments,' the statement read. 'The project's central park, conference rooms, restaurants, bars and other entertainment facilities will be located directly on the beachfront.' The joint venture with Chinese company Ridong Group will begin construction in 2015 and open in 2018. Mr Wang became the richest man on mainland China last year, according to Forbes, with an estimated wealth of $US15.9 billion ($17.1 billion). He visited Australia in June to inspect properties and to meet with Trade Minister Andrew Robb, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate. Wanda's expansion in Australia is part of the company's aim to be the world's largest hotel chain with plans to build at least 15 hotels in 15 cities by 2020. The project will comprise three towers, one of which will be a five-star hotel, while the other two will house serviced apartments . The project's central park, conference rooms, restaurants, bars and other entertainment facilities will be located directly on the beachfront . Roland Evans, director of Gold Coast-based Canford Property Group, has been working closely with Wanda and said the company is also looking for property in Sydney. 'It's no secret that they're actively looking for an opportunity in Sydney, just about everybody in the property game knows of their desire,' Mr Evans told Daily Mail Australia. When asked what other specific projects were in the pipeline, Mr Evans said: 'I can't comment on that, they're in negotiations… I'm bound to secrecy.' Chinese tourism and expenditure in Australia is growing rapidly, with Tourism Research Australia figures showing that Chinese visitor expenditure grew by 15.1 percent (or $670 million) to reach $5.1 billion in the year ending March 2014. Mr Evans said Wanda's Jewel investment would accelerate this further on the Gold Coast. Mr Wang, pictured in April, wants Wanda to be the world's largest hotel chain with plans to build at least 15 hotels in 15 cities by 2020 . In a statement Wanda said it would purchase a controlling 60 per cent stake in The Jewel at Surfer's Paradise . 'This is the best thing to happen to the Gold Coast in many, many years,' he said. 'In China Wanda dominate the market in as much as when Wanda goes somewhere the rest follow. 'So a lot of analysts will be closely studying Wanda's move into the Gold Coast and our perceiving is it will act as a catalyst for a lot of investment.' Mr Evans said Mr Wang's desire was to make Wanda the world's largest hotel operator 'within a very short space of time'. 'That will be a massive draw for Chinese tourists who aren't aware of the Gold Coast to come visit,' he said. The company said the Jewel would be the city's first five-star hotel and apartment complex on the beachfront . The Jewel has a planned gross floor area of 146,000 square meters . 'They know their biggest brand is there with their hotel so for them it really is a no brainer.' Mayor Tate said the Gold Coast was in the midst of a 'renaissance' in the lead up to the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . An insulted mother has vowed to boycott a Sydney café after she claims she was told to leave because she had her 11 month-old son in a pram. Jessica Smith says her relaxing morning coffee date with a friend ended in complete humiliation when she was forced to leave the almost empty Gnome Café in Surry Hills after she said the manager told her there was no room for her baby’s pram. ‘I found it offensive and unreasonable – if it was a bar I would understand,’ the Redfern resident told Daily Mail Australia. ‘You would think that mums would be bread and butter for a lot of these places.’ Jessica Smith was kicked out of a cafe because her 11-month-old son  Benjamin was in a pram (pictured) The Gnome cafe manager said parents and babies were always welcome but there was no space for prams in the small cafe in Surry Hills . The 35-year-old said she deliberately positioned the pram against a wall in a corner. ‘There was only one person sitting inside and one person on an outside table - then when I walked past an hour later there was no one in there,’ she said. She said will never go back  to the cafe after the humiliating experience of being turfed out. Ms Smith was so gobsmacked by the incident that she posted her outrage on Facebook saying: ‘Wow, just told we can't have coffee at Gnome on crown because we have a baby with us! Won't be going back there.' The Gnome café manager declined to comment to Daily Mail Australia but replied to a friend of Ms Smith’s who complained on the cafe’s Facebook page. The manger said children of any age were welcome in the cafe but because it was small, there wasn't enough room for prams inside. But Ms Smith said it didn't make sense that prams were not allowed. ‘Essentially he could have asked us to go to an outside table if it was genuinely a space/business issue,' she said. Ms Smith's post sparked a similar reaction from other disgusted mothers . Ms Smith (pictured with her son Benjamin) was humiliated when she was told to leave the cafe . The post sparked a similar reaction from other disgusted mothers. One mother said that type of attitude went out ‘centuries ago’ while another described the incident as discrimination. Another suggested that ordering alcohol would have been met with a different response. ‘But I'm sure if you'd asked for a whiskey or wine they would have happily indulged!’ The woman said: ‘Shame on you for not allowing parents with babies to have coffee on your premises! Will make sure all my friends know about this and we certainly won't be visiting whether we have baby in tow or not!’ The manager’s responded to the comment explaining that although parents and children of any age were always welcome but ‘because we are a small cafe though we just don't have enough space to have prams inside.’ A friend of Ms Smith's was so outraged that she complained on the cafe's Facebook page .","A mother claims she was told to leave Sydney café because her son in a pram .

"By . Amanda Williams . The haunting blog of a musician  - detailing his battle with depression and telling his loved ones 'not to be sad I'm gone'- has appeared online days after he died. It is believed Brett . Robertshaw timed the post for after his death - with the line: 'If this post is live . I’m probably not here any more.' The talented musician was found in his bedroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, by his aunt on July 5 - seven days before the blog appeared. The haunting blog of musician Brett Robertshaw detailing his battle with depression and telling his loved ones 'not to be sad I'm gone' has appeared online, days after he died . It is believed he set up up a delay on the post going live. It chronicled the 21-year-old’s fight with depression and the stigma attached to it. Mr Robertshaw wrote: 'I’ve felt nothing towards family members, friends, or otherwise acquainted people, as much as I’ve felt that I should, like any normal functioning being. 'No matter how many good things happened to me or the people surrounding me, I didn’t seem to feel any positive emotion at all. 'The truth is, I’ve felt suicidal since I was in high school, and told nobody of it until very recently. The only comfort to me for the past six to seven years has been knowing that if I don't get better, if I can’t deal with things, or if things become too much for me to cope with, I have a way out. 'It may seem strange to read, but I guess I saw death as my best pal. 'Nobody is to blame for this, except myself. It’s entirely my own fault, and only my own lack of willpower and strength of mind is to blame. My inability to cope with things is the killer here. The talented musician was found in his bedroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, by his aunt on July 5 - seven days before the blog appeared . 'Don't be sad that I’m gone, just be happy that I’m not suffering any longer.' Now his mother is pleading with other troubled people to seek help after her 'loving, caring and sensitive' son wrote about his own tragic death. Cheryl Robertshaw, 46, said: 'We thought if we could raise some awareness about mental health problems, that there is help out there, but people need to be made aware of it. 'Phone numbers and things are not given to people and if it can raise awareness for one other family, can help somebody and their family and stop them going down the route that Brett did - just anything to help. 'It can stop a family going through what we are going through at the moment.' In the blog, found by police, the games store worker talked about his concerns about maintaining friendships, anti-depressants, his use of alcohol, his attempts at finding help and bullying at school, which he said sparked his depression. Mrs Robertshaw said: 'He talked to me about how he felt - he went out at 3am in the morning once. I texted him saying come home and he did. When he came back he broke down crying, saying ""I’ve got depression"". 'He said ""nothing feels like it should"". I checked with him every day and he would say he was OK. He said he didn't want to worry me - it was the type of lad he was. 'The day before he died he came bounding down the stairs saying ""old woman are you not in bed yet?"" He had a wicked sense of humour. 'He came down to let the dog out - absolutely no different to usual. I had to go to hospital and could hear him pottering about. I spoke to him, told him where I was going and that was the last I heard of him.' She added: 'Open up and talk to anyone - there is help out there. There are . organisations out there - so many organisations. If you are feeling that . way there is extra help. We want to get the message out there For . friends, for family, there is help out there. 'For that one person, if it helps it is worth it.' His body was found by his aunty, Kelly Dixon, 35, in his bedroom. She said: 'I think that is another thing, the fact that it did take him a long, long time to pluck up the courage to speak to a doctor, because there is such a stigma. He was such a young lad, it is not something often spoken about and the fact he was on medication and had been referred for counselling, but these things take so long. It is believed Mr Robertshaw timed the post to go online after his death - with the opening line: 'If this post is live I'm probably not here any more' 'There is not enough help for them out there.' 'It was devastating when I found him. The blog made us understand what he was going through - he left a note to the family. 'It was a shock a week later when the blog was posted, saying why. We had no idea to the extent - it was such a surprise.' She added: 'He had the best sense of humour ever. He was so sarcastic and . would wind you up. He was caring, sensitive, thoughtful and creative. 'He was in a band. Music was a massive part of his life.' Mr Robertshaw’s funeral was held on July 17 at Lytham Crematorium, with the popular musician receiving messages from fans as far away as London, Kent and Scandinavia. His grandmother, Margaret Robertshaw, 68, said: 'It’s just so tragic that somebody so talented couldn’t get the help he needed. His family - including his mother Cheryl and sister Suzanne are now calling for more help for those with mental health problems . 'He didn’t want to admit to it because of the stigma of what people thought and it’s wrong.' His family said he had planned to go to Japan next year and teach English to students. A spokesman from Lancashire Police confirmed the body of a 21-year-old man was found on July 5. He added the death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner’s office. An inquest has yet to be held. Ms Dixon added: 'We are all going to have our regrets about not picking up on signs, but if you have friends or a young relative who is struggling - somehow try and get through to them. 'There should not be a stigma - years ago it used to be cancer, the ‘big c’. Now it is mental health and it should not be a stigma anymore'.

Great Britain's Hannah Cockroft was delighted after she broke her own world record with a stunning performance in the 200m T34 race on the opening day of the IPC Athletics Grand Prix in Nottwil, Switzerland. The 21-year-old multi-world and Paralympic champion powered past her previous best time by 0.37 seconds as she came home in 30.86secs to beat a strong field that included six of the eight finalists at the London 2012 Games. Cockfroft, from Halifax, said: 'It was great to post such a fast time in my first IPC Athletics Grand Prix of the season.

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . A large fire has torn through several businesses in the main street of Nimbin destroying the northern NSW town's museum and well-known Rainbow Cafe. As many as 34 firefighters and nine trucks were at the scene fighting to control the fire on Cullen Street which had one lane now open to traffic but the other lane and footpath would still be closed for some hours. Despite the best efforts of firefighters, the blaze destroyed the cafe, adjoining museum and the Tribal Magic store - along with half the Bringabong shop before being brought under control. Police say it was too early to say whether there ware suspicious circumstances and also quashed rumours that there had been an arrest over the fire. However, Inspector Doug Connors said asbestos was a possibility as the buildings were old. Scroll down for video . As many as nine trucks and 34 firefighters fought the blaze in Nimbin . An overnight fire destroyed Nimbin's Rainbow Cafe and damaged several buildings in the main street . Several other buildings on Cullen Street suffered fire, smoke and water damage from the overnight blaze, although no-one was injured, Superintendent Michael Brett from the Rural Fire Service said. 'The reports we have is that the Rainbow Cafe has been destroyed, the museum which adjoins that has been destroyed, and there is another business adjoining the museum which has been destroyed,' he said. Museum manager Michael Balderstone told ABC Local Radio the loss of the buildings would have a 'huge impact' on the town, which is famed for its drug history and alternative culture. 'It's really right in the middle of town, the Rainbow's probably the heart,' said. 'The museum's the biggest tourist attraction. It's a bloody mess.' The fire has been extinguished and police will start investigations, said Mr Shepherd. Balderstone, who has spent the past 30 years working and building the Nimbin Museum, said he understood this morning's fire started at the back of the Rainbow Cafe before spreading to the museum. Mr Balderstone told The Northern Star that the fire was a 'kick in the guts' for Nimbin, but admits it could have been much worse. He said Nimbin's fire crew arrived at the scene quickly and had been working to stop it leaping across the narrow gap to the neighbouring Nimbin Real Estate when instead it leapt the laneway between the cafe and the museum.

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Australian music legend Richard Clapton has compared himself to Rolling Stone's rocker Keith Richards, but said his 40-year career was not all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. 'People only talk about the negative aspects of drug taking,' the singer-songwriter and producer told Daily Mail Australia. 'That drug culture did fuel so much creativity in the '70s and '80s.' 'I'm not a drug advocate and I don't condone it... (but) I don't express regret for how I lived or how my friends lived. 'I'm Australia's Keith Richard, but you'll need a medical expert to explain it.' Scroll down for video . Australian rocker Richard Clapton has reflected on his 40-year career in his autobiography, but said readers will need to fill in some of the blanks . Clapton was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1999 and has produced a number of solo hits and albums. He is pictured left at the Rockin' For Rights concert at Sydney Cricket Ground in 2007 and right at the Albert Memorial in London in 1968 . Reflecting on his once 'decadent lifestyle', Clapton, who declined to reveal his age, said while weed and alcohol were his vices, he does not use any drugs now. 'Acid was big back then, but not in my case,' he said. 'It's a very conservative world we live in now - my period was the hippie period. A lot of the things people find shocking these days were normal 30 or 40 years ago,' he said. Born in Sydney, Clapton is most remembered for solo hits including Girls on the Avenue in 1975 and I Am an Island in 1982 and also as a member of The Party Boys. He has just released his touted tell-all autobiography The Best Years of Our Lives, but admits he has been coy about some details of his past, leaving readers to 'fill in the blanks'. 'My book could have been different,' he said. 'I'm keeping it gritty without the specifics... all my generation know exactly what was going on.' 'They can fill in the blanks without losing the essence of the story. The rocker has called himself Australia's Keith Richards but said only a medical expert could explain it . The singer-songwriter has also produced an album for INXS and has worked with Cold Chisel during his career . 'I could have made stronger comments 30 to 40 years ago if I was writing the book then because that hippie drug culture was the norm.' However the rocker said he believed the world would see a new wave of 'hippie culture' in the future because 'life is cyclical'. Clapton has 24-year-old twin daughters and said their lives are vastly different from his own, although one is currently in a retro band. 'My daughters have shown no interest in that sort of culture - they don't even drink let alone do drugs,' he said. When asked how he would feel if his daughters took drugs, Clapton said it was not a quandary that affected him. 'Modern drugs are a worry, because they're man-made,' he said. 'If my daughters had shown any interest in that lifestyle I'm not even sure how I would react - I'd educate them the best I can. 'They've leap frogged over me. They aren't interested in the lifestyle I lived.' Clapton, pictured in a London cemetery in the '70s, enjoyed the highs of working in music during the 'hippie culture' but said the focus was always the music . Clapton said today's drug and drinking culture was vastly different from what he experienced in the '70s and '80s. 'Hippies and generation X were able to drink so much and not attract so much negativity,' he said. 'In the '70s and '80s, bands like mine would play four to five nights a week. Fans would come three or four times a week and work at 9am, that's why it was called pub rock. 'Nowadays I don't know why there's so much bizarre drunkenness - people aren't happy drunks.' During his career, the 1999 ARIA Hall of Fame inductee said a highlight was working with INXS. 'For me it was life changing,' he said. 'The first time I saw them, they were playing a gig to nobody in Paddington. Their attitude was amazing,' he said. 'They had amazing work ethic.' 'About 13 years later I saw them playing to 25,000 people in Paris - every gig was killer, they were all killer and no filler. The performer, pictured in Berlin in 1983, said meeting INXS was a life changing experience . After meeting INXS, Clapton forged a 33-year friendship with Jon Farriss, pictured together right, and said he was devastated when 'good mate' Michael Hutchence died . Clapton produced one of the group's first big hits, The Loved One, in 1981 and went on to start producing their second album Underneath the Colours that same year. 'The important thing to remember, INXS and most of the musicians I know who were part of that culture were extremely prolific - a lot of killer songs came out of the '70s and '80s,' he said. 'It wasn't a matter of us just sitting around starring at our feet - drugs were on the periphery but weren't the driving force. First was always music.' Becoming 'good mates' with members including Michael Hutchence and Jon Farriss, Clapton said he was devastated at the loss of the group's lead singer - one of the biggest losses and lows he has experienced in his 40-year career. 'I thought Michael was amazing - the most special human I ever met. It was a loss for humanity,' he said. 'Because his death was so unexpected it exacerbated the impact - I was shattered.' Clapton said Farriss, who he shares a 33-year friendship with, has produced and played on some of his albums. Clapton produced INXS' second album Underneath the Colours after first working with them in 1981 . During his career, Clapton has worked and forged strong friendships with members of Cold Chisel including Ian Moss and Jimmy Barnes (pictured together from left) Clapton has also worked with Cold Chisel and its members throughout his career. 'Ian Moss has played on most (my) albums in the last 30 years, and Jimmy (Barnes) has been on quite a bit too. Despite his own success, Clapton said he would not advise people to get into the music business today and even advised one of his daughters not to join a band. 'The music world is entirely different today. It's based on a whole knew sort of attitude to music,' he said. Clapton said music was a 'pure art' in his day and not about the money. 'It was frowned upon if you said you wanted to be a pop or rock star. It was all about the musicianmanship,' he said. 'It was pretty tough when I was getting into it (music) but now it's impossibly tough. Young people have brief success - you blink and it's gone.' 'I didn't want to be a pop star, but my album Goodbye Tiger (released in 1977) put me on the map as an entity and now I have a cult audience who are still with me today.' The rocker said he has no regrets and his life was full of love thanks to his twin daughters . Autobiography The Best Years of Our Lives details Clapton's music career . With no intention of becoming a rock star, Clapton said his initial plan was just to be a songwriter. 'I've grown to love performing,' he said. 'I can tell you what a great ride this has been but until I've painted my masterpiece I will keep on going and I don't think I've painted it yet.' Despite 40 years in the business, Clapton said he had no regrets. 'I've got two beautiful daughters and there is a lot of love in the room,' he said. 'What I try and instil in my daughters is do something with their lives. That's really the key to longevity. Take on new challenges. 'Songwriting is the best vocation you can have. I'm never going to be resting on my laurels or say: ""I've written some great songs so I don't have to try anymore"".' 'It's very cathartic - get out of the f*****g gym and write if you want to be happy for the rest of your life.'

"By . Amanda Platell . On my bedside table I have a picture of me lying on the sofa hugging Jim. It’s a bit blurry because it was taken with an old-fashioned Polaroid camera, but it is precious because it’s the last picture of me together with my beloved old ginger tom. When it was taken, I knew Jim’s days were numbered, but even then we weren’t quite ready to let go of each other. As anyone who has welcomed a cat into their home as part of the family will recognise, however sick they get, however skinny and matted, you know when there’s life in the old furball yet — and when it’s time to let them go. And so do they. Old favourites: Amanda Platell's treasured Polaroid picture of her old ginger tom Jim who has since died . No vet, no friend even, can make that decision for you. It’s a heartbreaking pact you and your pet enter into together, when the time is right. That’s why I was so appalled — and enraged — to read how the RSPCA had stepped in and ordered the destruction of a bedraggled but beloved elderly cat named Claude, against his family’s wishes. A neighbour had reported that Claude looked unkempt, yet his owners insist he was perfectly healthy — just a skinny, matted mess of old fur. He was a long-haired Turkish Van who hated being groomed so much that his family took him to the vet every year to be anaesthetised so he could be brushed properly. Hardly the act of uncaring or neglectful owners. Eventually, the vet refused to continue this practice on the grounds it wasn’t good for Claude to have any more anaesthetics, so his devoted owner Samantha Byrnes cut his fur with nail clippers while he slept — hence the bedraggled look that alarmed the oh-so zealous neighbour. When the RSPCA arrived, they seized the family cat, insisted that he was put down, then issued legal proceedings against Samantha and her husband Richard — an accountant from Tring in Hertfordshire — for cruelty. The family also claim that the charity even refused a stay of execution for four hours to give their two children, Eloise and Dominic, the chance to say goodbye to Claude — though an RSPCA spokesman disputes that. Now, thankfully, the CPS has ruled that the prosecution must be dropped, which is a small mercy given what the family have been through. They had the good sense to tape their conversations with the RSPCA inspector — and the officer can be heard threatening them with calling in the police if they don’t agree to have Claude killed. Unsurprisingly, Mrs Byrnes can be heard bursting into tears several times. The charity says it had been concerned for Claude’s welfare — but is it any wonder that it’s haemorrhaging donations? They fell by £7 million last year, and membership is down by six per cent. Many fear the RSPCA has become obsessed with pursuing politically motivated causes, like the prosecution of the Prime Minister’s rural hunt. Last year it prosecuted an owner for not taking a sick cat to the vet, and threatened a woman with prison after she treated her dog’s fleas with a canine shampoo that could have given it an allergy. And a report reveals that 3,400 animals were put down by the charity in 2011 for ‘non- medical reasons’ — 44 per cent of all those taken in. Claude the cat, who was put down against his family's wishes after they were reported to the RSPCA . Yes, the RSPCA does fine work, and the vast majority of its actions lead to convictions. But it seems as though an arrogance has seeped into this organisation that means it sometimes plays God with our beloved pets. It now feels it can step in and destroy any animal it chooses — even one like Claude, who, as tests proved after he was put down, was as healthy as any elderly cat could be. Reading his story made my blood run cold, then boil, and brought the memories flooding back of my beloved Jim’s last months. Because he proved that a cat and its owner are the best possible judges of when the time to go is right. His arrival in my life in 2003 was somewhat unusual. I had just lost my beloved cat Ronnie, brother of the then recently departed Reggie, and had written about the terrible loss in the Mail. No cat, I thought, could replace my constant companions of almost two decades. But that was before I found this adorable six-year-old ginger moggie, who looked after me for 11 years. Despite his grumpy appearance (he had an adorable overhanging forehead), he was the sweetest, most gentle cat I’ve ever known. I nicknamed him ‘Slipper’ because wherever I was, he came plodding along — purring so loudly it was like an ever-present buzz-saw. He grew fat and happy, and having been very timid, did eventually venture outside, safe in the knowledge that nothing would ever separate us except death. As a kitten, he had been in and out of cat homes. But how he blossomed. It was only towards the end, when he couldn’t make it up the stairs to my bedroom, that he didn’t sleep curled behind my knees each night. By then he had a lot of health problems — he was on daily pills for his failing kidneys and an overactive thyroid. Like Claude, he had crazy fur, too — standing on end as though he’d gelled it up — because he wasn’t able to clean himself properly. But luckily he had only one tooth left by then, so he couldn’t bite me as I gently helped him swallow his medication, followed by lashings of beef and turkey Whiskas. But his favourite treat was Marks & Spencer prawns, cut into tiny pieces so he could ‘gum’ them properly. Due to his overactive thyroid, it didn’t matter how much he ate, he just got skinnier and skinnier — his weight dropped from 18lb at his peak to just 4lb. It sounds as though Claude was in a similar situation — bony, matted and scraggy. But even if a cat looks like that, it doesn’t mean they aren’t happy. All I had to do was open a pack of prawns, and Jim was there like lightning. At least until one day about a year ago. He was asleep on the sofa at the other end of the sitting room when I brought in some prawns, and he didn’t move. He also cried out when I picked him up. Determined that he receive the best care, I called out the vet, who examined him and announced: ‘It’s time.’ He said he could put Jim to sleep then and there, but I knew in my heart he wasn’t ready for that — and nor was I. So we decided to see how he fared over the weekend. Well, Jim must have heard us because he rallied and was down off that sofa like a kitten the next day for his prawn treat — although using the cushion steps I’d built up for him because he had trouble jumping up and down. That call to the vet the following Monday was one of the happiest of my life. ‘Nope, it’s not time,’ I said. ‘But what about the quality of his life?’ the vet asked. Jim, I reported, was happy, not in pain and purring. No Liverpool cat pathway for him yet, thanks, I said. Like the Byrne family, who knew Claude was getting towards the end but wasn’t ready to die, I wanted Jim to have one last summer. That’s exactly what he got — and another autumn and winter, too. I had the vet check on him regularly, and the diagnosis was simply that he was old. Yet even then, nothing dimmed those beautiful green eyes nor silenced that purr. Then, just before Easter this year, Jim had a minor stroke and raced around the room, clearly in distress and howling. In the days that followed, the life visibly ebbed out of him. He looked so weary. Then one morning, when I went down to cuddle him and prepare his breakfast, he didn’t want to get off the sofa. He looked at me as it to say: ‘I’m ready’ — and I knew he was. That’s the magical thing about cats. It happened with both Reggie and Ronnie: they knew their time had come before I did. So I called the vet and held Jim in my arms in his last moments. He opened those great big eyes and blinked slowly at me, and his limp body just melted into mine. And then he was gone. That’s the ending Claude should have had — surrounded by the family who loved him, not put down in some strange place at the behest of an official who had threatened his owners with police action.","Apalled and enraged RSPCA ordered the destruction elderly cat Claude .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and James  Nye . Legendary NASCAR driver Dick Trickle suffered chronic debilitating pain in his chest before his suicide according to Chuck, his brother. Trickle, 71, who died on Thursday from a self inflicted gunshot wound was so distressed by his mystery ailment that he visited doctors twice a day. According to his brother the popular racer became depressed by the discomfort under his left breast telling him that he 'didn't know how much longer he could take the pain.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Suicide: Dick Trickle, in Sept. 1989,  died on Thursday at age 71 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police say . 'It's a shock to me,' said Chuck Trickle to The Las Vegas Review Journal. 'It's real hard to think about. He was my brother, my friend and my hero, in that order.' 'He was very down.' Chuck, who lives in Las Vegas said that to his knowledge his brother was healthy, except for the pain under his chest, but when they last spoke a week ago he suspected that something was wrong when he heard his brother curse. Chuck Trickle said his brother was so beloved that 'he could’ve run for president and won.' 'He was there for everybody,' Chuck Trickle said. 'He left a very large footprint on this earth.' Chuck’s son, Chris, was shot in 1997 while driving in Las Vegas. He died the following year, and the case never was . solved. During his racing career, he attracted attention when he drilled a hole in his safety helmet to allow him to smoke a cigarette as he competed. He also installed cigarette lighters in his cars so he could smoke during races, the local news station noted. Trickle recalled in an interview with Fox Sports two years ago of a fan who came up to him while signing autographs and asked him about the cigarettes. 'He says, 'how many cigarettes did you smoke during that race?' And I said, ""how many yellows were there?"" I said, ""one for every yellow."" Dick Trickle was famed for smoking while driving at high speeds during NASCAR races - he is pictured here lighting a cigarette . Trickle said he quit smoking two and a half years before that interview but did it 'just for no good reason.' NASCAR legend Richard 'Dick' Trickle died on Thursday at age 71 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police confirmed. The body of the retired race car driver was found at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Boger City, North Carolina, 30 miles west of Charlotte. His body was discovered near his pickup truck. It is not known why he chose the cemetery as the location to end his life. The victim had actually called police before shooting himself and forewarned them 'there would be a dead body and it would be his.' Death: NASCAR driver Dick Trickle, in 1997, was found at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Boger City, North Carolina . Trickle made his debut on the NASCAR circuit in the #84 Miller High Life Buick for Stavola Brothers Racing. His career spanned 24 years, during which he competed in a total of 2,200 races. Dubbed the 'White Knight' by his corporate sponsor  SuperAmerica, he was said to have nabbed the most wins in short track racing. He was named the Rookie of the Year in NASCAR's Winston Cup in 1989 at age 48. Legend: The career of NASCAR driver Dick Trickle, in 2006, spanned 24 years, during which he competed in a total of 2,200 races . Dick Trickle inspired the Tom Cruise vehicle 'Days of Thunder' - the main character in the movie was called Cole Trickle . Hollywood: Tom Cruise's character in Days of Thunder, Cole Trickle, was name in honor of the NASCAR legend' During races ESPN commentators Dan Patrick and . Keith Olbermann also enjoyed making light of the alliteration in his name and . would always take notice of Trickle's finish, regardless of his . placement, according to WCNC-TV. 'No sports figure Dan + I had fun with took it more graciously. In fact, gratefully,' Olbermann tweeted on Thursday. Former . NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine expressed his grief over the sudden news of . his friend while remembering him in an interview with the Associated . Press as a man who was 'fun, just plain fun.' Popular guy: No matter where Trickle placed during his races, seen in North Carolina at the Coca-Cola 600 in 1997, ESPN commentators Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann would broadcast his name just because of the way it sounded . Larger than life: Trickle, who made his debut driving the No.84 Miller High Life Buick for Stavola Brothers Racing in 1989, is seen holding one of his famed cigarettes in a hand . Retirement: After retiring from the sport Trickle said he hoped to live out the remainder of his days as a grandfather at home in North Carolina . 'It's . all just sad. We don't understand why he would do this. Hopefully we . will all learn why he would do that. There was something that triggered . him to take his own life. We are all really saddened by this in the . racing community,' Bodine said. Trickle lived in Iron Station, N.C., for more than 20 years. Bodine said Trickle was full of stories and popular because of it. 'People . everywhere knew his name,' Bodine said. 'That’s why they used his . likeness in that movie Days of Thunder. He was such a character.' The main character in that popular niche racing movie, played by Tom Cruise, was named Cole Trickle. Bodine said that a few years ago he had . to back out of a celebrity cruise for patients who were on kidney . dialysis. He asked Trickle to fill in. Resting place: The 71-year-old was found dead near his pickup truck at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Boger City, North Carolina . 'He made such an impression on people on that ship that everyone wanted to know when Dick was coming back,' Bodine said. 'They loved him. They tell me he was the last man to leave most of the bars on the ship and I believe it.' Bodine also recalled inviting Trickle to compete in one of his bobsled events in 2004 at Lake Placid, New York. - Trickle on how he wanted to be remembered . He said Trickle went down the first time and crashed. After being cleared by doctors to continue, Trickle tried again and crashed in the same place. 'They were doing interviews with him on TV and he was like, ""I don’t know what happened, I did the exact same thing I did the first time,”’ Bodine said. 'And we’re all looking at him like, hey Dick, maybe that was the problem.' When Trickle was asked how he hoped to be remembered in his interview two years ago, he answered: 'I just want to be who I am and satisfied that I had a great career. I'm happy with it. I think I made a lot of friends.' He also said he hoped to live out the remainder of his days as a 'stay-at-home grandpa.' In a statement, NASCAR said its thoughts and prayers were with Trickle's family and friends. 'Dick . was a legend in the short-track community, particularly in his home . state of Wisconsin, and he was a true fan favorite,' NASCAR's statement . read in part. 'Personalities like Dick Trickle helped shape our sport. He will be missed.' Sheriff's Lieutenant Tim Johnson says foul play is not suspected. Dick Trickle enters his car at Talladega, Alabama, as he prepares to begin another race in 1997 . Trickle leaves behind his wife of 53 years Darlene and three children. According to fawbag.com they are the proud parents of three children. 50-year-old Tod Allen Trickle born on March 22, 1963, 41-year-old Chad Trickle born on March 03, 1972 and their eldest and only daughter 52-year-old Victoria Trickle, now Vicky Trickle Bowman, who once worked as her father's personal assistant. Darlene Carol Trickle, 69, was born Darlene McMahon on January 11, 1944, she got married to her childhood sweetheart Dick Trickle shortly after he graduated from High School in May, 1961. At age eight, Trickle almost died while playing tag with his cousin in a house under construction. He fell two floors to the basement and broke his hip and spent three years in a cast from his waist to his feet - walking with a limp for the rest of his life. And tragically, his nephew, Chris Trickle, who was also a NASCAR driver was murdered in an unsolved drive-by shooting in Las VEgas in 1998. The young man died from his wounds 409 days after the shooting.

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Bill Ryan has been arrested for protesting the Whitehaven coalmine in northern NSW . When Bill Ryan was 20 years old he fought for Australia in the Kokoda campaign. This year, at the age of 92, Mr Ryan was arrested for protesting a coalmine in northern NSW, work he believes is an extension of the fight to safeguard Australia's future he participated in New Guinea in World War II. 'I think it's a continuation. If we don't defend our farms, our water, our land and let it be destroyed - I can't find the word to say -  we're negligent,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If it was worth saving one time, it's worth saving now.' Mr Ryan, a great-grandfather, was arrested in April and fined $600 for blockading the roads leading to the Whitehaven coalmine in Maules Creek, northern NSW, with a group of 150 protesters. The protester's objections to the mine range from concerns about endangered flora and fauna, the fact the forest is home to 2,153 hectares of endangered Box Gum trees, the cultural significance of the area to Aboriginal people, as well as the potential impact on the surrounding farmland, which is a key food bowl in NSW. For Mr Ryan is particularly concerned about the impact the coalmine will have on global warming. A report by Dr Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor at Griffith University and president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, estimated the mine would produce 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, roughly the same as the amount of fossil fuels produced annually by New Zealand. 'All this information is coming from global specialists that if we don't do anything about [global warming], it would have catastrophic consequences for our grandchildren,' said Mr Ryan. Bill Ryan served in the Kokoda campaign during WWII and considers protesting against coal mining as an extension of the fight to safeguard Australia's future . Mr Ryan has visited the Maules Creek protest camp six times in the last two years and was arrested in April this year . Mr Ryan, who has two grandchildren and one great-grandchild, a three-year-old great-granddaughter named Amber, said he worries about the future they face. 'What is it going to be? When I grew up we didn't have any worries like this, there was none of this pollution they talk about today. I don't think we – the grandparents and parents – should leave that to them, we felt we had to do something.' In the last five years, since Mr Ryan became convinced that the Australian government would not take a firm stance on global warming, Mr Ryan has joined his local Climate Action group in the Sutherland Shire of Sydney, blocked a railway line to stop coal trains coming into Newcastle, joined a group blockading the entrance to Parliament House, participated in mass demonstrations in Canberra, and written to MPs. 'Our politicians have let us down and have sold out to mining interest and the people have to take some action themselves,' he said. The arrest in April was for trespass and resulted in a $600 fine for the great-grandfather . Bill Ryan (left) and his son Colin (right) protest the coalmine by occupying the Whitehaven compound . Bill Ryan (right) has become an active protester against coal mining since becoming convinced after the Copenhagen Summit that the Australian government was not going to take a firm stance on the issue . The coal mining industry accounted for more than $38 billion of export earnings in Australia in 2012-13 and employs 54,000 people across the country. Whitehaven Coal Managing Director Mr Paul Flynn called the Maules Creek project 'one of the most significant investments currently underway in regional NSW' employing 340 full-time staff during construction and 470 staff during ongoing operations. He added that the project had received 'immense and very gratifying' regional support for the project. Mr Ryan said that just because coal of the nation's key exports does not mean it does not cause social and environmental harm and he argues Australia should be investing in alternative energy forms. 'Just like we try to get people off smoking, we need to wean people off coal,' he said. 'The world is going over to renewables and Australia's sitting around with something they call direct action… We're in an ideal position to be a leader in the world, but with mining interest we're lagging behind. We've got to catch up with the rest of the world.' Mr Ryan says he will continue to visit the Maules Creek site and that participating in the protests is not only a duty, but it keeps him young. 'I feel rejuvenated and I hate leaving [the protest site], leaving these people who put their lives on the line to stop global warming and defend the forests,' he said.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Bottles of wine should be labelled with cigarette-style warnings to alert shoppers to the risks of drinking too much, according to MPs. They said most Britons have a ‘low understanding’ of the health problems associated with alcohol, which contributes to cancer, heart disease and strokes, as well as liver disease. Tracey Crouch, Tory chairman of the All-Party Group on Alcohol Misuse, said it was time for ministers to impose standardised health warnings on beer, wine and spirits. Scroll down for video . Warnings: The government has recommended that wine bottles should carry a stark warning: 'Alcohol kills' They would be similar to labels on cigarette packets, with statements such as ‘Alcohol Kills’. However, she stopped short of recommending what she called ‘shock and awe’ tactics, similar to pictures on some packets of cigarettes showing diseased lungs. Miss Crouch said it was important that the warnings also contained the units and calorie content of the alcohol. Professional women, whose levels of drinking have risen sharply in recent years, might be put off to learn there are around 700 calories in a bottle of wine, she said. Last week the Mail reported that the Government’s health quango will tell Britons to avoid drinking alcohol on consecutive days. Danger: The message would be similar to that on cigarette packets, but the print could be smaller . Public Health England says a ‘one day on, one day off’ rule is needed because daily drinking is a key contributor to increased health risks. The MPs’ report out today says most drinkers do not know there can be up to 2.5 units of alcohol in a pint of high-strength beer, or as many as nine units in a bottle of wine. ‘Health warnings are a familiar and prominent feature on all tobacco products,’ the report says. ‘Likewise, detailed nutritional labelling is ubiquitous on food products and soft drinks. Yet consumer information on alcohol products usually extends no further than the volume strength and unit content. ‘In order to inform consumers about balanced risk, every alcohol label should include an evidence-based health warning as well as describing the product’s nutritional, calorific and alcohol content.’ Miss Crouch said the size and wording of labels would be up for debate. The powerful drinks industry would object to health warnings, she said, but lack of awareness was leading to ‘people regularly drinking far more than they should’. Although the label recommendation are still at the proposal stage, it will put further pressure on the Government to act. A Government spokesman said: ‘We are taking action to give people better information about the impact drinking can have on your health. ‘Through our Responsibility Deal, the drinks industry has committed to putting unit and health messages on 80 per cent of all bottles and cans.’","Parliamentary group on alcohol misuse said it was time to impose warnings .

"By . Ruby Warrington . Cure for the meds: Quit sugar to avoid gaining weight when you are put on steroids . I am on long-term corticosteroids to treat a rheumatic condition which means I have very stiff joints – especially my shoulders, upper arms and hips. One of the side effects is that I have gained weight which I find impossible to shift. Is it pointless trying to diet and exercise if the drugs are making me bigger? No. Many people experience weight gain when they start taking steroids, as one of the side effects is an increased appetite. But this means it is also possible  to control. This is actually a great opportunity to clean up your diet. Cut out added sugar. It’s high calorie and the latest research suggests it triggers weight gain by affecting our body chemistry, too. Of course sugar is a natural component of whole foods, but this isn’t the problem. Do you drink fizzy pop? How about a teaspoon in tea or coffee? Alcohol is high calorie and often laden with sugar – there are online calculators that will tell you how many extra calories your daily tipple adds. Even modest regular drinkers are usually in for a shock. Check the ingredients of any pre-prepared foods, as there’s hidden sugar in many supermarket products. Also be wary of honey and other sweet syrups - these are basically pure sugar and empty calories. Fruit juices and smoothies are high in sugar albeit natural. I Quit Sugar, by Sarah Wilson, is a great new book about all the health benefits – including weight loss – of a sugar-free diet. All weight loss is achieved by limiting calories consumed and maximising what you’re burning off, so exercise is also key. Even committing to walking for 30 minutes a day will be a start. But if you really want to burn some calories, then you can’t beat High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Search on YouTube for hundreds of these short, intense workouts. Often, an entire workout can take just ten minutes. Good luck! I’ve read that even skinny children can be storing up health problems if they don’t exercise. That’s my teenage grandson! He spends his spare time playing computer games. What can we do to get him out of his bedroom? When we were that age, we played outdoors and I’ve never had to diet or worry about things like the gym. I’m 83, and still wear clothes I bought in my 30s. Turn it off: Even a slim person needs to turn the computer off and get up and exercise for their health . You’re right, staying fit well into old age isn’t just about size. A recent study looked at how inactivity in childhood led to fat deposits accumulating around the organs – hence the acronym TOFI: Thin Outside, Fat Inside. Establishing regular exercise early in life lowers the risk of most degenerative diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and some forms of cancer. In America, sport is ingrained in the culture. It’s a shame sports aren’t so popular among British teens. As your grandson loves his computer, a Nintendo Wii with physically active games, could be a good investment. Before I came to America, people warned me about ‘the New York stone’ – referring to the weight gain many experience when they move to the city. Eating out, larger portions  and food that’s more heavily processed are the main culprits. Luckily, discovering the city’s vibrant workout culture first meant I didn’t fall prey to it. I have noticed changes in  my digestion, though, and developed some food intolerances since my move. Here’s a luxurious way to beat the heat: A cooling spray containing none of the additives or chemical nasties that shop-bought brands can contain. Empty atomiser  spray bottles can be purchased cheaply online or at department stores, so you can have one by the bed and one for your bag or desk drawer. This is not to be used as a sun block, but the anti-inflammatory properties of  aloe vera mean that it’s a great treatment for sunburn. Witch-hazel soothes the skin and helps reduce swelling. Eucalyptus oil gives a fresh aroma and has a cooling sensation, as does peppermint oil, which can also be used as an alternative, or addition. Essential oils may not be suitable for pregnant women or those with some medical conditions – consult your doctor before using this spray. INGREDIENTS- 50ml water- 25ml aloe vera juice. Look for a brand containing nothing but aloe inner gel such as the one by Pukka (£8.96, 500ml, pukkaherbs.com). It’s 99.8 per cent pure with just some lemon juice as a preservative. You can find 100 per cent pure on the internet. These are usually marketed as drinks but are perfect for putting on skin too. - 25ml distilled witch-hazel liquid- 5 drops of eucalyptus  and/or peppermint essential oil, or three drops of each . DIRECTIONSMix ingredients into a bowl and decant into an atomiser spray bottle. Shake well before use and spritz your face and body when hot. Can be stored in the fridge for two to three months. Tackling these problems means I now follow a mainly vegan diet – I eat no dairy at all, but occasionally fish or eggs. Food blogger Aine Carlin, pictured, has a similar story. After moving from England to the States, her American diet left her feeling lethargic and lumpen, and she, too, started eating vegan – not because of animal rights, but for her health. And if this instantly conjures up images of endless plates of tasteless mung beans, then her new recipe book, Keep It Vegan, should change your mind. I love the sound of dishes like Smokey Moroccan Stew and Crunchy Curried Chickpea Tacos, and you don’t need eggs or cream to make her desserts. If that wasn’t enough to tempt you, the well-publicised health benefits of a vegan diet (as spelled out in the American cult documentary Forks Over Knives) include everything from lowered blood pressure to reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. A lessening in the environmental impact of factory farming and the needless suffering of animals is just an added bonus. IN the past year, the Duchess  of Cambridge has been photographed playing volleyball, cricket, the South African game of three tins at the Commonwealth games (above), running along a sandy beach and doing hurdles – all while wearing vertiginous heels. And now it seems as if Princess Eugenie is getting in on the act. She was last week photographed posing with a hockey stick wearing Kate’s heel of choice: wedges. What is it with the Royals and wedges? Perhaps the girls are following in the heels of the  fictional Carrie Bradshaw – from Sex And The City – who was  forever sprinting down the streets of New York in Manolos. But they should be careful. Despite ‘high-heel workouts’ growing in popularity, it seems more than a little dangerous to me. I’ve had too many sprained ankles from just walking in high heels, let alone taking to the treadmill in them. Americans are obsessed with their teeth, and it seems as if everybody here has a perfect movie-star smile. Flossing is a favourite national pastime, while most wear braces as children and then have their teeth bleached white. It’s no wonder, then, that the ancient Ayurvedic practice of oil pulling is the latest health craze. Said to remove harmful bacteria and plaque build-up, as well as whiten teeth naturally, oil pulling involves swishing a tablespoonful of oil around in your mouth for ten to 15 minutes each morning – before eating, drinking or brushing your teeth – then spitting it out. I’ve been trying it, and it’s not as disgusting as it sounds. I use coconut oil as I like the taste, and swish it about as I make breakfast. Do you have a diet or fitness qestion for Ruby?

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Sound waves may not appear to hold much power, but scientists believe directing them in the right way could allow them to hide objects and even levitate them in the air. Researchers in the US have developed technology to manipulate sound waves on fixed paths around an acoustic 'bottle'. The technique could be used to re-route sound waves around an object making them invisible to sonar detection. This animation shows the self-bending and obstacle-circumventing capabilities of the acoustic bottle  compared to a conventional  beam (top). Sound energy can be seen flowing through the shell of the bottle . The acoustic bottle could also help in levitation, where sound waves are used to lift and manipulate objects like particles, micro-organisms and drops of water. Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California developed the acoustic bottle, which is a three dimensional structure made up of high pressure acoustic waves. These acoustic bottles in open air can bend the paths of sound waves along preplanned paths. Sound waves move much like light waves. They travel on a straight path but this path – through reflection, diffraction or refraction – can be bent. Directed sound energy from speakers forms a 3D acoustic bottle consisting of high-pressure walls and a zero pressure region in the middle. Pressure field at bottom shows self-bending ability of the bottle . 'We need to find ways to bend acoustic wave fields without depending on the use of a highly engineered medium,' says Xiang Zhang, director of Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division. 'With our bottle beam technique, we can design and synthesise acoustic bottles that are capable of directing sound waves along paths of desired curvature through homogeneous space without the need of metamaterials or any other highly engineered medium.' In this latest project, Professor Zhang's research group, created an acoustic 'bottle' that features a three-dimensional curved shell. At the centre of this shell is of high acoustic pressure is a region of zero pressure. This image shows the sound intensity distribution of self-bending bottle beam. The trajectory the researchers aimed for is in the red-dashed curve, and the direction of the beam in the grey-dashed curve . Sound waves forming the bottle are concentrated into a beam that travels through the high pressure wall of its curved shell. The sound waves are generated by an array of loud speakers, 1.5cm in diameter and spaces 2.5cm apart, operating at a frequency of 10 kilo Hertz (kHz). The high pressure wall of the acoustic bottle exerts a pulling force, which means there are no sound waves passing through the centre, making it ideal for trapping sound. 'We can also levitate much larger 3D objects than can be lifted and manipulated with other acoustic levitation techniques,' said researcher Jie Zhu. It might look like a quirky plastic model of an ancient Egyptian pyramid, but this model is in fact a 3D 'acoustic cloak', created using just a few perforated sheets of plastic. The device reroutes sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything beneath it are not there. Like the 'acoustic bottle', a refined version of the technology could one day be used for sonar avoidance and to refine noise in concert halls. Engineers from Duke University in North Carolina, claim that unlike other efforts, the acoustic cloaking device works in all three dimensions, no matter which direction the sound is coming from. ‘The particular trick we’re performing is hiding an object from sound waves,’ said Steven Cummer, professor of electrical and computer engineering. The pyramid is constructed using plastic plates with a repeating pattern of holes that are stacked on top of one another. Its design means that sound waves can be manipulated by plastic and air. The cloak alters the sound waves’ trajectory to match what they would look like had they had reflected off a flat surface. The 'invisible' pyramid: The world's first 3D acoustic cloak (pictured) was created by U.S. engineers using just a few perforates sheets of plastic and a great deal of number crunching. The device reroutes sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything beneath it are not there .","Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California developed the 'acoustic bottle' to make objects invisible to sonar detection .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Since May 1973 the record for the longest distance traveled on an extraterrestrial world has been held by the Soviet Union’s Lunokhod 2 moon rover, which covered 24 miles (39 kilometres). But that record stands no more as Nasa’s Opportunity rover is now reported to have covered over 25 miles (40 km) on Mars, setting a new off-Earth driving record. And in more than ten years on the surface the rover is still going strong, despite initially being planned only to travel 0.62 miles (one kilometre). Nasa's Opportunity rover, illustration shown, has now traveled over 25 miles (40 kilometres) on Mars. The distance, which has taken 10 years, is a new record for off-Earth driving. The previous record was held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 moon rover, which covered 24 miles (39 kilometres) on the lunar surface . 'Opportunity has driven farther than any other wheeled vehicle on another world,' said Mars Exploration Rover Project Manager John Callas, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. On average the red planet is 141.6 million miles (227.9 million kilometres) from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles it’s around half the size of Earth. It’s absolutely freezing there, with an average temperature of -65°C (-85°F). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is desperately thin - one per cent of Earth’s pressure - and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain - Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. The planet's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars also has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 36 feet (11 metres) deep, according to Nasa. 'This is so remarkable considering Opportunity was intended to drive about one kilometer [0.62 miles] and was never designed for distance. 'But what is really important is not how many miles the rover has racked up, but how much exploration and discovery we have accomplished over that distance.' A drive of 157 feet (48 metres) on  27 July put Opportunity's total odometry at 25.01 miles (40.25 kilometers). This month's driving brought the rover southward along the western rim of Endeavour Crater. The rover had driven more than 20 miles (32 km) before arriving at Endeavour Crater in 2011, where it has examined outcrops on the crater’s rim containing clay and sulfate-bearing minerals. The sites are yielding evidence of ancient environments with less acidic water than those examined at Opportunity’s landing site. If the rover can continue to operate the distance of a marathon - 26.2 miles (about 42.2 km) - it will approach the next major investigation site mission scientists have dubbed 'Marathon Valley'. Observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars suggest several clay minerals are exposed close together at this valley site, surrounded by steep slopes where the relationships among different layers may be evident. Nasa's . Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, working on Mars since January 2004, . passed 25 miles of total driving on 27 July 2014. The gold line on this . map shows Opportunity's route from the landing site inside Eagle Crater . (upper left) to its location after the 27 July drive . This chart provides a comparison of the distances driven by various wheeled vehicles on the surface of Mars and Earth's moon. Of the vehicles shown, Nasa's Mars rovers Opportunity and Curiosity are still active and the totals listed are distances driven as of 28 July 2014 . The Russian Lunokhod 2 rover, model shown, landed on Earth's moon on 15 January 1973, where it drove about 24.2 miles (39 kilometers) in less than five months, according to calculations recently made using images from Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) cameras that revealed its tracks . 'The Lunokhod missions still stand as two signature accomplishments of what I think of as the first golden age of planetary exploration, the 1960s and '70s,' said Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and principal investigator for Nasa's twin Mars rovers, Opportunity and Spirit. 'We’re in a second golden age now, and what we’ve tried to do on Mars with Spirit and Opportunity has been very much inspired by the accomplishments of the Lunokhod team on the moon so many years ago. 'It has been a real honor to follow in their historical wheel tracks.' As Opportunity neared the mileage record earlier this year, the rover team chose the name Lunokhod 2 for a crater about 20 feet (6 metres) in diameter on the outer slope of Endeavour's rim on Mars. The Mars Exploration Rover Project is one element of Nasa's ongoing and future Mars missions preparing for a human mission to the planet in the 2030s.","Nasa's Opportunity rover has now traveled over 25 miles (40 km) on Mars .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Deadly: Men are usually much more affected than women by coronaries . Countless lives could be saved by a blood test which costs just £10 by detecting a heart attack in 30 minutes. The groundbreaking test, developed by British scientists, could provide relief to those suffering with chest pains by quickly checking for coronaries. It works by detecting a small protein which is released after a heart attack called H-FABP and could dramatically cut down on wait times and free hospital beds. At . present, the blood test to detect a heart attack takes over six hours and the long . wait time can lead to the patient suffering from cardiac damage and even death. Dr Rick Body, consultant in Emergency medicine has carried out successful trials of the test at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Dr Body told The Daily Mirror: 'Many patients with chest pain are admitted for hours, even days, for further tests but most don't have a heart problem. ‘With this new test we could bring instant peace of mind to those not suffering a heart attack and prioritise those who are.' According to the NHS, Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the UK and worldwide. It's responsible for around 74,000 deaths in the UK each year and about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 8 women die from the disease. However, while coronaries can be spotted on an ECG, a blood test to measure a protein called troponin is needed. In the UK, an estimated 2.7 million people live with the condition and 2 million people are affected by angina, which is the most common symptom of coronary heart disease. Coronaries affect men more than women but things change by the age of 50 when the chances of developing the disease become similar for both. Hospital: The test could dramatically cut down on hospital wait times and free hospital beds sooner . When patients visit A&E with chest . pains, doctors often recommend that they are admitted to hospital for . tests to rule out a heart attack. Yet, while this is the most common reason for hospital admission, most do not actually have a heart attack. It can also go undetected, leaving some patients unwittingly missing vital treatment. But a  good indicator of a problem is the protein H-FABP, which shows up when the heart cells are actually being damaged. The new test has been developed by Randox Health in Crumlin, Northern Ireland. Medical director Gary Smyth said that cardiac tests are not currently as sensitive as clinicians would like them to be, leaving many patients in hospital, using valuable resources.","The ground breaking test has been developed by British scientists .
It can detect a heart attack in just 30 minutes and help diagnose patients .

"By . Chris Parsons . Updated: . 07:10 EST, 30 December 2011 . Saif al-Islam, the son of Colonel Gaddafi who was captured in November, has had the ends of his thumb and forefinger amputated as he prepares to face trial on corruption and war crimes charges. Human rights groups have expressed concern over the treatment of the dictator's son, who has been held in solitary confinement without access to legal counsel since his capture by local militia in Libya. Mr Gaddafi has since had the ends of his right-hand forefinger and thumb amputated in his prison cell due to injuries sustained in a Nato airstrike before his capture. Captured: Saif al-Islam, pictured in November shortly after his capture by Libyan rebel forces, could face a war crimes trial as early as next month . These phone pictures were taken by one of the men guarding the captive Saif when he was taken last month . Booty: Saif's western-style glasses and a stack of U.S. dollars which he was carrying when he was captured . Medics had to remove the top knuckle of his thumb and forefinger because the injuries he sustained had become gangrenous. Colonel Gaddafi's son also has an injury to his right middle finger. The first of Mr Gaddafi's trials could be heard as early as next month, according to The Times. U.S.-based human rights group Watch said Saif al-Islam has been cut off from the world during his 33 days in detention, with no access to his family or a lawyer. News of the legal proceedings emerged as Colonel Gaddafi's daughter demanded an international criminal court inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her father's death. Distressed: Colonel Gaddafi's glamorous daughter, Aisha Gaddafi, has demanded an International Criminal Court inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her father's death . Aisha Gaddafi, who fled Libya in . August prior to the capture of her father by rebel forces, said she has . suffered 'severe emotional distress' by pictures of his death and the . treatment of his corpse. In a . letter to ICC prosecutor Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, international lawyer . Nick Kaufman said Gaddafi and his son Mutassim 'were murdered in the . most horrific fashion with their bodies thereafter displayed and . grotesquely abused in complete defiance of Islamic law.' The . letter continues: 'The images of this savagery were broadcast . throughout the world causing my client severe emotional distress.' Mr . Kaufman is said to have posed the ICC a series of questions, including . whether they are investigating the circumstances of the deaths, whether . it had received postmortem exam reports, and why the ICC had not ordered . its own independent exam. An . ICC official, Phakiso Mochochoko, said last week Libyan authorities had . promised to investigate Gaddafi's death, according to The Guardian. Meanwhile . the head of the rebel government council in Zintan, in the Nafusa . Mountains in Western Libya, said Gaddafi's son is still being . interrogated and 'is not allowed to talk to anybody' during this period. Last month Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke out over the fate of the former dictator’s one-time heir apparent. concerns have emerged that the former rebel faction that captured him is refusing to hand him over to the authorities in Tripoli, raising further doubts about the chances of a fair trial. Macabre: Images taken before Gaddafi's death saw the blood-soaked former Libyan leader being beaten and tortured as he was dragged through the streets . Asked if he backed the domestic trial decision, Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4’s Today: 'I would like to see him tried to international standards, whether that be in Libya or in The Hague. That is the important thing. 'The details of that have to be sorted out between the ICC and the transitional government.' Officials in Zintan told The Times that Mr Gaddafi would be handed to the central government if a request was made. The British Foreign Office said: 'We welcome the fact that the Libyan government is liaising closely with the ICC and we await details of where and when Saif will face trial. 'It is important that any trial is in line with international standards.'","Saif al-Islam was captured by rebel forces in November .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A council spent £23,000 of taxpayers' money trying to gag reporting of a case where it had placed a four-year-old in foster care with a suspected paedophile. Bristol City Council tried and failed to obtain a High Court injunction which would prevent embarrassing details of the case being made public. Social services took nearly three weeks to remove the girl from a foster family, despite the father being under suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. Bristol City Council has been branded a 'disgrace' for leaving a girl with a suspected paedophile and then trying to hush it up using taxpayers' money . He later killed himself after police took a laptop away from the property which contained a cache of child abuse images. Despite the little girl and the children of the suspected paedophile being automatically granted media anonymity, the council still tried to obtain a blanket gagging order. On the final day of the two-week hearing in October last year, the council's barrister Jo Lucas went to the civil court to get an injunction banning any reporting of the case. Temporary restrictions were then put in place to prevent publication of Bristol City Council, or the names of the social service workers who failed to protect the little girl. But these were overturned in London's High Court in January following a costly three-month legal wrangle. Mr Justice Baker ruled it was in the public interest for the story to be published, but that the identities of the girl, her family and foster family should all be protected. A Freedom of Information Act request has now revealed that the 'external cost' of the legal wrangle to Bristol City Council came to £23,528,40. Bristol City Council's expensive bid to stop their errors being reported was overturned in London's High Court . But the true cost is likely to be much higher as the quoted figure does not include the time council employees spent working on it. The hefty bill included £11,730 for legal advice, preparation and representation by Robin Tolson QC for two High Court hearings in London and one in Bristol. The council also paid the legal costs for the foster family, which came to £3,623.40. However, a spokesman for Bristol City Council today insisted the legal action was only taken to protect the identity of the child. 'The object throughout was only to protect the identity of the child,' he said. 'It is important to realise that automatic reporting restrictions in respect of children subject to care proceedings do not last once the proceedings have ended... 'The council did not think that this was . in the child's best interests and, as the press were already involved . and had attended some of the hearings in relation to the care . application, we considered that we had no option but to seek to protect . the identity of the child beyond the care proceedings.' Mr Justice Baker said Bristol City Council's bid to cover up its errors was 'unjustified', adding: 'It is in the public interest for these matters to be published' The case at Bristol's Family Proceedings Court heard that concerns were first raised in March 2012 when the girl had been living with the family for three months. Police informed social services that child sex abuse images had been accessed at the house for the second time. Unlike the first incident, which was blamed on a foster child at the house, the police strongly suspected the father had accessed the sick images. But despite being informed by police, social services did nothing for two weeks, leaving the little girl where she was. The child also told her real father and a social worker that she had been 'strangled' by another child at the foster home, but still she was returned to the house. Social worker Sherilyn Pritchard told the hearing, chaired by Annette Young, that there was 'not enough information to justify immediate removal' of the girl when the allegations arose. The child's appointed legal guardian said: 'I think we have to bear in mind that she may have been sexually abused in that foster placement.' Chairman of the magistrates Mrs Young criticised Bristol City Council for not following child protection procedures, saying: 'These matters concern us greatly and we believe should be thoroughly and forensically investigated and reviewed in an independent forum.' No disciplinary action has been taken against anyone from social services following the council's internal review, but an independent review has not yet been published. High Court judge Mr Justice Baker said the authority's bid for a gagging order was 'unjustified', adding: 'It is in the public interest for these matters to be published.' The girl is now in a new foster home. But speaking at the time of the court hearing, her natural father said: 'I am livid. 'They said she wasn't safe at home but they put her where someone had been downloading child abuse images.' He added: 'There is a danger that those who practise in the family justice system fail to give proper consideration to the Article 10 rights of the media. This must now cease.' Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This was a shameful attempt to suppress the media from reporting council bungling. 'It's a disgrace that Bristol City Council have spent taxpayers' money trying to hide its involvement in a very serious and disturbing case. 'Questions must be asked not only of those responsible for the mistakes in the original fostering case but also of whoever authorised the use of taxpayers' money for the legal action to cover it up.'","Bristol City Council left girl with family despite suspicions the father had accessed child pornography .

"By . Darren Boyle . A daughter, who was told her father was 'having a cup of tea' while he was slowly bleeding to death in a busy accident and emergency unit, only discovered the poor level of care he received five months after his death. Falklands veteran Tom Tubb, 70, was admitted to Peterborough City Hospital in Cambridgeshire in December 2013 suffering from chest pains. His daughter Victoria Woodward, 46, called the hospital and was told that the former Royal Navy officer was 'fine' and was was waiting to be seen. Tom Tubb, left, who spent 25 years in the Royal Navy, right, complained of chest pains in December 2013 . He was admitted to Peterborough City Hospital, pictured, where the seriousness of his condition was missed . An anonymous member of staff in the accident and emergency unit complained about the level of care offered by the hospital which led to an internal review. Five months after his death, Ms Woodward received a letter admitting that the hospital had made mistakes while treating her father. Mr Tubb was suffering from internal bleeding and according to the hospital's own guidelines he should have been seen by a senior doctor and then monitored every 30 minutes. Mr Tubb was eventually moved to the hospital's cardiac ward where he suffered a heart attack. He was found unresponsive and in a state of cardiac arrest 15 minutes after arriving on the ward. The Gastrointestinal and Liver services ward was full at the time of his admission. In a letter, the hospital admitted that the incident was a 'serious event' however the investigation and report was 'not intended to apportion blame but act as 'an opportunity for learning'. The investigation found that due to a lack of monitoring, Mr Tubb did not receive appropriate blood transfusions and other fluids in time to save his life. No members of staff have been disciplined over the incident and no inquest into the cause of Mr Tubb's death has been held. She said: 'I was told at the time he was waiting to be seen, and I was told he was just having a cup of tea and a biscuit.' At the time of his death, Mr Tubb's family were unaware that the hospital had failed in their treatment . As a result, Mr Tubb's death was not investigated by the coroner and no inquest into the incident has been held . Eventually she discovered that her father had been recognised as high-risk within 10 minutes of arriving at the emergency department. She was told he was given only two bags of blood over the eight hours he lay dying in the emergency care ward. He was also unable to go to the cardiac ward after his heart attack because it was full. Ms Woodward, a health and safety consultant, said: 'I am still of the opinion that the delay in appropriate action was either entirely or substantially responsible for my father's death. 'His heart had stopped because there wasn't enough blood left in his body. 'My family believe the lack of primary intervention and in particular the lack of blood, contributed to his death. 'I made a decision to put on the DNR (do not resuscitate). In the state he was in, I couldn't really make any other decisions.' The letter sent to Ms Woodward about her father's death didn't even mention him by name - forcing her to call in to find out why she was receiving it. This first report into his death was deemed so badly written, lacking in detail and error-prone that a second had to be ordered. Mr Tubb, right, received a Long Service and Good Conduct medal from the Navy after his 25 years' service . Ms Woodward went in to meet Dr Callum Gardner, the trust's medical director and heard details of what had happened to her father. She said: 'I don't think I've ever felt so sick.' In an email to Dr Gardner she wrote: 'I cannot begin to express my heartbreak, distress, anger, distrust and revulsion. 'I am appalled that any fellow human being, let alone my own father, can appear to have been overlooked, ignored or downright mistreated.' The hospital admitted the incident was a 'serious event' but said the report was 'not intended to apportion blame', and instead it would use it as 'an opportunity for learning'. Mrs Woodward said Dr Gardner has been helpful since the first report was released, but added: 'Frankly, I don't think comfort's going to be found.' Mr Tubb joined the Royal Navy as a Radio Operator in 1961. His service ended 25 years later and included a spell as lieutenant commander on HMS Alacrity in the Falklands War. She was one of the first ships to arrive at the Falklands and withstood 10 attacks and emerging unscathed earning the nickname 'HMS Miracle'. Mrs Woodward said the stoicism typical of his generation, and many others who serve in the forces, meant he didn't want to cause a fuss or draw attention to himself. She said: 'He was a very proud and generous man. 'He threw himself into things whole-heartedly and would not sit on the sidelines. 'I'm fighting this because if Dad had survived he would have fought. I'm doing this because he can't. 'Nine times out of 10 the NHS is brilliant, but when it goes wrong it really goes horribly wrong.' Ms Woodward said the hospital should introduce a 'silver advocate' service to protect elderly patients . She added that there should be a 'silver advocate' who would monitor elderly patients to make sure they were getting the care they needed and weren't suffering in silence. Dr Callum Gardner said the hospital had 'reinforced processes' in place to make sure relatives know if the death of a relative is being investigated. He apologised that a second report had to be ordered and said Ms Woodward had been offered 'continual support' from the trust. He added: 'The Trust already has a number of dementia champions, chaplains and members of the Friends charity and volunteers, who help care for and represent elderly patients. 'Providing an additional layer of support for our more vulnerable patients is extremely important and is something the Trust is very supportive of. 'As regards to the idea of ""Silver Advocates"", this is something we intend to look at to see if it would further enhance this support.'","Tom Tubb was admitted to Peterborough City Hospital with 'chest pains'

"By . Amanda Williams . A police officer allegedly gave a three-year-old girl a sexually transmitted disease when he abused her, a court has today heard. PC James Williams, who was based at Trinity Road police station, in Bristol, is accused of assaulting the toddler in a house in the city and passing on chlamydia to her. On the first day of evidence at his trial today a jury heard the allegations against the 28-year-old came to light when the little girl complained that she was sore when she went to the toilet. PC James Williams, of Bristol, is accused of assaulting a three year old and giving her a sexually transmitted disease . James Williams leaving court today. On the first day of evidence at his trial today a jury heard the allegations against the 28-year-old came to light when the little girl complained that she was sore when she went to the toilet . When her mother asked why, she said Williams had 'hurt' her and indicated how with her hands. She also claimed Williams had exposed himself to her, the court heard. While staying with her father the following day, the youngster repeated some of the claims to him. Williams, who is suspended from duties as a response officer for Avon and Somerset police, denies sexual assault by penetration on a child under 13. The girl's mother shook as she recounted what her daughter told her had happened. As she stood in the witness box at Bournemouth Crown Court she said the first time she took her daughter to the doctor, she did not tell him what the three-year-old was claiming. The youngster, whose anonymity is protected by law, was diagnosed with a water infection. But she was taken back to the GP several days later where the allegations were explained. She was then admitted to Bristol Children's Hospital for a full examination where tests revealed she had chlamydia, a disease usually transmitted sexually, which can cause infertility. Her mother said: 'I know chlamydia can cause problems for older ladies with them having children and that was one of my worst fears.' The jury heard the girl's infection was treated with medicine. But then two years later, tests revealed she had the infection again, having had no contact with Williams since the allegations first surfaced . Prosecuting, Kerry Barker said Williams and others who had come into contact with the girl around that time were all tested for the disease. Mr Barker said: 'He (Williams) agreed voluntarily to undertake tests for chlamydia and those tests showed he too had chlamydia, and it was the same strain.' Williams was privately confronted about the allegations by the family, with the girl - now five - in the same room. Witnesses told the jury that when asked who had touched her, she pointed at him and said that he had. When asked again she repeated the response, but when asked for a third time she replied: 'It's a secret.' The court heard from several witnesses at that 'tense' meeting who said Williams did not deny the allegations at the time. The girl's mother told the jury: 'James didn't really react.' During the alleged victim's first year in nursery school, staff catalogued 'concerning' and 'sexualised' behaviour towards other children. After counselling sessions, her behaviour became more normal but she is still 'very cuddly' towards other children, her mother said. The jury heard the girl's infection was treated with medicine. But then two years later her symptoms returned. Tests revealed she had the infection again, having had no contact with Williams since the allegations first surfaced. The case continues.

"By . Suzannah Hills . Cengizhan Cerit, 47, known as Jem Cerit, needed ten residents to nominate him so he could stand as a candidate for Beaver Ward in the Ashford Borough Council by-election in November 2011. But the wealthy businessman and former owner of Perfect Pizza in Ashford, faked the signatures on his election registration form and then tried to apply for hundreds of postal votes so he could rig the election. His cheating scheme was exposed by a simple spelling error - where a man was listed twice with two spellings of the name ‘Arnold’. Canterbury Crown Court heard the . Turkish property owner, who ran an empire of 68 houses with more than . 300 tenants, failed to spot the mistake in the Electoral Register. Father-of-two . Cerit was convicted by a jury of three charges of election fraud at . Canterbury Crown Court today and has been warned he could face jail. Alex Chalk, prosecuting, told the court: 'This is a case about misconduct in the democratic process. 'Cerit, . a candidate standing for election, submitted electoral documents to the . Electoral Services Department knowing that the signatures on those . documents were false. 'Cerit was interviewed by the local Conservative Association on October 25 and selected as the Party’s candidate. 'He was provided with nomination forms and instructed to complete one of them within two days. 'The . Conservative Party agent Gordon Williams returned to his office that . morning and discovered the two forms had been delivered duly completed, . even though only one had been necessary.

'On . examination, however, he noted that two of the signatures looked the . same - with only a difference in the spelling of ‘Arnold’ Madzianura. 'He queried this but Cerit reassured him they were two different people. That statement was false.' The same day the forms were sent to the . Electoral Services Department and officials noted the signatures . appeared almost identical. The prosecutor said that later checks revealed the second ‘Arnold’ - recorded as ‘Anorld’ at another address - didn’t exist. Mr Chalk added: 'All, bar one, of the . signatures on the first form were false. All six voters who could be . contacted in respect of a second form confirmed that the signatures were . false.' Officials then received a list of 200 names and addresses in Beaver Ward wanting to register to make a postal vote just a week before the deadline. He . said: 'The information on these lists were found to be inaccurate . because some of the individuals recorded as wanting postal votes already . had them, some of them were recorded on both lists and other names were . recorded as no longer being resident at the address.' The court heard how CCTV later showed that it was Cerit who had delivered the postal vote applications to the council. Election cheat: Cengizhan Cerit tried to apply for hundreds of postal votes so he could rig the election result . An investigation was launched and police raided a first floor office above ‘Perfect Pizza’ at in Ashford, Kent, and Cerit was arrested. He was asked where the signatures came from and told officers: 'I send the guys around to get those people to sign.' Mr Chalk added: 'When pressed on who the ""guys"" were, he mentioned Yanis or Cameron, adding later that ""girlfriends"" might have done so too. 'He said he had spoken to people on the forms and had said he was standing as a councillor and he expected their support. 'He stated that he had spoken to the individuals first and confirmed that they were happy to vote.' The prosecutor said police had also . questioned ‘the guys’, who included Cerit’s partner Oksana Nadeja, her . sister Natalijia Ivanova and seven others, and 'all were able to state . they had not been asked to fill in, deliver or collect, application . forms'. He added: 'Statements were later taken from some of the individuals whose names appeared on application documents for electoral registration by post - most were East European, Polish, Latvian and Rumanian - and they were able to confirm that the signatures on the documents were fake.' Cerit, from Kingsnorth, Kent, stood for election in May 2011 and polled 335 votes - losing out to two other candidates who polled 481 and 479 votes. But four months later one of the councillors, Brendan Naughton, died, which resulted in the need of a by-election.

"By . Rob Waugh . The Taung fossil, an early hominid which was discovered in South Africa in 1924, was significant features which could shed light on the evolution of intelligence . A fossil more than two million years old could help explain why man became so brainy. The Taung fossil, an early hominid which was discovered in South Africa in 1924, was significant features which could shed light on the evolution of intelligence. Importantly it has a ‘persistent metopic suture’ - an unfused seam - in the frontal bone, which allows a baby's skull to be pliable in childbirth. In great apes, this closes shortly after birth but in humans it doesn't fuse until around two years of age - allowing brain growth. The unfused seam allows babies to be born with larger brains, and the delay in fusing allows the brain to grow larger in early life, reports Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Taung fossil has become the ‘type specimen,’ or main model, of the genus Australopithecus africanus. An australopithecine is any species of the extinct genera Australopithecus or Paranthropus that lived in Africa, walked on two legs and had relatively small brains. Dr Dean Falk, of Florida State University, said: ‘These findings are significant because they provide a highly plausible explanation as to why the hominin brain might grow larger and more complex. ‘The persistent metopic suture, an advanced trait, probably occurred in conjunction with refining the ability to walk on two legs. ‘The ability to walk upright caused an obstretric dilemma. ‘Childbirth became more difficult because the shape of the birth canal became constricted while the size of the brain increased. The persistent metopic suture contributes to an evolutionary solution to this dilemma. ‘The later fusion was also associated with evolutionary expansion of the frontal lobes, which is evident from the endocasts of australopithecines such as Taung.’","Soft bones in child's skull allowed babies to be born with larger brains .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Nestled in the depths of the Amazon rainforest thousands of miles . from the biblical, war-torn lands of the Middle East, lives a small . community of people who call themselves Los Israelites. Seattle-based . photographer Stan Raucher has made the long journey down the Amazon . River to document the everyday lives of Peruvian villagers who adhere to . ancient Judeo-Christian traditions that go back thousands of . years in a series of striking black and white photographs. Officially called Asociación Evangélica de la . Misión Israelita del Nuevo Pacto Universal (AEMINPU), the evangelical . sect that seamlessly blends Old and New Testament traditions was founded . in 1958 by Ezequiel Gamonal, a shoemaker from a small Peruvian village. Welcome to the promised land: For the past six decades, a small community of Peruvians calling themselves Los Israelites have been living in the Amazon rainforest according to biblical laws . Humble beginnings: The evangelical sect called Asociación Evangélica de la Misión Israelita del Nuevo Pacto Universal was founded in 1958 by Ezequiel Gamonal, a cobbler from Peru . In the footsteps of a prophet: Gamonal proclaimed that he had been chosen by God to build a new Israel in the Amazon wilderness - and many people answered his call . Ancient fashions: The men in the community grow out their hair and beards, while the women dress modestly and cover their tresses with kerchiefs . Weekend warriors: From Sunday to Friday, the men keep their long hair covered and dress in plain clothes while going about their work, but on Saturday they don flowing robes to take part in a community celebration of the Sabbath . Melting pot of beliefs: Los Israelites gather in their sanctuary to read the bible, which contains both the Old and New Testaments . Raucher writes in his artist statement that Gamonal, a big fan of . Cecil B. DeMille’s biblical movie epics, converted from Catholicism to . Seventh-Day Adventism some six decades ago. A few years later, the . Peruvian cobbler proclaimed that he had been chosen by God to build a . new Israel in the Amazon rainforest – and some of his countrymen answered his call. Men and women from all over Peru left their homes . and businesses, flocking to Gamonal’s self-styled New Promised Land in . the tropical forest. Like modern-day Jews and Seventh-Day . Adventists, Gamonal’s Los Israelites observe the Sabbath – the . traditional day of rest – on Saturday, but do not celebrate Christmas or . Easter, and do not display crosses or images of saints. The sect members strictly follow the Ten Commandments, . which they refer to as the Royal Law; a large copy of the holy Decalogue is displayed along with a small ark in the . sanctuary of the congregation.

"By . Ray Massey . Councils were last night accused by ministers of ‘bending the law’ with their use of CCTV and overzealous parking wardens to catch out motorists and ‘fill their coffers’. Eric Pickles fired a broadside after a parking watchdog told MPs that councils are ignoring official guidance on enforcement. It said that, counter to the guidance, town halls are using surveillance cameras – which automatically issue fines – as a matter of ‘routine’, and leave no room for discretion. Zealous: Councils overuse CCTV cameras to enforce parking and road rules, a new report says . Mr Pickles, the Local Government Secretary, said it was ‘a constitutional affront that Englishmen and women are being fined in arbitrary and unfair ways’ to fill their cash shortfalls. Councils are on track to make £635million profit from parking this year – with income from fines and penalties alone topping £340million. The latest criticism came in evidence to the Commons’ Transport Select Committee from the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, set up by ministers to consider drivers’ appeals against parking fines. It cited concern over routine use of CCTV cameras to issue millions of fines. Department for Transport guidance says CCTV should only be used when it is impractical to use traffic wardens. Local Government minister Eric Pickles accused councils of using parking fines to 'fill their coffers with cash' When CCTV is used, drivers only find out they have been caught when a fixed penalty ticket drops through their letter box some time later, making it harder to challenge the fine. The tribunal told MPs: ‘Adjudicators have found cases where camera enforcement appears to be used as a matter of routine where the strict requirements for use in the Guidance do not appear to be present.’ Adjudicators also said councils are also refusing to use discretion to waive fines when a car stops in a ‘no waiting’ area for safety reasons. In one such case, a driver was penalised for stopping after his windscreen shattered. Tickets have also been issued to motorists who have stopped  to change drivers after feeling unwell, the watchdog said. It added: ‘Modern-day occurrences call for sensible and considerate handling of representations.’ A ‘zero-tolerance’ policy, it added, ‘cannot be appropriate’. Local Government minister Eric Pickles seized on the evidence, saying it shows ‘councils bending the law as a means of filling their coffers with taxpayers’ cash’. He added: ‘Parking charges and fines are not a tax, but even the independent Traffic Tribunal now warns they are being systematically abused by town hall officers.’ More than 300 councils in England have the power to keep income raised from fines and charges. But the law says they can only do so to ease congestion and control traffic – not to subsidise other services. The High Court ruled last month that Barnet council acted ‘unlawfully’ when raising residents’ parking charges to boost its income.","Authorities routinely use cameras to enforce parking restrictions .

"By . Associated Press . Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could have a potentially awkward encounter tomorrow night when they meet at a party just days after she criticized the president’s foreign policy. The White House said the president, . along with first lady Michelle Obama, planned to see Clinton on Wednesday . at a party on Martha's Vineyard for Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic . adviser Vernon Jordan. Clinton is on the Massachusetts island for a . memoir-signing session at a bookstore, while the Obamas are in the midst . of a two-week vacation. It was unclear whether former President Bill Clinton also planned to attend the party. The event comes on the heels of an interview in which Clinton drew the sharpest distinctions . yet from herself and Obama in a rebuke of his cautious approach to global crises. President Barack Obama is currently on vacation on the island of Martha's Vineyard. Tonight he and Hillary Clinton will attend the same get-together, which could be awkward. Just a few days ago Clinton slammed Obama's approach to Syria in an interview . Hillary Clinton signs copies of her book Hard choices in Huntington, New York last Wednesday. Clinton will be in Martha's Vineyard this week for another book signing . 'Great nations need organizing principles, and ""don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle,"" ' Clinton said in an . interview with The Atlantic, referring to a version of the phrase Obama and his advisers . have used privately to describe his approach to foreign policy. Asked for her organizing principle, she replied: 'Peace, progress and prosperity. This worked for a very long time.' Clinton wrapped her critiques in expressions of respect for the president and sympathy for the tough global decisions he grapples with from the Oval Office. On Monday, a vacation day for Obama, he dealt with issues involving Iraq, Ukraine, Gaza, Syria, as well as terrorism and Ebola in Africa. 'He's thoughtful, he's incredibly smart, and able to analyze a lot of different factors that are all moving at the same time,' she said. 'I think he is cautious because he knows what he inherited, both the two wars and the economic front, and he has expended a lot of capital and energy trying to pull us out of the hole we're in.' However, Clinton offered an uncompromising defense of Israel's battle against Hamas in Gaza and argued against Obama's decision not to build up a rebel fighting force to confront Syrian President Bashar Assad. Clinton previously described her advocacy for the Syrian rebellion in her recently released book Hard Choices, a memoir about her time leading the State Department. Obama has said supporting the rebels would not have stopped al-Qaida-inspired groups from rampaging across Syria and inside Iraq today. Clinton and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta reportedly argued for arming the rebels who first stood up to Assad three years ago. Since then, the question of 'arming the rebels' has become more complicated, as fighters linked to al-Qaida and other fundamentalist Islamist groups have joined the rebellion. Clinton told The Atlantic she can't say definitively that her recommendations as secretary of state would have made a difference, but 'the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.' The White House declined to respond to Clinton's comments, but said her team gave them a heads-up before the interview was published. Clinton, who lost to Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, has not said definitively whether she will run in 2016. But her decision to sit down for an in-depth interview about her foreign policy vision and to distinguish herself from the unpopular incumbent for whom she worked is the latest signal she's seriously preparing for a bid. Republicans say she won't be able to escape that she carried out Obama's foreign policy for his first term without public complaint. 'Hillary Clinton spent four years executing Barack Obama's foreign policy, and in year five of Obama's term it's ridiculous for Hillary to try to swindle voters into thinking what's happening around the world isn't a product of Obama-Hillary diplomacy,' Republican National Committee spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski said in response to Clinton's interview.","In an interview released over the weekend Clinton slammed Obama's 'don't do stupid stuff' approach to foreign policy .

"By . Andy Tillet . Robin Williams’ half-brother has paid tribute to the star, saying he meant a ‘very great deal’ to him.McLaurin Smith-Williams, 67, shared a mother, Laura McLaurin, with the tragic comic - who was found dead from apparent suicide at his home in Tiburon, California, earlier today - and is still coming to terms with the shocking news. When contacted at his home in Memphis, Tennessee, he exclusively told MailOnline: ‘I would very much not like to talk about this right now. He means a very great deal to me. Thank you.’ McLaurin has previously talked about how Robin and his other half brother Todd – who had the same father as the funnyman, but who passed away in 2007 – used to meet up with their families every year. Scroll down for video . The family is heartbroken: Zachary Pym Williams, Robin Williams and Susan Schneider attend The Comedy Awards back in 2012 during happier times . Half brother:Robin had a half brother named Todd and the two of them were very close and spent time iwth Robin's other half brother McLaurin Smith-Williams . Early years: Robin Williams is pictured here with his first wife Valerie Velardi to whom he was married from 1978 to 1988 . He told the Chicago Tribune in 1991: ‘All three of us grew up as only children - Todd, myself and Robin. I was adopted by my mother’s parents after her divorce from her first marriage. Todd grew up with his mother. ‘We all get along famously. Todd is no blood relation to me, but we’re real close.’ Robin’s first two wives, Valerie Velardi, whom he was wed to from 1978 to 1988 and Marsha Garces Williams, whom he was married to from 1989 to 2008, have yet to comment on his passing. When contacted, Charlotte Filbert - who the Good Will Hunting actor was linked to in 2008 - sounded distraught and a little shaken. She told MailOnline: ‘I’m sorry, but this is just not a good time right now.’ Following the discovery of the 64-year-old’s body, his wife, Susan Schneider, issued a statement. She said: ‘This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. Many loved him: Robin Williams and his ex- wife Marsha Garces Williams whom he was married to from 1989 to 2008 . ‘I am utterly heartbroken ... It is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.’ Robin is also survived by his three children; son Zachary Pym, 31, who he had with Valerie and Cody Alan, 22, and daughter Zelda Rae, 25, who he had with Marsha. Many who met Robin have fond memories of their encounters with him, such as Jonna Dzilsky, who grew up in the same neighbourhood as the Mrs. Doubtfire star lived with Valerie, in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles, in the early 80s. She remembers how he used to give her and her friends lifts in his car, a red BMW, as youngsters. She said: ‘He used to pick us up after we’d been hitchhiking. He was so funny.  I used to have a horse who used to get loose and eat his wife’s flowers.  And she would scream at me and he’d come out and say “oh, its OK they’re just kids.”' Missed by family: Robin Williams posing with family members Cody, Zeldaand wife Marsha during Williams' hand and footprint ceremony outside the Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . ‘I was between around eight and eleven at the time. ‘He was crazy, he would pick us up if he saw us trying to get home, and he would do jokes and try and scare us in the backseat, he was just so funny. ‘He was particularly nice to me because his wife would scream at me all the time. ‘Whenever we saw him we’d flag his car down to get rides. We knew he’d be a fun person to hang with on the way home. And he always made sure we got home safe and he dropped us at our door. ‘To hear that he [took his own life] makes me think there is a whole layer of depression I don’t know about, and that I am thankful I don’t know about.’ Marin County Sherriff’s office have released statement saying they received a call at approximately midday saying a male adult had been found unconscious and that Robin was later pronounced dead at the scene. An investigation into the cause, manner, and circumstances of the death is currently underway by the Investigations and Coroner Divisions of the Sheriff’s Office.

"By . Associated Press . An Oklahoma company has created a protective blanket that developers say could give children a better chance of surviving debris from a tornado — or bullets from a 9 mm handgun. The Bodyguard Blanket, made by ProTecht, is a bulletproof pad designed to protect students during disasters at school. The 5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack-like straps that allow users to put it on, and then duck and cover. Steve Walker developed the pad, The Oklahoman reported. Walker started on the idea after a massive tornado struck last year in Moore, killing 24 people including seven children inside an elementary school that didn't have a tornado shelter. Scroll down for video . Bodyguard Blankets made by ProTecht can protect students from tornado debris or bullets during school disasters . Kids can strap the blankets to their backs like a backpack to avoid getting hurt during a disaster . 'We're trying to stop that blunt-force trauma when that rubble is falling down on a child, for instance,' said Walker, a podiatrist from Edmond. He gave a sketch of the protective blanket to Stan Schone, an inventor and one of his patients, during an appointment. The two form half of the executive team at ProTecht. The others are Jeff Quinn and Jay Hanan. Hanan is an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Oklahoma State University-Tulsa. He introduced the team to Dyneema, a high-density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than Kevlar. The new material also protects against nails, shards of metal and other sharp objects. 'Instead of bending over and hoping for the best, they're afforded an extra layer of protection,' Schone said. At $1,000 per blanket, he and others with the company say buying one per student would be less expensive than building tornado shelters. 'By no means would we ever say that this is more protective,' Walker said. 'But when you have budget constraints, this might be a viable alternative.' ProTecht took a finished blanket to a shooting range and had it subjected to a National Institute of Justice Class 3A test, which is used to test body armor for police units. The classification implies protection against various projectiles, including 9 mm and .22-caliber bullets. It passed, Schone said. The blanket has been in production for about 10 months, and the team started marketing it about a week ago, he said. Blankets cost around $1,000 per student which is cheaper than building a bomb shelter .

"By . Associated Press . A federal judge known for sentencing a former Alabama governor to prison in a corruption case was released from an Atlanta jail Monday after he was accused of hitting his wife when she accused him of infidelity. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Fuller, 55, posted a $5,000 bond after a hearing in Fulton County Magistrate Court. He is charged with misdemeanor battery and must appear in court again Aug. 22. A former local prosecutor and appointee of President George W. Bush, Fuller has served in the Middle District of Alabama since 2002, serving as chief judge from 2004 until 2011. Standing in judgement: This photo shows U.S. District Court Judge Mark Fuller after his arrest on a misdemeanor battery charge in Atlanta . Atlanta police arrested Fuller early Sunday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in downtown Atlanta after responding to a complaint from his wife, Kelli Fuller. According to the police report, both the Fullers admit to an alteraction, but each blamed the other as the aggressor. The report states that Kelli Fuller, 41, 'answered the door in tears' and had visible cuts on her mouth and forehead when police arrived. They later documented bruises on her legs. Kelli Fuller was treated at the hotel by paramedics but refused to be taken to a hospital. Police say the judge was on the bed when they entered the room, which smelled of alcohol. There was broken glass and hair on the floor. Blood was discovered in the bathroom. Kelli Fuller told police that her husband became violent after she accused him of having an affair with a law clerk in his Montgomery office. She said he pulled her hair, threw her to the ground and dragged her, kicked her and struck her several times in the face. Mark Fuller told police that his wife became violent as she confronted him with allegations of cheating. The judge told police he was watching television when his wife threw a drink glass at him. He told officers that he grabbed her hair and threw her to the ground to defend himself. Mark Fuller had no visible injuries, the report said. Big case: Fuller presided over the public corruption trial of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman (left) and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy (right) Kelli Fuller's 17-year-old son, Hunter Gregg, also was at the hotel. He told police that he heard his mother and step-father fighting earlier in the evening as he passed by their room. He said they had been drinking and described a volatile relationship, telling police 'this was not the first time an incident like this had occurred.' Mark Fuller indicated in court Monday that he will hire a private attorney. Misdemeanor offenses in Georgia generally are punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. Fuller did not return a telephone message left in his chambers. Kelli and Mark Fuller married after the judge and his previous wife, Lisa Boyd Fuller, divorced in 2012. The divorce file, held in Montgomery County, was sealed at Mark Fuller's request. Through the attorney who represented her in the divorce, Lisa Boyd Fuller declined comment Monday. On the bench, Mark Fuller is best known for presiding over the 2006 public corruption trial of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy. Among other things, jurors convicted Siegelman of accepting political contributions in exchange for granting Scrushy a seat on a regulatory board key to the health-care executive's business interests. But the trial also focused on attention on Fuller, an active Republican before he joined the bench, and his handling of the case against a once-popular Democratic governor. According to the Middle District's online schedule, Fuller had been scheduled to preside in his own courtroom Monday at 10 a.m. for a hearing. He has two trials, one of them requiring jury selection, scheduled for next week, and he has multiple hearings scheduled for August 22, the day he's due back in Atlanta as a defendant. Federal judges are confirmed by the Senate to lifetime terms.","U.S. District Court Judge Mark Fuller, 55, has been charged with misdemeanor battery .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dramatic dashcam video has revealed the moment police officers saved the life of a six-year-old girl who was being savagely attacked by two vicious pit bulls. Zainabou Drame has been put in a medically-induced coma after the two dogs ripped off most of her jaw and tongue as she played with her brother outside their Cincinnati, Ohio home on Wednesday. The video shows one police officer jumping out of a patrol car before it had come to a stop before running towards the animals with his weapon drawn. When one of the pit bulls turns on him, the officer opens fire, but both animals run into another yard off camera. All three officers then shot at the dogs, who were killed. Scroll down for video .

The animals ripped off most of her jaw . The footage, first shared by WLWT, shows one of the officers standing over the girl as ambulances arrive to assist - before she is carried off on a stretcher. Zainabou had been playing with her nine-year-old brother outside their house when the dogs latched onto her face and dragged her along the suburban street. Her horrified brother Moustapha yelled for their mother Tanina Drame, who tried to beat off the dogs with a baseball bat. The pit bulls only let go when shot at by police. 'It started biting on her shorts and pants. It tripped her over and the dogs started chewing all over her face,' Moustapha told WCPO. 'I got scared when I saw it and then I started crying. Then I started calling mom.' Taken to safety: Footage shows Zainabou Drame being carried to an ambulance on a stretcher . Zainabou was rushed to hospital where she is listed in a serious but stable condition. WLTX reported she has been placed in an induced coma, with authorities 'cautiously optimistic' she will survive the unprovoked attack. Police said Zainabou was playing with a group of friends on Aquadale Lane about 6pm Wednesday when the dogs, which lived with their owner in the neighborhood, chased her and attacked. Upon hearing calls for help, the little girl's mother, who was inside her home, ran to the street with a baseball bat and beat the dogs. The family's dog Cappuccino also ran to the little girl's aid. It wasn't until police arrived that the pit bulls released the girl. Officers distracted the dogs before shooting them dead. 'It’s . really indescribable and something no person should ever have to see and . something we’ll never forget,' Cincinnati Police Officer Kyle Strunk said. Victim: Zainabou Drame, six (pictured left and . right) is in an induced coma after being mauled by two vicious pit bulls . outside her Ohio home on Wednesday night. The animals ripped off most of her jaw and tongue . 'I saw the brown dog, which was the bigger of the two dogs and he had . the girl’s head in his mouth. He was slinging it around, thrashing his . head back and forth with her in his mouth.' A day after the attack, police . arrested the dogs' owner, 24-year-old Zontae Irby. He is yet to be . charged in relation to the dog attack. However, following a police search of his home, Irby was charged with weapons under disability, drug abuse and drug trafficking. He is also being held on a . $75,000 bond. SPCA of . Cincinnati crew seized a third pit bull owned by Irby. Operations . Director Mike Retzlaff said dog owners have a responsibility to keep . their animals under control.

All the face gone,' he said. Gina Tyus, Zainabou's aunt, described her niece's injuries as 'gruesome'. 'Both . the dogs, one on each side, latched onto her face and ripped her jaw . almost completely off. It was broken to the point where you could . actually pull it away from her face,' Tyus said.

"Casey Kasem's dead body could be locked away in a funeral home for months and the star's children may never know where he is to be buried, his family told MailOnline today. A spokesman for the family said they fear his body is being stored in a funeral home in Montreal while his widow Jean 'plays games' with other family members that she has been at war with during Casey's last few years of his life. There is no time limit to how long he can be kept in the undignified state and Jean has sole control of his remains and is under no obligation to tell anyone where he is or what she intends to do with them. Mystery: Casey Kasem's body is believed to be in Montreal but the only person who knows for sure is his wife Jean. A spokesman at the funeral home stated on his death certificate would not confirm he is there . War: Kerri Kasem has been fighting a very public battle against Jean, claiming she was guilty of elder abuse of the star. Her spokesman today said she fears she will never know where her father is to be buried . A spokesperson for the family said today: 'At this point we believe that Casey's body is at a funeral home in Montreal, although it's difficult to be 100% sure, our fear is that Jean plans to keep Casey there for months while she plays her games. Ultimately our worry is that we may never know where Casey is to be buried.' Casey’s body is understood to be in Montreal, Canada, after it was apparently shipped there on July 14 - a month after his death - by Jean against the wishes of most of his family. But there is confusion over what happened next. The funeral director from Tacoma, Washington, who sent the body and his counterpart in Montreal have both denied they are responsible. Casey was one of the most beloved broadcasters of his generation and was the host of the long running 'American Top 40', as well as the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon series Scooby-Doo. He died at the age of 82 at St Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbour, Washington State, having been suffering from dementia. Jean, his second wife of 34 years, had already been embroiled in a bitter row with his three children from his first marriage who alleged that she was guilty of elder abuse by not providing him with adequate care in his final months. After Casey’s death his daughter Kerri Kasem won a restraining order from a Seattle judge to stop his body being cremated. But as she went to serve it at the Gaffney Funeral Home in Tacoma, Washington, she was told the body was no longer there. The death certificate drawn up by the Gaffney Funeral home says that Casey’s remains were sent to the Urgel Bourgie funeral home in Montreal on July 14. Yvan Rodrigue, president and chief of operations of the company declined to confirm if the body was in Montreal or if it was even in his custody. However he said that 'not uncommon' for one funeral director to 'sub-contract' services to another where they could not provide them, be it cremation or looking after the body in another country. He said that when bodies were being held in storage they are put in a freezer which he described as a ‘special container’ and said that the coroner in Montreal had a large one it used in the morgue. Asked if the Urgel Bourgie funeral home had such facilities, he said: 'Of course'. Mr Rodrigue, who said he could only talk in general terms, said that sometimes people die in the winter and the family want a summer burial so they use the freezer and that legally there was ‘no time limit' as to how long it could stay there. Bitter: Jean has been accused of 'playing games' with Casey's elder children. She is in sole control of his body in death and moved it days before Kerri won a restraining order to stop Casey's remains being cremated . As to who was in charge of Casey’s remains, however, he said that the Gaffney funeral home still had overall responsibility and pointed to its boss Corey Gaffney. Mr Rodrigue said: 'Mr Gaffney is still in charge. He still has contact with the family. 'I have no agreement with the family. I am not the funeral director involved.' In an interview with MailOnline Mr Gaffney said he was 'baffled' by the apparent contradiction. Mr Gaffney had told the Canadian Broadcasting Company that he was definitely not responsible for Casey any longer. In an interview he had said: 'What we did was made sure that Casey got to the airport, we released custody of Casey to the airline. 'The airline signed for that and acknowledged that and then at that point we returned to our office, tracked his flight to Montreal, confirmed that he had arrived, reported that to Mrs Kasem (Jean). 'When he landed in Montreal, I ceased being the funeral director in charge.' Mr Gaffney told MailOnline that those comments still stood. He said: 'My earlier statement...is still true and accurate today. We have no family mandate.' Why exactly Casey’s body was taken to Montreal is unclear. Casey had no known connection to the Canadian city, his daughter Kerri has said. A possible reason could be a bid by Jean to delay any further legal action by Kerri. By moving the body to another country, it throws up another legal barrier to Casey’s family who want his body back. Mr Rodrigue said: 'When we are facing a difficult situation the best thing for us is to do nothing until the lawyers have found an agreement. We cannot get in the middle of a family dispute. We are stuck. We are not there to judge.' He added that if Kerri wanted the Seattle judge’s decision to apply in Montreal she would have to make a separate legal application there too. Casey’s death has led to bitter words from both sides. His brother Mouner told MailOnline last week that Jean’s decision to move the body to Montreal was a 'sick joke by a sick woman'. At a complete loss over her father's whereabouts, Kerri doesn't even know if her father may have already been buried in Los Angeles in a secret funeral service. Adding to the drama is that Police in Santa Monica, California, where Casey had been being cared for, still want to carry out an autopsy in their investigation into the alleged elder abuse. Santa Monica police spokesman Rudy Camarena said: 'Mr Kasem’s matter is an open and on-going investigation. 'As such the Santa Monica Police Department will not be issuing any statements and or disseminating any press releases pending further instructions from our Criminal Investigation’s Office.'","Family spokesman told MailOnline they fear body is being stored in funeral home in Montreal .

"By . Derek Hunter . QPR are launching a bid to sign Lassana Diarra from Lokomotiv Moscow. Diarra, 29, blossomed under manager Harry Redknapp while at Portsmouth and was part of the 2008 FA Cup winning side. Redknapp had paid a bargain £5.5million to rescue him from Arsenal where he was struggling to make a breakthrough. Just a year later he sold Diarra to Real Madrid for £18.8m. QPR target: Harry Redknapp is keen to be reunited with former Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra . Galactico: Diarra in action for Real Madrid after he moved to the Bernabeu following his spell at Portsmouth . The France international was a favourite at the Bernabeu for his sharp tackling and willingness to play in different positions but, ultimately, was crowded out by their recruitment of galacticos and was sold to Anzhi Makhachkala before swiftly moving again to Lokomotiv. Redknapp is eager to bring a quality defensive midfielder into his side to protect Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker. Diarra would cost around £6m but may be allowed to leave on loan if QPR pay his £80,000-a-week salary. The good old days: Samir Nasri and Lassana Diarra in training with France in 2010 at Clairefontaine . Napoli are also keen but Diarra has told them he would prefer to go back to London. Redknapp wants four more signings, with a striker and left-back among his priorities.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Rebel: Lady Warsi claims Tories have neglected the votes of ethnic minorities in favour of white voters . David Cameron has left it too late to win next year’s general election because he has failed to woo the ethnic minorities, Baroness Warsi warned yesterday. In a further salvo after resigning from the Government over Gaza, she claimed that the Prime Minister’s ‘public school’ allies did not understand modern Britain. She also claimed that some of Mr Cameron’s inner circle had dismissed her – the first Muslim female Cabinet minister – as being not up to the job because she was a ‘brown, working-class woman’. Last night a Conservative MP criticised Lady Warsi, saying if the Tories were not winning the ethnic minority vote that was her fault as much as anyone’s because she had been minister for community cohesion. Alec Shelbrooke, the MP for Elmet and Rothwell in Yorkshire, claimed that she had ‘embarrassed herself’. He added: ‘I think within a week, “Who was Lady Warsi?” will be the question. She has ended her career in many ways.’ Lady Warsi quit as a Foreign Office minister last week, saying the Government’s position on the Gaza crisis – and its failure to properly criticise Israel – was ‘morally indefensible’. Mr Cameron had given her a job in his first Cabinet as party chairman in an attempt to give the Tories a more modern face. Lady Warsi was later moved to the Foreign Office – widely seen as a demotion – and given a job as faith minister charged with improving community cohesion. In a newspaper interview yesterday, she said Tory bosses were ignoring ‘electoral reality’ by relying on white voters. The peer, who comes from a working-class background in Yorkshire, said: ‘The electoral reality is that we will not win outright Conservative majorities until we start attracting more of the ethnic vote. 'We’ve probably left it a little too late to take this part of the electorate seriously.’ Rounding on criticism of her, she said: ‘Some of the bitchiest women I’ve ever met in my life are the men in politics. ‘I am a brown, working-class woman from the North. People have been telling me I’m not good enough since the day I was born.’ In a reference to Mr Cameron’s inner circle, she added: ‘I don’t hold the fact that someone went to public school against them. ‘I don’t hold the fact that they haven’t had the breadth of experience that some of us who didn’t go to public school have had. ‘I hope that if I can be so understanding about their background and shortcomings, they can be understanding to those of us who haven’t had those opportunities.’ In a reference to Mr Cameron’s inner circle, she added: 'I hope that if I can be so understanding about their background and shortcomings, they can be understanding to those of us who haven’t had those opportunities’ Lady Warsi called on the Government to recognise Palestine as a state and impose an arms embargo on Israel. She criticised George Osborne and Michael Gove for failing to use their ‘very, very close’ relations with the Israeli government to defuse the crisis. Dismissing the Chancellor’s claim that her resignation had been ‘unnecessary’, she said: ‘My actions would not have been necessary if he had done what he should have done, which is pick up the phone to people he is incredibly close to and say, “It’s unnecessary for you to meet your ends by taking out power stations, taking out homes, taking out schools and killing kids on beaches”.' Boris Johnson has given his clearest indication yet that he hopes to lead the Tory Party, saying he has shown in London he had the ‘ruthless energy’ to get things done. He said he ran for the job of London mayor six years ago to ‘show what I can do’. Asked if he wanted to follow David Cameron as leader, he replied: ‘I would certainly say I know an awful lot about administration and public service now.’ Mr Johnson last week announced he would seek to return to Parliament. He is said to be in talks to contest the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in west London. A poll yesterday put him in the lead to succeed Mr Cameron – with 34 per cent of all voters and half of Tory supporters wanting him to take over. In a Sunday Times interview yesterday, he also took a swipe at arch-rival George Osborne, denouncing the Chancellor’s ‘lack of vision’ in dismissing his idea of an airport in the Thames Estuary. One MP said Mr Johnson’s allies wanted a repeat of the 2010 election when the Tories were the largest party but did not win a majority. The Johnson faction could then join Labour to vote down a Tory-Lib Dem coalition and he would ‘storm through’ a subsequent leadership race.","Salvo came after first Muslim female Cabinet minister resigned over Gaza .

"By . Press Association . A dramatic 'supermoon' is set to accompany this year's Perseid meteor shower, one of the most anticipated events on the skywatcher's calendar. Given a dark, clear sky in a normal year, it is common to see more than 100 of the meteors an hour during the second week in August. But this year the Perseids have a bright shining rival that's already lighting up the sky - a 'supermoon.' Brightening up: The weathercock of the church of Saints Peter and Paul is pictured in front of the moon in the village of Klein-Auheim near Hanau in Germany . The debris stream left by comet Swift-Tuttle produces the Perseids . Lunar lady: The moon is seen as it rises over a statue by Harriet A. Ketcham titled 'Victory' in the statehouse complex in Des Moines, Iowa . Between two horns: The moon appears behind a Spanish fighting bull in Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain. The phenomenon, which scientists call a perigee moon, occurs when the moon is near the horizon and appears larger and brighter than other full moons . On Sunday, two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak, the moon will become full. Coincidentally, it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the Earth, known as 'perigee.' The supermoon will be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full moons during the year. On one level, this is bad news, according to Dr Bill Cooke from the American space agency Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office. 'Lunar glare wipes out the black-velvety backdrop required to see faint meteors, and sharply reduces counts,' he said. But all is not lost. The debris stream left by comet Swift-Tuttle, which produces the Perseids, is wide, so the shooting stars could make an appearance well before the moon becomes full. Dr Cooke added that the Perseids were also 'rich in fireballs as bright as Jupiter or Venus' that would remain visible despite the moon's glare. A study conducted by his team since 2008 has shown the Perseids to be the undisputed 'fireball champion' of meteor showers. Arizona: Men play on a climbing structure at Riverview Park in Mesa while the moon rises August 9, 2014, a day before the supermoon is to appear . Bright sight: Visitors look at an illuminated park from a new viewing platform in the 'Garden Park' in Bad Zwischenahn, Germany as a nearly full  moon is seen behind . Sparks fly: Sparks from fireworks in front of the moon during the Pyro Games competition in Magdeburg, Germany, where pyrotechnician compete against each other for the best rocket show . ""We see more fireballs from Swift-Tuttle than any other parent comet,"" said Dr Cooke. Tony Markham, director of the Society for Popular Astronomy's meteor section, also urged skywatchers to stay optimistic. ""The Perseids are rich in bright meteors and so many Perseids will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background,"" he said, writing on the SPA's website. ""You can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the Cassiopeia/Cepheus/Ursa Minor area. ""If possible, keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building."" He pointed out that at this time of year the moon is relatively close to the horizon, leaving much of the sky dark. Lunar flight: A plane is silhouetted against the moon as it is seen from Kalchreuth, Germany, 08 August 2014 . An LAX bound passenger airplane drops the wheels as it crosses the moon two days before the Full Moon and Super Moon passing over Whittier, California, on its final approach to the Los Angeles Airport, on Friday,  August 8, 2014 . Mr Markham also suggested looking at an area of sky 20 to 30 degrees away from the Perseid radiant - the spot near the constellation of Perseus that the meteors appear to fly out from. Every 133 years, comet Swift-Tuttle swings through the inner Solar System leaving behind a trail of dust. When the Earth passes through, the dust cloud particles hit the atmosphere at 140,000 mph and burn up in streaking flashes of light, creating the spectacle known as the Perseids. The best time to see the meteors is between Saturday and Wednesday, with activity peaking on Tuesday. An unusually bright full ""supermoon"" was also seen on July 12, and another is due to appear on September 9. But the supermoon of Sunday promises to be the most dramatic since this is when the moon will be at its closest point to the Earth all year. At perigee, the moon is around 31,000 miles closer than when it is furthest away from the Earth. Supermoons occur relatively often, every 13 months and 18 days, but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has not ruled out more signings to follow the capture of defender Thomas Vermaelen as the Catalan giants continue their summer rebuilding. Vermaelen completed his move to Barca on Sunday, signing a five-year contract at the Nou Camp after joining from Arsenal for a fee that could eventually rise to £15million. The Belgium international joins Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic, Claudio Bravo, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Jeremy Mathieu as newcomers at Barca, who will be under the guidance of new coach Luis Enrique next season as they look to recover from a hugely disappointing campaign under Gerardo Martino. New colours: Thomas Vermaelen with Barcelona director Andoni Zubizarreta (left) and Vice-President Jordi Mestre proudly show off their latest signing - and they could bring in more players this summer . Speaking at Vermaelen's presentation, Zubizarreta admitted he was very happy with the talent Barca now have at their disposal, but also revealed that the club were still open to more additions if the right players become available. He said: 'With the addition of Thomas we completed a defensive line of a very high level. There are options that we are working on for the exit of some player, as such we're not discarding that others could come in. 'What I can say is that at midnight on August 31 we hope to have the best squad possible. Even though we are very happy with the players that we have, if there is a chance to improve it, we will try. 'Until the first or second (of September), when we talk about the market being closed, anything could happen.' In the squad: Vermaelen will wear the No 23 shirt at the Nou Camp having signed a five-year contract . New man:  Vermaelen was unveiled as a Barcelona player at the Nou Camp after the completion of his move . Claudio Bravo - Real Sociedad - £9.5M . Marc-Andre ter Stegen - Borussia Monchengladbach - £9.5M . Ivan Rakitic - Seville - £16M . Luis Suarez - Liverpool - £75M . Jeremy Mathieu - Valencia - £15.8M . Thomas Vermaelen - Arsenal - £15M . Zubizarreta preferred not to talk about specific targets, which reportedly still include Fiorentina's Colombia star Juan Cuadrado, while he also said Barca had not received any offers for right back Dani Alves. Vermaelen was not short of suitors as it became increasingly clear his future lied away from Arsenal, with Manchester United one of the clubs heavily linked with services, but the 28-year-old insisted it was a 'dream' for him to move to the Nou Camp. 'I'm very happy. It's a dream for many players to be here, and I've achieved it. I will play with the best, I will train with them every day and I hope to improve. I will try and adapt as soon as possible,' he said. 'It's one of the biggest clubs in the world, it's a dream, as I already said. Therefore, for a player like me it wasn't a difficult decision to come here.' Vermaelen, who Barca hope will help fill the sizeable gap in defence left by the retired Carles Puyol, struggled with injuries at Arsenal but the former Ajax man hopes his fitness problems are now behind him. Target: Barca could yet move for Colombian World Cup star Juan Caudrado, with more business to be done . He made only 13 starts in all competitions and 21 appearances in total for Arsenal last season, which concluded with him being an unused substitute in the Gunners' FA Cup final victory over Hull as they collected their first trophy in nine years. 'Last year was a little tough with all the injuries I suffered. I think that happens now and again during a player's career. It could be a coincidence that they all happened in a short period of time,' he said. 'The only thing I want is to look to the future, regain my form and fitness. My aim is to play in lots of games and help the team. 'I want to start from zero and I am sure I'll have a fantastic season here at Barca.' Vermaelen's buy-out clause in his contract with Barca is £64million and he will wear the number 23 shirt with the Blaugrana. Outgoing? There has been speculation that Dani Alves (left) could leave but Barcelona have had no offers .","Former Arsenal captain Vermaelen is Barca's sixth summer signing .

"By . Jenny Awford . Top referee David Rose, 50, outside Plymouth Crown Court where he was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £700 in fines after admitting to falsely claiming unemployment benefits . One of Britain's top rugby referees today admitted claiming unemployment benefit while officiating Premiership matches. David Rose, 50, claimed more than £700 in Job Seekers Allowance while working as a top referee – earning up to £696 per game in the Aviva rugby union league. He was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £700 in costs at Plymouth Crown Court after admitting a charge of giving false information for obtaining benefits. The Premiership referee made an application for the benefit in February 2012 after being made redundant from his job as a project manager for the Rugby Football Union. But he failed to disclose his earnings from his work as a freelance referee and claimed £712 in benefits. Plymouth Crown Court heard that Rose had not thought of his refereeing as work and believed he did not need to disclose it as it was under the 16 hours a week threshold. Rose, from Plymouth, pleaded guilty to furnishing false information with the purpose of obtaining benefits between 17 February 2013 and 22 February 2013. Prosecutor Adrian Chaplin said: 'He had been made redundant from his work with the Rugby Football Union where he had been a project manager . 'He didn't say he was earning money from it. What he had been doing since his full time employment was working on an as and when basis for the Rugby Football Union. 'He had been refereeing rugby football matches and had been receiving income up to the time of his application and continued doing this. 'It would seem he reffed on the 15 February and received £696. 'The day after his interview on the 21 February he reffed again on the 22 February for which he received the same amount.' Rose had been charged with two counts of fraud for dishonestly signing a claim form and fraud by false representation but the prosecution agreed to reduce this to one charge. The court was told of his 'glowing CV' which had seen him officiate hundreds of matches since 2001. Defending Sam Jones said: 'He hasn't worked as a referee since facing these charges, He was temporarily suspended and has remained so for the last 17 months. The referee officiated at hundreds of Premiership matches from 2001 and he was  paid up to £696 per game. He is seen (left) at the Aviva Premiership match between London Wasps and Leeds Carnegie at Adams Park on April 17, 2011 and (right) at a Guinness Premiership match in 2007 . 'It was a genuine error, one that he accepts looking back now that he should have provided that information at the time.' Judge Graham Cottle sentenced Rose to a conditional discharge of 12 months and a £700 fine. He told him: 'You are an intelligent man. You have had a good and successful career concentrated principally around the game of rugby. Rose sprints to keep up with Jordan Turner-Hall of Harlequins during the Guinness Premiership match between Harlequins and Bristol at the Stoop on October 6, 2007 in Twickenham . 'It's at the very least odd that you should have thought you didn't need to disclose this information. 'I accept the submission that there has been a significant impact of this case professionally and also privately and that there may have well been for some period of time damage to your reputation.' The Rugby Football Union refused to comment on whether Rose would be able to continue working as a referee. Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is paid to help unemployed people and those who are on a low income and looking for a job. If you have paid enough National Insurance contributions you’ll be given a non-means-tested contribution-based JSA and those who haven't will be paid a means-tested income based JSA. It is at least £57.35 a week to help you while you look for work. To claim JSA you need to be: .","David Rose, 50, pleaded guilty to giving false information to obtain benefits .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Pub landlord Peter Lyon, 67, (pictured outside Bournemouth Magistrates' Court) is the chair of a drink awareness group but was caught drink-driving . A pub landlord who is in charge of a scheme promoting safe drinking has been banned from the roads after being caught drink-driving while delivering a takeaway. Peter Lyon, who runs The Nelson Tavern in Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset, was delivering Thai food from his pub to a customer when he was stopped by police because of a broken indicator on July 21. However, the 67-year-old, who is the head of a local Pubwatch initiative in the town, failed a roadside breath test and was arrested after being found to be nearly twice the legal drink-drive limit. He had 59mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - almost double the 35mg legal limit – and later admitted to having had two glasses of strong beer prior to getting behind the wheel. He was handed a 12-month driving ban and ordered to pay more than £500 in costs after admitting drink-driving when he appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Friday. The landlord has now offered to resign from his role as the chairman of Christchurch Pubwatch - which promotes safe drinking - but his fate will not be decided until the group's next meeting in September. He said the incident was a 'moment of madness', describing it as 'unfortunate'. He said: 'I most definitely do not condone drink-driving - this was an unfortunate set of circumstances. 'I was annoyed with my staff for taking the order, they hadn't taken it correctly. I just got in the car to do the delivery not even thinking. 'Normally I wouldn't have a drink until I had done all my deliveries. 'It was me who put the key in the ignition and I should have thought about it more carefully. 'I have volunteered my resignation to Pubwatch and what they decide is entirely up to them.' The court heard how Lyon had drunk two glasses of strong beer before getting in his car to deliver a last-minute takeaway order. Justin Shale, mitigating, said Lyon suffered from oesophagitis and Crohn's disease and had not eaten properly for the previous two days, which meant the beer had more of an effect. He said: 'He wasn't expecting to drive that evening. 'The circumstances are that he was working in The Nelson restaurant and there was a call at the last minute for a delivery to be made. Lyon is landlord of The Nelson Tavern (pictured) in Mudeford in Dorset and chairman of Christchurch Pubwatch . Lyon was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to may more than £500 in fines and costs after being found to be nearly twice the legal limit when he was stopped near Christchurch in Dorset on July 21 . 'He volunteered to drive, not thinking he would be above the limit.' Lyon was ordered to pay a £425 fine, £85 in costs and a £43 victim surcharge.

"By . Jennifer Smith . A grandfather whose wife died four weeks before he scooped £20,000 on the lottery thinks the win could be a parting gift from his late spouse. John Biddlecombe had been playing for 20 years with the same numbers when his beloved wife, Alice, died on July 2. Four weeks later, the 81-year-old from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, matched all eight numbers to take home the windfall. John Biddlecombe thinks his late wife is to thank his win which came four weeks after her death . Mr Biddlecombe, who has five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, thinks his late wife is to thank for the win. 'It’s extraordinary and far too unusual to be just a coincidence. 'I think she’s looking down saying ""I've made this happen now you enjoy yourself,""' he said. After a holiday to Malta and treats for the family, the pensioner plans to spend the money on solar panels his wife never allowed him to have. 'Alice said no when I wanted to do it - she said it wasn't worth it at our age. The couple, who had two children and five great-grandchildren, had been married for 60 years when Mrs Biddlecombe died on July 2 . Mr Biddlecombe had been playing with the same numbers for 20 years without winning more than £150 . The 81-year-old said he couldn't believe his luck when he realised what he'd won and had to go for a walk to let it 'all sink in' 'But you get such a good return I think it’ll be a good investment. The father-of-two said he felt lucky on the day of the draw which was also his birthday. 'The evening of my birthday all my family came round and I told them I felt lucky - but they just said ""yeah yeah Grandad"" and didn't believe me. 'I dozed off and so missed the numbers after the news, it was only the next day when I woke up early and checked on the computer that I found out. 'I couldn't believe it - I had to go and have a walk around to let it all sink in. 'It came into my head straight away that Alice had something to do with it - it was definitely her influence that helped me win. 'We’d been married 60 years and I’m sure this is her way of saying she’s looking forward to us meeting again and talking about our lives.' Mr Biddlecombe said he'll use the money to install solar panels in the house which his wife never allowed and plans to go on holiday in November .

"By . Sophie Borland . Drunks could be charged for ending up in A&E under proposals being considered in Northern Ireland. The country’s health minister has said there is ‘merit’ to the fees and they could free-up staff to treat seriously ill patients. Officials at the Department of Health in England insist there are no plans for charges here but some experts are in favour. In England last year a total of 1.22 million patients were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries, double the number in 2002/3 . Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland’s health minister, said he was concerned about the number of people requiring treatment as a result of their own irresponsible behaviour. ‘The United Kingdom has a great principle of health care, free at the point of need to all who need it irrespective of their ability to pay for it.’ he said . ‘I think it is a wonderful principle but I think on occasions it is abused and we sometimes need to look at how we can make sure that abuse doesn't take place.’ Referring to patients being charged if they needed treatment as a result of alcohol or drugs, Mr Poots said: ‘The principle of it has merit. ‘The implementation of it is more challenging. ‘We need to ensure that people who need medical care are not put off receiving that medical care.’ The proposals could see drunks being made to pay a fine every time they went to A&E or having to cover their treatment. Having your stomach pumped after excess alcohol, for example can cost between £600 and £3,500 . In England last year a total of 1.22 million patients were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries, double the number in 2002/3. The NHS now spends £3.5billion a year treating patients for the effects of alcohol, more than twice as much as 2001 when it was just £1.47billion. In June, senior nurses from the Royal College of Nurses said drunks should be banned from A&E as they divert care from the elderly and other seriously ill patients. Revellers who burden the NHS after turning up drunk at A&E should be charged, Northern Ireland's health minister Edwin Poots has suggested . Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the RCN, proposed sending them to drunk tanks – rooms or units in city centres – where they could sober up without creating a disturbance in hospital. He added: 'They say there was a time when this was a Friday or Saturday phenomenon but it's now round-the-week,' he said. 'There's hardly a time when there isn't someone with an alcohol problem in an A&E department.' Speaking at the RCN's annual conference in Liverpool, he added: 'It's a contemporary problem, more and more people - not just young people, people of all ages, are drinking too much. 'There is no doubt the country has a significant problem. 'We now have the highest rates of liver disease and alcohol-related illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and oesophageal problems. 'People that come in inebriated require a lot of nursing care and that detracts from nurses being able to care for others. 'People are coming in, perhaps they've been in a fight, there's blood everywhere, they're careering around, it can make things very difficult.' A Department of Health spokesperson: ‘With more than one million alcohol-related hospital admissions in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the NHS in England, costing around £3.5bn every year. ‘There are no plans to charge drunk people to use A&E. However, we have made sure there are powers in place to enable those who abuse staff to be removed.’","Northern Ireland health minister Edwin Poots attacks growing strain on A&E .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When retired mathematician Allan Robinson passed away after a battle with cancer, his grieving family chose an epitaph that he would have heartily approved of – a sudoku puzzle and equation. It did not take long, however, before zealous officials on the parish council had formed their own rather bizarre opinion of the gravestone. They ordered Mr Robinson’s widow Angela to remove the highly personal engravings because they are ‘contrary to guidelines for headstone inscriptions’. Widow Angela Robinson is furious that Farndon Parish Council, Cheshire, has ordered that the Sudoku puzzle engraving on her husband Allan's headstone be removed . And despite the tasteful – not to . mention cerebral – nature of the designs, the council said the stone has . to be changed so that standards at the graveyard are ‘kept high for the . benefit of all’. Mrs . Robinson, 67, who was married to her late husband for 44 years, said: . ‘What really got to me was they said we were lowering standards of the . burial site. Well, that’s just not true. ‘The . engravings aren’t offensive at all; we’re talking about a three inch . square puzzle and a small numerical equation. It’s about honouring my . husband’s memory.’ Mr . Robinson was a sudoku fanatic, completing puzzles every day,  while the . equation was taken  from his PhD thesis, which he  dedicated to his wife . in the early years of their marriage. Mrs . Robinson’s son, Paul, 40, added: ‘It is a very personal memorial that . surely is not causing any harm, regardless of petty rules.

Mr . Robinson, who worked for oil giant Shell in a research laboratory, died . aged 66 in May last year, following a battle with lung cancer. He . was buried in the cemetery at Farndon, near . Chester, where the couple lived, and the gravestone was put up in . November. But this August Mrs Robinson received a call from the parish . council to say a spot check of graves had revealed her husband’s . tombstone did not comply with their guidelines. Then last month she was sent the letter ordering her to remove the engravings altogether. Suzi . Pollard, clerk to the parish council, said the stonemason had failed to . submit a draft copy of the proposed headstone inscription to the . council before it was erected, and asked for it to be changed. To add . insult to injury, the letter wrongly referred to Mr Robinson as ‘Mr . Allen’. Mrs Robinson, who . has two children and four grandchildren, said there are other graves . with unusual engravings, such as animals and football crests. ‘Until the . others are removed as well I’m going to refuse to change Allan’s . grave,’ she said. Mr Robinson added that his family would be prepared to go to court to keep the existing headstone.","Allan Robinson's family commissioned puzzle engraving for headstone .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Police in Indiana have spent the past 12 years puzzling over a 19th-century tombstone that somehow ended up in a resident's backyard. With the help of social media and an enterprising Good Samaritan, the Greenwood Police Department now has come one step closer to solving the mystery. In June 2002, a Greenwood woman was digging in her garden when she stumbled upon a 144-year-old gravestone. Scroll down for video . Sad relic: This 144-year-old tombstone belonging to 20-month-old Charles A. Smith was dumped in a Greenwood, Indiana, backyard in 2002 . Unexpected find: A woman digging in her garden in this Greenwood neighborhood came upon the headstone . Collecting dust: The macabre item has been languishing in a police evidence locker for 12 years . The tomb marker was engraved with the name Charles A. Smith, a 20-month-old boy who passed away on August 6, 1870. The bewildered homeowner called police, who seized the headstone and placed it in their evidence locker, where it has languished for more than a decade. With no clues or tips to work off, investigators were completely stumped by the macabre find. Internet sleuth: Greenwood resident Caryn Turrel answered the cal of the police department, using a genealogy site to discover the tombstone came from Kosciusko County . ‘We’d have to assume it was probably a prankster or someone that maybe got scared and decided they had to get rid of it somehow, so they buried it. But we really don’t know,’ Detective Sgt Eric Klinkowski told the station Fox59. Two weeks ago, police decided to harness the power of social media, sharing a photo of the gravestone on their Facebook page and asking online users for help. The unusual post caught the attention of Greenwood resident Caryn Turrel, who launched her own online investigation into the mystery stone slab. With the help of the genealogy site Ancestry.com, Turrel discovered that Charles A. Smith's gravestone came from Kosciusko County, Indiana, more than 170 miles south of Greenwood. ‘It’s just made me feel good that ten minutes of my time was able to fix something,’ Turrel told the station WISH-TV. The burial site marker is expected to be returned to its rightful place this weekend. However, police say they may never know how it ended up in a Greenwood backyard more than two hours’ ride from the cemetery.","Tombstone found in a Greenwood, Indiana, backyard belonged to 20-month-old Charles A.

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . Pledge: The Prime Minister has made a string of pledges to kick out more foreign criminals, but overseas convicts are now avoiding deportation in one in three cases - a sharp increase on previous years . The number of foreign criminals avoiding deportation rose by 50 per cent last year – despite repeated Government pledges to kick them out. In total, 1,310 overseas convicts considered for removal were not sent home, up from 890. Offenders not thrown out after serving their sentences included 15 murderers, five people guilty of manslaughter, 15 rapists, 140 robbers and 20 guilty of sex offences against children. Foreign convicts are now avoiding deportation in one in three cases – a sharp increase on previous years. In many instances, the criminals won the right to stay after lodging appeals, citing their human right to a family life in the UK, or other legal objections. Last night, MPs said the revelations showed Britain’s border controls were ‘rotting away’. They also heaped fresh pressure on the Conservatives to spell out exactly how they plan to unpick the harm being caused by Labour’s Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. Yesterday, a case emerged showing how Article 8, the right to family life, is being used by criminals to get into Britain, as well as avoid removal. A double murderer from Bangladesh successfully claimed the right to move to the UK because his family already lives here. The Prime Minister has made a string of pledges to kick out more foreign criminals. Only last month, David Cameron said: ‘I can think of few things more infuriating than seeing people who have caused harm in our country … launch appeal after appeal to stay, with the line that they have a “right to a family life” – never mind  the families whose lives they have shattered.’ If the Home Office decides it cannot deport a foreign criminal after their jail term, they are released on to Britain’s streets. Criticism: Last night, MPs said the revelations showed Britain's border controls were 'rotting away', and heaped fresh pressure on the Conservatives to spell out exactly how they plan to unpick the harm being caused by Labour's Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights . Under . Freedom of Information laws, officials have admitted that of 4,030 . overseas convicts considered for deportation in 2012/13, 1,310 were not . sent home – 32.5 per cent. In the previous year, 890 avoided removal, . out of 3,380 cases – 26 per cent. Before . the Coalition came to power, in 2009/10 only 22 per cent were allowed . to stay. Since 2009/10, 3,700 of 14,380 foreign criminals considered for . removal have not been sent home. The figures exclude Scotland. Officials are obliged to consider deporting foreigners sentenced to lengthy jail terms in the UK. 'Safe haven': Tory MP Dominic Raab is trying to force the Home Office to reveal how many cases are related to Article 8 . The Home Office sometimes drops the . case after deciding there are too many legal barriers, such as the . criminal originating from an unsafe country or having his family in . Britain. In other instances, the offender will lodge a successful . appeal. Officials do not . break down reasons for successful cases, but a large number are brought . on human rights grounds, with criminals claiming they face mistreatment . at home, or citing the right to a family life. Tory MP Dominic Raab is trying to force the Home Office to reveal how many cases are related to Article 8. Last night, he said such claims were making Britain a ‘safe haven for the most dangerous foreign criminals’. ‘The growth in legal excuses for not deporting criminals … is rotting away our border controls – and only a majority Conservative government will get rid of it,’ he added. In 2011, ministers ordered judges to pay less attention to a criminal’s Article 8 rights – but the move was largely ignored. It . has prompted Home Secretary Theresa May to make further changes to the . law in a new Immigration Act, including a ‘deport first, appeal later’ policy. Exceptions will be made if the criminal is at serious risk of . harm at home. Tory MP Philip Hollobone called for Labour’s Human Rights . Act to be ‘done away with’. He . added: ‘What these figures reveal … is that, because of the Human . Rights Act, the ability of the British Government to deport undesirables . is actually getting less … This underlines the need for a new . government …[to] get control of our borders once again.’ Peter . Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said overseas . criminals would be ‘right to think coming here is a no-brainer given . the … feebleness of our sentencing’. Home . Office officials said removal efforts may be ongoing in some cases.

"By . A. Greg . An Indianapolis jail let an inmate out by mistake last week - the sixth time such an error has occurred since June. It took Marion County deputies three days to locate and rearrest Scott Snyder, 31, who was in jail for assault with a deadly weapon. In June, deputies had to track down five inmates who had been released by accident. Assault with a deadly weapon: Scott Snyder was released mistakenly and free for three days before deputies tracked him down . Fox 59 reports that the problems began when the county switched over to a new computer system called Odyssey in June. A spokesperson said the latest mistaken release was down to the system and human error. Sheriff of the Year: Despite the accolades, Sheriff John Layton has been hindered by errors that have seen criminals released by mistake . According to the IndyStar, the error occurred when a release order was logged on Snyder's case file but the jail staff didn't check a second case file number for the prisoner, which said Snyder should be held in custody. Snyder was released Monday and back in custody Thursday. 'They’re human beings and there can be human errors, it’s not a totally electronic system and even with the information that they have it’s extremely complicated,' said Lieutenant Colonel Louis Dezelan. Following the earlier incident, he said the sheriff's department would go 'above and beyond' to ensure it didn't happen again. Sheriff John Layton, a Democrat, was just named Indiana Sheriff of the Year and will run against Republican Emmitt Carney in November. Carney says Layton should bear the blame for the mistakes. 'They can say it’s on the computer, they can say it’s operator error, bottom line it comes down to him. It’s his office, it’s his shop. When is somebody going to step up and accept responsibility,' Carney told Fox59.","Scott Snyder was mistakenly released from Marion County jail last Monday .

Allan Portor said in evidence he had not seen any oncoming car as he was checking messages on his phone but he believed Easter's account. He also added he believed Jessica did wear a seatbelt. Mr Portor added: 'She suddenly shouted out 'what the f****** hell is he doing' and I looked up and she was swerving. 'There was nothing there but there was no time to look around. 'I trust her and if she says there was a car there, that's good enough for me. 'She loved those children like anything.' Heartbroken: The girls' mother Lorraine Mason said today that people must ensure their car is safe because: 'I don't want anybody to go through what I'm going through every day of my life' Easter admitted two charges of causing death by careless driving at Norwich Crown Court earlier this year and was given a 15-month jail term, suspended for two years. Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a conclusion that the youngsters died of multiple injuries after the car overturned. Outside, the girls' mother, Lorraine Mason, said: 'I just want to make people aware that if you're driving a vehicle, you're responsible for it and everybody in it. 'Don't take somebody out without a seatbelt on, do check your tyres and if the tread or pressure is low, don't drive it. 'I don't want anybody to go through what I'm going through every day of my life.' Easter admitted two charges of causing death by careless driving at Norwich Crown Court earlier this year and was given a 15-month jail term, suspended for two years. Giving evidence today, she insisted she had been forced to swerve to avoid an oncoming vehicle on the wrong side of the road. The road was straight and wide enough to allow for overtaking. Asked about the condition of the car, Easter said the vehicle had been repaired on December 19 and she had been told it was safe to drive. However, mechanics told the hearing that although the car had been booked in for repair, the appointment was missed. Collision investigator Sgt Andy Hood said the defects could have seriously affected the car's handling. Mr Hood added: 'It is possible the car lost traction and the driver was unable to regain control.' Mr Portor suffered broken ribs in the crash. His son, Liam, then 12, suffered cuts and bruises. Easter was also injured in the crash.","Tamzin and Jessica Portor were killed by Marie Easter at Christmas 2012 .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Steven Craig Vonk left his DNA behind at the crime scene . A bungling burglar has been jailed after leaving his DNA on a can of Carling at the scene of his crime. Armed with lager, Steven Craig Vonk broke into a flat near his home in Brynmill, Swansea, last month. The 39-year-old fled the scene empty-handed after waking up the homeowner, leaving the beer behind. Forensic officers were able to trace the burglar through DNA left on the tin. He was sentenced to 876 days in prison for burglary and a further 12 weeks from a previous suspended sentence at Swansea Crown Court. Detective Inspector Mark Kavanagh, of Swansea CID, said disturbing a burglar was a terrifying experience for any householder. 'Fortunately in this case the victim was unharmed and no property was stolen,' he said. 'But when our investigation got under way it became apparent a can of lager had been left at the scene which did not belong to the victim. 'The can was forensically examined and contained the full DNA profile of Vonk. He was later traced and arrested for the burglary. 'Whenever a burglary is reported we use every tool available to us to try and identify a suspect. 'Forensic technology is an important way of catching burglary suspect and, in this case, leaving behind a can of lager has resulted in us putting the suspect before the court.' The burglar was caught by police after leaving his can of Carling at the crime scene when the homeowner woke up .","Steven Craig Vonk broke into a flat near his home in Swansea .

"By . Amanda Williams . An investigation has been launched after a social worker took the wrong child out of school for a supervised visit with another boy’s father. Four-year-old Kenzie Joe Jubb was removed from his nursery classroom, and sent with a stranger to ‘see his father’ - along with a two-year-old girl they mistakenly thought was his sister. He was away from his class at Francis Askew Primary School in Hull, East Yorkshire for more than 10 minutes and driven to social services offices before teachers realised the mistake. Four-year-old Kenzie Joe Jubb was removed from his nursery classroom at Francis Askew Primary School in Hull, East Yorkshire, and sent with a stranger to 'see his father' - along with a two-year-old girl they mistakenly thought was his sister . Now, his parents are demanding a full explanation as to why Kenzie, who has no dealings with social services, was taken. His father Alistair Jubb said: 'We are furious. The school CCTV shows him being away for 11 minutes, but 11 minutes is a long time when your son is with someone he doesn’t know. 'How did they get the wrong child? We want to know exactly how this has happened. 'I am absolutely furious with the school. The head has assured me this will never happen again, but I wouldn’t have ever expected it to happen in the first place. 'Somebody has messed up somewhere along the line and we want to know who it was and how it happened.' The school contacted the city council’s Safeguarding Children Board when they realised the error and an investigation is being carried out. Mr Jubb said: 'The school called his mum and she was distraught. When she called me, all sorts went through my head. 'She said Kenzie had been taken out of school and the first thing that went through my head was that it was someone with a fake identification. 'It was horrific. His mum said he was back in school and those feelings of horror turned to anger.' Mr Jubb said Kenzie was taken with a social worker who also had a two-year-old girl - the sister of the child who was meant to be taken from the school. Mr Jubb said: 'I asked Kenzie if he had got in the car and where they took him. 'He said he was put in the car and the social worker told him he would be going to a house where there was a dog and he would be seeing his dad. 'He is only four. He was confused. He was taken by someone who he has never seen before in his life.' Kenzie was driven to social services offices before the mistake was discovered.

It has since been confirmed the social worker was at the school to take one of the other children on an access visit to see their father.

'They have all re-read the policies for this and the school assured me they were going to change those policies. 'This has been a bit of a wake-up for them.

"By . Amanda Williams . Terry Admas, former head of an infamous crime family, has lost a High Court battle after a judge has rejected his claims he was too poor to pay back debts from his days of crime . The head of an infamous crime family has lost a High Court battle after a judge rejected his claims he was 'poncing off his wife' and was too poor to pay back debts from his days of crime. Terry Adams, the former boss of the north London Adams Family gang, argued he was too poor to meet a £650,000-plus debt. He told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, sitting in London, that he was so poor that he felt 'like a ponce' living off his actress wife Ruth. He also denied having hidden assets that were funding a luxury lifestyle. Mrs Adams recently appeared in Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Adams applied to the judge for a 'certificate of inadequacy' to show that he lacked funds to meet his crime-linked debts - a preliminary step to getting them reduced or written off. But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) opposed his application and said there was 'a strong case' that Adams possessed 'substantial undisclosed assets' that continued to fund a luxury lifestyle. The CPS told . the High Court that Mr and Mrs Adams’ average 'identifiable' spending in . the three years from September 2010-2013 was £97,000 per annum - . 'nearly four times the national average'. The . CPS said the type of spending was 'inconsistent' with her husband’s . claim of having no assets and of being reliant on friends and family . loans for living expenses. The . CPS gave as examples Mrs Adams spending £12,044 on dental treatment and . £2,500 on a dietary programme during three months in 2013. In June 2010 she bought a spa membership at a North London country club for £3,850. The couple also spent nearly £15,000 on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment from August 2009 to September 2013. Another £5,351 had gone on parking charges, fines, and the congestion charge. Dismissing . his application for a certificate, the judge said she was 'not . satisfied that Terry Adams has provided full and frank disclosure to the . court' of the assets 'which fund his life and that of his wife'. Judge Davies refused Adams permission to appeal against her decision. Adams . owes the balance of a confiscation order of £750,000 imposed after his . conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2007 for conspiring to conceal . the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year period. The . trial judge said he had accumulated a 'considerable fortune' from his . life as 'a highly successful career criminal' over a 'significant' period of time. He told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, sitting in London, that he was so poor that he felt 'like a ponce' living off his actress wife Ruth Adams (pictured at an earlier hearing) Mrs Adams (second left) recently appeared in Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East . Described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the UK, he was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £50,000 and the £4.6 million bill for his publicly funded defence. Today the High Court rejected his claim that he was too poor to pay up on the confiscation order. The judge said that, when she heard his application at a three-day hearing in July, the amount outstanding on the order was £651,611, and interest was accruing at the rate of £83 a day. Dismissing his plea for a certificate of inadequacy, she said: 'I believe that there are financial matters known peculiarly to Terence Adams which are not before the court. 'Upon the evidence presented to the court on behalf of the applicant, I am not satisfied that the current assets of Terence Adams are worth less than the outstanding balance of the confiscation order. Accordingly this application is refused.' Barrister Ivan Krolick said on Adams’ behalf that he could not meet the confiscation order and added: 'He has committed crime and paid his price to society.' Mr Krolick said Adams became bitter after MI5 bugged his former London home for almost two years, recording the most intimate moments of his private life, including the sounds of him making love with his wife. Mr Krolick told the judge: 'You may have felt that Mr Adams is a somewhat bitter man. Rightly or wrongly, to put up with, or learn that, everything you said to your family and friends has been pored over by the authorities must make a person bitter. Dismissing his application for a certificate, the judge said she was 'not satisfied that Terry Adams has provided full and frank disclosure to the court' of the assets 'which fund his life and that of his wife' 'This is a man who has been living in a goldfish bowl. There is no element of his life that has not been exposed to the authorities.' He rejected accusations that Mrs Adams had been involved in the staging of sham loans. He suggested the CPS case was 'guesswork' and Adams’ claim of poverty was genuine. After today’s ruling, the CPS said the order against Adams, with interest, was 'now worth £653,947.74' - and steps would be taken to ensure that he met the debt and to show 'crime doesn’t pay'. The CPS said that, following the sale of his home in north London in 2009, Adams paid the court £234,166.21 and another £130,323.43 following the sale of other assets. In seeking to have the confiscation order reduced, it was Adams’s case that his current assets were worth less than the outstanding balance of the confiscation order. The CPS said: 'He claimed that he and his wife were living on expenses of £200 per week, paying rent of £250 and living on £23,000 - £24,000 per annum. 'However, visits to the Royal Opera House and expensive meals out, spa memberships at luxurious hotels, high cost dental treatments and other treatments at private clinics all indicated a very different lifestyle.' Nick Price, head of the CPS Proceeds of Crime department, said: 'Through a series of nefarious means, Terry Adams has consistently sought to hide the proceeds of his crimes. 'However, today’s judgment is proof of our determination to see that crime doesn’t pay and that those who seek to hide their wealth will be challenged and held to account. 'Mr Adams argued that he couldn’t afford to pay what he owed and yet his lavish lifestyle showed this was not the case. 'I’m pleased that, presented with our carefully gathered evidence, the judge has decided that Mr Adams does, in fact, have the ability to pay and has assets that he has not put before the court. 'We will now work hard to ensure that Mr Adams pays his confiscation order.' Mr Price said many criminals 'go to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying what is owed under confiscation orders, such as applying to the High Court to write off debt and hiding their assets. 'Depriving criminals of their ill-gotten gains disrupts organised crime and the new CPS National Proceeds of Crime Service is leading this fight across the country. 'Dedicated prosecutors will work tirelessly with investigators to claw back assets from those who seek to benefit from their crimes.' Head of the National Crime Agency’s Centurion Team, Mark Blackwell, said: 'Today’s judgment shows the real value of lifetime management and especially ancillary orders such as financial reporting orders (FROs). 'Terry Adams’ FRO remains in force until 2017 and his confiscation order will continue to incur interest until it is settled. The NCA, in partnership with the CPS, will monitor both these orders very closely.'","Terry Adams is the former boss of the north London Adams Family gang .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . There are few things Britons take greater pride in than a well-trimmed swathe of lustrous lawn. But caring for your treasured turf could be about to become much more expensive – thanks to a ruling from (you guessed it) Europe. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has been warned that Brussels may soon require anyone using a ride-on mower to take out motor insurance – even if they never take it near a road. Taken for a ride: Mowing costs may soar amid warnings Brussels may soon require users to take out motor insurance . Insurance experts have predicted the move would cost gardeners at least £100 a year in extra premiums – and potentially much more. Sources close to Mr McLoughlin said he was determined to fight off any such ‘bureaucratic meddling’. Under current rules, gardeners using ride-on mowers on their property – and not on the highway – are normally insured for any accidents through their home insurance policies. But Department for Transport officials are worried that a ruling due next month at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg could change all that. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, is reportedly determined to fight off any such 'bureaucratic meddling' Bizarrely, the case has nothing to do with Britain but revolves around a Slovenian man who was injured in a farm accident when he was knocked off a ladder by a trailer attached to a tractor. Tim Price, rural affairs spokesman for insurance firm NFU Mutual, said changing the rules would mean more expense for homeowners. He added: ‘It would be likely to cost at least £100 extra a year to take out a separate motor policy, and that would be for a small mower at that.’ Last night, a source close to Mr McLoughlin made it clear he would fight any new Brussels ruling on the issue. The source said: ‘This is exactly the sort of bureaucratic EU meddling that drives people mad. We’re determined to fight it off. It simply isn’t necessary and could hit Brits in their pockets.’","Brussels may soon require anyone using ride-on mower to take out motor insurance .

"By . Associated Press . Tony Stewart has broken his silence after causing the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward JR at a night race in New York on Saturday. Witnesses have reported that veteran driver Stewart hit young racer Kevin Ward Jr, who was walking on the track after they collided on a prior lap at the Empire Super Sprints in Canandaigua, New York. On Sunday, the three-time NASCAR champ issued a statement expressing his condolences to Ward Jr's family. WARNING GRAPHIC VIDEO .

My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy,' Stewart said in a statement released by spokesman Mike Arning. The competition director of Stewart's racing team said earlier in the day that he planned to continue Sunday's race, but he was later replaced by fellow driver Regan Smith. A video purporting to be of the incident was posted on YouTube early Sunday and appeared to show Stewart spinning Ward Jr's car.

The . track canceled the remainder of the Empire Super Sprints slate within . five minutes while the Ontario County Sheriff's Department says its . officers are at the track investigating but do not see it as a criminal . matter. Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said Stewart was 'visibly shaken' and had been cooperative in the investigation. Authorities were asking spectators and others to turn over any video they recorded of the crash. 'This is right now being investigated as an on-track crash and I don't want to infer that there are criminal charges pending,' Povero said. 'When the investigation is completed, we will sit down with the district attorney and review it. But I want to make it very clear: there are no criminal charges pending at this time.'

Witnesses at the track also described the collision. According to onlookers Ward was spun out of the race by Stewart and was hit by the three-time Nascar champion as he passed the spot on his next lap. 'It happened in Turn 2,' Adam Dulski told USA Today. 'The prior lap, Tony had gotten into him – just spun him, nothing big, just spun him around. The caution came out. He hopped out of the car – the driver of the 13 [Kevin Ward] ... he hopped out to go and yell and point a finger at Tony, typical thing.' 'Tony came around ... the back end slid out, and he definitely caught him – I couldn't tell if it was with the front or the back of the car. ... The body made contact with the car and went sliding across the track a long distance, at least 50 feet. It was the worst thing I've ever seen.'

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Tournament officials insist they have no regrets about their handling of the final day of the US PGA Championship, which finished in near-darkness and unusual circumstances at Valhalla. 'I thought it was the greatest day of golf that we've seen in years and I could not be more pleased about the excitement,' Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America's chief championships officer said. A torrential downpour which flooded the course and caused play to be suspended for almost two hours meant the final pairing of Rory McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger did not tee off until 4:19pm on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch PGA Championship highlights . Delay: Play was suspended on the final day for nearly two hours after heavy rain at Valhalla . Soaked: Staff attempt to clear standing water off the first fairway during the final round of the US PGA . VIDEO PGA Championship highlights . That meant a race against time to finish before darkness fell in Louisville, so much so that Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stood aside on the 18th hole to allow the final group to tee off. The fact that rain had been forecast on an already saturated golf course raised questions as to why tee times were not brought forward or play started from two tees, as was the case in the third round of the Open at Royal Liverpool last month. 'The forecast for Sunday was the same as the forecast for Saturday, which was a reasonable chance of showers and they could be sporadic and either hit us or miss us,' Haigh said. 'Unfortunately the one that hit us was literally only three miles wide but moved very slowly. We got three quarters of an inch of rain and the course was obviously saturated. But no, there was no real consideration given to moving the tee times forward. 'There have been occasions where we have split tees in the PGA Championship. Hazeltine, I believe, in 2009 we split tees after a rain delay. So it's not something that we are opposed to doing. 'If there was a huge front coming through that was absolutely guaranteeing rain, we would consider the best option for the running of a major championship.'

Under cover: Jerry Kelly (left) and Patrick Reed (second from right) hold umbrellas to keep themselves dry . Ian Poulter was one of the players to complain about being forced to take relief from casual water by dropping the ball in the semi-rough, but Haigh added: 'It's unfortunate and it's tough on everyone. Nobody likes playing in the casual water and with mud on the balls. But it's part of the game. 'We focused all the water movement to get it away from the landing areas so that ideally the players still had that option to play it as it lay, as well as finding the nearest point of relief that was dry.' In the end, the conditions arguably contributed to a thrilling conclusion which saw a five-way tie for the lead on the front nine and McIlroy eventually come from three shots down to win his second major title in the space of four weeks. 'I think it's wonderful golf for the people that watched it, how enthused they would be, thinking 'Hey, I want to play that game',' Haigh added. 'What better advertisement for the game than seeing the four greatest players probably in the world right now (McIlroy, Mickelson, Fowler and Henrik Stenson) playing to a crowd that was loving it. I could not be happier and more excited about how they performed.'

"By . Sam Cunningham . There are rare times in football when goalkeepers pull off seemingly impossible saves – and Watford had to rely on one of those from Jonathan Bond to knock Stevenage out of the Capital One Cup. Think Gordon Banks' save from Pele's header in the 1970 World Cup finals, Peter Schmeichel clawing out Steve Sedgley's header when Manchester United played Tottenham in 1994 or David Seaman defying physics to keep out Paul Peschisolido's header that was behind him in Arsenal's 2003 FA Cup semi-final versus Sheffield United. Stevenage were only trailing 1-0 and deserved an equaliser but were left stunned when Watford's Bond leapt across goal to keep out and effort from Darius Charles at point-blank range in the 65th minute. The ball struck his body and somehow went over. Hornet's sting: Lloyd Dyer celebrates after scoring the wining goal in the Capital One Cup . Stevenage: Beasant, Dembele, Worley, Wells, Okimo (Deacon - 56' ), Pett (Ashton - 81' Booked ), Bond, Whelpdale, Lee, Marriott (Calcutt - 80' ), Charles . Subs: Ashton, Calcutt, Day, Johnson, Deacon . Booked:  Dembele, Pett, Bond . Watford: Bond, Tamas, Munari, Doyley (Ekstrand - 29'), Pudil, Andrews, Ighalo (Vydra - 84'), Dyer, Hoban, Forestieri, Fabbrini (Murray - 81' ) Subs: Gomes, Ekstrand, Murray, Vydra, Doherty, Smith, Johnson . Booked: Pudil . Scorer: Dyer  52' Ref: Carl Berry . Att: 3,989 . At that moment they were ahead by one ruthless move. It had taken until the 52nd minute for the Championship side to take the lead against their League Two opponents. Fernando Foriestieri picked up the ball in the right channel and played a deftly-weighted through ball to Diego Fabbrini. The Italian dropped his shoulder to move one-on-one with goalkeeper Sam Beasant then selflessly passed to Lloyd Dyer to finish. It was his first goal for the club since moving from Leicester this summer. The gulf in the two sides was evident when the team-sheets were handed out. Watford manager Giuseppe Sannino was able to make nine changes from the side who beat Bolton 3-0 in their first game of the Championship season on Saturday, whereas Stevenage's Graham Westley could not even fill the allotted seven substitutes and named only five on his bench due to a raft of injuries. But until that punishing breakaway goal the difference in quality was not so clear cut and it was Stevenage, relegated from League One last season, who almost took a shock lead in the 13th minute. Striker Charles held up the ball on the right and laid off to Charlie Lee, whose effort across goal beat Bond but crashed back off the left post. It took several seconds to stop shaking. Watford's largely second string were inches away from going in front six minutes later. Lloyd Doyley played a long ball into the box and Beasant failed to spot Dyer's run, following the path of the ball instead.

"By . Kelly Rose Bradford . Carefully manoeuvring the pushchair through the doors of my local bank, I return the friendly smiles from customers. As usual, Matilda and I are treated like royalty, with bank staff fussing over her in the stroller and remarking how pretty and placid she is. Every mother knows just how precious the ‘buggy years’ are. When my son William outgrew his eight years ago (he’s 11 now), I missed it enormously. Scroll down for video . Kelly's 'Baby Girl': Kelly Rose takes a stroll in the park with Matila, tucked away in her stroller . Strolling along together is such fun, a chance for mum and her young charge to enjoy quality time outdoors in the fresh air. There are other plus points, too. I would load the pram with shopping bags, strategically park it in cafes to make sure I had plenty of room, relishing that ‘Out of the way! Mum coming through!’ power that only a baby-carriage allows. It’s fair to say that as a single mum just months away from my 41st birthday, I didn’t think I’d once again be pounding the pavements surrounding my West London home with a trendy, jogger-style three-wheel buggy. But I am, and I’m loving it because it makes me feel like a young mum again. However, the attention I attract with Matilda is very different to what I experienced when William was a golden-haired little boy. And why? Because Matilda is a four-year-old West Highland White Terrier, and we are using a pet pushchair. The reaction from passers-by as we walk around town varies greatly. I’ve been laughed at, asked if she is ill, told I’m cruel, and even accused of being an attention-seeker. In fact, I was inspired by a sweet old lady I met in Battersea Park a few months ago. Hitting the town: Kelly is pictured above hitting the shops with Matilda and pram - she is pictured left outside Sainsbury's and right near a Costa Coffee branch . Aged 90 if she was a day, she was pushing three elderly Pekingese dogs (all in various states of decline) down a wooded path. She told me the stroller had transformed all their lives and that she wouldn’t be without it. ‘And it makes me feel just like I’m wheeling a baby around,’ she confided in hushed tones. I was immediately sold on the idea. When Matilda was a puppy, I’d experimented with dog carry bags and had taken her out in a holdall-like contraption over my shoulder. But she didn’t like it - and neither did I. It was heavy and, to my mind, hot and stifling for her. A pushchair would be more comfortable; it would let her see the world yet still give me control over where she goes. Pets Pyjamas, the company I got my cream-coloured model from, tell me the 90 strollers they have sold in the past year have gone mainly to owners who have elderly dogs, or pets with mobility problems. They are also popular for people with puppies, as young dogs get tired walking longer distances. Having a browse: The pair pause for a while to look at a shoe display, with Matilda sat calmly in her pram . There are dozens of different types on the market in an array of colours, starting from about £40 and rising to £260 for a top-of-the-range model. Some of the more expensive ones have cupholders so the owner can enjoy a coffee, and there’s a built-in tray for treats. Other features include mesh panels to aid ventilation and stop insects flying in, clip-on straps so your dog can’t fall or jump out, hoods with clear plastic windows so your dog can watch the world go by but stay dry when it rains, sun canopies for hot, cloudless days and large, air-filled wheels ideal for bumpy terrains. Most are suitable for medium-sized dogs such as a beagle or Airedale, but you can get one big enough for a labrador. Matilda is not immobile in any way, as her energetic dashes around the local park show. But in many ways she is my baby, so it makes sense to place her in a pushchair. After all, she is absolutely one of the family, and I dote on her as much as I do my son. In fact, ‘Baby Girl’ is one of my pet names for her. The pushchair, which cost £139, also allows us to spend time together we wouldn’t otherwise have. Just last week, I took Matilda to North Wales for a four-day break. Out and about: According to Kelly, the stroller lets her take Matilda further afield without piling on the stress . Usually she’d go to our fabulous dog-minder, but she was away so I had no choice but to take Matilda along, too. In the past, taking Matilda has been stressful for all concerned. When visiting attractions, it always means one person has to wait outside on dog duty. Despite being a nation of dog lovers, we are pretty intolerant when it comes to allowing our four-legged friends into shops and restaurants. Now, thanks to Matilda’s pram, establishments with dog bans aren’t as much of a problem. Tucked up in her buggy with the hood down and a plentiful supply of biscuits to keep her sweet, no one was any the wiser when I popped in with Matilda in tow. And those who did spot she is a dog and not a toddler were generally so taken aback and intrigued that they were happy to let us stay. Stowed away: The pushchair can be carried around in the back of her car . Happy to pose: Matilda enjoys simply being wheeled along and watching the world go by . Critics say Matilda should be running freely in the park on her own four legs, and not cooped up in a pram. Of course she still enjoys those pleasures — but she also clearly enjoys being wheeled along and watching the world go by. I also feel that with my buggy I am being extremely responsible when I take her out - which is not the case with many other owners. I have lost count of the number of times out-of-control animals have jumped up at my son, and we routinely see dogs tied up outside shops or tethered to tables in pubs, all barking, yapping and generally getting very distressed - and being an absolute nuisance to everyone around them. Even more worryingly, I have witnessed disturbing numbers of pets being left in boiling hot cars by irresponsible owners. This is extremely dangerous. So I feel I am beyond criticism for keeping my dog with me. Safe in her stroller, Matilda is secure and cannot cause a nuisance to anyone else - while I bask in the mostly positive attention it attracts. Matilda, too, delights in being taken out in her stroller. In fact she leaps with excitement the moment she sees it being unfolded. Call me barking mad, but I’m revelling in this second chance at motherhood.","Kelly Rose Bradford, 41, loves hitting the town and strolling with pet Matilda .

"By . Chris Pleasance . When 18-year-old Calvin Conger hooked a stingray while fishing in Florida, he intended to chop it up before sticking it back on a hook to use as shark bait. But instead he ended up helping the female ray to give birth to two pups after noticing the fish had a second stinger sticking out of its behind. That tiny tail turned out to be the rear end of a baby stingray, as the mother was halfway through giving birth when she was caught. Scroll down for video . Fisherman Calvin Conger, 18, found himself playing doctor after catching a pregnant stingray before helping it give birth to two pups on board his family's boat . Conger was about to cut the fish up to use as shark bait before noticing it had an extra stinger sticking out of it's rear end. As his father Terry gave the animal's stomach a push, a baby ray popped out . Calvin's father, Terry, instinctively stepped in, pushing down on the ray's belly while Calvin's mother, Valerie, recorded the bizarre incident. As Terry gently prodded the creature, the tiny baby ray popped out and began wriggling around in the boat, followed shortly by another. Despite nearly becoming fish food, the story had a happy ending for the mother ray and her two new babies, as Calvin decided to let the family go back into the ocean. Calvin told HLN: ‘We put it on the filleting table because we were going to use it for bait. ‘We got a closer look at it and there was a stinger hanging out. I can put it on my resume that I helped birth a stingray.' Calvin was out fishing with his family in Port Charlotte, Florida when the incredible event occurred. After the first baby ray was born, the Conger family noticed another stinger, before helping the fish to give birth to a second pup . Despite nearly being turned into fish food, the ray and her babies were released back into the ocean . Rays are ovoviviparous, meaning they carry litters of young inside them numbering up to 13 which feed on individual yolk sacks. Female rays are capable of storing a male ray's sperm inside their bodies without getting pregnant for years before impregnating themselves at a later date. A pair of rays gave birth to seven young at the Sea Life Aquarium in London despite not having been in the same tank as a male for two years.","Calvin Conger was out fishing with his family when they caught the ray .

"By . Charlie Skillen . Follow @@charlieskillen . Chelsea’s pre-season has been the perfect one in the sense that some matches and displays have given reason for confidence, others exposed glaring holes in the set-up. Impressive wins over the likes of Fenerbahce and Ferencvaros have been compounded by limp efforts as seen against Werder Bremen. On Tuesday night, Real Sociedad visit Stamford Bridge in the final friendly before Chelsea's trip to Burnley next Monday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Torres miss from two yards and Ramires find the top corner . Big impression: Summer signing Cesc Fabregas (centre) has shone during Chelsea's pre-season campaign . Decision maker: Manager Jose Mourinho will get one last look at his players before the start of the new season . VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho . The good news for Blues fans is that new signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have been the star turns, while a number of the club's youngsters may have earned themselves a spot in Jose Mourinho's reckoning for the campaign ahead. Equally, Didier Drogba's injury and the continued misfiring of Fernando Torres give a worrying vision of Chelsea's attack were Costa not available. It doesn't seem like there will be a surfeit of first team exits from Stamford Bridge, but there are still a couple of starting roles up for grabs. Here, Sportsmail looks at the players - old and young - who still have something to prove before the big kick-off. Danger man: New boy Diego Costa scored twice during the Blues' tour of Europe . All smiles: Eden Hazard (left) shared this image of himself sharing a shower with Willian (right) on Instagram . Ramires . The Brazil midfielder’s usual boundless energy was not enough to make up for his wayward passing and ill-discipline on the field last season, and with the arrival of Cesc Fabregas it looks as if Ramires will find first-team chances far harder to come by this season. Straight on the back of Brazil's World Cup nightmare comes a question over the starting berths of Chelsea charges Ramires, Willian and Oscar. However, Mourinho is still a stickler for physicality and work-rate and Ramires is fresh from netting a scorcher in Sunday’s friendly against Ferencvaros. He is also one of the few players remaining from the club’s victorious Champions League campaign in 2012 – with the Portuguese manager on the lookout for experience in a dressing room shorn of Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard. Impress at Stamford Bridge and Mourinho could well be looking for that experience for a potentially tricky opening Monday night at Burnley. Man in the middle: Brazilian Ramires could provide physicality in the heart of Mourinho's midfield . Fernando Torres . Torres has had more last chances than anyone else in the last few years at Stamford Bridge, but he remains one of just three senior strikers at the club – and returning 36-year-old Drogba is now facing an injury lay-off. Last season fell at the final hurdle thanks to a lack of striking options, and having just Torres and Diego Costa available hasn’t done much to alleviate fears of the same problem rearing it's head. The Spaniard has added to his collection of close-range misses in this pre-season campaign, and will have to cap a good display against Sociedad with a goal if Mourinho isn’t to be tempted into a last dip into the transfer market. Drought: Fernando Torres must start finding the back of the net more regularly next season . Petr Cech . Having been such a world class performer in goal for Chelsea for almost a decade should mean Cech has no place on a list like this, but Thibaut Courtois’ arrival from a long-term loan at Atletico Madrid changes the No 1 situation considerably. The Czech stopper did little to impress in conceding Besiktas’ late goal in last week’s friendly, and a goalkeeper of such talent shouldn’t be forced to stay on the bench as his career enters its final third. A typically commanding display in this match would make Mourinho’s most difficult decision even more unpalatable. Still No 1? Petr Cech faces serious competition from young goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois next season . Branislav Ivanovic . Like Cech, a stalwart of the Chelsea defence, whose quality and experience cannot be easily dismissed. However, with Filipe Luis’ arrival at left back, the Serbia may face a fight for the right-back berth with Cesar Azpilicueta. There is no doubt there is a need for all of these players in the squad – particularly with Ivanovic’s ability to play in a centre half positon where Chelsea look light – but one will miss out on the majority of starting XIs. Ivanovic’s impressive pre-season so far should continue against Sociedad, and if he can cap off his usual defensive efforts with a goal from a set-piece he’ll have all the more reason to be confident heading into the new season. Versatile: Branislav Ivanovic faces a fight to earn himself a starting spot at right back or in central defence . Patrick Bamford . The 20-year-old striker seems destined for another loan move after spells at MK Dons and Derby, but Drogba's injury may have made Mourinho re-think. Make no bones about it, if Chelsea are to challenge on all fronts they need another striker. Although raw and not the complete forward, Bamford is clinical in the box to a degree which the current iteration of Torres can only dream of. If he plays on Tuesday night and grabs a goal or two, Mourinho will find it hard to rule him out of the reckoning. The only issue would be whether he would be better served by regular football on loan.

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . There is no question: the Capital One Cup has been a more exciting competition to watch over the last three years than its more glamorous older brother, and is immediately throwing up talking points left, right and centre. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five ties to keep an eye out for in the first round for a variety of reasons. MK Dons vs AFC Wimbledon . It may be a decade since the birth of MK Dons – obviously coinciding with the dramatic fall of Wimbledon - but this remains a bitter clash. So much so that the away supporters are refusing to spend a single penny inside stadium:MK such is their overt loathing for Pete Winkelman’s club and are planning on eating at a nearby IKEA before the game. The Swedish store does do a mean meatball, in fairness. Winkelman, meanwhile, refused to call the Dons by their proper name in a recent interview, merely referring to the League Two side as ‘AFC’. Not happy: AFC Wimbledon supporters hold up placards during their game at MK Dons in December 2012 . Invasion: Away supporters celebrate at stadium:MK but Karl Robinson's side scored an added-time winner . Brighton vs Cheltenham . This is a big evening for Sami Hyypia. Even though we’re only in the first week of the season, the former Bayer Leverkusen boss has failed to win 13 of his last 18 as a manager. That includes the rather peculiar home defeat against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday – his first in charge – and Hyypia needs to get off the mark quickly. Albion, after all, weren’t too far away from reaching the Premier League last season. A loss to Mark Yates’ Cheltenham wouldn’t be disastrous in the grand scheme of things but it certainly wouldn’t help the new boss in the short term. Big evening: Sami Hyypia wants to get himself a first win as Brighton boss since taking over this summer . Shrewsbury Town vs Blackpool . This will hereby be known as the Matt Williams derby. The Seasiders lost their club secretary to the League Two side during the summer after Williams wasn’t given a justified pay rise and change in title by chairman Karl Oyston. He subsequently moved to Shropshire as chief executive – a role he was performing at Bloomfield Road without the grand title. Williams moving on has been to the Seasiders’ detriment; he signed most of the players and sorted their registrations – something new secretary Chris Hough has staggeringly failed to manage as Jose Riga revealed he had just nine (nine!) players available on the morning of their first game against Nottingham Forest. Former Pool players Scott Vernon, Mark Halstead and James Caton could also line-up for the Shrews. How many? Blackpool had just nine players registered on the morning of their game away at Nottingham Forest . Leeds vs Accrington Stanley . Dave Hockaday is thought to be a touch out of his depth as a manager of a Championship outfit. Even owner Massimo Cellino said as much when talking to Sportsmail last week. Disparaging is probably the word to go for. ‘Don’t forget where he came from; league five. He’s like a baby, who is in a toy shop.’ Oh. Well, Hockaday lost his first game in charge at Millwall on Saturday, with Accrington posing a more familiar challenge given the boss’s previous experience at Forest Green Rovers. Saying that, Accy have been in the Football League since 2006. Big night for Dave, eh? You don't know what you're doing! Leeds owner Massimo Cellino (right) doesn't fully trust Dave Hockaday . York vs Doncaster . This should be a little bit lively. Bootham Crescent is heaped in nostalgia that radiates through the rickety old stands; it’s a ground that can create a brilliant atmosphere. It has the semblance of a Yorkshire derby, albeit a minor one. Nigel Worthington’s side lost away at Rovers on penalties in this round last year so they’ll be out for a bit of revenge.","Massimo Cellino's Leeds play against Accrington Stanley at Elland Road .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Darren Fletcher says the rivalry between Manchester United and Liverpool will be as intense as ever when they meet in the final of the International Champions Cup on Monday - even if it is still pre-season. The Scot has played more minutes on United's tour of the United States than any of his team-mates and is likely to feature again when the old foes meet in Miami. After three years of pain and frustration as he battled ulcerative colitis, the 270 minutes Fletcher has played on the tour finally proves he is on the road to recovery. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United and Liverpool on pre-season US tour . Pumped up: Darren Fletcher is desperate to land the first blow of the season as Manchester United prepare to take on old rivals Liverpool in the Miami final of the International Champions Cup on Monday . Back in action: After three years of setbacks as he struggled with ulcerative colitis, Fletcher has played more minutes on United's pre-season tour of America than any other player . Good start: United have won the first four matches of the Louis van Gaal era, beating LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid on their Stateside tour . He is confident of overcoming a calf injury to play in the final and stoked the rivalry ahead of the coming Barclays Premier League season. 'It’s Man Utd vs Liverpool. It doesn't matter if it’s pre-season. We want to win,' he said. Fletcher captained Manchester United to their fourth and most impressive pre-season win on Saturday when they defeated Real Madrid 3-1 at Michigan Stadium in front of 109,318 spectators. With all the focus being on Louis van Gaal, the story of Fletcher’s return to the first-team has flown under the radar over the last fortnight. In 2011 Fletcher was diagnosed with the chronic bowel disease. The debilitating illness left Fletcher 'running to the toilet 10, 20, 30 times a day,' he explained recently.

In form: Ashley Young (second left) celebrates one of his two goals as United beat Real Madrid 3-1 in front of a record crowd of over 109,000 at the Michigan Stadium . As a result, Fletcher has spent nearly two of the last three years on the sidelines. It is no surprise, therefore, that he is happy to be back to full fitness. 'I don’t want to look back, but everyone knows I've been through a lot,' Fletcher said. 'I have not had a pre-season for three years. 'But now I am back in the gym and I am feeling the benefits from that. 'I am getting stronger and hopefully I can get as fit as possible. 'I am looking forward to the new season.' Dark days: Fletcher leaves the field after United crashed out of the FA Cup against Swansea last season . Hot pursuit: Fletcher chases after Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben in the Champions League encounter last year . For a man who has dedicated the last 19 years of his life to Manchester United, last season’s seventh-place under David Moyes was hard to take. The midfielder and his team-mates want to prove that was nothing but a blip. 'Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea all finished above us last year so it was disappointing for us,' he said. 'Next season we all want to show what we are capable of. 'We have got a fantastic team spirit. We were talking about it the other night among ourselves. 'We are all pulling in the right direction and we all want the best for Manchester United. 'We realise some experienced players have gone and it’s up to us to come together and get us back up there.' Victory sealed: Javier Hernandez celebrates with Shinji Kagawa after scoring United's third goal against Real . It may just be pre-season, but the fact that three of United’s four wins on tour have come against some of Europe’s top clubs has given the squad optimism about the season ahead. Van Gaal must take credit for installing that confidence among the playing staff. The contrast between the atmosphere in the camp and the final weeks of Moyes’ reign could not be greater. The players are happy to undertake double training sessions under their new manager and they have adapted well to Van Gaal’s 3-4-1-2 formation. The players are smiling again. And so is the manager, who was happy to chat and pose for photographs with fans after the match in Ann Arbor on Saturday. 'We are just enjoying it,' Fletcher said when asked about the difference between this season and the last. Confident mood: United look a different proposition under new manager Louis van Gaal . In form: Liverpool have also impressed in the pre-season tournament, beating Manchester City, AC Milan and Olympiacos to reach the final against United . VIDEO Sturridge no concern - Rodgers . 'The manager expects a lot from us and he thinks we have got the ability to do it. 'He demands a lot, but the players have responded. 'We are enjoying playing in a new system and under him.' Just like United, Liverpool have experienced a summer of upheaval, with star striker Luis Suarez departing for Barcelona. The Reds have registered wins over Manchester City, AC Milan and Olympiacos while in the US though so they will be confident of taking home the one million US dollar prize (£600,000) too. Liverpool will be without Daniel Sturridge as he has been sent home for treatment on a hamstring injury which kept him out of Saturday’s 2-0 win over AC Milan. 'Dan has flown back to the UK,' Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said. 'He had a really, really slight feeling in his hamstring.

"By . Mark Bryans . Olivier Giroud is confident he will be ready to fire Arsenal to glory from the start of the new Barclays Premier League season. The France international looked laboured in the Gunners’ 1-0 Emirates Cup defeat to Monaco on Sunday - a result which saw Valencia win the pre-season tournament. Having seen fellow forwards Yaya Sanogo and Joel Campbell light up the Emirates on Saturday, with the former grabbing four goals in a 5-1 victory over Benfica, Giroud’s performance was nowhere near as eye-catching. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arteta expecting great season . Prolific: Giroud scored 22 goals in all competitions for Arsenal last season . Experience: Giroud has be a real asset to Arsene Wenger over the last couple of seasons . The 27-year-old scored once in five World Cup appearances for France as Les Bleus lost to eventual winners Germany at the quarter-final stages. And,although he admits he is struggling for fitness following an extended season, Giroud believes he will be much sharper in time for Sunday’s Community Shield clash with Manchester City. “We did well on Saturday and had a great game, scored a lot of goals but on Sunday there was another team who have had only three or four days of training,” he explained. “We could see it, especially for me - it was really hard for me physically and I didn’t feel really well in the game but it is okay as I have this week to work because we have to be ready against City. I have asked to work hard (in training). For pre-season preparation you have to work hard and there is less than one week to be ready.” Arsenal’s pre-season preparation also saw them take a squad to face New York Red Bulls in the United States, with most players who were involved on World Cup duty excused from making the trip. Giroud feels there is an obvious gap in fitness levels between those players who have been back in training for a longer period but is backing Arsene Wenger’s side to have a great season once everyone is up to scratch. “I didn’t got to New York, along with a lot of players, so we are at a different stage so it is hard to value our potential but when we are fit and all together we will do fantastic things,” he said. Celebration time: Giroud lifts the FA Cup up with his team-mates after beating Hull in May . Hot streak: Giroud has proved to be a force on the international scene too . “We just have to work at our training and we have a fantastic test on Sunday, we will be ready I think because we want to win this first trophy.” Wenger is not concerned about Giroud’s fitness and put his display on Sunday down to a lack of rest. “Today at least he was not ready at all,” Wenger said after the game. “He had only three weeks rest, it was not an eternity and he had to come back quickly. But sometimes when you come back late you want to work hard and in a game you are not as sharp. “It’s nothing about him. He’s not put weight on, he’s not out of shape, he’s worked very hard this week and not recovered from the work he has done.” After the Wembley showdown against City, the Gunners get their Barclays Premier League campaign up and running at home to Crystal Palace before the first-leg of their Champions League qualifier.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Kieran Trippier is hoping a good season with Burnley in the Premier League could earn him an England call-up. The former Manchester City full-back is regarded as one of the Clarets' best players and has been included in the Championship team of the season for the last two years. Trippier has played for England at every level from under-18s to under-21s and is hoping to impress manager Roy Hodgson. He said: 'It's always been my ambition to play for England. I've played at a young age and it was an honour, I loved every minute of it. 'I'm playing in the Premier League now and I just want to do very well. I'm only 23 so I'm certainly not going to write it off. Hopefully I can catch the manager's eye and show what I can do, and hopefully I can get the nod.' Impressive: Kieran Trippier has made the Championship team of the season two years running . Trippier was rumoured to be interesting Arsenal at the end of last season but he committed himself to Burnley by signing a three-year contract until 2017. And the 23-year-old insisted leaving Turf Moor was never a consideration. 'It's been a good two seasons for me and all the lads,' he said. 'I'm just delighted that I did well in the Championship and I'll try to take it one step further. 'When the season finished I was speaking to the gaffer and I committed myself to the club. I never had any intention of leaving. 'Before the season ended I'd spoken to the gaffer and I was glad to finally get it signed early doors so I could just enjoy my summer and look forward to coming back. 'It's always been my dream to play in the Premier League and I'm just happy I'm doing it with Burnley.' International: the 23-year-old admitted competition was tough but 'wouldn't rule out' an England call-up . The first matches Trippier looked for when the fixture list came out were Burnley's two clashes with City, the first of which is a trip to the Etihad on December 28. The defender spent all of his youth career with the club but, despite captaining the FA Youth Cup-winning side in 2008, he never made a first-team appearance. After two loan spells at Barnsley, he headed to Burnley on loan in July 2011 and signed a permanent deal the following January. 'It was a tough time because I was there from about eight,' he said of his City departure. 'When I came on loan to Burnley I still had about three years left at Man City but it was a choice that I made because I wanted to play games and I didn't want to be playing for the reserves any more. 'I've got a few people I still speak to there. I'll always try to keep in contact with them because they brought me through the ranks but there'll be no friends when I go back there. Success: Few people thought Sean Dyche and Burnley would win promotion after selling Charlie Austin . 'I don't think I have anything to prove to them, all I want to do is put the Burnley shirt on, go out there and do the best for me and the club.' Burnley begin their second season of Premier League football with a home match against Chelsea a week on Monday. Their first campaign ended in relegation in 2010 and they are odds-on to suffer the same fate again. But Trippier is taking inspiration from Crystal Palace following their incredible revival under Tony Pulis last season as well as the manner in which Burnley defied expectations to reach the Premier League. 'Last season we were fourth favourites to get relegated and we got automatic promotion,' he said. 'This season obviously we're going to be written off but, if you look at Palace last season, they were written off by Christmas and they finished 11th. 'We're used to being written off but we've just got to get on with it and play to the best of our ability. We proved everyone wrong last season so who says we can't do that this season.'

"By . Andrew Baldock, Press Association . Sevilla coach Unai Emery says Wales star Gareth Bale's success in Spain has not surprised him. Bale is back in Wales ahead of Tuesday night's UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid at Cardiff City Stadium. The game has been billed as a homecoming fixture for the Cardiff-born former Tottenham attacker, as Champions League winners Real prepare to take on Europa League title holders Sevilla. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Gareth Bale arrive in Cardiff ahead of the Super Cup clash . Welsh wonder: Gareth Bale is back home for Real's Super cup clash against Sevilla . Prepared: Sevilla coach Emery is only too aware of Bale after his brace against them last season . Bale shone for Real against Sevilla last season, which is an experience etched in Emery's memory, and he is expected to play a pivotal role as the Spanish giants target more silverware. 'We unfortunately got to know him in the first match he played (against Sevilla), and he was already at an extremely high level,' said Emery, during Monday's pre-match press conference in Cardiff. 'It was a beautiful game for spectators, but an ugly game for Sevilla. Bale was the star.' Talking tactics: Emery addresses his squad during training on Tuesday afternoon . That fixture came in October, when Bale scored twice in a 7-3 win for Real at the Bernabeu. 'When you have a player of that calibre on your side, you can rest easy. We will aim to cover him individually, and also his team-mates tomorrow,' Emery said. 'It hasn't surprised me how quickly he has adapted (with Real Madrid), based on the fact he's a great player and a great athlete. Final preparations: Carlos Fernandez (centre) battles for possession in training . 'He has adapted quickly, and it's down to his character and personality. His style and his team match, and that has been key to his success.' While Emery readily showered praise on 25-year-old Bale, he was less forthcoming when asked about speculation linking defender Alberto Moreno with a possible move to Liverpool. 'I expect him to play for us tomorrow,' said Emery, without offering any further comment. Real are expected to parade new signings James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos - both are included in a 23-man squad - but Emery claims his team will be ready for whatever is thrown at them. Helping hand: Sevilla players take part in an unusual routine in the build up to the game . 'We have tried to think about the initial line-up they may have, but we have prepared regardless of who will play,' he added. 'The handicap that might play in favour - or against us - is that Kroos and James have not yet played with Real Madrid, but we cannot prepare just for them. We have to see what their entire line-up will be. 'They are football players of the highest level, players of the highest rank in physical and technical terms. They know how to give their best.

"By . Gemma Mullin . Dr Clive Mowforth, 57, sent out 108 leaflets to neighbours after cats killed birds in his garden . A scientist has sparked fury after he threatened neighbours with ‘drastic action’ if they do not stop their cats from going into his garden because they are killing birds. Dr Clive Mowforth, 57, distributed 108 angry leaflets containing images of the two ‘leading killers’ on his street in Dursley, Gloucestershire. The threats have left the Oxford University-educated research chemists’ neighbours concerned for their pets’ safety. But Dr Mowforth explained he had to take action after he witnessed three birds being killed in the last week. He has spent the last ten years transforming his garden into a paradise for the local wildlife but recently noticed less birds and more cats. He said: ‘We had a lot of different birds in the garden - starlings, sparrows and blue tits, but now we have got very few birds in the garden and a lot more cats. ‘Putting two and two together the cats are coming into the garden and eating the birds. There are about ten cats coming in total. ‘The final straw for me was when I was sat eating dinner and I saw a cat leap up onto the bird table and kill a goldfinch.’ He continued: ‘Usually there is about one bird a month killed in the garden but this month there have been three. I’ve had enough. ‘I decided to write the leaflet and put it through the letter box of 108 doors in the area. I spoke to one person whilst I was doing it and he didn’t seem to have a problem with it. ‘But now I’ve heard that it’s all kicking off on Facebook and one person is threatening to firebomb my house.’ He has since defended his actions, saying he thought it was entirely possible for people to control their cats and if not he is planning on buying something that will scare them away. ‘If my dog was going around doing this all hell would break loose,’ he said. ‘There are things people can do - if they attach bells to them the birds can hear them coming for example. ‘This could now push me out of my house. I’m about to retire and I want to be able to enjoy my garden.’ ‘I am now planning on getting something from America, I won’t disclose what, which will scare them away. ‘I don’t plan on killing them but I want my garden back for the birds.’ The leaflet, which is titled ‘cat menace’, includes pictures of cats that have been caught in his garden, as well as dates of birds’ deaths. Brandon Allen, 9, pictured with his cat Oscar (left) became upset after seeing the leaflet which is held by his mother Amanda Woods, 39 (right) who owns another cat and said there is nothing you can do to stop them . The leaflet, titled 'cat menace' went out to 108 of Dr Mowforth's neighbours in Dursley, Gloucestershire . One of Dr Mowforth’s neighbours, Amanda Woods has two cats, one of which belongs to her nine-year-old son Brandon Allen. ‘There is nothing you can do to stop your cats going in other people’s gardens - unless you have house cats,’ said the 39-year-old. ‘One of the cats is my son’s and he got really upset when he saw the letter. ‘We all got leaflets through the door, it’s all over Facebook - it really has upset a lot of people. ‘If he doesn’t like cats in his garden there are things he could do about it. He could just spray them, or set up sprinklers. It’s harmless and it means they won’t come back. ‘My neighbour thought about taking the leaflet to the local police station, I’m not sure if he has yet. If they don’t take it to the police I’d happily do it myself.’ As well as the 26 neighbouring houses on Dr Mowforth’s street, the letters have also been put through the doors of adjoining streets.

My cat is actually pictured on the front of the leaflet. ‘I think the whole thing is a bit like Crimewatch for cats, it all seems very petty. ‘I was actually really concerned when I read the bit about him taking “drastic action” against the cats. ‘I don’t know what it could be but it certainly sounds very worrying - I’m sure the RSPCA would be interested to hear about it. ‘I haven’t bothered confronting him because I don’t want to cause a big argument but I know he has upset a lot of people.’","Dr Clive Mowforth sent 108 angry leaflets titled 'cat menace' to neighbours .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . An 81-year-old woman has been ordered to repay more than $500,000 in falsely claimed Centrelink benefits . Pauline Mitchell has been ordered to repay more than half-a-million dollars in Centrelink benefits she claimed over a 30-year-period on behalf of her dead brother and sister. The 81-year-old from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney,  was ordered to repay the government more than $514,000, which she has received in the names of her dead siblings, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal last week. The tribunal is investigating whether Mrs Mitchell, who also goes by her married name Pauline Crowhurst and her mother's maiden name Pauline Henning, will have to repay a further $219,000 based on false reporting of assets to Centrelink. Mrs Mitchell received $292,000 for pensions in the name of her brother Kenneth between 1984 and August 2010, despite the fact he died at sea in 1942 during active service in the Second World War. She also claimed $231,000 in pension benefits for Mary Mitchell, the legal name of her older sister also called Marie or Maria, who died in 1983. Payments to Mrs Mitchell and her deceased siblings were stopped in August 2010 and Australian Federal Police raided Mrs Mitchell's houses at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney and in Asquith, in northern Sydney in September 2010. Police found bank account details and key cards for Kenneth and Mary Mitchell. Mrs Mitchell claimed that her brother Kenneth had not died in the war and she met him in a park in the 1980s and saw him again in 2005. She insisted that Mary Mitchell was Kenneth's wife and that she had been withdrawing money from their accounts at their request, which she would leave on a table in the shed for them to collect. Mrs Mitchell has been receiving pensions for her deceased brother since 1984 and for her deceased sister since 1990 . Mrs Mitchell was also ruled to have 'told untruths' and deliberately failed to reveal her assets to Centrelink over the last thirty years, failing to tell them about four properties she owned in Kangy Angy on the central coast of NSW, Asquith and Wentworth Falls. At various times over the last few decades she told Centrelink officials that she lived 'in the National Park in the Blue Mountains by a river', in a caravan, and that she was homeless. Senior Member of the AAT Geri Ettinger ruled that 'much of Mrs Mitchell's evidence [was] less than credible' including her claims that she had suffered serious memory loss after being thrown from a horse in 1994. Mrs Mitchell also claimed that she did not tell Centrelink about her living arrangements because her three daughters had been abducted from her in 1968, after she separated from her husband and she 'lived in fear' of a second abduction. She also said that she had moved from her home in Asquith because there was a prostitute living downstairs.","Pauline Mitchell, 81, has been order to repay $514,000 to Centrelink .

Miss Cunningham, a former prostitute, has previously confessed that she was 'ashamed' to admit she did not know who the father of the baby is as she had slept with one client and had been having 'casual sex' with a friend at the time she conceived. Mr Smith, who is jobless, has come forward to claim that he is Ms Cunningham's 'friend with benefits'. He said that the mother-of-two told him three months ago that she had slept with him and a black man over the weeks she conceived. He recalled: 'She told me ""I've slept with you and a black lad in those dates. So if it doesn't come out black, you'd better run because it will be your child"".' Yesterday Miss Cunningham, 24, whose baby son is due in October, announced that she is selling more than £10,000 worth of tickets to 50 fans who will be able to watch the birth over video chat service Skype. Miss Cunningham, who rose to fame . after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, has already . scooped a staggering £30,000 for the four VIP bedside seats. Three of the four tickets were purchased . by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by . somebody described as 'a super-fan'. Her announcement that she was going to sell the £200 Skype tickets came just two days after Miss Cunningham revealed on Twitter that she plans to sell her placenta to the highest bidder. Mr Smith said that he felt scared when Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, broke down in tears and told him about the baby as he is homeless and already has three children who he doesn't see. He added that he last slept with Miss Cunningham three months ago, after she said that they might be having a baby together. As well as the NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Earlier this year, she sparked further . outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give . birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel . 5's Big Brother. Controversial: Miss Cunningham, a former prostitute, rose to fame after undergoing a breast enlargement on the NHS. Mr Smith said she had told him that she had slept with two men during the weeks she conceived . Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving . negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide . her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. Leeds . City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss . Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers . will always fund me.’ She later added: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.' Earlier this month Miss Cunningham declared she was 'genuinely gutted' to discover she was expecting a third boy, not the little girl she had hoped for. The wannabe model, who already has two boys, aged six and three, said she smoked a whole packed of cigarettes and drowned her sorrows with a glass of wine after finding out her baby's sex.","Homeless Jonathan Smith said he is one of two men who might be the father .

"By . Jenny Awford . A 62-year-old man has died in a house fire in what is thought to be Britain's first death from an exploding e-cigarette. His body was found in the living room of his flat in Wallasey, Merseyside, by a member of the public after a small fire broke out in the bedroom. Investigators believe the blaze started when an e-cigarette that was charging in the bedroom exploded and set fire to an oxygen concentrator - thought to have been used by the victim. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said she was unaware of any other deaths caused by the electronic devices. Up in flames:  The 62-year-old was discovered in his flat in Wallasey, Merseyside, by firefighters after a small fire broke out in the bedroom of the property - believed to have been caused by an electronic cigarette . It is thought that the man was using a third-party charger that did not come with the original e-cigarette. Emergency services were called to the address - a large house converted into flats - at 11.39am on Tuesday, but the fire was out before they arrived. The man has not yet been publicly identified, but next of kin have been informed. A spokesperson for Merseyside Fire and Rescue said: 'The exact cause of death is yet to be established, but the subsequent fire investigation identified that an e-cigarette that had been charging in the bedroom exploded, caught fire and ignited the oxygen tube of an oxygen concentrator which may have been in use by the occupier.' An oxygen concentrator is used to raise the blood oxygen levels to prevent damage to the heart or brain by people with severe respiratory or circulatory conditions. Risk: Charging e-cigarettes are believed to have caused a number of devastating house fires . An inquest is set to be held and the death is not being treated as suspicious. Firefighters  said the charging device being used at the time may not have been the one supplied with the original e-cigarette. Area manager for Merseyside Fire and Rescue, Myles Platt, said: 'Only use the original charger or electrical cables supplied and ensure you purchase electrical items from a reputable source.' 'We urge people to always use electrical equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and guidance, always ensure that no electrical items are left charging overnight or left unattended for a long period when being charged and do not mix parts from different e-cigarettes.' Handle with care: Investigators believe the blaze started when an e-cigarette (not pictured) that was charging in the bedroom exploded and set fire to an oxygen concentrator. Remember to use the correct charger on a non-flammable surface (file photo) How they work: Electronic cigarettes simulate tobacco by releasing an aerosol that resembles smoke . The blaze is the ninth fire believed to have been caused by the devices in Merseyside alone since January 2013. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: 'At this time the man's death is not being treated as suspicious and the matter has been referred to the coroner. The man has been identified and next of kin have been advised.' 1) Don't hold the button for longer than needed: . You should not have to hold down the vaping button for any longer than a few seconds. 2) Don't let the atomizer overheat: . Holding down the button on your e-cigarette long enough could cause the atomizer to overheat. 3) Use the correct charger: . Only use the charger that came with your e cigarette or is 100% compatible with your e cigarette. 4) Charge in a clutter free area: . The more material around the charger, the more likely it is there will be a fire. 5) Charge on a non-flammable surface: . Don't charge on top of carpet, paper cardboard. There have been a number of serious accidents and house fires caused by e-cigarettes in the last few years, increasing calls for tighter regulation of the devices. In April an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face in North Yorkshire. Laura Baty, 18, was serving at the Buck Inn Hotel in Richmond when she heard an almighty bang and saw fire coming towards her. Before the teenager had time to think following the explosion on Saturday, she could feel the fire coming at her, adding: 'I felt the heat as I ran away'. And in June a family's home was left gutted by flames after an e-cigarette exploded while it was charging, killing the neighbour's cat. Gutted: Victoria Newton and her children (left-right) Dylan Thomas-James, Millie Anne James, and Lauren James, were  left homeless after an e-cigarette exploded in their house, engulfing it in flames . Homeless: Ms Newton grabbed Dylan, four, as she fled the house after hearing an enormous bang upstairs . Victoria Newton, 34, and her three children were 'lucky to be alive' after the fire. She was at home with her four-year-old son Dylan and her two daughters Millie-Anne, nine, and Lauren, 13, when they heard a bang and the house in Leigh, Greater Manchester, became engulfed in flames. She said: 'It was a nightmare. My daughter Lauren had some friends round and one of her mates had plugged in her e-cigarette and they'd gone out playing.'","The man's body was discovered in the living room of his flat in Merseyside .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Celebrities, politicians, even members of the royal family - it seems that very few in the public eye are able to resist the temptation of snapping a selfie. Now an artist has used his photoshop skills to imagine what icons of the past would have looked like taking pictures of themselves. The artist, known by the alias Pixel Fairy, created the cheeky images of late celebrities, including Margaret Thatcher, Muhammad Ali and John Lennon, who are all captured posing, mobile phone in hand. How does one look? An iconic image of Queen Victoria has been transformed into a cheeky selfie by a creative photo-retouching student . Blonde bombshell: The artist imagines how picture-perfect Marilyn Monroe would have looked snapping herself - decades before selfies took over the internet . Looking good: The artist behind the images, who goes by the name Pixel Fairy, said that this image former president John F Kennedy was among the easiest to do . The photo-retouching student, who . undertook the project as a fun way to practise his skills for his . university course, said that it has been such a success he has already . had requests for prints. He added that the most difficult part was finding the right pictures to mesh together in order to create a believable composite. The artist said: 'It’s difficult to find the right pictures to mash together, that takes up the most time. 'You find that the most famous people like Marilyn Monroe and JFK are the easiest ones to find the right pictures for because they have been photographed so many times.' The British artist said that he did the project for fun and to practise his skills for his university course. 'I have no problem with selfies, I take a few myself from time to time. But I do find it bizarre how some celebrities and ordinary people get really obsessed with taking them. Lighter moment: The artist imagined what former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would have looked like as a follower of the selfie trend . Too cool for selfies: Martial arts legend Bruce Lee, pictured left, and John Lennon, right, are among the icons least likely to have been part of the craze, said the artist . Look at me! Boxing legend Muhammad Ali pulls a funny face for this selfie moment imagined by the Pixel Fairy. The artist said he found celebrity selfie culture 'bizarre' 'You couldn’t really see John Lennon or Bruce Lee getting selfie obsessed but maybe Audrey Hepburn and Freddie Mercury would have a few on their Instagram accounts!' Other well-known figures included in the work are Indian civil rights leader, Mahatma Gandhi and German physicist, Albert Einstein. The imagery whizz-kid said he’s had a great reaction to his work and plans to embark on further projects. 'It really did start off as a bit of fun and practice for my course but I’m really pleased with the results. I’ve already had people asking me for prints!' Sharing the moment: Queen frontman Freddie Mercury stops mid-show to take this dynamic selfie, which was made from composite images by a photoshop artist .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . The U.S.-based mission that sent Nancy Writebol to Liberia, is bringing some of their aid workers in the country home, SIM USA officials announced Sunday. While none of the returning aid workers are sick or have shown any signs of having ebola, they will be quarantined upon their arrival back to Charlotte, North Carolina. The quarantine will last at least three weeks since the missionaries were last exposed to people infected with the ebola virus, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said. Going home: Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, announced Sunday that they will be pulling aid workers from Liberia. Johnson pictured above at a press conference in Atlanta on August 5 . SIM USA is the same organization that sent Nancy Writebol to Liberia. Writebol has since become infected with ebola and is being treated for the deadly disease at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Pictured above with children in Liberia in October 2013 . SIM USA president Bruce Johnson said in a statement that they are working with health officials to be as cautious as possible. 'We will continue to cooperate and collaborate with them and adhere strictly to their guidelines in the return of our missionaries to the United States,' Johnson said. The aid group isn't releasing how many missionaries were in Liberia or when they will return to protect the privacy of their families. The returning missionaries will arrive in an area of the Charlotte airport away from the public. The airport won't say exactly where the plane will be taken, according to a statement. Quarantine: The retuning aid workers will be quarantined for three weeks upon their arrival. Above, Writebol arriving at Emory Hospital on August 5 . Meanwhile, SIM USA aid worker Writebol and American doctor Kent Brantly continue treatment at Emory University Hospital where they are being given doses of an experimental medicine. MailOnline's calls to the hospital on Sunday were not immediately returned, so it's unclear what condition the two Americans are in. However, Brantley broke his silence on Friday and issued a statement  saying he's getting stronger every day. Not alone: Writebol is being treated for ebola at Emory along with American doctor Kent Brantly, who also became infected while working in Liberia . Getting better: Writebol's husband David issued a statement on Friday from Liberia, saying his wife appeared to be improving at the hospital . 'I am growing stronger every day, and I thank God for His mercy as I have wrestled with this terrible disease. Ann Coulter has written a column, criticizing Dr Kent Brantly's choice to practice medicine in Africa . Writebol's husband David issued a similar statement that day, saying Nancy seems to be improving. Meanwhile, conservative pundit Ann Coulter has written a scathing column critiquing Dr Brantly's choice to practice medicine in the 'disease-ridden cesspool' of Liberia. In an article on her website, Coulter writes that Dr Brantly's mission in Africa was negated by the cost of flying him out of the country and treating him at one of the nation's finest hospitals. 'Whatever good Dr. Kent Brantly did in Liberia has now been overwhelmed by the more than $2 million already paid by the Christian charities Samaritan's Purse and SIM USA just to fly him and his nurse home in separate Gulfstream jets, specially equipped with medical tents, and to care for them at one of America's premier hospitals,' Coulter wrote. She goes on to list several others problems in America, and regions where Dr Brantly could have been effective practicing medicine. 'Right there in Texas, near where Dr. Brantly left his wife and children to fly to Liberia and get Ebola, is one of the poorest counties in the nation, Zavala County -- where he wouldn't have risked making his wife a widow and his children fatherless. 'But serving the needy in some deadbeat town in Texas wouldn't have been ""heroic."" We wouldn't hear all the superlatives about Dr. Brantly's ""unusual drive to help the less fortunate"" or his membership in the ""Gold Humanism Honor Society."" Leaving his family behind in Texas to help the poor 6,000 miles away -- that's the ticket,' she added.","SIM USA, the North Carolina-based organization that sent Nancy Writebol to Liberia, is bringing some aid workers home .

"As the sun beams down and the bees buzz in the bushes, Summer Pullen is happiest toddling around in her back garden just like any other curious two-year-old. But she is banned from enjoying this simple pleasure, because of a rare form of epilepsy that means she can suffer up to 16 seizures a day. If she has a fit at the wrong moment, she is at risk of serious injury. These pictures show her with two black eyes she suffered after collapsing at her brother's birthday party. Risk: Summer Pullen, two, is one of only a handful of children in Britain who suffer from Dravet syndrome . Banned from playing outside: The disorder means that she is at risk of collapsing in a seizure at any moment . Danger: Summer's suffered the facial injuries pictured after she had a seizure at her brother's birthday party . Summer is one of only a handful of people in Britain to suffer from Dravet syndrome - an extreme form of epilepsy - and can collapse at any time, suffering fits that last up to four hours. After one particularly bad seizure she even suffered a stroke. Now, after Summer hurt herself too many times, her terrified mother Cath, 25, feels she needs to ban her daughter from playing outside. Ms Pullen, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Obviously I'm terrified she will hurt herself is she falls on the ground. 'We had a birthday part for her little brother, MacKenzie, a couple of weeks ago, and she suddenly dropped and had a seizure. She had a huge bump on her head, and two black eyes, as well as cuts all over her face. 'It's just too dangerous to let her play outside now. 'We're trying to install a soft play area in our back garden for Summer to play in, but until it's finished, I don't dare let her play outside. 'Her big brother and sister, Alex, six, and Caitlin, four, are very caring though, and make sure they play inside with her, even though they'd probably prefer to be outside in the sunshine.' 'I'm terrified': Mother Cath with (from left) Caitlin, four, McKenzie, two, Summer, two and Alex, six . Summer first suffered a seizure when she was six months old. Ms Pullen told how she found her baby daughter fitting in her cot. She called an ambulance, which rushed Summer to hospital - where doctors tried to discover what had caused the hour-and-a-half long fit. It was six months before Summer was finally diagnosed with Dravets syndrome. First described by French physician Dr Charlotte Dravet in 1978, it is a disorder beginning in infancy, that is characterised by intractable seizures. It is believed that one in every 20,000 to 40,000 children born are infected by Dravet's, but symptoms vary from one child to another and incidence may be found to be greater as it becomes better recognised. There is no cure and it is more difficult to manage than other kinds of epilepsy. Constant care and supervision of sufferers can be emotionally draining on family, says the Dravet Foundation. Summer in hospital: She first suffered a seizure when she was just six months old . In the past year, Summer's seizures have become longer and more frequent. Ms Pullen said: 'At first, she was only having one seizure every couple of weeks, but before long, it had become one every day. 'Then they became more frequent, and she now has up to 16 a day. 'Sometimes they're only a couple of minutes long, sometimes they can last for four hours.' In March this year, Summer's seizures even triggered a stroke which stopped her form walking, an ability she was only able to relearn after extensive physiotherapy. 'She still lacks some movement in her left arm, but hopefully in time, she will fully recover,' said Ms Pullen. 'Doctors say they don't know whether her epilepsy will ever improve, but I just want to make sure my little girl can live as normal a life as possible. 'I'm so proud of how she copes with a very difficult condition - she's always got a smile on her face.'","Summer Pullen suffers from Dravet syndrome - a rare form of epilepsy .

"By . A. Greg . A nine-year-old Florida boy is recovering in hospital after fighting off a nine-foot, 400-pound alligator with his bare hands. James Barney, Jr, spoke calmly and eloquently about his ordeal from hospital, where he was tucked up in bed with a teddy bear by his side. The little boy described how it was a hot day so he had parked his bike and jumped into Lake Tohopekaliga - a lake that people are forbidden to swim in - when he felt something brush against his leg. Recuperating: Nine-year-old James Barney, Jr is recovering after fighting off a 400lb alligator with his bare hands . Brave: James described how he managed to hold the animal's jaw open long enough to slide free and swim for shore . 'It really amazed me what happened.  At first, I thought someone was just playing with me, and I didn't know what happened,' he told ABC. 'I reached down to grab it, and I felt its jaw, I felt its teeth, and I didn't know what to do, so I immediately reacted and hit it a couple times. And I had enough strength to pry its jaw open.' The child pulled the powerful jaws open long enough to slide out and swim for sure. Witnesses say the boy surfaced, screaming that he'd been bitten by an alligator. They immediately called 911. 'There was a big alligator, about five feet away from him,' one caller said. Inviting: The boy's father said James often jumps into the lake (where it's forbidden to swim) to cool off - but won't ever do it again . Lesson learned: The little boy advised people to stay out of the lake - but says he wants to wear the alligator's tooth to show his friends . 'He was crawling up the shore, screaming and crying and gator bites all over his back.' He was airlifted to hospital where doctors found he had suffered three superficial bites and about 30 teethmarks as well as scratches from the gator's claws. Doctors found a tooth in one of the little boy's wounds. 'I want to put it on a necklace so that I can tell all my friends,' he told ABC. Fish and wildlife officials have taken the tooth to help them find find the alligator, but James Barney, Jr is hopeful he'll get it back. The boy's father James Barney, Sr, said his son often swims in the lake, but when asked if he'll be doing so ever again, he told the Orlando Sentinel, 'Negative.'","Nine-year-old James Barney, Jr fought off a nine-foot, 400lb alligator with his bare hands .

"By . Associated Press . A coroner says a high school football player from western Pennsylvania who died after practice had a heart tumor. An autopsy performed Thursday on the body of 16-year-old Noah Cornuet revealed the non-cancerous growth. The Allegheny County medical examiner's office ruled his death as being from natural causes. Cornuet was a sophomore at Burrell High School in Lower Burrell, about 25 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. First practice: Noah Cornuet died after running sprints on the first of three days of heat acclimatization football practice . The teen had reportedly just finished sprinting when he collapsed while walking off the field Wednesday evening. Paramedics who attended practice immediately went to help Cornuet, who died about an hour later. It was the team's first practice of the season. The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association last year began requiring schools to hold three days of practice to get players used to the heat before they're allowed to have contact drills. The PIAA instituted the rule because of an increase in heat-related player deaths nationwide in recent years. Undetected: A coroner found that the teen had a non-cancerous heart tumor . Tragedy: The teen collapsed and was unresponsive at Burrell High School. He was rushed to hospital but died an hour later . The high temperature Wednesday was about 80 degrees, with relatively mild humidity, not nearly as hot as the 90-degree days which often greet high school football players each August. 'The Burrell School District community recognizes the tragic loss of a student tonight,' a statement issued by Superintendent Shannon Wagner said. The district has activated a crisis team and planned to support those who might be at the school for activities before classes begin August 25, the statement said. Under the new PIAA rule, players were allowed to wear helmets and shoulder pads on Wednesday and Thursday, and full gear on Friday. But there was to be no contact at those practices. Regular, full-contact practices were to begin Monday.","Noah Cornuet, 16, died after his first football practice at Burrell High School near Pittsburgh .

"By . Corey Charlton For Mailonline . A secret song by singing superstar Michael Jackson has been discovered, in which he professes his love for the county of Gloucestershire. The unreleased demo by the King of Pop is believed to have been inspired by a visit he made to the West Country as a child with The Jackson Five. He reportedly said the time he spent in the county was among his happiest memories. Scroll down for video . Michael Jackson during a 1997 performance in Sheffield. An unreleased song has been discovered in which he reveals his love for Gloucestershire, an area he visited as a child with The Jackson Five . Jackson with his friend and former child actor Mark Lester, who lives in Cheltenham, Gloucester . The village of Bourton on the Water in Gloucestershire is one of the most popular tourist towns in the region . The previously unreleased demo is believed to have been inspired by a visit he made to the area as a child . The song ‘Days in Gloucestershire’ was recorded in 2003-4 and reworked in 2008 but never released. 'Like we really used to before we met the fall, . I can’t get it back, my youth is gone, . We really had it all, oh, . Hold my like you really used to, . Summers in Gloucestershire, . The air has changed, . The city won’t light in and about you, . I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, . I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, . I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again.' It remained unheard and unknown until it mysteriously appeared recently on YouTube. The song lasts 4.35 minutes, during which Jackson sings about missing the time he spent as a youth in the county. He sings: 'I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire. I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again.' The song was leaked onto the internet around two months ago and has already racked up almost 13,000 views. Among the comments, Gloucestershire resident Maxien Fisher says: 'It does sound like a demo though as some of the music isn’t quite up to Jackson standard. 'I imagine he would have perfected this beautifully. 'I’m glad to be living in Gloucestershire now... Thanks Michael x?' It is thought Jackson planned to complete the track on a recording trip to London in 2009 but he died just months before the visit.","Newly discovered demo by superstar Michael Jackson has been unearthed .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Nicola Adams wants to make history again. She was the first woman to win an Olympic boxing title in London two years ago, and now she wants to become the first female Commonwealth champion on Saturday in Glasgow. The 5ft 4in flyweight’s desire remains as strong as ever. ‘I want to be the first and make history and bring back gold for Team England,’ she said. ‘It’s a really, really big draw for me. I want to get another first under my belt.’ Women’s boxing make its Commonwealth debut in Glasgow on Monday, with Adams’s category the first of three events for female boxers on finals day next Saturday. Sealed with a kiss: Nicola Adams, pictured here kissing her 2012 Olympic gold medal, is aiming for glory in Glasgow . More to come? Adams wants to add Commonwealth gold to her memorable success at London 2012 . England’s Natasha Jonas and Savannah Marshall are also heavily tipped to win gold, but it is the smiling Adams who is attracting the most attention. The Olympic champion is the biggest draw in the entire boxing programme, men and women, something that would have been unthinkable two years ago. But then Adams is now perfectly at home popping into 10 Downing Street (‘It’s better than it looks’) or visiting Brazil with the Prime Minister. She went up to her old boxing club in Leeds recently as she carried the Queen’s relay baton through her home town. Adams marvelled at how a ‘small, Rocky-style club in a basement with one ring and maybe six bags’ had turned into a buzzing, thriving gym with 10 girls training regularly. That’s the Adams effect, in a sporting landscape that has changed  dramatically since London 2012. The female boxers are not being talked of as novelties in Glasgow, just athletes. They may still wear headguards, unlike the men, because they are simply not as powerful and, frankly, there is no will from within the sport to abandon them, but they are still just boxers here to try to win medals for their countries. Big hitter: Adams overcame China's Ren Cancan in the final of the women's flyweight competition in London . Honoured: Adams poses with fellow athletes Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford after receiving an MBE . 'F****** Chris Froome,' was Sir Bradley Wiggins’s opening gambit, delivered tongue-in-cheek, as he walked into a tent next to a bowling green in the shadow of Celtic Park last week. It was a particularly odd experience speaking to a knight of the realm as police snipers looked down from the rooftops of the neighbouring high-rise flats… . Dr Mike Loosemore of the English Institute of Sport has worked with British Boxing since 1997. Women joined the squad in 2010 and he believes they have helped the amateur sport change ‘beyond all recognition’. He added: ‘Performance director Rob McCracken says we don’t have male and female boxers, we just have boxers. That’s the attitude  throughout the squad and they are all treated very much the same. ‘They all train in Sheffield four days a week and there are coaching staff, three physios, masseurs, nutritionists, two psychologists, two performance analysts, two strength and conditioning coaches, a physiologist and many more. I wouldn’t dream of giving out nutrition advice, for example — there is an expert for that. ‘Nicola is . a remarkable athlete. She put in an extraordinary amount of work to get . herself fit for the Olympics. You don’t just get given Olympic gold . medals.’ But it will not be entirely straightforward for Adams, who faces Nigerian police officer Oluwatoyin Oladeji on Monday. All smiles: Adams wants to make history in Glasgow by becoming the first female Commonwealth champion . Special moment: Adams discusses her triumph at the Olympic Games with the Queen after receiving her MBE . Away from the Commonwealth Games, Great Britain’s future stars have enjoyed the World Junior Athletics Championships. Morgan Lake turned down a place in Glasgow to race in Oregon, where she won the heptathlon title by setting a world youth best of 6,148 points. Lake is just 17 and still has two years to improve on that record. The 31-year-old suffered her first defeat in almost two years in the quarter-finals of the European Championships in June; a ‘strange’ feeling that left her angry after her dream of becoming Britain’s first double  European champion — male or female — was dashed. ‘It wasn’t too much of a setback,’ she insists. ‘I had won the European Championships gold already in my career and the Commonwealths are my main focus this year. ‘It was disappointing but I can’t dwell on the past.’ The . Commonwealth field is just 11 strong and athletes will only have to . contest a maximum of four bouts, but there are still potential dangers . for the Englishwoman. Northern . Ireland’s Michaela Walsh and Indian railway worker Rani Pinki, who beat . five-time world champion Mary Kom to reach these Games, are lurking in . the draw. But Nicola Adams is only interested in finishing first. There is history to be made in Glasgow, after all.","Adams wants to become the first female Commonwealth champion .

England's female swimmers made it another golden night in the pool with Fran Halsall winning her second gold and Siobhan O’Connor topping the podium after winning three silvers and a bronze earlier in the week. Halsall, 24, has promised greatness for a long time now and is delivering in Glasgow in sensational style. It took her just 25.20sec to make history last night in a watery blur of brilliance. She led the race throughout, becoming the only woman to win Commonwealth gold in both the 50 metres butterfly and 50m freestyle. ‘It feels just amazing,’ she said. ‘I wanted to swim a bit faster but it’s another personal best so I can’t complain. I was in control the whole race and couldn’t feel anyone’s presence too close.’Less than two hours before, she advanced to her fourth final of the week, this time for tonight’s 100m freestyle, touching on 54.88 to  qualify fifth fastest. Golden girl: Fran Halsall poses with her medal during the ceremony . Winner, at last: Siobhan O'Connor has a gold medal to add to her three silvers and one bronze . Finally: O'Connor was able to pose with the gold medal after her brilliant 200m medley final performance . Ahead of the pack: No other swimmers are even in sight as O'Connor heads for the finish . Seemingly . everything Halsall does is with maximum gusto. That extends to singing . the national anthem, which she did at full  volume as God Save The Queen . reverberated round the Tollcross Swimming Centre in her honour. Halsall . frolicked and flirted her way around the edge of the pool as she did a . lap of honour with her gold medal. As well as being one of England’s . most talented swimmers she is a natural entertainer out of the pool. Halsall . has a breezy manner but things have not always gone her way. In Delhi . four years ago she had to settle for one gold and had to be fished out . of the pool after being struck down by a stomach bug. In London in 2012 she came away empty handed from five medal races. ‘I’ve . had to grow up,’ she said. ‘The knocks and blows have forced me to. When things are going well you don’t have to. I know I have the . capabilities.’ Halsall . claims much of her improved form is down to the  rapport she has with . coach and former Olympian James Gibson, who she appointed after London. ‘It’s . really good the fact that James swam, he understands me,’ she said. ‘He’s gone through it himself, went through the Olympics that I went . through and I have total faith in him and what he asks me to do.’ Easy does it: Fran Halsall won her second gold in the 50m butterfly final on Sunday at the Tollcross centre . On top of the world: Halsall is the first woman to do the sprint double in the pool after a brilliant showing . O’Connor, . 18, is a more understated personality but similarly earmarked for . greatness. She was only 12 when her idol Rebecca Adlington became a . double Olympic champion. Six years on her hero was commentating on BBC . as O’Connor won Commonwealth gold in the 200m medley. ‘She . is my role model. I can’t put into words how much her support means to . me. It’s incredible having someone there who has been through it all. For her to really believe in me means so much.’ O’Connor . powered off the blocks and led throughout. She was half a body length . clear after 50m but Australian Alicia Coutts closed in on her and the . two were almost level at halfway. Unfazed by the Olympic silver . medallist on her shoulder, O’Connor motored away to take gold in 2 min . 8.21sec, breaking the Commonwealth Games record by more than 1.5sec. Home favourite Hannah Miley clinched bronze behind Coutts in 2:10.74. O’Connor . said her victory made it a ‘dream’ Games. ‘I wasn’t sure I had it in . me,’ she said. ‘But I’m over the moon so that was a dream. My coach said . to me yesterday I was one race away from making it a better week than I . could have imagined.’ Well done: Alicia Coutts in the yellow cap congratulates O'Connor after she finally claimed gold . Leader: O'Connor was at the front from the start but pulled even further ahead to finish two seconds clear . Based . in her hometown of Bath at one of Britain’s two elite performance . centres, O’Connor has flourished under the guidance of her coach David . McNulty. ‘Dave’s . coached me since I was 14,’ she said. ‘He’s perfect for me. We’ve been . through so much, ups and downs, he’s not just a coach but a friend. This . is an amazing moment and I’ll get to go and  celebrate with him.’ At . 16, O’Connor was the youngest member of the British team which failed . to perform in London. Like Adlington, who won two bronzes, she was . excused from blame after finishing 21st in the 100m breaststroke. But . she said the mood among the team in Glasgow is much different. ‘We are . all chuffed to bits because collectively, not just as England but as . Britain with the Welsh and Scottish results, we have been doing . amazingly,’ she said. ‘In the England team there is such a good vibe and . I’m proud to be part of it.’ As . a reminder of her youth, O’Connor said she would celebrate with ‘lots . of sweeties,’ but not yet — she has a chance to win a sixth medal in the . 4x100m relay medley. There was more good news for England as Liam Tancock won bronze in the 50m backstroke in 24.98.","O'Connor was a clear winner with fastest time in the world this year, 2:08:21 .

Steve Way celebrated with his first pint of lager for three months after breaking a 35-year-old British record to finish 10th in the Commonwealth Games marathon. The bank worker from Bournemouth weighed 16-and-a-half stone seven years ago, but has given up his ‘couch potato lifestyle’ — smoking 20 days cigarettes a day, boozing and eating junk food — to shed nearly half his body weight and take his place among the elite. The 40-year-old’s time of 2hr 15min 16sec yesterday smashed Ron Hill’s 1979 best for over-40s. Way was the second British man home after Scotland’s Derek Hawkins, who finished ninth. Personal best: Steve Way completed a remarkable turnaround by finishing 10th in the marathon . Post-race recovery: Way used to weigh more than 16st and smoke 20 cigarettes a day before changing his lifestyle to become a marathon runner . Pleased: Steve Way tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the 'Best day ever' Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . ‘I need to go have a drink and I’m not talking about water,’ said Way. ‘I’m going to have a pint or few as I haven’t had one for three months. ‘I can’t go completely off the rails because I’ve got a 90-kilometre (55-mile) race in Sweden at the end of August. ‘I’m absolutely delighted. This is the best day ever. Running is normally second place to my wedding day but this one matches it. ‘My wife Sarah won’t mind because my goals were top 10, personal best, British record and I’ve managed all three so I’ve couldn’t have hoped for a better day. ‘I hope I’m an inspiration. There are quite a few people out there that say they are getting themselves off the couch, getting out the door and seeing whether there is a marathon runner hidden underneath that couch potato.’ Way’s England team-mates Nicholas Torry, 37, and Ben Moreau, 32, finished 13th and 14th respectively. Australia’s Michael Shelley, who never bothers to look at a marathon course before he runs it, won gold with a time of 2hr 11min 15sec. Shelley, 30, won silver in Delhi four years ago in only his second outing over 26.2miles and on Sunday became the second man after Steve Moneghetti, Australia’s chef de mission in Glasgow, to reach the podium in consecutive Commonwealth Games. Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running . Shelley took up running because his parents did not want him to play contact sports after he was born with a hole in his diaphragm. The Australian said: ‘To come back and win now I’ve got a bit more experience is indescribable. It was a dream. I can’t believe it.’ Stephen Chemlany finished 43secs behind Shelley. He won Kenya’s first medal of these Games, but there were two more shortly afterwards in the women’s marathon as Flomena Cheyech Daniel, 32, took gold and Caroline Kilel, 33, won silver. Scotland’s Susan Partridge was the first British runner home in sixth place, with England’s Louise Damen seventh and Amy Whitehead ninth.

"By . Mike Dawes . He was a teenager from the Solomon Islands whom just about no one inside Hampden Park had heard of before he took to the track in the 5,000 metres final at the Commonwealth Games, but Rosefelo Siosi left it a hero. He also left some time after the 23 other athletes in the race had finished, but did so with a new national record to his name and the cheers of a packed crowd still ringing in his ears. His homeland in Oceania is more than 9,000 miles away, but on Sunday he was an honorary Scot. Tout seul: Rosefelo Siosi of Solomon Islands crosses the line to the roar of the Hampden Park crowd . Pipped: Siosi was lapped three times, and crossed the line one-and-a-half minutes behind second-last finisher . Lapped three times, the 17-year-old was roared on down the home straight and, arms and legs still manfully pumping, he crossed the line in 16 minutes 55.33 seconds. He was more than one-and-a-half minutes behind the second-last finisher and more than three-and-a-half adrift of winner Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku with his dyed gold hair. The Kenyan had won the title, but Siosi had won the crowd. Siosi thanked the Scottish public for getting behind him and spurring him on when he felt like quitting. 'I feel so tired,' he said. 'It was too cold for me. It was difficult to finish the race. I almost gave up, but the crowd were shouting, ‘Go! Go!’, so I had to finish the race. 'I’m privileged to compete against the fastest people in the world. 'The boys who train in Kenya train at altitude, whereas I just train at home - no coaches, just on my own. I was lucky to compete. They encouraged me really well.' The teenager will use the experience gained in Glasgow as motivation to step up his training ahead of the Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea next year and the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia’s Gold Coast. Meanwhile, at the front: Kenya's Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku runs ahead of countryman Isiah Kiplangat Koech . 'I will go back and train harder for the next Commonwealth Games,' Siosi added. 'This is my starting point for the Pacific Games. I will go for gold in the Pacific Games.' Siosi’s display will doubtless see him likened to other plucky competitors from down the years who finished way off the pace. British ski jumper Eddie ‘The Eagle’ Edwards came last in both the 70m and 90m events at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary - his best effort was more than 50m short of double gold medallist Matti Nyaken’s mark - but won acclaim for his attitude and perseverance and was greeted by 10,000 new fans on his return to Heathrow. Swimmer Eric ‘The Eel’ Moussambani, from Equatorial Guinea, came in more than a minute behind the 100m freestyle winner in his heat at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. His time of 1:52.72 was outside even the 200m world record, although it was a new personal best and national record. Sprinter Timi Garstang of the Marshall Islands finished last in his 100m heat at the 2012 Olympics in a time of 12.81secs - way slower than his personal best of 12.56secs and more than three seconds short of Usain Bolt’s 9.58s world record.

"By . Michael Powell . and Nick Craven . Dreadful loss: Schoolboy Zane Gbangbola, who died during the devastating floods in February . The parents of a seven-year-old boy said to have died due to a faulty pump used at their home during the winter floods, claim he was really killed by deadly cyanide gas leaking from a landfill site. New evidence has emerged that toxic hydrogen cyanide may have leached from a lake at the back of the home where schoolboy Zane Gbangbola tragically died during the heaviest flooding to hit Britain in 248 years. His grief-stricken parents now fear there has been a cover-up, as police continue to insist Zane died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a petrol-driven pump at their riverside home, even though the Gbangbolas insist they did not use it. Meanwhile, Public Health England officials and environmental experts have uncovered evidence of hydrogen cyanide at the riverside property in Chertsey, Surrey, which still remains sealed off six months after the tragedy. Scientists have told The Mail on Sunday that the deadly gas – used in the Nazi death camps – could have come from the former landfill site that stands just 20 yards from the back of the family’s home, as the rising water table could have pushed cyanide gas up through the landfill soil, generating hydrogen cyanide. As floodwater clogged the basement, gas bubbles could have risen up into the house with tragic consequences. The family were rushed to hospital in the early hours of February 8, after a call from Zane’s mother Nicole Lawler, 37, who had found both Zane and his father Kye, 48, unconscious. Zane was pronounced dead on arrival, while medical tests confirmed there were traces of hydrogen cyanide in his parents’ blood. Kye, a company director, has been left paralysed from the waist down and still attends almost daily hospital appointments. A consultant neurophysiologist has confirmed his medical condition is caused by exposure to hydrogen cyanide. Firefighters evacuated the area after their personal alarms were triggered by the presence of the gas. A total of 17 people were rushed to hospital and checked for signs of poisoning, but the only casualties were Zane and his parents. Later the same day, teams from Public Health England (PHE) and the Environment Agency descended, scouring the flood-hit area in biological suits. PHE has confirmed hydrogen cyanide was present. The couple have been advised not to return home – even to collect belongings or precious photos of their only child. Yet authorities are now accused of refusing to investigate the landfill site. Meanwhile, Zane’s parents are still waiting for a date to be set for their son’s inquest – despite new rules that mean inquests should be completed within six months of a death, unless there are good reasons for a delay. More than 10,000 people have signed a petition demanding ‘a national debate’ on the risk of toxic gas leaching from landfills during floods, as Zane’s parents claim they face a ‘wall of silence’ from the authorities. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Kye said: ‘It’s been six months since Zane’s death and people are still at risk. It’s obvious there are powers that don’t want this to come out.’ A million tonnes of hydrogen cyanide are still produced globally each year, and it is used in many industrial processes from paper-making to electroplating metal. Regulations around its disposal are tight, but that has not always been the case. Scroll down for video . Rising waters: Father Kye clears the floodwater from outside the family home in Chertsey prior to Zane's death . An initial post-mortem examination on Zane was inconclusive, but his parents say the pathologist was not told to test Zane’s blood for the presence of hydrogen cyanide – which disappears from the body within 48 hours. According to Surrey Police, further tests have found the cause of death to be ‘carbon monoxide poisoning’. Yet Kye and Nicole insist there was no possible source of carbon monoxide in their all-electric house. Kye said: ‘How can they say our son died from a substance that was not in our house, yet not look at the substance we now know was and has left me maimed?’ Questions: Nicole and Kye, who is now paralysed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair . Surrey Police released a public statement on Zane’s cause of death less than 24 hours after 800 local residents attended a heated public meeting on the floods, during which suspicions were raised about whether hydrogen cyanide was responsible. ‘The area was landfill from the 1940s until the 1970s,’ said Kye. ‘Nicole and I now cannot live in our own home because of the gas activity that’s been found there. We can’t even go to get our belongings. It is heartbreaking that we are now six months down the line and still have not got to the truth.’ But Surrey County Council insists the former gravel pit site was filled in with building rubble rather than industrial waste before being converted into a lake and field, although some residents claim the area was known as ‘the dump’ for decades. A joint statement from Surrey Fire and Rescue and Surrey County Council said: ‘Abbeyfield is not a landfill site in the usual sense, it is a former quarry restored as a landscaped lake. ‘The landfill referred to is rubble used in constructing its banks.’ But Kye said that Public Health England (PHE) wrote to him in May, warning him that as traces of the toxic gas had been found in the house, they should not return home. PHE would not comment other than to say: ‘We have not identified any evidence suggesting there is a public health risk, or hazard to neighbouring properties.’ Last night experts called for a full investigation into the tragedy. ‘Questions need to be answered,’ said Nick Walton, a leading environmental hydrogeochemist with 25 years’ expertise. ‘Almost anything can come up from a landfill site going back to the 1940s. The problem with older sites is we don’t really know what’s gone in there.’ David Rudland, chair of Environmental Protection UK’s land quality committee, said: ‘There are landfill sites that have taken large amounts of industrial waste, including cyanide, in the past, and it’s a possibility that dangerous material could be mobilised if the landfill site wasn’t particularly water-tight.’ How it happened: The tragic events that led up to Zane's death... and how his parents found 'the truth' Neighbour Ian Berry, 44, a finance broker, told The Mail on Sunday that he was told he may have 15 minutes to live when firefighters knocked on his door at 5am on the night Zane died. He was among the 17 neighbours taken to hospital as a precaution by emergency service. He recalled: ‘We were woken up at an ungodly hour. Two firemen came and said, “Zane has passed away and Kye and Nicole are in hospital.” I was told by both the fire brigade and the police that it was hydrogen cyanide. The fireman said death happens quite quickly, and that if it was in our blood we had got 15 minutes. ‘I don’t see how they can say carbon monoxide killed Zane. The only thing that could have caused carbon monoxide poisoning is the petrol-driven pump and I know they didn’t use it because I would have heard it.’ A spokesman for the Environment Agency said it would not comment while police inquiries were continuing, referring all questions to Surrey Police. A police spokesman said: ‘There’s no evidence of any wider risk to members of the public.’ Asked if there was any indication of hydrogen cyanide either at the property or in Zane’s blood, the police spokesman replied: ‘I can’t comment on any of the medical testing as that was done externally and by independent experts. 'We go by whatever information is put to us and the result is that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. We can’t comment on [whether the pump had been used or not] as that’s part of the investigation.’ The ex-landfill site is owned by gravel company Brett Aggregates. Last night, a statement from the firm said: ‘While to date we have no reason to believe there is any link between this site and the awful tragedy that has befallen the Gbangbola family, we have made it clear that we will give complete cooperation to any authorities wishing to investigate the background to this incident.’ Meanwhile, Kye and Nicole continue to fight for answers. Kye said: ‘Zane spent his short life helping others, now Zane needs some help. We cannot replace Zane. But can try to protect others. If we can find answers for Zane, we can protect others.’","Zane Gbangbola died during heaviest floods in UK for 248 years in February .

Adam Gemili qualified fastest for Monday's men’s 100 metres semi-finals and said he is capable of breaking the 10-second barrier for the first time to win a medal here in Glasgow. In a world-class field boasting the likes of Richard Thompson and Nickel Ashmeade, both of whom have run comfortably under 10 seconds this year, it was the 20-year-old Englishman who recorded the fastest time. We should, of course, not get too carried away with two races for Gemili still to navigate before he could step up onto the podium at Hampden Park, but there is a growing confidence about the former world junior champion. Flying: Adam Gemili coasted through to the semi-finals of the 100m with a time of 10.15secs . Confident: Gemili believes he can break the 10-second barrier in Glasgow over the next week . He may still refuse to conform to tired sprinting stereotypes by smiling rather than growling at the start of his races, but Gemili now believes he not only belongs along such elite athletes, but that he is capable of beating them. ‘I don’t see why I can’t realistically make the final and hopefully be pushing for a medal. I think I’m going to have to break 10 seconds to get a gold medal, but I feel I have been fit enough to do it for a while, weather-permitting,’ he said. ‘You do have to believe in yourself in sprinting. As much as people say “there are big egos” you do have to have a big confidence in yourself that you can do it and  execute it with the world’s best. ‘Everyone can beaten. It is just how you  prepare yourself on the day.’ But Michael Johnson, the world 400m record-holder, criticised the 20-year-old’s performance on the BBC, advising Gemili to stop looking like he is simply enjoying the occasion. ‘I wasn’t that excited by Gemili’s performance,’ said Johnson. ‘What has impressed me so much over the last couple of years is his technique, and he looked a little tight there. ‘He hasn’t run in a while and he’s been through a coaching change, so that may have something to do with it. When he runs well, I’d like to see him look a little more like he expects that, not like: “Oh my god, that was really great.”’ While it was true Gemili did not coast through his heat like Ashmeade or Thompson, who only qualified as a fastest loser after coming third in 10.33secs, the Englishman’s refusal to take himself too seriously has been a key to his success. He is a former Dagenham and Redbridge full back who only burst onto the scene two years ago. Impressed: Gemili praised the 'unbelievable' crowd that cheered him on at Hampden Park .

He is a . former Dagenham and Redbridge full back who only burst onto the scene . two years ago. Gemili still combines full-time training with Britain’s fastest active sprinter, James Dasaolu, under coach Steve Fudge in Loughborough — after switching from London-based Michael Afilaka — with studying for a degree in sports and exercise science at the University of East London. Maintaining such a grounded sense of perspective in what could be a dizzying world is no bad thing, surely. Fellow Englishmen Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Richard Kilty also progressed to today’s semi-finals, running 10.33secs and 10.34secs respectively. But Northern Ireland’s four-time Paralympic champion Jason Smyth, who is legally blind, missed out on a place in the semi-finals after clocking 10.66secs. Afterwards Kilty, the 60m world indoor champion, dedicated his Commonwealth campaign and season to his close friend David Zikhali, who drowned after swimming in the River Tees on Monday. Through: Richard Kilty, left, and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey will both join Gemili in the semi-finals . Kilty said . the 20-year-old’s death was ‘absolutely devastating’ and added: ‘David . was the most loving guy you will ever meet. This Games and the whole of . my 2014 season will be dedicated to him.’ England’s . three female 100m sprinters — Bianca Williams, Asha Philip and Sophie . Papps — all progressed to the semi-finals, with Williams the pick of the . three in running 11.37secs to finish second in her heat. Nigeria’s . Blessing Okagbare qualified quickest overall in 11.20secs, with the . dangerous Jamaican trio of Schillonie Calvert, Veronica Campbell-Brown . and Kerron Stewart also impressive. But Trinidad and Tobago's Michelle-Lee Ahye, the second quickest woman in the world this year and one of the favourites for the title, suffered her first 100m defeat for 10 races. The 22-year-old was clearly hampered by her heavily strapped left hamstring as she recorded only 11.52secs, and later withdrew from the Games.

"By . Richard Spillett . Controversial: Dr Daniel Potter runs a clinic in the US which allows couples to choose the sex of their baby in treatment costing £7,600 . Increasing numbers of British parents are flying to the US for a controversial IVF treatment which allows them choose the sex of their baby, a leading expert has revealed. Dr Daniel Potter, who runs the largest fertility clinic on the West Coast of America, has delivered 750 babies to UK mothers since he started in 1997. Visits from UK women have risen by 20 per cent year on year to the IVF specialist, which allows them to choose the sex of their baby using a process currently banned in Britain. Dr Potter says he sees around ten patients a month from the UK for his £7,600 treatment, with 80 per cent of potential parents opting for a girl and 20 per cent a boy. The fertility guru is now visiting the UK for the first time to discuss so-called 'gender selection' and meet some of his 'miracle babies' at his first ever UK patient reunion. A pioneer in Gender Selection, IVF and fertility, Dr Potter believes in parents' reproductive freedom to choose the sex of their child. He hopes his trip to the UK will help make those seeking a boy or girl aware that it is possible to choose the sex of their child. He said: 'I'm here to educate the British public on gender selection, explain the process and address some of the misconceptions surrounding the treatment. 'With more and more of my patients coming from the UK, I wanted to meet people face to face and explain that gender selection is a tested, trusted resource available to families.' The treatment process, which takes two weeks, involves husbands and wives flying out to his clinic by Newport Beach, California, to provide samples. One couple who used the clinic, named only as Hayley and Greg, visited Dr Potter because they wanted a daughter after having two sons. More British couples are having IVF treatment in the US so they can choose the sex of their baby. File photo . After a failed gender selection attempt at a fertility clinic in Cyprus, Hayley flew out to LA for treatment with Dr Potter after speaking to him on Skype. She is now six months pregnant with her first daughter. She said: 'I'd always wanted a little girl but logistically, we didn't want lots of children, we only wanted three, so we thought we'd go down this route. 'My husband said ""you can have one more baby"" at which point I said, ""if I'm having one more I'll make sure it's a girl"". 'I just think I've always wanted a mother-daughter relationship - not to take away from what I have with my sons, which is lovely. A sample is taken from the couple and a series of embryos are made from the samples to make sure they are healthy. Genetic markers in the embryo indicate whether the baby will be a boy or girl and, as a result, the desired sex will then be implanted into the mother. The remaining embryos are then either frozen for future pregnancies, disposed of or donated to other parents, depending on the wishes of a couple. The process is popular in the USA, with one in 10 IVF cycles performed there are now carried out for gender selection. 'We knew . about gender selection from a TV programme and Googled it. We found a . website with a message board with a lot of people from the UK who were . doing it. 'Of . the eggs we created, we had six healthy embryos - three girls and three . boys. I still can't quite believe it, I'll believe it when she's here."" The . couple spent a total of £22,000 on the treatment. The practice of . gender selection is illegal in the UK under the 1990 Human Fertilisation . and Embryology Act, and its 2008 amendments. It . rules that a license to assist in reproduction 'cannot authorise any . practice designed to secure that any resulting child will be of one sex . rather than the other'. It also forbids 'the testing of embryos for the purpose of establishing their sex'. However, UK law does allow provision for gender testing in the case of gender-related serious physical or mental medical conditions. Dr Potter defended the practice against critics who believe nature should decide the sex of a baby or fear selection will lead to a sex imbalance in the UK population. He said: 'Internationally, the genders selected vary, with boys and girls selected roughly equally. 'Many couples choose to donate any remaining healthy embryos anonymously.This way, they can be adopted and made into a baby, potentially transforming someone's life.'","Selecting baby's sex before birth is currently banned in the UK .

An epileptic teenager was trapped for 13 hours without her medication after a school locked her in a changing room overnight. Sornnaly Hossain's furious father says she could have died and is planning to sue Morpeth School in Bethnal Green, east London. After she was rescued the 14-year-old spent two hours at the Royal London Hospital having tests following her ordeal, which left her feeling dizzy. Her father Syed said he and his wife Khafija were gripped by panic after their daughter failed to return to her home on May 22. He said: 'She went to school and she didn't come back.  At 5.30pm they locked the door without checking. 'When she didn't come home we were searching everywhere for her. 'We called all our relatives but they couldn't find her anywhere.' Mr Hossain raised the alarm but police and social services looked around their home and not the school. It was only at 6.30am the next morning police found her in the changing room. Mr Hossain has now written to his MP, Rushanara Ali, and met local mayor Lutfur Rahman to discuss his concerns. 'What if my daughter had died?' he said. 'This isn't some small incident - she went without food and medicine. 'Why couldn't they care less about my daughter?

"By . Tara Brady . Marijuana use in America and Canada tops most other countries according to a new report by the UN. The United States, Canada, Nigeria and Australia ranked the highest with more than 10 per cent of their populations aged between 15 and 64 admitting to using the drug. Western Europe also has a high marijuana use but did not rank in the top group. The UN gathered data from people ages 15 to 64 around the world to analyse cannabis consumption . The countries with low use rates included Ecuador, Paraguay, Turkey and Romania. Surprisingly, Mexico's use of the drug was low despite despite most of America's marijuana coming from the country. The report said: 'While cannabis herb is grown in almost every country in the world, the producrion of cannabis resin is confined to only a few countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South-West Asia. 'The largest quantities of cannabis herb were seized in North America, which accounts for 64 oer cent of seizures worldwide.' Graph showing percent of people 12 and over who have used cannabis in a lifetime, past year and past month . When comparing prices worldwide, cannabis herb is found to be relatively inexpensive in North America, cheapest in Africa and South Asia and most expensive in East and South-East Asia. In 2012, between 125million and 227million people estimated to have used cannabis - that's 2.7 to 4.9 per cent of the population. Over the past five years in North America, the largest cannabis hreb market, prevalence rates have followed an upward trend but declined in Canada between 2008 and 2011 but rising between 2011 and 2012.

Although little research is available on the topic, experts estimate cartel losses of nearly $3billion from the initiatives that passed in Colorado and Washington. However, in the state of California, researchers concluded that legal changes would not be enough to diminish the market for Mexican cannabis. The report adds: 'Global cannabis use seems to have decreased, essentially reflecting a decrease in cannabis use estimates reported by a number of countries in Western and Central Europe.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . South Somerset District Council has hired a security guard for its reception area after claims David Fuller (pictured) intimidated staff . A council has been forced to hire a £30,000-a-year security guard to protect staff from a single local resident who is 'intimidating' workers. South Somerset District Council recruited the guard to sit in its reception five days a week to ensure David Fuller does not enter the building. Officials banned him from its premises in Yeovil, Somerset, in 2011 but claim he has broken the restriction a number of times. Fuller has a previous public order conviction for erecting an offensive sign aimed at a council officer he has been in dispute with. Mark Williams, council chief executive, sent a letter in October last year which warned Mr Fuller his case would not be reviewed for another year after demonstrating a 'complete contempt' for the ban. It said: 'Despite my earlier letter you have acted in a flagrant breach of this ban and accessed our offices by force. 'You behaved in a completely unacceptable and intimidating manner such that the police were called and you were subsequently arrested. 'The council is not going to be threatened from doing everything it can to protect its staff.' It said the council had licence to prohibit entry by any person and added: 'If you ignore this letter we will take such steps as are necessary to enforce the ban.' Instead the council said it would deal with any queries through Mr Fuller's wife Jo, landlady of a local pub, and who also manages around 180 tenants in properties in the council's area. Yesterday Mr Fuller branded the decision 'unfair' and said it made running a business difficult. He said: 'I've only ever visited to talk about queries and complaints. Now they won't speak to me on the phone and I can't go to the offices. 'When you have a concern you want it sorted straight away. Mrs Fuller is busy and it's a lot for her to have to deal with.' He said it was a waste of public money which could be spent on improving and retaining council services instead. He added: 'The offices are a public place, how can they ban someone from it? If I haven't committed an offence then I shouldn't be banned. I feel discriminated against.' But Mr Fuller admitted previous disagreements he had with district council licensing officer Nigel Marston may have 'escalated the situation'. The council banned Mr Fuller from coming to their offices (pictured) in 2011, but say he has violated the ban on several occasions. Mr Fuller has a previous conviction for erecting a sign aimed at a council officer . It is understood the guard was been hired specifically to prevent Mr Fuller entering the premises in Yeovil, Somerset, but the council has refused to confirm or deny this. Private security companies in the area prodive guards for around £80-a-year, meaning the council could be spending £30,000-per-year on the officer. It is believed the guard has been in the post for at least a month. A spokesperson for the authority said: 'The council reviews security for our reception services periodically to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff working in customer services, and has concluded it warrants the presence of an Security Industry Authority qualified security officer at the present time.' Earlier this month Fuller lost an appeal to have a conviction and sentence overturned after he was found guilty of causing a public order offence after making a sign attacking Mr Marston. The court ruled he would now have to pay a larger fine for the crime.","David Fuller banned from offices in 2011 after claims he intimidated staff .

"By . Associated Press . Marlene Pinnock said she thought she was going to die as a California Highway Patrol officer straddled her, repeatedly punching her head, on the side of a Los Angeles freeway. During an hour-long interview with The Associated Press on Sunday — her first public comments since the July 1 incident was caught on now-viral video by a passing driver — Pinnock spoke haltingly or in a whisper, occasionally putting her hands to her temples and grimacing. Her attorney Caree Harper frequently interrupted her and limited her responses to a reporter's questions. Scroll down for video... Speaking out: Marlene Pinnock, left, poses with her attorney, Caree Harper during her first interview since video of her being beaten by a California Highway Patrolman on July 1 went viral . 'He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me, he beat me. I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death,' Pinnock said. Pinnock, 51, was released from the hospital last week after several weeks of treatment for head injuries and now slurs her speech, Harper said. Pinnock is suing CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow and Officer Daniel L. Andrew in federal court for civil rights violations. The suit claims excessive force, assault, battery and a violation of Pinnock's due process rights. The CHP hasn't identified the officer but said he had been on the job for 1 1/2 years and is on desk duty pending completion of the internal investigation. Farrow met with community and civil rights leaders in Los Angeles multiple times last month and pledged that the investigation will conclude in weeks rather than the usual months. CHP Sgt. Melissa Hammond said Sunday that she couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation. 'He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me, he beat me. I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death,' Marlene Pinnock said in her first interview since the July 1 incident . Staying mum: Video taken by a passerby quickly went viral as popular opinion weighed heavily in the homeless grandmother's favor, though the CHP has thus far preserved the officer's anonymity . The CHP has said that Pinnock was endangering herself by walking on Interstate 10 and the officer was trying to restrain her. Pinnock said she had been homeless for the last three to five years, occasionally staying at the Los Angeles Mission, a family member's home or on La Brea or Crenshaw. Pinnock said she had been on her way to a safe place where friends could watch her sleep when the altercation occurred. Harper said the area Pinnock was headed to is one of those frequented by the homeless and only accessible by walking along the freeway ramp. She was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold by Andrew after the incident, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. Andrew said in his report that she was a danger to herself and wrote that 'upon contacting the subject she was talking to herself. The subject began telling me 'I want to walk home' and called me 'the devil.' The subject then tried to walk into traffic lanes.' Harper didn't allow Pinnock to discuss the details leading up to the incident or her medical treatment. 'If . in fact she did call him the devil is secondary to the fact that he . proved to be either the devil or a close relative,' Harper said. 'Because he treated her in a manner nobody should ever be treated.' Pinnock . is being supported by Harper to keep her off the street and is . essentially 'starting from scratch,' her attorney said. She also had to . go to the emergency room Thursday for 'severe temple pain,' Harper said. Victim: Marlene Pinnock, 51, is suing the CHP and several officers now that she suffers debilitating and lasting injuries in the wake of the beating . Standing strong: Maisha Allums (left) daughter of Marlene Pinnock, stands with her attorney Caree Harper before a news conference outside court in Los Angeles on Thursday, July 17 . And Pinnock said she's had 'bad nightmares' about beating beaten. 'When I was in the lockdown facility I woke up to screaming, I was screaming,' Pinnock said, imitating the sound. 'High pitched, loud, then I said nothing, I turned over, and said hope I didn't do that again.' CHP investigators in July seized Pinnock's medical records and the clothing she was wearing during the incident from Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Harper said she was outraged by the violation of doctor-patient privacy and attorney-client privilege. The incident has drawn outrage from U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, who called it police brutality and demanded the officer be fired, and civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.","Marlene Pinnock is suing thew LAPD and several California highway patrol officers after one allegedly beat her .

"By . Richard Spillett . Criminals are abusing so-called 'right to be forgotten' rules in a bid to cover up their past crimes, it emerged today. A European court ruling has ordered that search engine Google remove links to webpages which people claim are no longer relevant. The move - which has seen the company inundated with nearly 100,000 requests to remove search results - has been widely criticised as unacceptable censorship of the internet. It has now emerged that criminals are exploiting the new rules by lying to Google in a bid to cover up their past wrongdoing. It has emerged the criminals are abusing so-called 'right to be forgotten rules' to hide their past wrongdoing . The revelation came in a letter from Google lawyer Peter Fleischer to a working party set up by Brussels to police data protection across Europe. Google is currently looking into requests by  91,000 people across Europe, who want 328,000 allegedly 'irrelevant or outdated' web links removed from the web. But Mr Fleischer revealed that because Google only have  people's 'take-down requests' to go by, they are only getting one side of the argument. In the letter, reported by The Times, he wrote: 'Some requests turn out to have been made with false and inaccurate information. 'Even if requesters provide us with accurate information, they understandably may avoid presenting facts that are not in their favour.' He gives the example of criminals who apply to have links to news reports about their convictions removed, without mentioning they have since committed similar crimes. The new claims emerged in a letter sent by Google lawyer Peter Fleischer to a Brussels group investigating the fallout of the European Court ruling . News organisations, including MailOnline, have been notified of links to perfectly accurate reports which have been wiped from the internet after applications to Google. Stories about a Scottish referee who lied about a penalty incident, and an airline accused of racism by a Muslim job applicant were among those censored. An article about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden, because someone was embarrassed about comments they had left at the bottom of the story. Links to the referee story, which included no suggestion of any criminality, were later reinstated following public pressure. Astonishingly, the Brussels group monitoring the move has questioned whether news organisations and websites should be informed of the removals at all. But, in his letter, Mr Fleischer informed them it was essential to ensure the system was not abused. He gave the example of unscrupulous businesses who may try and get links to their competitors' websites removed so customers can't find them on the internet. The latest revelations came in the same week that a House of Lords Committee said the new rules were 'unreasonable'. Baroness Prashar, chair of the Lords Home Affairs EU Sub-Committee, said: 'We also do not believe that individuals should have a right to have links to accurate and lawfully available information about them removed, simply because they do not like what is said.'","New rules allow people to apply to Google to have links wiped from web .

"By . Tara Brady . A grieving widow has spoken of the moment her husband died from a heart condition while they were having sex. Lucie Brownlee found herself widowed at the age of just 36 following Mark Johnston’s death. The couple had been trying for a baby and were having sex at a time they had identified as the optimum to conceive. Lucie Brownlee found herself widowed at the age of just 36 following Mark Johnston's death . Lucie Brownlee, 38, from Sedgefield, County Durham, with her husband Mark Johnston on their wedding day. She says her husband's last words were: 'You've still got your socks on' However, the intelligence analyst suffered a catastrophic arrhythmia and could not be revived. An arrhythmia is an irregular or abnormal heartbeat. One type, sudden cardiac death, where the heart stops functioning. Men aged between 35 and 45 are most at risk. According to Ms Brownlee, her husband's last words were: 'You’ve still got your socks on.' Mr Johnston, who was just 37 when he died, had collapsed four years prior to his death and medics discovered that his aorta had ruptured. However, following an operation he went on to make a full recovery and was otherwise fit and healthy. Ms Brownlee, who has a six-year-old daughter with Mark, has now written a book about her experiences of being widowed at such a young age and talked about how she came to terms with her grief. An arrhythmia is an irregular or abnormal heartbeat. There are various types, such as the heart beating irregularly or more slowly than normal - or abnormally fast. Certain types of arrhythmia can cause sudden cardiac death due to loss of heart function. This can be caused by a thickening or abnormal structure of the heart muscle. Irregularities of the electrical impulses that upset the natural rhythm of the heart may also be to blame. Sudden . cardiac death kills 100,000 people a year in the UK and 325,000 in the . U.S. - most frequently in adults in their mid-30s to mid-40s. Doctors say most of these deaths could be avoided if the condition was diagnosed earlier. Men are twice as likely to succumb to the condition than women. The 38-year-old, who lives near Sedgefield in County Durham, said: 'We were trying for a baby. We had lost a baby in November. 'Anyone who has tried for a baby knows there is small window every month during which it is the best possible time to conceive. 'We were at my mother’s house for my grandmother’s funeral. It wasn’t ideal as we were actually in my mother’s bed but we didn’t want to miss out on that window. 'We hadn’t been having sex for very long, we had only just started, when he collapsed. 'His last words to me were, ""you’ve still got your socks on"". 'I thought he’d collapsed because of a problem with his heart, but it didn’t cross my mind that he wouldn’t wake up. 'I called 999 and did CPR on him for half an hour before the ambulance arrived.' Paramedics spent 40 minutes trying to revive him but he couldn’t be saved. 'I was just in shock. I couldn’t come to terms with it.' Ms Brownlee, a professional writer and creative writing teacher, said she then began to grieve for her husband, who died on February 11 2012, in a way which caused some people close to her concern. She admits . she ‘drank like a fish’ and embarked upon a ‘completely inappropriate’ affair with a plumber in the wake of his death. Ms Brownlee added: 'I drank an awful lot, and I started a fling with a plumber who had come round to do some work on my house. 'It was completely inappropriate, and my friends and family were worried that I wasn’t coping with my grief in the right way. Ms Brownlee started writing a blog in April last year and has now published a book called Me After You . 'But what I have learnt is that there is no appropriate way in which to deal with grief. 'People think there is a right way to grieve, that it should be in private. 'My grief has been chaotic and unruly. There are no rules to it. 'I can be quite matter of fact about what happened, but when I sit down and really think about it, it hits me.' Ms Brownlee started writing a blog in April last year and has now published a book called Me After You which can be bought on amazon.co.uk for £11.99. She said: 'I couldn’t write after Mark died. It took me over a year before I felt able to again. 'And once I did, it was lovely, because it was as though I was spending time with Mark every single day. 'He was such a positive person, so friendly and so loving. He was a one off in every possible way, including the way he died.'","Lucie Brownlee found herself widowed at the age of just 36 .

"By . Tara Brady . Former Lostprophets singer and paedophile Ian Watkins has launched an appeal against his sentence . Former Lostprophets singer and paedophile Ian Watkins has launched an appeal against his sentence. The former rock singer was handed a 35 year sentence at Cardiff Crown Court last year after admitting 13 sex offences. Among them included the attempted rape of a baby. After a judge branded the disgraced star a dangerous sexual predator, Watkins was handed a 29 year prison term followed by an additional six years on licence. However, the now grey-haired vocalist - who said his child sex offences were 'megalolz' - has complained his sentence was too harsh. Watkins, now 37, will appear in front of a panel of judges next week - and will decide whether his case can go any further. Application for permission for an appeal hearing was first lodged with the court in January - just a few weeks after his conviction. Originally Watkins had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite a damning video of him engaging in sexual activity with an 11-month old baby. However, he changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then complained he had not realised that a guilty plea had made him 'look guilty'. A court heard that after sexually touching a groupie's baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child. He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself. Dangerous: Watkins was handed a 29 year prison term followed by an additional six years on licence . Trial judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. 'This case, however, breaks new ground. I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous. 'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.' Watkins' two accomplices, Woman A and Woman B, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively. Watkins' appeal hearing is to be heard at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday, July 23.

Harry Jones, 76, who is secretary of a gun club, claims the collection of weapons is just a hobby . Armoury: More than 40 deadly firearms and weapons including this 5ft long Air Force missile have been discovered by police at a pensioner's home . Mr Jones told the Manchester Evening News that he was a weapons 'enthusiast'. 'This has been grossly exaggerated,' he said. 'I’m not criticising the police. I’ve been very well treated.' Mr Jones was arrested on July 9 while attending a meeting of the Tameside Shooting Sports Association, which is affiliated to the controversial National Rifle Association in the US and the Muzzle Loaders Association of Britain. Officers then raided his home and Greater Manchester Police say over 40 prohibited weapons were recovered. Mr Jones has since been bailed pending further inquiries. However, officers have warned that there could have been serious consequences if the weapons, including shells, missiles, guns and ammunition, had fallen into the wrong hands. More than 40 prohibited weapons have been . seized and they are in the process of being examined by specialist officers . under the Firearms Act. Among their number was a First World war artillery shell and the large grey missile, which has 'Air Force FA-770' painted onto it, and is thought to have been designed to be released by a fighter aircraft. Haul: Officers uncovered the hoard of weapons, most of which date from the First and Second World Wars, at the home of an elderly collector in Dukinfield, Manchester . 'We have recovered a significant number of firearms at this address, many of which appear to be antique or heritage weapons relating to the World Wars,' said Detective Chief Inspector Debbie Dooley, from Greater Manchester Police. 'At this stage the weapons do not appear to have been collected for any other reason than as part of a hobby but it does not detract from the seriousness that these weapons pose, particularly if they get into the wrong hands.' Police said that many firearms are held by people who are ignorant of their illegality, or have been left in homes and forgotten about.

"By . Tara Brady . David Craggs is headteacher at the Gad's Hill School in Higham, Kent . A headteacher of a private school has been accused of giving himself a 381 per cent pay rise over 11 years taking his salary to £169,000. David Craggs is headteacher at the Gad’s Hill School in Higham, Kent, which was once the country home of author Charles Dickens. The Charity Commission, which oversees the school because of its charitable status, is awaiting a response from trustees to 'serious' concerns it has raised over the alleged misappropriation of funds. It also alleged that Mr Craggs made up to 20 purchases using school bank cards which may not have had approval from governors. John . Melville resigned as chairman of the board of governors in April and . said he was now free to speak out about his concern over the school's . finances 'as opposed to toeing the line'. Two other governors left the following month, both also mentioning financial concerns in their letters of resignation. Mr Melville said he was 'bitterly disappointed, angry and upset' over the allegations. The governors are responsible for finances but the head has day-to-day control of the money. Mr Craggs reportedly began as headteacher of the school in 2000 on £35,130 a year, but by 2011 was being paid £168,985 having allegedly been free to set his own salary. A former employee of the £10,000-a-year school blew the whistle in March 2012 and an internal review was carried out. It concluded Mr Craggs 'had not breached any school policy or procedure and therefore would not be subjected to any disciplinary process.' Prestigious: A former employee of the £10,000-a-year school blew the whistle in March 2012 . Data published by the Department for Education shows that 900 school leaders in England are paid at least £100,000 this year. According to figures, some 300 heads are being paid £110,000 or more – around three times the salary of the average teacher. The average salary of a school leader at any type of state school now stands at £56,100. In comparison, David Cameron earns around £142,500. The Charity Commission was informed of the result and according to a statement from Gad’s Hill’s acting chair of governors Kirsty Hillocks, 'concluded the school may need to review some of its internal procedures' but that it had 'acted appropriately' and 'no further action' was required. But the commission was not told of allegations over Mr Craggs’ use of school credit cards, which have emerged since Mr Melville spoke out. It is now waiting for a response from the trustees before deciding whether to take any action against the school in Gad’s Hill Place, where Charles Dickens lived for the last 14 years of his life. A spokesman for the school said it was 'unfortunate Mr Melville has felt the need to speak to the media when he had full knowledge of the school’s finances during his 17 years as a school governor. 'The media are focusing on the financial management of the school which is something Mr Melville, in his role as chairman of governors and also vice chair of the finance committee, had control and oversight of throughout his tenure.' Ms Hillocks added that Mr Craggs 'deservedly has the full confidence of school staff and the governing body.' Mr Craggs was elected to be a Conservative councillor in Medway, Kent, in 2010 but was forced to resign just two weeks later because it he also served as a Special Constable in North Kent. At the time he said in a statement: 'People will know that I have served as a volunteer special constable on behalf of the people of Kent for the past 17 years, a role that I have held with pride. 'In the hope that I could expand my community service I stood as a councillor for Medway. 'I did not believe there was any conflict between these roles and was unaware that police regulations prevent anyone from holding political office whilst also serving the police. 'It is a pity that I have to stand down as a councillor. However, I have faithfully served the people of Kent as a special constable for the past 17 years and wish to continue to do so for many years to come. 'I now look forward to continuing my duties as a special constable in the service of the people of Kent and Medway.'","David Craggs is headteacher at the Gad’s Hill School in Higham, Kent .

"By . Tara Brady . Richard Dawe, 80, breached a restraining order banning him from being anti-social (file picture) An ASBO pensioner who has terrorised his neighbours living in a rural village for the past 16 years has been jailed for breaching the order for the 25th time. Richard Dawe, 80, breached a restraining order banning him from being anti-social when he launched a verbal attack on Barbara Wilks, 57, who lives next door to him. The sheep farmer has a string of ASBOs - including one for singing ‘Oh What A Beautiful Morning’ and Tom Jones’ classic ‘Delilah’ - at the top of his voice outside his neighbour’s houses. Dawe was jailed previously in 2012 after he threw mud at windows as well as calling Mrs Wilks 'ugly' during the ongoing feud. He also swore at his neighbours, attacked one with a shovel and made peacock noises to annoy a woman who he claimed played her radio too loudly. His bizarre hate campaign against his long-suffering neighbours in the pretty village of Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire, dates back to 1998. The serial pest described another’s home as a ‘tart’s boudoir’ and once goose-stepped up an anthill shouting ‘the Don rules’, has repeatedly breached the terms of his order since it was imposed. He was finally jailed for six months in July 2012 after he was caught on CCTV lobbing clumps of mud and stone at his neighbour’s garage window which smashed. However, last week he was back on trial again at Worcester Crown Court accused of breaching an ASBO - which was imposed on October 5, 2004. The court heard the breach occurred when Dawe shouted 'a load of bloody c***s' at Mrs Wilks following a long-standing row over land on January 14. On Monday the OAP - described as having a criminal record the 'length of War and Peace' - was jailed again after he admitted breaching the 10-year ASBO. Sentencing Judge Robert Juckes QC said: 'The language was particularly vile. Richard Dawe at his home in Worcestershire. He will spend another month in jail after breaching an ASBO . Neighbours: A general view of the house belonging to Richard Dawe  (left) and Barbara Wilkes (right) 'He was trying to discuss some kind of deal over the land and it was in that context he used the language he admitted to using. 'The order was designed to stop him using language of this kind. 'You have offended in this context of breaching criminal orders since 1998. 'I cannot tell you how much I hope that I never see you in this court again.' The five day trial heard the OAP used the offensive language at around 6pm on January 14. The court was told he 'delighted' in terrorising residents by referring himself as the 'Don of Castlemorton', 'The Godfather' and referring to himself as 'Mad Max'. Prosecuting Roger Brown said: 'Every time she goes out Barbara Wilkes takes a dictaphone to record him. 'This has happened frequently. 'She (Barbara Wilkes) is very upset. The language was very unpleasant.' He was also accused of driving onto Mrs Wilkes’ land before chasing her pregnant sheep around the field in his car, but a jury cleared him of this charge. Dawe admitted driving at the sheep on March 18 but said he did so slowly to shepherd them away. He also claimed his two dogs were in his car at all times and said he only let them out of the vehicle once the sheep were out of the field and the gate was closed. Sheep in the field next to the houses of Richard Dawe and Barbara Wilkes in Castlemorten . Richard Dawe's home in Worcestershire: The court was told he 'delighted' in terrorising residents . The court heard the ASBO was handed to Dawe at Birmingham Crown Court on October 5, 2004 and was due to expire on October 4 this year. Dawe, who has numerous previous convictions including wounding and harassment, was also cleared of charges of criminal damage and breaching an ASBO by damage to property. Defending Lee Masters said: 'He is 80 years old and he has been in custody for 171 days in total, an awful long time. 'Quite frankly, he is his own worst enemy. 'If he returns home today, you may think he may not be able to resist saying, for instance, ""Mrs Wilkes, your lies were not believed by the jury"". 'However, he instructed me all he wants to do is go home to his wife.' Dawe - who will be free in a month - has previously dismissed the ongoing feud in the idyllic village and branded it as petty parish politics. Speaking four years ago he said: 'I’ve been a valuable member of the community all my life. 'But the neighbours have ganged up on me because they want that corner of the street to themselves. 'I’ve been victimised by them. 'I like to sing and I just let out whatever tunes come into my head. It’s all just petty parish politics.'","Richard Dawe, breached order banning him from being anti-social .

"By . Tara Brady . Nigel Hardman is facing time in prison after he accidentally handed over child porn to the police . A magician is facing time in prison after he accidentally handed over child porn to police. Entertainer Nigel Hardman, 46, agreed to give CCTV images taken from outside his house to officers investigating drug dealing in the area. The performer, who previously went by the stage name of Prince Razaq, duly handed over a USB memory stick. However, when police from Lancashire Constabulary looked at the device they discovered an indecent image of a child. Hardman, of Preston, Lancashire, was arrested and initially claimed the photograph belonged to someone else, telling officers his ex wife had access to a computer. But a search of other computer equipment in Hardman’s home revealed 93 indecent images stored on various computers and hard-drives and Hardman confessed to saving the images. Hardman admitted he had used search terms including 'schoolgirl' to track down child pornography but claimed he filtered the images and if they appeared to show underage children he would not look at them. Paul Cummings, prosecuting, told Preston Crown Court: 'During his police interview he was maintaining the view that what he was looking at were legal images of people over 18. ‘When the allegation was put to him that they were clearly images of children he began to seek legal advice.' The former entertainer, who also had a sideline driving stag and hen party guests around Blackpool in a 31ft limousine, claimed he could tell the girls’ ages by their appearance and insisted the images he was viewing were of actresses pretending to be younger than they were. However he later accepted the 93 images found on computer equipment at his home belonged to him. Prince Razaq aka Nigel Hardman lies across a bed of nails at a Magic Convention in Blackpool . Mr Cummings told the court the images, which were categorised from Class A to C covering the whole range of indecent images under a new classification system, clearly depict underage girls. Hardman, who once won a talent competition on Channel 4’s Big Breakfast for escaping from a straitjacket while standing on a bed-of-nails, has no previous convictions for sex offences. However, he came to the attention of the authorities when he was caught defrauding the benefits system of thousands of pounds, claiming he was too ill to work, while working as a sword swallower and fire eater in 2008. After leaving his job as a civil servant due to alleged workplace bullying, he discovered he had a talent for dangerous forms of entertainment and created the persona of Prince Razaq, dressing as an Eastern fakir - in robes, complete with turban and curly-toed sandals. He went on to set up a limousine company but that fell by the wayside when he separated from his wife. Hardman pleaded guilty to 11 counts of making indecent photographs and two counts of possessing indecent photographs at Preston Crown Court. He will be sentenced on August 1.","Entertainer Nigel Hardman, 46, agreed to give CCTV images to officers .

"By . Tara Brady . Gabriel Edwards, 24, had played for Wigan Athletic¿s second team until a knee injury stalled his career . A professional footballer has been jailed for three years for teaming up with a gang of cyber-fraudsters to hack into bank accounts across the globe. Gabriel Edwards, 24, had played for Wigan Athletic’s second team until a knee injury stalled his career. Later he joined a gang of villains who targeted bank users from 'Minnesota to New South Wales'. Stolen details were used to hack into hundreds of bank accounts online and by phone before money was stolen by electronic transfer. The gang grabbed £130,000 and tried to get a further £45,000 between August 2010 and February 2012. They were caught after a man of 72, returned from a visit abroad to learn £47,365 had been stolen from his Halifax account between November 17, 2011 and November 25, 2011. Police discovered the money had been deposited into different accounts without his knowledge using different IP addresses. Officers later arrested Edwards at his flat in Salford, Greater Manchester during a series of raids on home across the county and during house searches various documents, mobile phones and laptops were seized. The computers and mobile telephones that were seized were examined and found that those involved in the conspiracy had acquired personal identification and account details for hundreds of people across the world. The information had allowed them to transfer money from bank accounts held by customers of major high street banks and credit card companies, into accounts run by the gang. At Manchester Crown Court, Edwards pleaded with a judge for leniency claiming he had been offered pre-season training with Macclesfield Town and wanted to 'continue his career in the lower leagues'. William Baidoo, 32, (left) who is said to be the organiser of the fraud was jailed for 40 months while his fellow ringleader, Mudasir Adesina 27, (right) was jailed for three-and-a-half years . But he was jailed after being found guilty of conspiracy to steal, concealing criminal property and possessing an article for use in fraud at trial. Two accomplices were also jailed while a woman was given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to complete community service. Judge Michael Leeming told Edwards, who left his native Ghana on a football scholarship after being spotted on TV: 'You are a talented footballer. Had fate been kinder the path you followed may have been very different.' Earlier the court haerd victims of the scam included 158 Visa customers, 74 Halifax customers and eleven Bank of Scotland customers. 'You are a talented footballer. Had fate been kinder the path you followed may have been very different' Judge Michael Leeming . Michael Lavery, defending, said of Edwards: 'After a serious knee injury he lost a year of his career and his contract. In that low point in his life, he perhaps became influenced by others.' But after the case Det Con Jane McHale from the Greater Manchester Police Volume Fraud Unit said: 'All those involved thought they could take money from the victim’s bank account and get away with it. 'Our investigations found that these people had accessed hundreds of accounts and time after time, those attempts had successfully resulted in funds being taken from bank accounts and placed into the hands of this conspiracy. 'It is clear from the analysis of telephone and computer records that the conspirators in this case were extremely busy over many months, involving themselves in sophisticated and highly lucrative conspiracies to steal and to conceal their ill-gotten gains. 'Thankfully, our investigation pointed the finger at all of them and we were able to secure evidence to bring them to justice.' William Baidoo, 32, of Beswick, Manchester, who is said to be the organiser of the fraud was jailed for 40 months after admitting conspiracy to steal, concealing criminal property, handling, and possessing articles for use in fraud. Baidoo’s fellow ringleader, Mudasir Adesina 27, from Whalley Range, Manchester was found guilty of conspiracy to steal and concealing criminal property at trial, and jailed for three-and-a-half years. Adesina’s wife Laila Adesina, 22, admitted the same charges and was sentenced to 16 months jail, suspended for two years, plus 250 hours unpaid work and made subject of a 12-month supervision order. A fifth defendant will be sentenced separately on Friday 11 July.","Gabriel Edwards, 24, had played for Wigan Athletic’s second team .

"By . Tara Brady . Kate Livesey pictured three weeks before she died from Sudden Death Syndrome . A fit and active nine-year-old girl died suddenly after being struck a previously undetected heart condition while she had a bath. Kate Livesey was found slumped in the water last February after being struck by Sudden Arrthythmic Death Syndrome (SADS), the same condition that affected footballer Fabrice Muamba. She died in hospital two days later. Although Kate’s mother Suzanne, 46, has a history of arrhythmia, Kate, who spent nearly every evening at cubs, swimming lessons or kickboxing, had no warning of the illness. Today, after an inquest recorded a verdict of death by natural causes, Kate’s family said they were campaigning for better research into the causes of SADS and had already raised thousands of pounds towards the hospital unit where the youngster was treated. The rest of the Livesey family are now getting screened for SADS but doctors have warned the condition may not ever be apparent. Mrs Livesey, who works at the Job Centre Plus said: 'Losing a child is possibly the worst thing you can go through. 'When a child is really sick it is a horrendous experience to go through but the only thing I can say it that in most situations parents can see if coming - they have warning - yet we had no warning. 'Her dream was to go on X-Factor - that’s is the one thing she wanted to do. 'She had passions for everything. Every night she going to some club or activity. She loved kick-boxing and to swimming and cubs most nights. 'There needs to be more done to identify or ensure there are ways of detecting SADS as we don’t wish any other parents to go through this. 'A lot of footballers are getting checked for underlying heart conditions and even Muamba was checked before he suffered from it and nothing came up. Tragedy struck when Kate was found slumped in the bath last February after suffering from SAD . Kate in fancy dress aged seven. Her family say she loved to sing and dance and dreamed of being a star . 'Cardiac Risk in the Young is a great project raising awareness but one of the few. 'There is still very little on the internet on it. When you look for a charity there are reams and reams but when you look for this there is about one website with hardly anything on it. 'In this day and age with information available at the tip of your fingers there should be more on it. There is very little data.' Lively: Kate dancing at a party in 2011. The child loved sport as well as performing . The inquest in Stockport was told it is rare for SADS to affect young girls, usually presenting in boyspredominantly aged between 14 to 35. Kate had dreamed of being a pop-star like Cheryl Cole when she was older and wanted to go on XFactor. The child would always be recording songs and dancing around the family home in Audenshaw, Manchester. Mrs Livesey said: 'Kate is the loudest, most all singing, all dancing, out there girl - she wasn’t a shrinking violet.

Her brother entered their family in a charity run after his sister died . Photograph of Kate as a bridesmaid at her cousin's wedding with friends and family in 2013 . 'So when I shouted up to her and heard no response, I went up and I found her on her side with her head in the water.' Kate was taken to Tameside Hospital but was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital but died on February 7. Her mother said: 'She always wanted to give to charity and was always asking if we could give to this or that so we decided to donate her organs and she helped four people who got her kidneys, pancreas and liver.' Kate's brother Mathew (centre) and friends at the Color Run which they did to raise money for charity . She added: “One of the things we are looking at is whether we have passed it down to Kate. I had arrhythmia but that can be physically seen. 'You could have a check-up and medical test and nothing would actually present at all and a few weeks later you could just drop. It is like turning a light switch off. In around 1 in every 20 cases of sudden cardiac death - up to 500 every year in the UK - no cause can be found, despite examination of the heart by an expert cardiac pathologist. The cause of death is therefore described as 'unascertainable'. This is called Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome, or SADS. The conditions responsible for SADS cause a cardiac arrest by bringing on a disturbance in the heart's rhythm, even though the person has no structural heart disease. It is believed there are 160,000 people in the UK with an undetected heart condition. Anyone with a condition affecting the heart that can cause sudden cardiac death needs to take extra care with medicines. All medicines - both those prescribed by your doctor and any you buy over the counter - must be checked, as some can increase the risk of sudden death. 'The possibility we are looking at is that I might have a secondary heart condition that we didn’t know about and passed on. It might not be that. 'It may be the case that she is the first in the family to have it. But we now have to make sure Matthew isn’t at risk.' A few weeks before Kate’s funeral, her father, building supervisor David, 48, found an email on her tablet of a song she recorded which she had emailed to a friend for her birthday. Her mum said: 'We found the song, it was quite crackly, so we sent it to get it cleaned up. 'We actually put it on a CD and played it at the funeral.. It was the theme tune from a TV programme called Victorious. It was talking about being tomorrow’s fascination and ‘remember me.’ 'The words were so poignant. It was brilliant because we wanted it to be her performance - she starred in her own show.' The Livesey family have been fundraising for the PICI unit at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and have raised around £5,000. Kate’s older brother Matthew, 14, entered the family in a sponsored run which raised £1,000 for his sister. This year retired footballer Fabrice Muamba said there was still not enough being done to prevent cardiac deaths. Two years ago the former midfielder suffered a severe cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane when his heart stopped beating. Muamba, who retired after the incident but made a full recovery, now works alongside the Professional Footballers' Association to raise awareness of cardiac health.

Anna Wlodarczak, a practitioner at the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service in Barrow, Cumbria, saw Helena Farrell on January 3 last year. An inquest into the death of Helena heard yesterday that she had been referred to the service by the South Lakeland school nursing team after taking an overdose on December 3, 2012, and disclosing an eating disorder stemming from a sexual assault while on a school exchange trip to Germany the previous year. Helena Farrell, pictured, was found dead in woodlands in Cumbria in January 2013, the inquest heard . Ms Wlodarczak, who was on duty at CAMHS, a service found to be in disarray in a subsequent investigation, was described as 'gruff' and 'unfriendly' by Enda Farrell, Helena’s father who accompanied her on the assessment visit on January 3. He told the inquest: 'Afterwards, Helena said ""Dad, she was terrible. Cold.. I don’t ever want to come back here again."" 'For Helena, that was the end and I knew I wasn’t going to get the proper service from them,' he added. Ms Wlodarczak told the hearing she had discussed issues such as bulimia, low mood, suicidal thoughts and her friendship group with Helena during the assessment. The teenager had been forced to move schools after being bullied for having red hair and a 'posh accent' She confirmed she had highlighted in paperwork that the teenager had been a very high risk during the overdose incident and had been scored three out of four for intent to take her own life when talking about the attempt. But Ms Wlodarczak said: 'There were issues there of concern but nothing in the way Helena presented at that time indicated any more risk.' Mr Ian Smith, coroner for south and east Cumbria, heard Barrow’s CAMHS team had been dogged by staff sickness and low morale at the time of Helena’s death. A damning internal report into the referral of Helena to CAMHS found five key areas of operation required immediate improvement, the hearing was told. The inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard she was a ‘bright, intelligent, adventurous and fun- loving’ girl who was a gifted cellist and singer . Failure to recognise the level of risk posed to the vulnerable teenager, failure by clinicians tounderstand their responsibility towards safe guarding and the reporting of a sexual assault by theteenager and inadequate information sharing were all weaknesses highlighted in the urgent review of the service, by Lynette Moore, clinical manager for Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The inquest also heard from part-time school nurse Donna Moore who met Helena three times in the month before her death. Mrs Moore, who had no mental health training, explained that due to sickness and vacant posts she had been responsible for five secondary schools and more than 20 primary schools - up to 5,000 pupils - across South Lakeland at the time. Her father Enda Farrell (left holding a picture of Helena) said she was not happy because people were 'teasing her about the colour of her hair' Speaking through tears, she said: 'I asked her if she had thoughts about ending her life. She said ""no, not really, I just feel up and down"". At the time I didn’t see the risk then.' PC Paul Kelly told the coroner he had found Helena hanging in woodlands behind the Castle Green Hotel on January 4, 2013, surrounded by notes, clothing, shells and the Coldplay song The Scientist playing on a loop. The inquest has previously heard Helena had been left heartbroken when she was dumped by her boyfriend. Her body was found at the same spot where they went on their first date. The inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard she was a ‘bright, intelligent, adventurous and fun- loving’ girl who was a gifted cellist and singer. But the teenager had been forced to move schools after being bullied for having red hair and a ‘posh accent’. Her father Enda Farrell, 56, said: 'She was unhappy because people were teasing her about the colour of her hair and about her accent.’ She transferred to an independent school, and at the age of 14 went on an exchange trip to Europe – where she claimed she was sexually assaulted in an attack which triggered an 18-month bout of bulimia. Helena Farrell had been in a brief relationship with William Williams while they were both studying at Kirkbie Kendal School, pictured, in Cumbria, an inquest heard . After she left the private school she moved to her local comprehensive, Kirkbie Kendal School. The inquest heard that in autumn 2012 she started dating Billy Williams, a boy who was one year above her. On their first date the pair went for a walk in the woods near her home in Kendal. However Mr Williams ended the relationship shortly after the half-term holidays in October. After the break-up, she wrote on Facebook that he had ‘broken her heart’ and went on to take an overdose of paracetamol. Her father, a former councillor, and her mother Maria, a GP, told the inquest they had desperately tried to help their daughter overcome her ‘dark thoughts’. Helena had written letters saying goodbye to her family and friends in the weeks leading up to her death, but they were confiscated by a teacher. The inquest is set to continue tomorrow.

"By . Tara Brady . A football mad father has drawn the line at his wife interrupting his TV viewing of the World Cup by using his own version of the new vanishing spray given to referees. Officials have been using the disappearing marker to draw white lines on pitches in Brazil to stop players encroaching on free kicks. Father-of-two Mike Taylor, 39, was so worried about his wife and daughters interrupting his viewing he has decided to copy the tactic in his living room. Mike Taylor has come up with a novel way of keeping his wife out of the room when he is watching football . Whenever . wife Lisa, 38, Paige, 18, or Lauryn, 15, approach the sofa he sprays a . line of shaving room in the doorway from the kitchen to keep them out. However, . Lisa and the girls got their own back when they posted a video of . Mike's special spray on Facebook and several women accused him of being . sexist. Everton fan Mike, an engineer from Plymouth, Devon, laughed off the controversy but says his spray is here to stay. He said: 'There was lots of hype around this new vanishing spray and so I decided to try it out for myself with shaving foam. Lisa and his daughters got their own back when they posted a video of Mike's special spray on Facebook . 'I . sprayed a line in the kitchen to stop my wife passing it - she found it . hilarious. She was in on the joke and if you look at the video you can . see her laughing. 'I . plan on using it for future matches outside my living room so people . know not to disturb me and I'm able to watch the footie in peace and . quiet. 'Anyone who crosses it will get a red card.' The . genuine article is named 9:15 Fairplay, a reference to the minimum . distance in metres that opposing players should be from the ball after a . foul. Invented by an Argentinian journalist, it's a mixture of butane, isobutane and propane gas, a foaming agent and water. Necessary: Everton fan Mike laughed off the controversy but says his spray is here to stay . The . invention has never been used at a World Cup before but it's nothing . new for fans of South American football where it's featured in league . matches for years to stop defensive walls creeping forward. The . vanishing spray will not be introduced into the Premier League next . season despite it being considered a success at the World Cup. The . new initiative marks out where a free-kick should be taken from and . where the defensive wall must stand, aiming to prevent players cheating. Referee Yuichi Nishimura sprays a temporary line on the field marking ten yards as players from Brazil and Croatia form a wall during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Group A match between Brazil and Croatia . It will be used in the Champions League from next season. But the Premier League and Football Association will monitor how effective that is before introducing it. The spray, which has been used in recent seasons in the Brazilian and Argentine leagues, evaporates about a minute after being administered from a canister by the match official.","Officials have been using disappearing marker to draw white lines on pitches .

"By . Tara Brady . A husband has been left penniless after his dying wife secretly ran up £48,000 in debts to fritter away before she died. Devastated Lenny Walters, 56, discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice to add cash to their joint mortgage. She died months after she confessed to the loans, forcing her husband of 29 years to sell the family home where they had lived for more than three decades, to cover the debt. Lenny Walters discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice to add cash to their mortgage . Lenny Walters and wife Joyce Walters taken in 2000. Joyce died months after confessing to the loans . Fishmonger Lenny admitted he could not forgive or forget her betrayal despite the fact the love of his life was on her death bed. He said: 'Words cannot describe the pain I felt when the full scale of her betrayal unfolded. 'Even as she was dying, I couldn’t accept her apology. It was the worst moment of my life. Joyce was well loved in our community and I trusted her implicitly. 'To think she could do this to me was beyond comprehension. We’d been together for 33 years. 'This is a woman I shared half of my life with, who I thought I knew inside out and who I trusted implicitly. 'To think she could steal from me with such ease is hard to get my head round. I couldn’t bring myself to forgive her even though she was dying of cancer.' Lenny believed they were close to paying off the £30,000 mortgage on their three-bed, semi-detached in Pembrokeshire, when his wife was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007. Joyce, 56, whose condition was terminal, underwent chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life but the cancer had also spread into her bone and brain. Lenny Walters and wife Joyce Walters taken in late 1990s. The couple had been married for 33 years . Photograph of Joyce Walters taken in 1980s: Her husband Lenny said he could not forgive her . Heartbroken Lenny decided to inform their provider Lloyds Bank as the couple had a joint account, although Joyce organised the mortgage repayments, which cost £350-a-month. However, on the day of Lenny’s trip to the bank he received a bombshell text from Joyce admitting to her deceit, before she fled to live with her niece in Surrey. Lenny said: 'Looking back, I think she knew what was coming. Finding out about the cancer was hard enough. 'I loved her just as much as the first day I met her and the thought of living without her was enough to kill me too. 'But when she dropped the bombshell about what she’d been up to at the bank. I was crushed. She texted me and confessed to re-mortgaging the property. 'I had no idea what was going on and couldn’t get any sense from Lloyds because she’d also changed our address, so the one I gave them wasn’t on their system. 'She told me she wouldn’t be coming back - that was it. She was dying and I’d have to fix this mess.'Lenny, who has a daughter, Katy, with Joyce, was showed statements that proved the property had been remortgaged in 2004 - adding a loan of £18,000. Joyce informed the bank that they had moved to a different address - which was actually the address of the resource centre where she worked. In May 2007, six months before she was diagnosed with cancer, she arranged a further £30,000 loan with Lloyds, secured against the value of the property. Lenny Walters, 62, a fishmonger from Milford Haven whose late wife remortgaged his house without his knowledge. Also pictured is his daughter Katy Walters, 33 . Despite the large value of the loan, no one queried that she had put a different address on her application form to their home address. When Lenny confronted his dying wife she confessed and even admitted that she 'fully expected to be pulled in [by police] for fraud', though she never was. A month latter Lenny received a letter from his heavily-medicated wife, reading: 'I know you must hate me, and who can blame you. 'You are a hard-working man, loving, kind and heart of gold. You made me a very happy woman and now I have lost you all because of money. 'This is all my fault not yours. I was spending far too much and it got out of control and I just didn’t know how to get out of it. I didn’t spend it on anything any good either. What a waste. 'I have nothing now. I am in the fight of my life with the cancer, and for the first time in my life I have never ever felt so alone.' In spite of the letter Lenny said he was unable to forgive his wife, who died five months after sending the apology. In April 2012, Lloyds Bank took Lenny to court in order to try to repossess the house. Lenny argued that he should not be penalised because of his wife’s actions because the bank should have been more vigilant in their checks. But despite accepting that he had nothing to do with the fraudulent activity, the bank will not accept any liability in the matter and are determined to recoup the money by forcing him to sell his property. He added: 'They want me to put the house up for auction with a reserve price of £45,000 for a quick sale. 'If I agree, they’ll also refund £3,000 for mis-sold PPI. 'I’ve already spent £10,000 of savings in legal fees but I’ll fight them to the bitter end to keep my home. I haven’t put it up for auction but it is on the market for £60,000. 'There are a lot of unanswered questions, like how she saw the same bank manager 14 times in the space of three years without me being present and how no one thought to query that she gave an address different to the home address. 'I’ve had years of stress fighting this case and, as far as I’m concerned, Lloyds need to be made answerable for their errors and lack of due diligence. 'The money I’d get from the house sale will be negligible. Lenny Walters said he is devastated that the woman he loved left him in such a financial mess . 'After spending 30 years of my life paying off a house, I’ll be forced to rent again, back to square one. 'I’ve always done the right thing and paid my way in life. I don’t think I should be penalised for my wife’s actions and Lloyds’ negligence. 'But the bank don’t care about my pain and distress and the fact that they are making me homeless. All they care about is recovering their money. They are completely heartless. 'And as for Joyce, I’m not sure I’ll ever understand how or why she could do this. I’m devastated that the woman I loved has left me this way.' A spokesman for Lloyds said: 'We are aware of Mr Walters’ case and are working with the customer to help reach a resolution. 'As discussions are still ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment in further detail about the case at this stage.'","Lenny Walters discovered wife Joyce forged signature twice on mortgage .

"By . Tara Brady . The son of MP Mike Hancock has been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay more than £2,000 in compensation for head-butting and punching a press photographer. Dean Hancock had expressed regret at his 'loss of control' and accepted that he was the more aggressive party when he attacked Steve Reigate of the Daily Express with 'tremendous force', Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court was told.

The 38-year-old unemployed pipe-fitter was found guilty of causing the photographer actual bodily harm and criminal damage to a camera lens and flashgun belonging to Mr Reigate. District Judge Anne Arnold described the attack, which happened outside the family home in Rockingham Way, Portchester, Fareham, Hampshire, on January 23, as a 'red mist situation'. She sentenced him to a 12-month community order comprising of 200 hours unpaid work and ordered that he pay a total of £2,951.20 in compensation and court costs.

'This is a moment I do not feel he will ever repeat again.' Dean Hancock pictured hitting Steve Reigate (left) and after the attack Hancock being led away by police . During . the trial, the court was told the fracas occurred while journalists and . photographers were waiting outside hoping to talk to the defendant’s . father. The . MP for Portsmouth South was making headlines at the time as he was . being sued in the High Court by a 'vulnerable' female constituent who . alleged that he sexually assaulted her. The 68-year-old, who has since settled the court action, had just been suspended from the Liberal Democrat Party. Dean Hancock (left) was ordered to pay costs after hitting photogtapher Steve Reigate (right) Vivian .

He . said that at 9.20am, the defendant’s mother, Jacqui, started to leave . the property in her car and was accompanied by her son who shielded her . using an umbrella. Mr . Ducie said that after Mrs Hancock had driven away, he walked over to Mr . Reigate and attacked him 'using some tremendous force'. Mr . Reigate told the court that he had not expected trouble when he went to . the Hancock house as he had been there previously without problem. He . said: 'I was prepared to be called something unpleasant but instead Mr . Hancock came straight up to me and head-butted me in the face, between . the bridge of my nose and my forehead, at which point I put my hands . forward, in one I had a camera in, to defend myself.' Mr Reigate said that he suffered an injury to his nose and a split lip. Footage of the incident filmed by freelance cameraman Paul Wellings for ITN was also shown to the court. Hancock admitted swearing at the journalists but claimed that he only hit Mr Reigate out of self defence after he said the photographer struck him in the stomach. He denied that he had head-butted Mr Reigate but said that they had “exchanged blows” with himself suffering facial injuries in the incident. Hancock said that he had dealt with the press over many years and had never threatened or attacked anyone but did admit that he would 'bait' journalists by deliberately opening the front door in a bid to make them believe his father was leaving the property. Hancock did not make any comment as he left the court.","Dean Hancock had expressed regret at his 'loss of control'

"By . Tara Brady . A family have ‘adopted’ one of Britain’s rarest creatures which has visited their garden every day for the last month - a black squirrel. The mutant rodent, which is a grey squirrel with a specific genetic defect, has been named Sooty by the Papps. Husband and wife David and Yvette live with their three children Vicki, 27, Sarah, 25, and Charlie, 22, in Hayes, west London. Sooty the black squirrel seen in the garden of Yvette and David Papps in Hayes, West London . Creative technician Vicki said: 'At first I thought it was a rat. But then I saw the big bushy tail. 'I never knew you could get black squirrels. 'He seems pretty happy though - he’s back in our garden every day. 'We put nuts and food out for him and his pals, and he seems very happy. Sometimes he’s with a pair of grey squirrels. The black squirrel mooches around the Papps' family garden in Hayes, west London . You looking at me? A rare black squirrel meets a grey companion in the garden . 'He’s a lovely little creature, and I hope he keeps coming back. He’s like our pet.' Black squirrels were first spotted in the wild in Britain Bedfordshire, around 1912, when a couple of the genetic mutants escaped after being brought over from America. It is thought there are same number of black squirrels as there are red squirrels in the wild, mostly in south east England. Black squirrels originate from North America and are the same species as grey squirrels. The only difference is they have a piece of DNA missing on a gene that produces pigment, meaning they can only produce black fur. The grey squirrel is a native of North America but has become a well established invader in the British Isles. Between 1876 and 1929 more than 100 grey squirrels were introduced to more than 30 different sites across England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. There are now more than two million grey squirrels in the British Isles where they continue to spread and their numbers continue to rise. About a dozen black squirrels from North America were released in Bedfordshire about a 100 years ago . The black squirrel is the same species as the grey squirrel and they interbreed normally. Scientists at Anglia Ruskin University discovered that the difference between the black and grey squirrel is genetic; black squirrels have a piece of DNA missing on a gene involved in producing pigment. Black squirrels are commonly found in North America particularly in the colder northern parts of the continent. About a dozen black squirrels from North America were released in Woburn, Bedfordshire about a 100 years ago, the first recorded sighting being in 1912. Black squirrel numbers have risen steadily over the years and they have been a common sight in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire for many decades now. Although black squirrels are spreading they are not found anywhere else in the British Isles. The mutated gene has travelled about 50 miles in 100 years and so the gene is travelling at about half a mile a year.","The mutant rodent is a grey squirrel with a specific genetic defect .

"By . Tara Brady . This photo taken by Amy Carter's family shows the teen on the day she was released from hospital in December 2009 - three days before she died . The parents of a teenager who died from multiple organ failure have received a payout from the NHS after she was sent home from hospital - even though she was too weak to walk, eat or drink. Amy Carter fell ill in December 2009 with a sore throat and flu-like symptoms but was told by her GP to take paracetemol and 'get plenty of rest'. However, the 15-year-old’s condition worsened over the next few days and she developed a rash, puffy eyes and a fever. Her worried parents took her to Worcestershire Royal Hospital on December 19 after she started vomiting and she was diagnosed with glandular fever. However, Amy’s family was stunned when they were told she would be discharged just two days later on December 21 even though her condition had showed no improvement. Shockingly, the schoolgirl - who had not been able to eat or drink for 19 days and weighed just six stone - begged doctors not to send her home even telling them 'I am dying'. Despite this, Amy was still sent back to her family home in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcs., with the rash spreading across her entire body. After her condition continued to worsen, dad Richard Carter, 48, took her back to hospital the next day but an A&E doctor sent her home for a second time after testing her oxygen levels. Amy was rushed back two days later on Christmas Eve where she then suffered four heart attacks and multiple organ failure. She died at 3pm in front of her heartbroken parents and sister Samantha, 21, who watched helplessly as repeated resuscitation attempts failed. Amy Carter was told to get plenty of rest and take paracetamol when she became ill in December 2009 . An inquest in July 2010 heard the teenager had developed a lethal combination of conditions . An inquest in July 2010 heard the teenager had developed a lethal combination of conditions never before seen in a patient. Yesterday, Richard and wife Jacqueline Carter, 52, received a 'substantial' out of court settlement from Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. The parents, who run pet shops across Worcestershire, slammed bungling NHS doctors for letting their daughter down. They said they were still angry bosses had refused to make an admissions of formal liability despite accepting that if Amy had not been discharged, she would probably have survived. Pictured: Amy Carter, 15, on the day she was released from Worcestershire Royal Hospital on the December 21 . Mr Carter said they were disappointed they had not received an apology from the Trust. He added: 'Our family has been utterly devastated at losing Amy, we have really struggled to come to terms with what has happened. 'We feel that the treatment Amy received at hospital fell well below acceptable standards. 'You beat yourself up. As parents you feel I should have been responsible for her but you trust the doctors. 'On reflection now this is what we now beat ourselves up about, we think we should have insisted. 'But at the time you don’t think you can, we presumed she was on the right side of it and would get better and trusted the doctors. Richard Carter, 48 is pictured with his wife Jacqueline, 52 and their daughter Samantha, 21, at their home . 'Our outlook on life is totally different, that’s what it does to you. They will just carry on and we are left to pick up the pieces. 'We put our faith into the clinicians that were looking after her in hospital and now we have to live with the guilt of thinking we could have done more to save her life. 'We have been fighting for justice for Amy ever since she died and the settlement from the Trust marks the end of a long legal battle. 'However, we are bitterly disappointed that they didn’t fully accept any responsibility for what happened to our daughter and were unable to provide us with any detailed explanation of what went wrong. Close: Amy Carter pictured with her father Richard before she became ill and died . Photo taken from a Facebook tribute page for Amy Carter (right) who died after suffering several heart attacks . 'Without this information, the reality is that we have no faith that the same tragedy can never be repeated. 'Our lives have been turned upside down since 2009 and as a family we no longer celebrate Christmas as it marks the anniversary of us losing Amy. 'We hope that through Amy’s case lessons are learnt by medical staff in recognising when patients need further treatment rather than being sent home in the hope no other family has to go through what we have.' Medical experts at Irwin Mitchell lawyers who represented the family found that Amy should not have been discharged on December 21, 2009. Richard Carter, 48 is pictured with his wife Jacqueline, 52, have received a payout after their daughter died . They discovered the bacterial condition she developed as a complication of a serious episode of glandular fever would have been spotted if she had remained in hospital. Instead she was allowed home and an overwhelming amount of bacteria entered her bloodstream causing septicaemia which resulted in a rapid deterioration and Amy developing multi-organ failure. Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust maintains their decision to discharge the teenager was correct. But medical experts found hospital staff sent Amy home despite her parents raising concerns that she was unable to walk because she was so weak. She had also lost over half a stone in weight, was suffering from a high temperature and had developed a widespread rash over her body. Amy's family were given 'substantial' settlement from Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust . Mrs Carter said she was in 'disbelief' when Amy was allowed home because her daughter had asked doctors if she was going to die just a day earlier. She added: 'I was shocked because I was thinking how am I going to treat her when we get home. 'It was just disbelief. Considering the condition she was in, we did not expect her to go home. 'She couldn’t eat or drink. 'She had asked if she was going to die just the day before she was let home, that’s how bad she felt' Mrs Carter, Amy's mother . 'We were concerned she hadn’t improved, she had got worse if anything. She was dismissed in the morning but we didn’t go home until the evening. 'I was going to the nurses telling them that the rash was still vibrant and she was having difficulty breathing. 'She had asked if she was going to die just the day before she was let home, that’s how bad she felt.' 'Thomas Riis-Bristow, a medical law and patient’s rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, added: 'Ever since Amy’s death the family have been desperate for answers about whether more could have been done to save her. 'They are disappointed that the Trust has made no formal admission of liability, despite accepting that if Amy had not been discharged, she would have survived. 'Nothing can turn back the clock, but the settlement at the very least, marks the conclusion of the family’s long legal battle to secure justice for Amy’s memory. 'We hope that any shortcomings the Trust found in its own internal investigation into the treatment given to Amy are improved to prevent any future deaths in similar circumstances.'","Amy Carter, 15,  fell ill in 2009 with a sore throat and flu-like symptoms .

"By . Tara Brady . A primary school has banned children from drinking squash because it is too unhealthy. Youngsters at Carlton Central Infant School in Nottingham are only allowed to drink a choice of orange juice, milk or water. However, some parents claim their children are becoming dehydrated and going without a drink all day because they will only drink cordial squash. Corbyn Richardson who has been told not to drink cordial at school pictured with his mum Nikki Richardson . Parents have branded the school’s claims that cordial drinks are unhealthy as 'nonsense' because the orange juice allowed is loaded with sugar. They accused the school of double standards because they happily allow crisps and chocolate as well as serving up fattening sponge cakes, cookies and cream and custard desserts in the school canteen. Mother-of-four Nikki Richardson, 32, says her four-year-old son Corbyn has been going thirsty while at school and has called for an end to the 'barmy' restrictions. However, scrooge school bosses have refused to back down on the rules, insisting parents must get a note from a doctor if they want their children to drink the cordials. Corbyn Richardson's parents believe their son is becoming dehydrated and going without a drink all day . Mrs Richardson, who sends Corbyn to school with a no added-sugar 10 calorie Fruitshoot drink each day, said: 'I was sending my son to school with cordial in his lunchbox and he was coming home with it at the end of the day. 'He was not being allowed to drink it. 'He was coming home thirsty. I asked the head teacher why and they said they weren’t allowing it on health grounds. Mrs Richardson sends Corbyn to school with a no added-sugar 10 calorie Fruitshoot drink each day . 'But there is sugar in pure fruit juice, so I don’t accept that explanation. It’s also very acidic, which isn’t good for his teeth. 'There’s less calories in the cordial I am sending him to school with. There’s three calories in the ones I buy and up to 115 calories in orange juice the school provides. 'Where is the logic in that? 'I don’t want him to drink milk in this hot weather as it’s not stored in the fridge and he doesn’t like water. 'My son won’t drink any of them, so what is he supposed to do? He is going thirsty and that is dangerous for his health. 'Ironically I asked about the chocolate and crisps in his lunchbox and they said ""oh, that’s absolutely fine"". 'That’s even more unhealthy than a no-added sugar cordial drink and they serve up custard and cream and sponge cakes quite happily. 'It’s just double standards really.' Full-time mum Nikki, who lives in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, with husband Matthew, 33, a bus driver, is now starting a petition to get the ban dropped. She added: 'I’ve had so much support, all the other parents think it is ridiculous too. 'We just want common sense to prevail in the end, it’s just nonsense and completely barmy.' Tiffany Antcliffe, whose five-year-old daughter Amber is also going without a drink all day, said: 'She has been coming out of school saying she is very thirsty. 'She won’t drink water and I want her to have cordial. Corbyn Richardson's parents have started a petition calling for children to be allowed to drink squash . 'But they have said that if she goes into school with cordial she will have it taken off her. 'I keep sending her with cordial. I don’t believe it is that unhealthy.' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'I know kids, including my own, are going without a drink because of this. 'The school should reconsider. 'They are children, they don’t understand that if they do not take in liquids they can become dehydrated and very ill. Fruit shoot No Added Sugar 200ml . Energy: 10calories . Protein: Trace .

'The school is preventing them from drinking something they will actually take in and is putting our children in real danger.' Earlier this year, research by experts at Glasgow University revealed that drinking fruit juice, including pure orange juice, can be harmful. They said a 250ml serving of orange juice contains 115 calories. Carlton Central Infants said it was following county council guidelines. Headteacher Anna Spencer added: 'If parents don’t wish their child to bring in water for medical reasons, we have asked them to supply a doctor’s letter. 'The reason we introduced this policy is that although the majority of parents were sending their child in with water, some children were bringing in sugar-laden fizzy or still drinks every day, which were having an adverse effect on their behaviour by the afternoons when some were becoming disruptive in class. 'Bringing in water also means that children can easily top up their bottles during the day, especially when the weather is warm, to keep them hydrated.' Youngsters at Carlton Central Infant School in Nottingham are only allowed to drink orange juice, milk or water . A Fruit Shoot No Added Sugar contains 10 calories while a 200ml glass of orange juice has 100 calories . The school which caters for 179 children aged between three and seven was rated as 'Good' in all areas after an OFSTED inspection in 2012. The report claimed that the school needed to 'improve the effectiveness of leadership and management and quality of teaching.' In January this year Valence Primary School in Dagenham, Essex banned fruit juices from school lunchboxes due to their unhealthy calorie content.","Parents at Carlton Central Infant School say children are dehydrated .

'Someone has misrepresented photos taken . at a restaurant five years ago for their own purposes,' he said. 'And so I’m not . just going to comment. That's really all I’d like to get into.' The images showing Jones - who has three children with his wife of 50 years - posing with two strippers at a Dallas restaurant emerged on August 3 when they were shared on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Speaking after practice this weekend, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones insisted the racy pictures of him with two women were taken five years ago . The man who published the photos, which appeared on websites including TMZ, claimed they were taken by someone else to extort Jones, who is worth an estimated $2.7 billion. Shortly after the pictures surfaced, the two women who are seen posing with Jones insisted they were so drunk on the night in question that they can remember very little. On Sunday, Jones, who had previously refused to publicly comment on the images, also refused to shed more light on the situation. 'I don’t want to comment on it anymore, but I have known about it for five years,' he said, the Star-Telegram reported.

Another image released online doesn't include Jones, but appears to show the woman he grabbed in one of the other photos . Previous reports by TMZ, claimed . that the strippers - Lindzie and Jordan - contacted their lawyers out . of fear that the married billionaire would go after them in court. 'There . was a lot of alcohol involved,' the women said, denying that they had . anything to do with leaking the photos or being a part of an extortion . plot against Jones.

"By . Christopher Stevens . Rocky and Rickina are best friends. As they pile into the school bus on their way to morning lessons, they're playfighting and planning mischief... as they always do. These carefree kids are no different from millions of children the world over - except that they're orangutans, their bus is a red wheelbarrow, and their school features the most unusual lessons you'll ever see, thanks to a National Geographic programme called Orangutan Rescue: Back To The Wild. First item on the curriculum, as the wheelbarrow deposits a gaggle of baby apes at the forest's edge in West Kalimantan, Borneo, is tree-climbing. Rickina is becoming an expert, but Rocky can't seem to get the hang of it and clings to his pal instead. Rocky and Rickina are part of the Animal Rescue project, where orphaned apes are taught the skills they'll need to survive in the wild . His weight drags her down, and they land in a jumble. Shaking twigs and leaves out of their fur, the terrible twosome move on to the next lesson - learning how to get at the porridge and honey hidden in tree trunks. But there's chaos again as two other students, Joyce and Gunung, decide to go playing in the trees that are out of bounds, further into the forest. It's all in a day's work at the International Animal Rescue project, where orphaned apes are taught the skills they'll need to survive in the wild. Like the human education system, the orangutan school is divided into primary, secondary and college levels. Rocky, Rickina and friends are on the first rung, but in three or four years they'll be ready to tackle more challenging lessons in nest-building and other forest skills vital for survival. Project director Karmele Llana Sanchez says the girl apes learn faster and make better progress. The boys are naughtier and much more boisterous, especially from the age of seven or so, and more likely to give the human handlers a playful nip from their powerful jaws. Indonesia: Five orangutans sit in a red wheelbarrow ready to go to 'school' One young female called Joyce is top of the class at making treetop nests, weaving branches and fronds into a snug basket that will keep her safe through the night. But as she finishes her handiwork, a bigger lad rudely turfs her out and commandeers it for himself. Bullying is a problem in this school as at all others. When the orangutans are ready for independent living, perhaps aged ten, they are transferred to ape university - a jungle island surrounded by a moat that has been carved out by mechanical diggers. Volunteers monitor their progress and ensure they have enough food as they build up to graduation day... and release into the wild. The importance of this school can't be overstated. Orangutans are desperately endangered as their habitat is obliterated to make way for palm oil plantations, logging and mining for resources such as coal and bauxite - an aluminium ore. Once there were half a million apes, but just a few thousand survive today. As the forests are chopped down, adult orangutans are slaughtered, and babies are illegally sold as pets. It's a brutal trade - Rickina has a scar across her scalp from the machete that killed her mother. A very young orangutan in the forest school learning practical skills for the wild . Orangutans have the longest adolescence of any animal beside ourselves, and they learn their life skills from their mothers. So it's a daunting but crucial task for the human volunteer schoolteachers, such as Lisa Burtenshaw from Bath. Lisa sold her contract-cleaning business to work at the centre for seven months a year, often joined by her husband, stand-up comedian Noel Britten. One of her jobs is devising new ways of secreting food around the forest for her students to find. 'We call that ""enrichment"",' she says. 'Rather than giving them food out of our hands or from bowls, we encourage natural behaviours, making them climb and forage.' Sadly, not all the apes can ever hope to return to the wild. Some may have become too reliant on people, or have suffered injuries in captivity - such as Monte, the centre's biggest inhabitant, an adult male whose legs withered during years chained inside a tiny cage. Monte might never walk again, but he has an active mind. Lisa dreams up food puzzles for him to crack, boxes to prise open and knots to unravel in search of a grape or peanut. It's the ape equivalent of sudoku. 'Orangutans are so intelligent they get bored easily,' Lisa says. 'They get stagnant sitting around in a cage all day, so this helps them stay mentally active and keeps their natural instincts alive.' Workers must wear masks at all times to prevent human diseases from infecting the apes. They are not allowed to cuddle the babies either, and it's not just the risk of sickness. Orangutans are not natural huggers, because in the treetops they need both hands for holding on to branches. Instead, the babies cling to their mothers until they are confident enough to let go. When humans hug and cradle them, the orangutans lose the instinct to cling - and that could be fatal later on. 'They're very lazy,' laughs Lisa, 'and they'll take the easy option. Even if one is crying in baby school, we don't pick it up - instead, we give it to one of the other orangutans. It's really important that they know they're orangutans, not humans. From a young age they all crave companionship, and they buddy up quite quickly. We encourage strong friendships.' That's why Rocky and Rickina are allowed to carry on causing mayhem together, when human children might be separated. And it's why the wheelbarrow is so important - the apes can cling to each other as it bumps along the forest trail. But on the journey home, it's sometimes a different story. Too tired after a day's study to clamber back into their one-wheeled bus, some of the babies hitch a ride on a human foot... wrapping their arms round a teacher's leg as they bounce home. Even for these adorable bundles of fur, school really is hard work.

"By . Taylor Auerbach . and Richard Shears . The father of a three-year-old girl still missing after after she was abducted from her home in remote southeast Queensland believes she was taken by someone who knows the family. Australian police are continuing the desperate search for Chloe Campbell, who was reported missing just before 7am on Thursday from her home on Ridgeway Street, Childers - a town of roughly 1,500 people. A police spokesman told MailOnline the search continued to centre around Childers and that investigators had began looking in farmland and dams in the area on Friday morning. But Chloe's father Garth is adamant that his daughter was taken by someone who knows the family and is familiar with the layout of their home. 'It's got to be someone who knows . me...how they got in, where she sleeps,' Mr Campbell told the Australian Associated Press. 'They knew . she was sleeping in front of the TV. Scroll down for video . Desperate search: Chloe Campbell, 3, had been missing for 42 hours . Fighting back tears: Garth Campbell said he hoped his daughter's abductor was treating her well . Close friends say Chloe's mother Tammy (left) is 'an absolute mess' while her father Garth (right) held back tears as he told media 'we are blaming ourselves' 'I don't think there's any possible . way she's wandered off. She wouldn't . leave the yard by herself.' He said the family usually . closed the windows of their Childers home at dusk each night to keep out . mosquitoes, but he believes that one of the latches had not caught. 'That's why we are blaming ourselves,' he said, fighting back tears. Police issued a 'child abduction . alert' shortly after 9am on Thursday and requested the message be broadcast on local . radios every 15 minutes. Search effort: police and SES volunteers are focusing on the Childers Showground which backs onto Chloe's home street . 'She . is wearing yellow pants with love hearts on them and a white-coloured . shirt with butterflies and bees pictured on the front' it said. 'Chloe could also be carrying a blue soft toy and a grey blanket.' The . disappearance has already drawn comparisons with that of British . toddler Madeleine McCann who went missing from her parents' apartment in . Praia da Luz, Portugal in May 2007. She was also three-years-old at the . time. In Childers - roughly 50km south of Bundaberg - the desperate search continues as State Emergency Services volunteers join police in scouring the locale. A major alert for Chloe was also put out at all airports and sea ports. Search for clues: The bedroom window and car at the centre of an 'urgent' police investigation . Mr Campbell said that while Chloe and her two older sisters, Janae, eight, and Britney, five, have their own room in the house, on Wednesday all three girls slept in the lounge. 'When Janae woke to go to the toilet in the morning, Chloe wasn't in the lounge room,' he said. Janae, he said, had then thought that her younger sister had sneaked into her parents' room because she had not been well lately. 'I hope someone that's taken her is looking after her - giving her brekky, lunch, I don't know - I don't know what to think,' he said. 'Maybe someone took her who can't have kids or something like that.' Heartache: Chloe Campbell's half-sister Codi (pictured) has made an emotional plea for her safe return . Chloe Campbell's half-sister Codi told reporters on Friday morning she loves the three-year-old and is desperately hoping for her safe return. 'I don't think she would go anywhere,' she said. 'She would stay as close to family as possible...I love her I just want her back.' Melissa Small, a 'close family friend' of the Campbells, told News Corp the toddler's window was left open and that alarm bells were raised when her parents discovered she wasn't in her bed this morning. 'The parents put the kids to bed last night. They went to sleep about one o’clock in the morning after watching TV. They have woken up at seven o’clock and (Chloe) was not in her bed,' she told reporters. Far and wide: A massive search operation has taken over Childers . 'There’s a footprint on the roof of the car to get through to the window. 'The window was open and her blanket and teddy bear, a grey blanket and a blue teddy bear, has been taken with her.' Ms Small referred to a car parked underneath Chloe's window which could have been used to access it. She described Chloe's mother Tammy as 'an absolute mess'. The missing girl is described as being Caucasian in appearance, 100cm tall, with fair shoulder-length hair. Searchers are currently door-knocking houses in the town and focusing their efforts on an area around the Childers showground. Local butcher Ken Gooden told MailOnline helicopters have been assisting with the mission since roughly 8am. He described the Campbells as 'a young family of three or four' who shop regularly in town. 'It's just like anything, you just serve them and don't think about it until something like this happens,' he said. 'It's crazy to think of what can happen in your own backyard. I hope she hasn't gone missing, I hope she's just wandered.' Crime scene: Police have closed off Ridgway Street in Childers, where Chloe Campbell disappeared . Similarities: Chloe's disappearance has reminded many of Madeleine McCann's in 2007 . The case has also reminded locals of the tragic disappearance of four-year-old Eeva Dorendahl and her father Greg Hutchings. The duo went missing from Pottsville - on the Queensland/New South Wales border - in early January, with police discovering their bodies 17 days later. Their disappearance made international headlines as details of a custody dispute surrounding young Eeva came to light. Childers, where today's search for missing Chloe has intensified, was also in headlines around the world 14 years ago after the Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel went up in flames on June 23, 2000, killing 15 backpackers. Later Robert Long was arrested for starting the fire and charged with murder. He was sentenced to life in prison.","Chloe Campbell was reported missing when her parents didn't find her in bed on Thursday morning .

"By . Richard Shears . Two new signals have been picked up from deep in the Indian Ocean, possibly from the black box carried on the missing Malaysian Airlines jet, it was revealed today. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is co-ordinating the search in Perth, said the discovery by the Australian ship Ocean Shield was 'further encouraging' news in the search for MH370. Mr Houston said the first signal was picked up yesterday afternoon and the second late last night. Scroll down for video . 'Encouraging': A total of four signals, matching those of a black box flight recorder, have now been detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the search for flight MH370 . The search co-ordination agency headed by retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston says there is now doubt over whether the pings recorded by search vessels are from the black box of the missing MH370 aircraft . He said the detection yesterday afternoon was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds, while the second was held for about seven minutes. This brings the number of transmissions detected by the high-tech Australian vessel that might be from the crashed jet to four. 'Yesterday's signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor' he said. Despite what Mr Houston described as 'further encouraging findings' he said that the underwater vehicle 'Blue Fin 21', which can 'sniff out' objects deep in the ocean, would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed. 'I believe we are searching in the right area, but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,' he said. 'I'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage.' More signals: A handout image released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) shows the search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where  15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight MH370 more than a month after it disappeared . An AP-3C Orion returns to RAAF Base Pearce after a day of searching an area in the Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . A map from AMSA shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight MH370 . However, U.S. Navy Captain Mark . Matthews said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is . somewhere within about a 12-mile radius. That would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the Bluefin sub between six weeks to two months to canvas. Data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder, said the air chief marshal. The Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis . Centre based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, on the NSW coast south of . Sydney, concluded that the two detections were from a source that was . not of 'natural origin' and was 'likely sourced' from specific . electronic equipment. Mr . Houston, pointing out that his optimism had risen since Sunday, warned . that a lot of silt could complicate the search, which is being boosted . by a sonar buoy and a modified RAAF P3 aircraft to co-ordinate with . Ocean Shield. 'It's . important for Ocean Shield to collect as much data as possible ahead of . deploying Blue Fin 21,' he said. 'The reason we want to do that is . there's no second chances.' The pings detected by the Australian Defence vessel Ocean Shield's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern Indian Ocean may now not be released . The towed pinger locator (TPL-25) on the deck of the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield detected two  signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder, but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with MH370 . The Bluefin 21 submarine drone, which will be used to scour the seabed for MH370 once the search area in narrowed down further, is hosited on board the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield after buoyanct testing . He warned that the recently-detected . signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - 'so . that means probably we're either a long way from it, or in my view, more . likely, the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the . signal is becoming weaker.' He added: 'So we need to, as we say in Australia, make hay while the sun shines.' Ocean . Shield, he said, would be looking to pick up more transmissions that . would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from. Once the search area has been narrowed, ships and aircraft could then find something in 'a matter of days,' he suggested. He . continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the . plane's final resting place, despite what he believed were signals from . dying batteries. Bluefin . 21, takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator, . which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres. A RAAF P3 Orion is seen parked on the tarmac after returning from a search mission for debris from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 yesterday . Iinitial confidence of Royal Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy (pictured, right, with search chief Angus Houston last month) of the recorded pings being from missing MH370 has now waned . The sub's sonar can scan only . about 100 metres and it can 'see' with lights and cameras only a few . metres. The maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres, and some areas of . the search zone are deeper. Search . crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor . that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds . emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there, said Mr Leavy, . who is helping to lead the search. Captain Matthews said: 'It's . certainly a man-made device emitting that signal and I have . no explanation for what other component could be there. 'I'm . an engineer so I don't talk emotions too much. But . certainly when I received word that they had another detection, you feel . elated.

"By . Richard Shears . Instead, the search will enter a new phase with the focus on the ocean floor - despite there being no 'pings' from what was earlier hoped were the aircraft's black boxes. Mr Abbott said that as the aircraft, which had 239 people on board, has been missing for 52 days, if there had been any debris from the aircraft it would have now sunk. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston announced yesterday that the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 would move to a new face as it is now 'highly unlikely' that wreckage will be foundo n the ocean's surface . 'By this stage, 52 days into the search, most material would have become waterlogged and sunk' said Mr Abbott. He paid tribute to the 'tremendous work' of air crews from eight nations who have contributed to the search. His words were seen as virtually admitting that the search had little prospect of finding the aircraft, particularly as a concentrated hunt by the undersea search vehicle Bluefin-21 in a 'likely area' had found nothing. Adding to the mystery is the testimony of sea current experts that anything that floats is likely to have washed up on rocks or a beach somewhere. But nothing has turned up and air and sea searches have also failed to find even a slick of oil that could be linked to the missing plane if it had plunged into the sea. Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mr Najib Razak, conceded in an interview that investigators had made no substantial progress since March 28 - the date experts calculated from satellite data the plane  crashed into the Indian Ocean. 'That's all we have until today,' Mr Najib told the Wall Street Journal. Royal Navy submarine HMS Tireless concluded its work searching for the black box of the missing plane on Friday . Flying Officer Elizabeth Vonfister is pictured aboard the RAAF E-7A Wedgetail aircraft during the search for wreckage of MH370 . Searchers for missing Flight MH370 face tough choices on how to proceed after almost seven fruitless weeks, with only a fraction of a deep-sea zone still left to be scanned . Earlier, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, questioned whether MH370 had even crashed into the Indian Ocean - and he blamed manufacturer Boeing for its fate. He also suggested the reason passengers and crew did not act to stop whatever was happening on the Boeing 777 aircraft after it had taken off from Kuala Lumpur was because they were 'somehow incapacitated.' In an opinion piece, Dr Mahathir, who maintains a strong influence in Malaysia's ruling party, said there was no chance, as had been suggested, that the pilot had committed suicide. 'Even if the pilot wants to commit suicide, the co-pilot and the cabin crew would not allow him to do so without trying something,' said the former prime minister. 'But no-one, not even the passengers did anything.' Dr Mahathir also questioned why no debris or oil slick from the plane has been found. 'Can it be that the plane remained intact on crashing and sank with no trace and no-one launching  the lifeboat doors as we are told all these aircraft are equipped with? 'Can one believe this plane quietly floated down into the raging sea and sank conveniently in the deepest part of the Indian Ocean?' He said it must have taken some effort if the pilot, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had disabled the plane's communication system. 'The co-pilot would notice and for his own life he would have tried to do something.' Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak (left) has conceded that no progress has been made in the search for the missing plane since the search began. (Right) Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has claimed that the manufacturers of MH370, Boeing, are responsible for its disappearance . Dr Mahathir, 88, who was Prime Minister for 22 years, asked: 'Was he disabled? Were all the crew members and the passengers disabled?' He expressed his sadness that staff of Malaysia Airlines were targeted by Chinese relatives of passengers in Beijing last week 'because they are blaming the wrong people.' 'The loss of the plane is due to the makers, Boeing. How can Boeing produce a plane that is so easily disabled?' In an era where passenger planes can be tracked on mobile phones and spy satellites operated by some countries are able to photography and identify a single person on the ground, Boeing had to explain how all these methods of tracking the aircraft 'can be disabled, can fail.' The former Prime Minister's controversial comments did not end there. 'Either Beoing technology is poor or it is not fail-safe. 'I would not like to fly in a Boeing aircraft unless Boeing can explain how all its systems can fail or be disabled.' Boeing, he said in his blog post, must demonstrate how the communication system could be disabled. The company, he added, 'must accept responsibility for building an aircraft that can disappear in mid-air so completely.' Insisting that Malaysia Airlines were not to blame for the tragedy, he said it was standard practice that when a plane crashes, a team of experts would arrive at the scene soonest so as to find the cause of the crash . 'Boeing and the authorities in the manufacturing country should be looking out for the plane. 'Maybe the plane type should be grounded. But Boeing has shown no interest and had said practically nothing.' Responding to Dr Mahathir's comments, a Boeing spokesman told MailOnline: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with the families and loved ones of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. 'Under the international protocols established for aviation accident investigations, Boeing continues to serve as a technical advisor to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, in support of the Malaysian authorities.' Relatives of Chinese passengers onboard the Malaysia Airlines MH370 push through a police line to march to the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on Thursday .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Richard Shears . Christine Armstrong, 63, was killed by a shark while on a regular morning swim off the coast of New South Wales on Thursday morning . A woman has died after she was taken by a shark while swimming off the coast of New South Wales, Australia. Christine Armstrong, 63, was swimming with a group of five others  when she was separated from the group and attacked by the shark. The incident occurred at about 8.20am on Thursday morning, about 320 feet from the shore. It was witnessed by swimmers in the water and people on the nearby wharf. People at the scene reported seeing a 10-13 feet shark close to the surface of the water near the time of the attack. ‘We have got a number of witnesses who have all seen this incident occur and I’m fairly safe to say at this stage to say that a shark has taken her, Inspector Jason Edmunds from Bega Police told ABC radio. Mrs Armstrong was a Tathra local, a keen swimmer and had been married to her husband Rob since the age of 19. Her family released a statement in which they said she had been loved by many people and would be sadly missed. 'She has been swimming at Tathra Beach for 14 years and was an experienced and committed member of the surf club', they said. 'She was a senior surf club trainer for many years and swimming brought her much joy and many friends. 'She will be sadly missed by all who loved her, especially by Rob, her husband of 44 years.' Police have closed the beach while water police, rescue helicopters and surf lifesavers search the area for Mrs Armstrong's body, or the shark. Mrs Armstrong was part of a group of about 20 people who regularly completed the swim together. The five members of the group who had been swimming with Mrs Armstrong on Thursday morning are being treated for shock by ambulance members at the scene. Scroll down for video . Police have closed off Tathra Beach and are searching for the body of Mrs Armstrong, who was taken by a shark while swimming . Tathra Beach is a popular holiday destination on the south coast of New South Wales, near the Victorian border. This is believed to be the first shark attack in the area in living memory . ‘Naturally they are shocked and horrified by what has occurred,’ Inspector Edmunds said. The swim from Tathra Beach to Tathra Wharf is a popular one. Up to 600 people take part in the annual Tathra Wharf to Waves ocean swim each January. The attack took place at what has always been considered a safe area. Locals have expressed their horror at the incident, saying that while sharks have occasionally been sighted in the area, they have never known of an attack. 'It is a bit of a shock. I was down at the beach about 8am. I saw the swimmers go in and then I was up at the house when the helicopter went over,' local resident Molly Carroll told the Bega District News. Ms Carroll also commented there was 'an eerie feeling' in the holiday town. The incident follows reports from Western Australia that the remains of a diver who disappeared at the weekend had been recovered, but there was no immediate confirmation that a shark had been involved. This is the second shark attack off the NSW coast within five months. Last November, 19-year-old Zac Young died at Campbell's beach, north of Coffs Harbour after receiving a severe leg injury in an attack while riding his bodyboard. In that incident, a bull shark was involved. In 2008 Tathra Wharf was the scene of a tragedy when father Shane O'Neill drowned while trying to rescue his two young sons after they fell 15ft into rough seas. Mrs Armstrong had lived in the idyllic holiday town of Tathra for 14 years. The town has been devastated by the attack .","Christine Armstrong, 63, was killed by a shark while swimming .

"By . Richard Shears . and John Hall . Self-confessed conman Peter Foster - the Australian former friend of Cherie Blair during the notorious Cheriegate Affair - has been revealed as 'the puppeteer' behind a slimming product scam. The 51-year-old fraudster, who became infamous in the UK in 2002 when he helped Mrs Blair purchase two flats in Bristol at a discounted price, was found by a judge to be guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct. But he wasn't in the Federal Court in Brisbane to hear Justice David Yates' condemning comments about his 'secret' involvement in a nasal slimming product, which was found to be a scam. Verdict: Peter Foster has been found guilty in Australia of misleading and deceptive conduct. He became infamous in the UK in 2002 when he helped Cherie Blair purchase two flats in Bristol at a discounted price . Past: Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry and promoting products that he knew would not work . Foster is currently on an Interpol 'most wanted' list and was last heard of in hiding in the Pacific nation of Fiji. He has already been sentenced to . three years jail for contempt of court after breaking a 2005 court order . barring him from the weight loss industry - and, if caught, he now . faces further prison time for failing to appear in court and being found . guilty of the slimming con. Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US . and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming . industry and promoting products that he knew would not work. His gained notoriety in Britain when it was revealed he had been an unofficial financial adviser to Cherie Blair - wife of then Prime Minister Tony Blair - and had helped to negotiate a low price for her purchase of two flats in Bristol. Mrs Blair initially distanced herself from Foster and the claims, but email evidence later proved she had in fact called Foster a 'star', before adding: 'We are on the same wave length, Peter'. She later made a tearful apology blaming her 'misfortune' on the pressures of being a mother, adding: 'I did not think it was my business to choose my friends' friends'. Apology: In 2002 Cherie Blair made a statement over her links to convicted fraudster Peter Foster. She had earlier sought to distance herself from claims he helped her purchase a house . Relationship: The scandal brought to light how close Peter Foster was with the Blairs - who had agreed to be the godparents of a yet-to-be-born child that was later miscarried . Cherie Blair makes a tearful apology blaming her 'misfortune' on the pressures of being a mother. 'I did not think it was my business to choose my friends' friends,' she added . The scandal brought to light how close Foster was with the Blairs - who had agreed to be the godparents of the yet-to-be-born child that his then partner Carole Caplin later miscarried. Foster even spent the night of his 40th birthday with the Blair's as a guest at 10 Downing Street. Referring to the slimming product known as SensaSlim, Justice Yates said of Foster: 'He was the puppeteer who pulled all the strings in the operation of the business.' Finding Foster guilty of a number of allegations of misleading and deceptive conduct brought against him by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the judge said Foster had involved a Melbourne gangland figure and his business associate in the scam. The judge said that Foster, who variously describes himself as an 'International Man of Mystery' or 'International Man of Mischief', had kept his involvement in the SensaSlim scam secret because of his 'awareness of his own bad reputation.' Reply: Peter Foster makes a public statement relating to the so-called 'Cheriegate' scandal. He helped the then Prime Minister's wife purchase two flats in Bristol . Foster was found to have created a fake Swiss research institute with 'false doctors' to promote SensaSlim. 'The individuals said to be employed by the institute as senior medical staff are fictitious,' said the judge. 'The institute is a fabrication.' And in a further indictment, Justice Yates said that Foster had used Melbourne-based alleged gangster Mike Gatto and Mr Gatto's business associate John Khoury to resolve a 2010 dispute with SensaSlim sales head Scott Emerton. 'I'll get my friends from Melbourne involved,' Foster was alleged to have told a Queensland Gold Coast dentist, an investor in SensaSlim. He was alleged to have said later: 'The problem has been dealt with. Scott will leave Mike alone.' Whereabouts unknown: Peter Foster is currently on an Interpol 'most wanted' list and was last heard of in hiding in the Pacific nation of Fiji . Further penalties against Foster as a result of today's hearing are to be fixed at a date to be arranged. Foster has a long history as a notorious conman, the majority of which relates to his involvement in the world of health and beauty products. When he was aged 20 he was fined by a court in Australia for attempting to make a fraudulent insurance claim when a boxing match that he was promoting fell through. The following year he was declared bankrupt in Australia after trying to market a product aimed at people who wanted to quit smoking. In the 1980s he reportedly made almost £20million from Bai Lin - a Chinese herbal tea that was promoted as a weight loss product in Britain, Europe and South Africa. Despite recruiting such well-known figures as Sarah, Duchess of York, Samantha Fox and the Chelsea football squad to promote the product, Foster was fined £21,000 in 1994 for a trading standards offense relating to the weight loss claims, before being jailed a year later for breaching laws regarding his distribution of slimming granules. Nine months later he absconded while on day release from open prison and went to Australia, though he was subsequently re-arrested and extradited back to England. History: Peter Foster has a long history as a notorious conman, the majority of which relates to his involvement in the world of health and beauty products . In the late 1990s, Foster launched Chow Low tea onto the U.S. market. After publishing an advertisement claiming the tea lowered cholesterol levels in newspapers across the US - including The New York Times . and The Washington Post - Foster was sentenced to four months in prison. Under Californian law it is illegal to claim a food or drink can lower cholesterol levels. Foster was jailed again in September 2000 at St Albans Crown Court, after being found guilty of using fraudulent documents to obtain credit for a company that sold thigh-reduction cream. During sentencing the judge said: 'The sooner you go from the country the better'. He has since found himself deported from Ireland and facing and string of arrests and fines in Australia over his involvement in various products sold as health or beauty items. In 2007 Foster pleaded guilty to forging documents relating to $300,000 he obtained fraudulently from the National Bank of the Federated States of Micronesia and was sentenced to four and a half years in an Australian prison. He was released on parole at the start of May 2009. Foster's current place on Interpol's 'most wanted' list relates to going on the run last October while  on trial in Brisbane for contempt of court. In his absence he was given sentenced to at least 18 months in prison. Foster's current whereabouts are unknown.","Australian judge finds Foster guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct .

"By . Bianca London . Gwyneth Paltrow must be quaking in her Tod's. First Blake Lively launched her very own lifestyle blog, just like Gwynnie's Goop, and now she's gone and launched a new designer fragrance campaign on the same day as her fellow A-list actress. Blake has been the face of Gucci fragrances  for several seasons and dazzles in the new campaign imagery for Premiere Eau de Toilette. Wearing a glittering gold dress and with her hair in tumbling waves, the Gossip Girl star oozes old school Hollywood glamour. Wow! Blake Lively has just been unveiled as the face of Gucci's latest fragrance and she oozes old school Hollywood glamour in the campaign . Speaking about the new scent, Frida Giannini, Gucci’s Creative Director, said: 'In the new Première Eau de Toilette, there is a charming balance of jasmine sambac and Bulgarian rose, two classically elegant feminine flowers that are contrasted with delicate freesia. The result is a vibrant,modern feminine scent that you can enjoy wearing every day.' Blake added: 'You spray it and you immediately feel empowered - there’s a sensuality that comes with fragrance and there’s a power that fragrance has on other people. 'But while Gucci Première represents a red carpet moment or a big night out, the new Eau de Toilette version is softer. It has all the great presence of the original, but dialled down and freshened up. You really can wear it as your everyday fragrance.' What a difference! While Blake has been attempting to emulate Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle blog, the stars new campaigns couldn't be more different. Gwyneth looks natural and pared-back in her shoot for Boss Ma Vie pour Femme . Gwyneth, meanwhile, has just been unveiled as the face of Boss Ma Vie pour Femme, inspired by a woman who stops and pauses to enjoy the simple things in life. Lively launched her foray into the online world of lifestyle blogging on Monday promising to be a younger more hip - and slightly less expensive - version of the fellow actress's long running site, Goop. The 26-year-old's part blog - part store also ended up with a slightly gloopy name, specifically the jelly-inspired title Preserve. New role: Blake Lively launched her foray into the online world of cool on Monday with a new lifestyle site called Preserve . The Gossip Girl star has previously avoided calling the site a lifestyle one, but just like Gwyneth's, Blake's offers a host of stories about cool clothes, places, foods and fashion scenes. Cue videos of artsy snippets, stories on tattooed men and organic health remedies and, of course, a store which sells everything from spoons to clothing and hot sauces to lighting options. The actress has been speaking of the project for months and now it is finally here, Blake was at pains to point out that she is not being a star trying to show people how to live like her, but merely pointing out how people live already. Buying the cool factor: Blake's site offers a host of stories about clothes, places, foods, fashion scenes and, of course, a store which sells everything from spoons to clothing and hot sauces to lighting options . Not all about Blake: The Gossip Girl star was at pains to point this is not the star trying to show people how to live like her but how people live already . As the name suggests, while using the modern medium of the internet, she wants her page to harken back to the small batch jam making times of yesteryear including things like preserving and promoting underground designers and produce. Confused? Well that's alright, so is Blake. Evolving: The 26-year-old wife of Ryan Reynolds, pictured last month, happily admits in her first Editor's Letter this is a learning curve for her . The 26-year-old wife of Ryan Reynolds happily admits in her first Editor's Letter that this is something of a learning curve for her. She writes: 'Sitting down to write this editor’s letter has been the hardest thing I've done yet on my Preserve journey. 'I’m more intimidated than I should probably admit. I’m no editor, no artisan, no expert. And certainly no arbiter of what you should buy, wear, or eat. 'I am hungry, though... not just for enchiladas. I'm hungry for experience. 'I'm comfortable with the knowledge that I'm not a teacher, but rather, a student. I don't do any one thing perfectly. I do a lot of things though. Some well, some not-so-well.' According to Blake, she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a 'new street.' 'A sort of greatest hits of ""Main Street, USA"". While the whole world races to keep up with technology, we tighten our laces, join the race, but our end goal is to preserve what's already there. 'The function of Preserve is part magazine, part e-commerce hub, part philanthropic endeavour and - above all - a place to showcase the power of imagination, ingenuity, quality, and (simply put) people. 'Preserve is a creative space. An indulgent space. A space for pleasure and fun. But also a space for knowledge. A space that honours both tradition and innovation - a space that honours the future, while having a love affair with the past...' However, now that they both have lifestyle sites, don't expect Blake to start a war with Gwyneth. The Gossip Girl star recently name dropped her fellow online retail blogger, telling Vogue she is always in both the actress's and Martha Stewart's corner. Blake said: 'I’m always the first person to defend Gwyneth Paltrow. Or any woman in a position of power, like Martha Stewart or Oprah, who gets burned. Because they have paved the path for so many other women who are doing something they believe in.' Arty Main Street: According to Blake, she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a 'new street' which promotes small designers and produce .","Blake has just set up lifestyle blog like Gwyneth's .

In Hollywood, . photobombing has become a tit-for-tat game among the stars, especially . at big awards events, when the opportunities to intrude a photo are . endless in a sea of cameras - just ask professional photobomber Jennifer Lawrence. Now you see her, now you don't! Spruced Up! is a new app that aims to help remove photobombers from your snaps - sorry Beyonce! Has your otherwise perfect photo been . hijacked by a photobomber? Got an ex or former best friend you want . erased from your favourite snaps? Want to banish those blasted . blemishes, remove tattoos, tone down excessive shine or correct ‘hair in . face’ photos? Now you can. Spruced up!, a professional retouching app, aims to enhance and preserve your pictures as you choose, with a little help from some of the most talented ‘sprucers’ in the industry - you can even add someone into the photo who missed the opportunity because they were in the toilet. Bye, Niall! The app lets you send your bombed snap off and 48 hours later it will be returned without the photobomber (in this case, One Direction's Niall Horan, who is gatecrashing Harry Styles' snap with a fan) The new app lets you upload your problem photos and pinpoint the changes you would like to make before professional photo ‘sprucers’ get to work on them. The app then alerts you when your photo is ready to download for a price of £4.48  (£2.49 minimum charge + £1.99) per picture. The only problem is you'll have to be patient; it takes 48 hours for your perfected snap to come back.

I wanted to provide the kind of high-end service usually reserved for advertising clients with multi-million pound budgets, but at super-competitive high street prices. 'It’s all about giving people the opportunity to perfect their photos; a service that simply doesn’t exist at this level. It has taken a year to create the Spruced up! website and app. As a retoucher (and perfectionist!) I wanted it to be very user-friendly and super-quick to use. 'Unlike many photo-editing apps, images sent to Spruced up! will be worked on individually and by real-life, skilled members of the team. We’ve created an easy-to-use service which will deliver your images to you within just 48 hours, perfectly retouched and ready to wow.' Did someone ruin your perfectly nice photo?

"By . Bianca London . Lara Stone recently revealed that her pregnancy - and the months afterwards - were less about 'earth mother' perfection and more about bloating, limp hair and self-criticism. She admits that she developed a love of fried food and that it took her a while to slip back into her pre-pregnancy jeans. But the supermodel, who gave birth to a child with David Walliams' last year, has been working hard to shift her post-baby pounds and now she's ready to show off the fruits of her labour. Scroll down for video . She's back! Lara Stone has spent the last few months trying to get her pre-pregnancy body back and she's showcasing the results in her new Calvin Klein campaign . The 30-year-old is the star of the new #mycalvins campaign and has been shot by industry legends Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. The throwback campaign is designed to look like Calvin Klein's iconic 1990s ads and Lara looks amazing as she showcases her enviably toned stomach in a series of saucy shots. What's her secret? While Lara admits that she developed a love of fried food during her pregnancy, she whipped herself back into shape on James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet . Vintage: The throwback campaign is designed to look like Calvin Klein's iconic 1990s ads and Lara looks amazing as she showcases her enviably toned stomach in a series of saucy shots . Lara has revealed exactly . how she coped with her pregnancy, the months that followed and the diet . and exercise regime that helped her get back into shape. ‘Pregnancy . is supposed to be the most amazing time in a woman’s life,’ Lara Stone . writes in the foreword to James Duigan’s latest book in the Clean & . Lean series, Pregnancy Guide. ‘We’ve . all heard stories of the glowing expectant mum, with toned legs and . neat bump and the instant and deep connection with her unborn baby. I’m . sure those pregnancies exist, but mine certainly wasn’t like that. ‘I . was in maternity jeans at nine weeks. I was bloated all over, had limp, . greasy hair, no energy and I could eat (and waddle) for England. ‘I . felt terrible for feeling this way because I actually had an easy . pregnancy. I had no morning sickness, no bleeding, no pain and my baby . and I were perfectly healthy. Yet I didn’t get that earth mother feeling . I’d been hoping for. Opening up: Lara, pictured, left, when pregnant . and, right, in September 2013, has penned a foreword in the new Clean . & Lean pregnancy book and admits that there's so much pressure to . lose the baby weight within days of leaving hospital . Like many women, Lara says she was keen to stay in shape during her pregnancy. In reality though, while she was aware she needed only 200 extra calories per day towards the end of the pregnancy, she found herself irresistibly drawn to deep-fried foods. ‘We’re only human,’ she says. ‘The most important thing during pregnancy is to grow a little person inside of you which, when you think about it, is the most amazing miracle in the world. ‘There is so much pressure these days to look fantastic during pregnancy and to lose the baby weight within days of leaving hospital. I have nothing against those who do, but it’s not normal.’ Despite her positive outlook though, Lara admits is has been a journey for her to accept the changes her body went through and the fact that it still doesn’t look exactly how it did before. Looking good: Lara, pictured here in . Cannes, says that she's a few pounds heavier than she was pre-baby, but . that's OK because she's happier than ever and she loves every minute of . being a mother . Happy couple: Lara is married to funny man David Walliams and the pair have a baby son, Alfred, together . ‘Your body changes hugely during a pregnancy and it takes time to go back,’ she says. ‘I’ve had lots of ups and downs regarding my body image over the past year. On every level I know I should just be happy to have a lovely healthy baby, and I do count my blessings every day. ‘But seeing articles about me that say: “She’s brave to go outside looking like that”, “She’s struggling with her baby weight”, “Is she pregnant again?”, or “She can kiss her career goodbye” is painful. And it sends a bad message to other women reading it, who may be feeling bad about their own baby weight.’ Since giving birth Lara says it has been a struggle to accept the changes in her body, but eating Clean & Lean and making time for exercise has helped. ‘I feel happier, stronger and more confident,’ she says. ‘I’m still not in my pre-pregnancy jeans and I’m a few pounds heavier than I was pre-baby, but that’s okay. ‘I’m happier than ever and I love every minute of being a mum. And I no longer feel the jealous need to unfollow friends who post bikini selfies ten days after giving birth looking amazing. Because everything is just how it’s supposed to be.’ The key to James Duigan’s Clean & . Lean philosophy is to eat clean foods (as close to their natural state . as possible), cut back on CRAP (caffeine, refined sugar, alcohol and . processed foods - find more detail in the book), eat lots of good fats . (nuts, avocados, oily fish) and limit bad fats (bacon fat, pies, . processed meats etc).

"By . Bianca London . Yet to do a Victoria Beckham circa 2006 and chop off all your hair? You're not alone. Nearly half of all Brits never change their hairstyle, finding what they believe is their ideal 'do' and sticking with it, according to new figures. The research also found that 47 per cent of Brits - like Cindy Crawford, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Scherzinger - will go through their whole adult life with the same style or cut. Well, it does suit her! Like Cindy Crawford, pictured, left, this year, and, right, over ten years ago, nearly half of us never change our hairstyle . Among the other 53 per cent, an average adult changes their hairstyle once a year and nowhere more so than in Birmingham, where the typical person spends £32 a month at the hairdresser. This compares to a UK average of £23.68 a month. While nearly half of Brits never shake up their style, more than eight in ten women - and even half of men - are affected by so-called bad hair days, said the study. Cheryl Cole and David Beckham were crowned as the King and Queen of hair types - after the nationwide survey revealed they’re the proud owners of the hair we’re all lusting after. Cheryl, who beat everyone from Miley Cyrus and her pixie crop to Alexa Chung and her tousled bob, fought off tough competition from ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan and This Morning favourite Holly Willoughby, who came second and third in the poll; proving that long, loose feminine curls are in no danger of losing their most-wanted status. Never changing: The research also found that 47 per cent of Brits, like Nicole Scherzinger, pictured, right, with the same style seven years ago, will go through their whole adult life with the same style or cut . Will she ever go for the chop? Unlike Gwyneth, who has had the same style for over ten years, among the other 53 per cent, an average adult changes their hairstyle once a year . As for the boys, David Beckham retains his crown as the UK’s favourite male fashionista with the majority of the vote, with One Direction’s Harry Styles and comedian Russell Brand winning the silver and bronze. A spokesperson for Macmillan Cancer, who commissioned the survey to launch its 'Shave or Style' fundraising campaign, said: 'Changes to our appearance affect not just how we look, but also how we feel, suggesting that we should shake it up a bit more often in order to feel at our best. 'Shave or Style, a week of fundraising from 19th-25th July, calls on people to stand proudly alongside men and women facing cancer who are experiencing physical changes to their appearance such as hair loss.'

"By . Bianca London . Most of us have a favourite piece stashed away in our wardrobes and Cressida Bonas is clearly no exception after she stepped out in her white Frame Denim dungarees for the second time in a week.

"By . Bianca London . Anyone who has watched Frank Lampard play football will have noticed his goal celebration - he raises the index finger of his right hand and points at the sky, lifting his eyes in the direction of the heavens. Frank, who is England's midfielder and Chelsea's all-time best goal scorer, has performed this small, yet significant, ritual since the day his mother, Pat, died after a short bout of pneumonia in 2008. Pat was 58 and her death was sudden and unexpected, and while Frank admits he struggled to come to terms with it, he has used her as inspiration in both his football and when penning his children's books. His biggest inspiration: Football ace Frank Lampard says that his greatest inspiration in life, and behind his children's books, is his mother Pat, right, who passed away in 2008 . Speaking about his series of books, Frankie's Magic Football, the 36-year-old said: 'My mum, who sadly passed away, will always be my biggest inspiration.' Frank, who has two children with his former fiancee, Spanish model Elen Rivas, added: 'I feel most inspired at home with my daughters. 'Thinking about what they would like to read helps me to come up with ideas. So, often inspiration comes to me when I'm reading to them, or telling them made-up stories. 'Chatting to my daughters and hearing the often funny things that they come up with helps me to get creative.' Salute: Frank's goal celebration, where he raises the index finger of his right hand and points at the sky, lifting his eyes in the direction of the heavens, is a tribute to his late mother . Story time: Frank, who has two daughters with his former fiancee, Spanish model Elen Rivas, said he is inspired by his children's ideas and funny stories . Inspired . by the football stories he invented for his own children, his books tell . the tale of a group of friends who are whisked off on incredible . adventures by a magical football. Sharing how he researches the story ideas for his books, which are aimed at five-year-olds and older, he said: . 'My stories are about football and fantasy, with a bit of magic thrown . in. 'This means that most of the research comes from my own experiences . on the pitch, combined with where I think that it would be cool to play a . football match. Like on a pirate ship, or in ancient Egypt!' Chelsea teammates - including Fernando Torres and John Terry - . better watch out, when asked who inspires the villains in his tales, he . added: 'Some of the characters in my series are based on the team . members I play football with. It's always fun to think about who could . be the next character when I'm playing football with them.' Frank, who cites Roald Dahl's BFG as his favourite book, said . that if an idea feels forced or you don't love it, then it's usually . not the right one. 'Trust your instinct', he says about getting . creative. Talents: While he may be Chelsea's best ever goalscorer, Frank has also written children's books, right . Frank is encouraging Brits to enter The Big Idea - a competition to discover original story ideas for children and offers one lucky winner the prize of publishing contract and the promise of their idea being nurtured, developed and written by a well-known author.

"By . Bianca London . She's married to a footballer and is preparing to slip into a wedding dress this year, so a healthy fitness regime is, perhaps unsurprisingly, high on Christine Bleakley's priority list. And now, the TV presenter has revealed how she stays in shape and has shared her top fitness tips for busy women who want to keep active. The svelte 35-year-old, who is the perfect advert for a healthy lifestyle, said: 'Fitness and keeping fit is very important to me and it’s very much a part of my life but with family life I know that finding the time in the week to exercise can be difficult. But there are lots of ways that you can combine the two and get you and your family active and healthy.' Now we can all look like her! Christine Bleakley, who turned PE teacher for the day to help children prepare for the Sainsbury's anniversary games this Sunday, shared her favourite ways of getting fit . Christine, who is the ambassador for Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games, suggests raiding your children's sports bag and seeing what 'goodies' are in there. 'You may not have picked up a skipping rope since you were 10 years old but just a few minutes a day is great cardio exercise and doesn’t require a gym membership. Get your kids involved and see who can do the most skips in a minute,' she advises. Christine also revealed that one of her favourite ways to stay in shape is by hula hooping. 'I was playing with them (Frank's daughters) recently and it was amazing how out of breath I got,' she added. Christine, who acts as a stepmother to Frank Lampard's young daughters with Elen Rivas, said: 'Sometimes you feel like you have to make a choice between spending time with the family and working out but this doesn’t always have to be the case. Get the glow: Christine revealed that she loves skipping, cardio blast workouts and replacing pasta with courgette to stay healthy . Football fans: Speaking about her favourite sports, Christine, who is set to tie the knot with Chelsea and England star Frank Lampard this year, said that obviously they love watching football but she's a fan of all sports . 'Why not combine the two and head down to your local park with the family. It’s a great place to be for a run around in the fresh air, get a group together and have a game of rounders – fun for kids and adults alike. Watch out, in my experience the adults always get competitive!' She believes that just five minutes a day can help to whip you into shape revealing that her 'intensive workout' is a mini circuit challenge, which consists of one minute plank, one minute of squats, one minute of sit-ups, one minute of press ups and one minute of burpees. 'It doesn’t sound a lot but I can guarantee you’ll feel like you’ve had a work out once you’ve finished and if you do it every day you’ll see real differences. 'The beauty of these exercises is that they all rely on body weight alone and don’t require any equipment, and even better, you can easily do them in your living room or back garden,' she said. Get the look: Christine reveals that she stays svelte by doing her 'intensive workout' and mini circuit challenge, which consists of one minute plank, one minute of squats, one minute of sit ups, one minute of press ups and one minute of burpees . Speaking about her favourite sports, Christine, who is set to tie the knot with Chelsea and England star Frank Lampard this year, said: 'Obviously in our household we love watching football but I’m a fan of all sports and sporting events are a great way to get the family together and inspire kids to enjoy sport and be active from an early age. 'I always find exercise so much easier when I have a friend to do it with me. Team up with some of the other mums you know and enter a local sporting challenge like a 5k run, cycle ride or swimathon. Having a goal to train for keeps you so much more motivated and on track. 'Plus committing to regular training sessions with friends will ensure you don’t let your training slip. If you have older kids - get them involved in your training too.' Fitness fan: Christine may find it hard to fit an exercise regime into her working day soon as she prepares to fill in for Holly Willoughby on some of her shows whilst she's on maternity leave . And it isn't just her fitness regime that Christine takes seriously, adding: 'Let’s not forget healthy eating, which will really complement your fitness drive. I find that doing a weekly shop means that I plan ahead and there is always healthy food in the house. 'I love cooking and always try to make nutritious meals that the whole family will enjoy. Simple things like replacing the middle layer of pasta in a lasagne with courgettes make the family favourite that bit more nutritious.' Christine may find it hard to fit an exercise regime into her working day soon as she prepares to fill in for Holly Willoughby on some of her shows while she's on maternity leave.

"By . Bianca London . Ripped jeans are all the rage this season but have you ever considered how they were made? One company is shunning factory workers and seamstresses in favour of wild animals. Zoo Jeans, which claim its jeans are the only ones on earth designed by dangerous animals, take the animals' favourite playthings - old tires and giant rubber balls - and wrap them in sheets of denim. Scroll down for video . Animal behaviour: A new jean company called Zoo Jeans takes the animals' favourite playthings - old tires and giant rubber balls - and wrap them in sheets of denim for the lions, bears and tigers to play with . They then return them to the animals, who roar, gnaw and claw at the toys. When the animals are done, the team scoop up the remains and make the jeans using the fabric, which feature a distressed denim look that is totally unique and comes with a built-in story telling the purchaser how - and by which animal - they were made. Zoo Jeans is the brainchild of the Mineko Club volunteer group of zoo supporters launched in collaboration with Kamine Zoo in Hitachi City with the goal of reviving the local zoo. A fashionable tussle: The Mineko Club volunteers give the denim toys to the animals, who roar, gnaw and claw at them to create statement pieces . Designed by lions: The jeans feature a distressed denim look that is totally unique and comes with a built-in story telling the purchaser how they were made . As of this week,  three pairs of jeans - two created by lions . and one by a tiger - will be auctioned to the highest bidders on Japan's Yahoo Auctions. The . proceeds will go to the Kamine Zoo’s wildlife preservation efforts and . the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). As well as raising money for animal charities, the practice is believed to be great for their welfare. Robert J Young, a professor of Wildlife Preservation at the University of Salford, calls this environmental enrichment, which he describes as 'a simple and effective means of improving animal welfare in any species - companion, farm, laboratory and zoo'. Conscious fashion: As well as raising money for animal charities, the practise is believed to be great for their welfare . Speaking about the concept, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'I can't work out if this is uber genius or just screams of exploitation. I mean, I don't agree with zoos anyway - but if this Japanese zoo is going to keep these big cats, then this is one way to keep them occupied AND make fashion out of it! 'I also wonder if they treat the jeans after they've been mauled by the animals. No one wants to catch something from their couture!' Dr Ros Clubb, senior scientific officer at the RSPCA, said:'We believe animals should only be kept in captivity if good welfare can be assured. 'Providing well-planned, varied, imaginative environmental enrichment should be part of all animal husbandry programmes in zoos, as is providing a suitable, species-appropriate environment that provides for the animals' needs. 'As long as it's safe for the animals, such as using non-toxic materials, then this could well be beneficial for the animals, stimulating natural behaviours and occupying the animals' time.'","Zoo Jeans  is brainchild of group of zoo supporters in Japan .

Vivian, 31, who appeared on ITV news with husband Adrian Jayasinha, said: 'I thought I'd be fine because we're very close to the hospital and I'd had a baby before so I thought I had this under control.' Clearly she didn't. Miss Gray began having . contractions in the early hours of June 12, a week before her due date. When her . waters broke, she presumed she had plenty of time to walk to the local . maternity unit. Scroll down for video . They can laugh about it now! Vivian Gray appeared on ITV news with husband Adrian Jayasinha to chat about giving birth on the pavement on her mother's Burberry coat . She . set off for Chelsea and Westminster Hospital with her husband Adrian, 38, an investment banker, and her mother Alicia Gray, a . plastic surgeon, who was staying at their home. But just 30 yards from . the hospital doors, Miss Gray could walk no further and realised her . baby had decided he wasn’t waiting any longer. Dramatic arrival: Miss Gray with her mother, who laid out her Burberry coat, and medical staff who helped her give birth on the street . Help is at hand: Medical staff from the Chelsea and Westminster . Hospital came out to assist Miss Gray, who was eventually taken into the . building on a stretcher . Blissfully unaware: Sky was born a healthy 7lb 9oz at 5.51am on June 12, just half an hour after Miss Gray's waters broke . The Scottish-born actress, who . is well-known in the US for playing villain Suzy Edwards in television . drama Desire, left home just after 5am, thinking it would be quicker to walk than get a taxi as the hospital was so close. But the contractions quickly became more powerful. ‘It was as if my body was doing all the work and I had no power over this pushing sensation,’ she said. She explained that her mother very 'gallantly' threw her Burberry coat on the floor 'like Sir Walter Raleigh'. Unexpected: The Scottish-born actress, who is well-known in the US for playing villain Suzy Edwards in television drama Desire, said her body took over . She said: 'She was the hero and she was very concerned that I was going to be . lying on the dirty street to have the baby so she did not hesitate. 'She . took her coat off, put it on the floor and I did crouch on it, and . that's where the baby was born.' When asked if the fact that she was born on Hollywood Road was a good luck charm, she said: 'Absolutely a good luck charm. This little boy is very lucky for me and I think maybe he'll be an actor too.' Miss Gray and baby Sky were allowed out of hospital to go home 12 hours later to join her husband Adrian and older son Liam . The hospital was extremely efficient. Within three minutes, two midwives, two assistant midwives and two paramedics arrived with all the equipment and held sheets round her to screen her from view while they delivered the baby. Sky was born a healthy 7lb 9oz at 5.51am on June 12, just half an hour after Miss Gray’s waters broke. She had spent eight hours in labour with her first child Liam, now two, so Sky’s speedy delivery came as something of a shock. After the birth, she spent 12 hours in hospital before taking her newborn son home the same day.

"By . Bianca London . and Catherine Ostler . The Duchess of Cambridge may have come under fire for all three of her kitchen refurbishments, but it seems that she'll be putting her up-to-the-minute appliances to good use. TV chef Rachel Khoo has revealed that Kate has been brushing up on her culinary skills at Leith's cookery school, a reputable teaching facility with alumni including Gizzi Erskine, Lorraine Pascale and Xanthe Clay. Speaking to Woman magazine, Rachel, who shot to fame  in the BBC Two cookery show The Little Paris Kitchen, said: 'Kate was in my class. Kate was . ill for a few days, so I took notes for her. She was a lovely person, . but she kept herself to herself.' Scroll down for video . Domestic goddess: TV chef Rachel Khoo, right, has revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge was in one of her cookery classes at the prestigious Leiths in West London . Leiths School of Food and Wine is situated in West London and claims on its website to have 'an international reputation as a first class culinary institute for chefs'. You'd hope so; a two-week course costs around £1,600. 'Students come from all over the world to enjoy dedicated teaching in a friendly atmosphere. The guiding principle is to impart enthusiasm for the food and wine trade and instil a lasting love of good food and wine,' reads the website. 102749 . 162215 . 80620 . 73213 . 36224 . 118480 . 104676 . 139436 . 36224 . 43296 . 80448 . 161054 . 146542 . 205102 . 96154 . 219940 . 70612 . 116704 . Cooking up a storm: With the skills she learned at the £1,600 cookery course, Prince George and William are surely in for a culinary feast . 'This is not restricted to career cooks - many enthusiastic amateurs join us in our varied programme of courses and our diverse range of special events.' The teaching staff are trained professional chefs, with experience in the real world of restaurants and commercial catering and renowned chefs, cookery writers and Masters of Wine regularly demonstrate or lecture at the school. The cookery course news comes just after we . learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her Kensington . Palace apartment, as well as at Anmer Hall. Kate and William have splashed out on a sleek, modern new kitchen - full of restaurant-standard . equipment with the finest furnishings and underfloor heating beneath a . reclaimed stone floor. The . focal point of the room is said to be a dining table for at least eight . people. Kate has taken advice from food writer Tom Parker Bowles (her . mother-in-law Camilla’s son) who loves a large dinner party in a . kitchen. Perfectly polite: Rachel said that Kate, pictured last week at Wimbledon with husband William, kept herself to herself but was a 'lovely person' Kate . and William have already kitted out Kensington Palace with these . products and are now said to be installing one of the giant . fridge-freezers at Anmer Hall. Also . used by Coleen Rooney, Victoria Beckham, Bernie Ecclestone, Sir Paul . McCartney, Madonna and Rod Stewart, these monolithic fridges come . complete with an air-purification system invented by Nasa that kills . bacteria, automatic icemakers which make crescent-shaped cubes (said to . melt more slowly) and lights on every shelf so no forgotten food ever . goes mouldy at the back. A special salad drawer is kept a few degrees cooler to keep the royal rocket and radishes crisp. The Cambridges have also . invested in a £8,000 Wolf double-oven with (separately) five induction . rings on a black ceramic hob, which boasts an ‘eye-catching’ cobalt blue . interior (useful for spotting burnt-on food), and ten different . ‘cooking modes’ which vary temperature and airflow at the touch of a . button depending on whether Kate is baking a cake or cooking a roast.

A set of . £159 restaurant-standard, hand-made Sabatier Perrier knives from France . (this brand is one of the oldest knife-makers in the world) are . included, too. And that is not to forget the quick-boil kettle, a £1,000 . state-of-the-art coffee maker (at this price, it will be . barrista-quality and able to make lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites at . the touch of a button) and crystal and glass from William Yeoward. Here, champagne glasses are around £169 each, water glasses, £45.95 and a . simple water jug £92. Kate’s . perfectionism also extends to the health of herself and her family, . and, of course, her figure. The kitchen will feature a £100 silver . ‘Nutribullet’ blender, the very latest juicer that keeps the goodness . from the fibre in the drink. Like many . building works, the Anmer project has apparently overrun, which means . that the talked-about summer party there has been delayed. There is speculation that Kate is concerned about being so far away from her parents if she spends too much time in Norfolk.

"By . Joel Christie . Do you live in a corrupt state on don't realize it? A new study claims to have determined the most unscrupulous states in the USA, based on research of more than 25,000 convictions of public officials for violation of federal corruption laws between 1976 and 2008. A joint venture between the University of Hong Kong and Indiana University, the study also looked at patterns in state spending to develop a corruption index, in order to estimate the most and least corrupt states in the union. According to business magazine Fortune, the findings put Mississippi as the most corrupt state in America. Named: The 10 most-corrupt states in the USA have need revealed in a joint study by the University of Hong Kong and Indiana University, with the list lead by Mississippi . Mississippi is almost the poorest state in the corrupt, Yahoo's Main Street reported. Interestingly, the data collected for the study goes beyond what is reported in the media, with many of the cases being small. The results may therefore surprise people, with some of the states listed not necessarily having a reputation for being crooked. It also means states that do have a reputation for highly-publicized corruption, such as New Jersey and New York, do not make the list. 1. Mississippi . 2. Louisiana . 3. Tennessee . 4. Illinois . 5. Pennsylvania . 6. Alabama . 7. Alaska . 8. South Dakota . 9. Kentucky . 10. Florida . The report said that: 'States with higher levels of corruption are likely to favor construction, salaries, borrowing, correction, and police protection at the expense of social sectors such as education, health and hospitals.' The researchers - Cheol Liu and John L. Mikesell - believe the need for correctional officers is greater in corrupt places because 'the overall extent of corruption will be higher in states with higher numbers of convictions of public officials'.

"By . Joel Christie . and Associated Press . An arrest has been made as part of the homicide investigation into the death of six-year-old Washington girl Jenise Wright. A 17-year-old male will be charged with second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter and child rape after forensic evidence linked the teenager to Wright, detective Lt. Earl Smith of the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office during an afternoon press conference Saturday. A major part of the investigation centered on collecting DNA cheek swabs from residents of the mobile home park where Wright lived with her parents in Bremerton. The little was last seen at the park on Saturday night, with search crews finding her body in nearby woodlands on Thursday. 'Yesterday, we made a promise to 6-year-old Jenise Paulette Wright that we would find justice for her. Today we have fulfilled that promise,' Kitsap County sheriff’s Lt. Earl Smith told reporters Saturday, according to NBC. Tragic: According to court documents, Jenise Wright died of blunt force trauma to the head, and there was evidence she was strangled. Scene: Law enforcement officers investigate at the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on Tuesday, August 5, 2014, in Bremerton, Washington. DINA evidence from the scene lead them to the arrest of Gabriel Gaeta . Forensics: Investigators used DNA cheek swabs to eliminate and hone in on suspects for the homicide of jenise Wright . Aerial: Pictured here is the 103-unit community at Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in Bremerton, Washington, where Jenise Wright lived with her parents . An autopsy proved she was murdered, however the cause of death has not been released. Police do not know whether the 17-year-old suspect - who was not named - knew Wright. Sheriff's . office spokesman Scott Wilson said earlier Friday that the wooded area . where an FBI team found the body contained thick brush and likely was . muddy. He said the person responsible for the girl's disappearance likely would have been covered in mud. Wright's family has said she was an outgoing girl. 'She was a happy child, a bright light for those around her,' Smith said. The FBI's Specialty Search Dogs Unit discovered the body after volunteer canine search teams reported their dogs showed interest in a particular area. Jenise was last seen when she went to bed Saturday night. Her parents waited a day before calling for help because they said the girl had wandered around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the past. Wilson said Thursday there were no signs of forced entry at Jenise's home and no indication she was taken from her room. Murdered: An autopsy concluded Jenise was a homicide victim, and her body was found Thursday in an area near the mobile-home community where she lived with her family . Parents: Denise Almojera Wright and James 'Jim' Wright told police their daughter would often roam around the mobile home park alone . Mourning: Karole Johnson places balloons of princesses and flowers at the entrance sign to the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park, Thursday, August 7, 2014 in Bremerton, Washington . The girl's parents are cooperating with authorities, he said. Hundreds of people, including officers from 15 law enforcement agencies, searched for Jenise, going door to door at  the mobile home park on the west side of Puget Sound, across from Seattle. They also pulled surveillance video from nearby businesses and checked in with sex offenders in the county. After the search began, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home. Jenise Wright's father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15, court records show. He eventually pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped. Prosecutors there did not return calls. A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail term on the condition that he follow certain conditions, including paying fees. Wilson has said authorities were aware of the past charge against the father, but officers were focused on finding the girl. Jenise was well-known among her neighbors and was so friendly that she would have breakfast with one family and lunch with others, authorities have said .","Jenise Wright, 6, went missing from the  Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in Bremerton, Washington, at the weekend .

"By . Joel Christie . A post-mortem examination has revealed that New Jersey Republican campaigner Joan Bramhall was shot dead at her Denville home by husband of 54 years, John Brahmhall, who then turned the gun on himself. The couple's daughter has said the two had recently been under 'enormous stress' amid reports that that 76-year-old Bramhall - a Morris County clerk of 15 years who retired in December - had been suffering from dementia. Their bodies were discovered by a family member about 10am on Thursday. A longtime friend, Keith Pierson, 63, told The Daily Record he noticed Joan had become 'vacant' of late, and said she recently asked him whether President Richard Nixon had died. Recently retired: New Jersey Republican fixture Joan Bramhall was shot dead on Thursday by her husband John Bramhall, who then killed himself. She had reportedly been suffering dementia and the couple were under 'enormous stress' However Pierson said in those times she would often have something of a mental reboot and be straight back to herself. One the couple's children, daughter Lori Bramhall, told the publication she has battled substance abuse issues for years and that her parents had, at various times, raised her six children. Lori Bramhall was estranged from her father, who had obtained domestic violence restraining orders against her and three of her children one day before the deaths. 'My father said I wasn't allowed to talk to my mother. I loved my mother and she loved me,' Lori Bramhall told The Daily Record. Lori Bramhall said her father had mentioned that her mother had dementia, but she didn't believe him. She said her mother had become forgetful, but was not suffering any serious mental ailments. Pierson - who said he has known Bramhall for decades - described her as one of the classiest women he had ever known. He said her husband kept a low profile and liked to go hunting. Morris County Clerk Ann Grossi said Bramhall was a political leader that entered into politics at a time when women were severely under-represented. 'Her vision was obviously bigger than the roles women used to be pigeon-holed into,' Grossi said. Joan Bramhall had two children from a previous relation and another two children during her marriage with John Bramhall. However one of their daughters, Deborah, sister of Lori, previously died. Joan Bramhall had been a longtime member of the Morris County Republican Committee and served as its chairwoman from 1988 to 1994, and worked alongside present Governor Chris Christie as a freeholder from 1993 to 1998. John Bramhall had owned a construction company which was responsible for many of the large homes in the couple's neighborhood, reports the Star Ledger. Family home: The couple were found in their Arden Road home in Denville after police received a call from a family member . Assembleyman Michael Patrick Carroll said Bramhall was incredibly kind and helpful to him when he began in politics in the 1970s. 'She was a great lady, everybody's friend. She never had an ill word about anybody,' Carroll told the Star Ledger. 'At the end of the day, if you could stay serving the people in the state of New Jersey for basically 50 years, even somewhere as relatively civil as Morris County, and never piss anyone off, that says a lot about your personality.' When she announced at the age of 74 in January 2013 that she would not run for a fourth term as county clerk, Bramhall said she was looking forward to her retirement. 'You know when it's time to stop and I want to stop and smell the roses, so to speak,' Bramhall said, reports the Daily Record.","Bodies of retired Morris County clerk Joan Bramhall, 76, and her husband of 54 years, John Bramhall, were found in their Denville, New Jersey, home on Thursday .

"By . Joel Christie . A lawyer for the wife of a Georgia man arrested in the death of their toddler who was left in a overheated SUV believes the woman has been ruled out as a suspect in the murder case. The attorney for Leanna Harris says a victims impact statement has been requested of his client, suggesting prosecutors do not intend to charge her. Her husband, Ross Harris, has been charged with intentionally leaving their son, 22-month-old Cooper, in a hot SUV for seven hours on June 18, killing him. Leanna Harris has since received a grief package to help her deal with her loss, according to WSBTV. 'Cleared': Attorneys for Leanna Harris believe the victim impact statement sent to her shows that law enforcement are not considering her a suspect death of her son, Cooper, who was left in scorching SUV for seven years . Leanna Harris, whose husband Ross faces a murder . charge after leaving their 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a . scorching hot SUV in June, hired her own attorney for the case . Scene: Cobb County police investigate the SUV where . toddler Cooper Harris died near Marietta, Ga., when his father Ross . forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work . Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man charged . with murder after his toddler son died inside of a hot SUV, was refused . bond and will now remain in jail until he is tried . 'In my experience, the district attorney only sends packages like these when they think someone is the victim of a crime,' attorney Lawrence Zimmerman told WSBTV. 'That’s what I believe based on what they’ve sent her. 'This is the most high-profile case in the social media era that Cobb County’s ever had, and the biggest case by far that Vic Reynolds has had since becoming the district attorney. 'This just didn’t get out by mistake. 'That doesn’t happen.' In her statement, Harris said she is still yet to swallow the loss of her son. 'The death of my son is still unreal,' she said in the statement. 'Not a moment goes by when I don’t think about him or what our future would have held. 'I now live a tortured existence.'

Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 . Harris also said that she has been suffering from depression. 'Some days I completely break down because I miss my baby and my family so much,' Harris wrote. 'The rush to judgment by the public and the mainstream media has left me with little confidence in our legal system and our society.' Also in the statement, Harris stood up for her husband, saying Cooper's death was accidentally. 'Ross was a wonderful father, and he loved Cooper with all his heart,' she wrote. 'I know without a doubt he would never have knowingly allowed any harm to come to our son.'

Police are still investigating the child's death. However they maintain Mr Harris intended to kill his son. During a bond hearing on July 3, prosecutors claims Mr Harris was leading a double life. They said he had sent explicit messages to numerous women -including at least one teenager- on the day of Cooper's death. Investigators had described Mrs Harris' behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. When informed by workers at her son’s day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There’s no other explanation,’ according to Cobb County Police Det. Phil Stoddard’s testimony. Then, when reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Police had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling officers it was her ‘worst fear.’","Criminal defense attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said Leanna Harris was asked to submit a victims impact statement over the death of her son .
