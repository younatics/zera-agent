"Miami (CNN) -- A fire engulfed a yacht a mile off Miami Beach on Saturday, sending a thick column of black smoke into the clear blue sky before rescue crews were able to put it out, the Coast Guard said. Three people were aboard the 80-foot yacht Bliss when it caught fire around 10 a.m., the Coast Guard said. They all jumped into the water and were rescued with no reported injuries. Crew members from the Coast Guard Cutter Sitkinak were about to board the yacht as part of a routine inspection when the fire broke out, the Coast Guard said. Boat crews from the Coast Guard's Miami Beach station and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded and extinguished the fire. It was not immediately known what started the fire. The yacht was partially submerged Saturday afternoon and commercial salvage was being arranged to tow it back to shore, the Coast Guard said. Were you there?

"New York (CNN) -- In the aftermath of one of the worst weather systems to hit the Northeast, finding adequate shelter is the big concern. What to do with displaced residents, whose homes were rendered dark, cold and powerless by Superstorm Sandy, is now the question plaguing emergency management officials across the Tri-State area. FEMA's answer for New York: Fix up the homes as best they can and put people back in them. Faced with a lack of physical space for FEMA trailers and limited access to available rental apartments and hotels, FEMA officials in New York said they are bent on making flood-soaked homes inhabitable as winter weather moves in. Jersey City takes 1-2 punch . ""New York is a unique housing environment,"" said Michael Byrne, federal coordinating officer for FEMA, on Wednesday. ""We had to come up with something."" The agency's typical approach to disaster relief, such as the widespread use of emergency trailers for displaced residents and long-term rental assistance, doesn't work as well in the Big Apple. Rental housing vacancies across New York City are less than 5%, while holiday season hotel rooms are packed with tourists and travelers, leaving few options for those in need of shelter, authorities said. Adding to the dilemma, crowding persists in the city's public housing units, where more than 160,000 families were on the waiting list before the storm. Can Christie capitalize politically on Sandy? Officials are expected to focus on getting power restored in places where the sheer extent of the electrical damage has made utility companies cautious about reconnecting homes to the power grid. They will also implement structural repairs to make the homes adequate shelters for incoming winter weather. Repairs could include tarps, plastic and plywood. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . FEMA is putting forth ""an essential package of necessary fixes so that people can get back into their homes,"" said Byrne. ""This is not a complete repair."" More than 17,000 households remain without power across New York. That does not include more than 30,000 customers who ""are unable to safely receive power without customer repairs,"" according to the Long Island Power Authority. Long Island residents sue utility . In hard-hit places like the Rockaways and Staten Island, where residents have often clung to their damp homes instead of evacuating, officials said the new program will better cater to the stark realities of the crisis. ""Our home is not that destroyed. We don't have no heat (and) it's very cold in the apartment,"" said Margaret Alvarez, a 41-year-old resident of Far Rockaway, Queens. ""We just need heat, water and electricity."" Residents like Alvarez, whose homes are damaged but not destroyed, are likely FEMA's target customers. But reservations about safety persist. Opinion: Don't rebuild . ""My house shifted about 5 inches,"" said Joanne McClenin, 55, a New Dorp resident of Staten Island. ""We don't know if the quick repair ... is going to be safe enough."" A thicket of downed houses and washed-out roads lines several blocks in the New Dorp area after a torrent of wind and water swept across the coastal neighborhood on October 29. ""I don't know how minor repairs get you back in your home,"" she said. Sandy amplifies struggles for low-income families . Others seemed somewhat encouraged by the federal plan. ""There are a lot of people that don't have their own contractors, so it's a good program for those people,"" said Dawn Nasella, a 41-year-old resident of Staten Island, whose rental property was destroyed in the storm. But the program is not meant to address the needs of those made homeless. That displaced population has mostly inhabited hundreds of city shelters, holed up with friends and family members or taken to living in more perilous places, like their cars. Costs of Sandy in the billions . Meanwhile, signs of normalcy continued to surface across the Tri-State area. But those still in the dark require inspectors to go door-to-door to check individual electrical panels to avoid further damage and potential electrical fires, raising the possibility of a long and cold winter for those still without proper shelter.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Chinese authorities are investigating an incident in which dozens of angry protesters surrounded the car of U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke in a Beijing street, some throwing objects at the vehicle before security forces intervened to protect it. The United States has expressed concern to China about the unusual disturbance on Tuesday, which comes at a sensitive time for American diplomats following the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in an attack in Libya last week. The harassment of Locke's black Cadillac took place as anti-Japanese demonstrators marched in numerous Chinese cities amid tensions between the two Asian countries over a disputed group of islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Chinese outrage over islands troubles Japanese public . ""Our mission is located very close to the Japanese mission, and there were some chantings of slogans with regard to the Senkaku Islands,"" Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, said Wednesday at a regular news conference. ""So our preliminary assessment is that it was related to that issue and not to the issues in the Middle East."" She said China has expressed ""regret"" over the incident, which caused ""minor damage"" to the car and left Locke unharmed. A video of the events uploaded Wednesday to the dissident artist Ai WeiWei's channel on YouTube shows about 50 protesters, some of them carrying Chinese flags, gathering around Locke's car as it tries to enter the embassy compound. A few of the demonstrators are seen hurling objects at the front of the vehicle before uniformed security officers manage to shield the car, enabling it to drive a short distance up the street and enter the compound through a different gate. The incident was an ""isolated case,"" Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said Wednesday at a regular news briefing in Beijing. ""Relevant Chinese authorities are investigating and will handle the result properly,"" he said. The long-running dispute between China and Japan over the islands -- situated between Okinawa and Taiwan in the East China Sea -- has escalated in the past two weeks after the Japanese government announced the acquisition of several of the islands from a private Japanese owner. China declared the purchase illegal and has sent patrol vessels into the waters around the islands, drawing protest from the Japanese government. The Chinese authorities also allowed the anti-Japanese protests to take place over several days. Some of the demonstrations turned violent, causing damage to Japanese businesses and prompting some companies to temporarily suspend operations. The United States, a key ally of Japan, has refused to take sides on the competing sovereignty claims over the islands. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who met with senior officials in both Tokyo and Bejing in recent days, has urged the two countries to resolve the issue through peaceful negotiations.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese government is in the final stages of negotiations to bring a hotly disputed set of small islands in the East China Sea under public ownership, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Friday, stressing his country's claims of sovereignty. The islands are at the heart of a bitter diplomatic argument between Japan and China that has resulted in occasionally violent acts of public protest. The uninhabited islands, known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, are privately owned by a Japanese family. A public initiative begun in April by the outspoken governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities has set off a new cycle of tensions between Japan and China over which country has sovereignty over them. China talks tough in Japan island dispute . Reports in the Japanese news media this week suggested the Japanese authorities had agreed a 2.05-billion-yen ($26.1-million) deal to buy the islands from the private owners. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Noda declined to discuss the size of the sum likely to be paid for the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan, because of the sensitivity of the matter. But he said the talks were in their ""final stages,"" and he remained unequivocal about which country the islands belong to. ""The Senkaku Islands are an inherent part of Japanese territory, historically as well as under international law, so there's no territorial claim issue between the two countries,"" he said. ""Right now, it is the ownership issue -- whether the individual owns these islands, or the Tokyo metropolitan government or the state. And I think we have to clearly and solidly explain these stances to the Chinese side."" His comments are unlikely to please Beijing, which issued the latest of its angry statements on the matter on Wednesday. ""I want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the Japanese regarding the Diaoyu Islands are illegal and invalid,"" said Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""We are closely monitoring the developments and will take necessary measures to defend our territorial sovereignty,"" Hong said. Why Asia is arguing over its islands . Noda said Friday that the purpose of the government's planned acquisition ""is to maintain those islands in a peaceful and stable manner."" The Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on the matter. The islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa, sit among popular fishing waters and are also believed to be rich in oil resources. Animosity between China and Japan over the islands runs deep. They have come to represent what many Chinese people see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says they saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. In the interview Friday, Noda also addressed recent difficulties Japan's relationship with another of its neighbors: South Korea. Tokyo dispatches team to survey islands at center of tensions . He insisted on Japanese sovereignty over a small group of islands in the Sea of Japan that South Korea calls Dokdo and that Japan claims as Takeshima. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited the islands last month, prompting Japan to recall its ambassador to Seoul and warn that it will take the issue to the International Court of Justice -- a proposal rejected by Seoul. Noda said he hoped Seoul ""will deal with this issue based on the principles of law and justice, but if they will not jointly refer this matter to the ICJ, we will have to make preparations to do it unilaterally."" Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. Lee also said in remarks to teachers last month that Japanese Emperor Akihito should make a ""sincere apology"" for the suffering Korean people endured under Japanese colonial rule, suggesting it was necessary before the emperor could visit South Korea. ""First of all, we never requested a visit by our emperor to South Korea,"" Noda said. He added that Tokyo was requesting ""a withdrawal of that statement as well as an apology."" He said he was ""surprised"" that the relationship with Lee had changed so dramatically in such a short space of time. ""It is quite regrettable,"" he said, before adding that a healthy relationship between the two countries is important for peace and stability in the region, especially with regard to issues like North Korea.

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong has defiantly posted an Internet picture of himself with the seven Tour de France winner's jerseys he received for performances that have been expunged from the history books. The American's victories from 1999 through 2005 have been annulled by cycling's ruling body following a damning report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which made allegations of systematic drug use that he refused to contest. The 41-year-old was banned for life, has been ordered to return his prize money and also faces a $12 million lawsuit from a former sponsor. Lance Armstrong quits Livestrong entirely . However, Armstrong -- who has never admitted any wrongdoing -- made his stance clear this weekend on social networking website Twitter, where he has 3.8 million followers. With a status reading ""Back in Austin and just layin' around ..."" Armstrong posted a picture of himself lying in his lounge with the seven yellow jerseys framed on the wall. His Twitter profile used to say ""7-time Tour de France champion"" but now it reads ""Raising my 5 kids. Fighting Cancer. Swim, bike, run and golf whenever I can."" The fallout from the scandal has resulted in Armstrong severing all ties with his Livestrong cancer charity. The Texan stepped down as the organization's chairman last month. CNN iReport: To wear or not to wear? Your views on the Livestrong bracelet . ""Lance Armstrong has chosen to voluntarily resign from the board of directors of the Livestrong foundation to spare the organization any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding his cycling career,"" read a statement from the foundation's chairman, Jeff Garvey.

"(CNN) -- Referee Mark Clattenburg has no case to answer in relation to a complaint from Chelsea that he used racist language towards one of their players during a Premier League game. The English Football Association (FA) announced Thursday that their probe into the incident found Clattenburg did not say ""shut up you monkey"" to midfielder Jon Obi Mikel, as had been claimed by another of their players, Ramires. And while the official has been completely exonerated, the FA insisted that Chelsea and Ramires, who is the only player to have heard the alleged comment, were right to report the matter. The FA also confirmed Mikel has been charged for his conduct after the game against Manchester United on October 28 when he went into the officials' changing room to confront Clattenburg. The referee, who has not taken charge of a game since the incident, said in a statement he hoped ""no referee has to go through this in the future."" A statement on the FA's website read: ""Having considered all of the available evidence it was the opinion of David Waters QC, independent counsel, that the evidence of Ramires was not supported by any other evidence. ""Moreover it was contradicted by other witnesses and does not cross the evidential threshold required to bring a charge against Mark Clattenburg. ""Having considered Counsel's opinion, and in view of all the circumstances of the case, the FA does not believe that there is a case for Mr Clattenburg to answer. ""Equally the FA is satisfied that the allegation against Mark Clattenburg by Ramires was made in good faith. It is entirely possible for a witness to be genuinely mistaken and convincing in his belief."" The head of the Professional Game Match Officials, who organize England's referees, said they would be recording all communication between the referee and players in future. Clattenburg added in a statement: ""To know you were innocent of something but that there was the opportunity for it to wreck your career was truly frightening. ""Racism has no place in football and this experience should not discourage those to speak out if they genuinely believe they are a victim of abuse. ""However, there are processes that should be adhered in order that any investigation can be carried out in a manner that is fair for all parties involved. ""I know first-hand the ramifications of allegations of this nature being placed into the public domain ahead of a formal process and investigation."" Chelsea defended their position in a statement released on their official website. ""With regards to the Mark Clattenburg decision, the club accepts the case is now concluded and notes the FA states the allegation was made in good faith,"" it read. ""Chelsea FC has a duty of care, as do all employers, to act responsibly when such allegations are reported by employees. ""We did not take the decision to lodge a formal complaint with the FA lightly and followed the correct procedures and protocols throughout."" Chelsea confirmed that Mikel would accept the charge against him, but would request a personal hearing. The Clattenburg decision came as interim manager Rafael Benitez took charge of Chelsea training for the first time after the sacking Wednesday of Roberto Di Matteo. The 3-2 defeat to Manchester United, which saw Fernando Torres controversially sent off by Clattenburg, was the start of a poor run which ultimately cost Di Matteo his job with the European champions.","Referee Mark Clattenburg to face no action from FA after complaint of racism by Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Trading of US equities on ""dark pools"" has grown by almost a half in the past three years to account for nearly a third of total market volume, according to research that underscores the challenge facing international regulators. The shift from transparent public exchanges has highlighted growing concern among asset managers and global regulators about off-exchange trading, where prices are reported only after deals are executed. Such venues allow investors to trade large blocks of shares anonymously, with prices posted publicly only after trades are done. They have grown popular with asset managers as they minimise the risk of the market moving against them when executing a large order, or of seeing their order sliced up by high-frequency traders. However authorities in the US, Europe and Australia are considering tighter regulation of such alternative trading venues amid fears that they could further fragment trading and dent the integrity of public markets. A survey by the London-based CFA Institute found that trading of US equities on dark pools had risen 48 per cent since the start of 2009 to account for about 31 per cent of total consolidated volume, as of March. The CFA used data from Nasdaq OMX, as it collates the vast majority of equities trading data in the US. Rhodri Preece, director of capital markets policy at the CFA and author of the report, estimated that there was a similar proportion in Europe. ""The results suggest that dark trading does not harm market quality at its current levels but the gains are not indefinite,"" he said. ""If the majority of order flow is filled away from pre-trade transparent markets, investors could withdraw quotes because of the reduced likelihood of those orders being filled.It would be prudent for authorities to monitor these developments closely,"" he said. The study calculated that about 18 per cent of total volumes of trades were executed on broker-dealers' own trading desks -- a process known in the industry as ""internalisation"". That figure included virtually all retail orders, Mr Preece said. Other block-trading venues, whether independent or bank-owned, accounted for 8-13 per cent of consolidated volume, the CFA said. It called on broker-dealers to provide significant price improvement offer better prices for retail orders that are internalised, or route the order to public exchanges, so it could be executed against the order book. Mr Preece said such moves would help to uphold market integrity. ""It would thus minimise any disincentive to post displayed limit orders and would uphold market integrity,"" said Mr Preece. The CFA called on regulators to monitor the growth in the proportion of dark volume trading and improve the reporting and disclosure around the operations of dark pools. Last week, an annual survey by Tabb Group, the US capital markets consultancy, highlighted growing industry worries about market quality, shrinking commissions and widespread restructuring among broker-dealers.","Trading of US equities on ""dark pools"" has grown by almost a half in three years .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak announced his resignation Monday, saying he will quit politics in January to spend more time with his family. His resignation comes at a highly delicate time for Israel, which is observing a fragile cease-fire with the militant Palestinian group Hamas after an eight-day conflict that killed more than 160 people -- the overwhelming majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.

Barak, who is married and the father of three children, said Monday at a news conference in Tel Aviv that he will continue as defense minister for the next three months, as elections are due in January. He said he won't contest the elections. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee, weighed in on the announcement. ""I hope this signals recognition of the futility of the military approach in the adoption of violence as means of dealing with the Palestinians,"" she said. ""If it is for personal reasons, we cannot comment, but if it's recognition that his whole career was based on the military approach to political life, then this demonstrates the recognition of the futility of militarism and violence."" Some Israeli political commentators had speculated ahead of the announcement that Barak was planning to quit the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new center-left party.

Barak served as defense minister under former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert between 2007 and 2009, and retained the post under Netanyahu from 2009 until the present. He also held the title of deputy prime minister for both administrations.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As Western companies hear the siren call of the Chinese consumer, they better heed the cautionary tale of Barbie. Mattel Inc. spent millions opening a six-story flagship store in Shanghai to great fanfare to bring the doll franchise to China in 2009. Two years later, it closed its doors. ""Barbie spent a lot of money setting up a boutique in the most fashionable part of Shanghai, where you could go and have all of your Barbie needs met. You could have a fashion consultation, you could of course buy lots of Barbie dolls,"" said Karl Gerth, author of ""As China Goes, So Goes the World: How Chinese Consumers Are Transforming Everything."" However, ""they didn't think long and hard enough about whether Chinese girls wanted to look sexy or they wanted to look something closer to what you'd associate with Japan -- cute,"" Gerth added. ""So Hello Kitty is doing well, but Barbie is an example of crash and burn."" It's a lesson in localization rather than grafting tried-and-true Western business plans to the Chinese market, ""On China"" experts told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. As China's ranks of consumers swell -- the number of middle class earners is estimated to grow 70% to 600 million by 2020 -- so too rises the stakes for companies looking to cash into China's growing consumer market. ""It's very important for the Western brands to not simply take an existing strategy or operations and try to take it into Chinese market,"" said Janet Wang, director of international business development for Tmall.com. ""You always have to be very flexible, be reactive to consumers' requirements and demands."" One company that's done it right, Wang said, is Starbucks. ""They really localize their products to fit Chinese consumers' taste -- and not only the coffee itself ... they have pastry dedicated to Chinese flavors, (such as) dedicated products for the Moon Festival,"" said Wang, referring to traditional cuisine during China's Mid-Autumn Festival. ""They are trying to adapt their coffee into a traditional Chinese tea house. And it really blends the West meets East culture."" One area where Western brands have some headway against their domestic Chinese competitors is product safety, in the wake of scandals over tainted baby formula, fake eggs and exploding watermelons. Shaun Rein said his company, China Market Research Group, interviewed 5,000 Chinese consumers in 15 cities last year. ""Their biggest concern in life, ahead of being able to pay education for their kids, or for medical care cost for their families, was food and product safety,"" Rein said. ""They're absolutely petrified of biting something and dying, or getting toxic shock syndrome from a toy. So what we've found is in these 5,000 consumers they trust foreign brands far more than they trust local domestic Chinese brands,"" Rein said. A dichotomy is growing in Chinese consumer trends between shopping for status and shopping for value. ""What that means is, people don't buy mid-level brands, which is why you see (brands?) like Marks & Spencer, or Li-Ning, or Gap kind of struggle, because these are branded for middle-class consumers,"" Rein said. ""What we see is people either shop for the most expensive things they can get, like a Louis Vuitton or Hermes bag, or they go for the cheapest."" Still, there is a growing individualism in consumer tastes -- and a widening gap for new players to enter the market, the experts said. ""So for brand managers, now is the best time to come to China,"" Rein advised. ""Because people are no longer being monopolized by the same five brands. You know, you don't have to have a Omega (watch) any more -- now maybe you can buy something from Richemont.""

Dr. Evan Nadler, who started a program for adolescent surgery at National Children's Hospital in Washington, said he felt ""compelled"" to help Maria. ""Her BMI [body mass index], which is a measurement we use to determine how obese someone is, put her in the highest risk category. Not just morbidly obese but two categories higher than that,"" Nadler said. ""So I felt that withholding a known therapy that works based on her age alone was really almost unethical."" Between 2000 and 2003, some 800 teenagers went under the knife to lose weight, Nadler said. Before she was approved for surgery, Maria had to meet with a nutritionist, a pediatric cardiologist and a psychologist. In the end, Maria was approved for an experimental procedure known as a ""gastrectomy,"" during which about 80 percent of the stomach is removed, including the part of the stomach that controls appetite. Nadler said the procedure ""basically restricts the amount of food that can come into the stomach at any one time and it really makes the patient have a sense of fullness or a lack of hunger."" Maria had the ""gastrectomy"" last month and already has lost about 45 pounds. Today she weighs 400 pounds and is down to a size 32. Maria said she would like one day to be a size 12 but isn't trying to reach a specific weight. ""It's not about the numbers; I want to be at a healthy size,"" she said. ""I want to be able to go into a normal store and buy something and be able to wear it. I want to be able to run. I haven't been able to run since I was 5 years old. I want to be able wear a bathing suit without feeling embarrassed. ""I just want to be normal."" But Dr. Edward Livingston, a Texas surgeon who also has helped adolescents lose weight, said surgery for teenagers can be risky. He has turned away most teens sent to him for evaluation, he said, and has operated only on those more than 500 pounds with serious health risks such as blood clots and congestive heart failure. ""Adults are a different matter because they are more emotionally mature,"" Livingston said. ""They know what risks they want to take and they can buy into the procedure. Kids don't really know what they're getting into, so I think you have to be really careful with children before doing these operations on them."" Livingston noted that only a limited number of studies have been done on weight-loss surgery's effects on teenagers later in life. ""We don't really know the full spectrum of positive or negative outcomes for the procedures,"" he said. Nadler, who operated on Maria, said he fully agrees that ""we need to study this more. But I don't think it's fair to the Marias of the world to keep them from having this procedure based on their age alone."" In his own study, Nadler followed 41 teenagers for two years after weight-loss surgery. He said they lost half their excess body weight and their health had improved. Maria said she was well aware of the risks of surgery, but after trying about a dozen different diets, she said, surgery was her only option. Now, she said, she is well on her way to becoming a healthy teen and adult. She works out playing the Wii video game and walks every day with her brother after school. She is eating a high-protein diet. ""This surgery is a tool in your tool box to becoming healthy,"" she said. ""It is not the quick fix. You need a lot more. You need to exercise you need to make the right food choices."" In a letter to the insurance company seeking coverage for this procedure, Maria wrote she needed this surgery to make it to her 15th birthday. She said, ""Doctors have told me for years that if I keep gaining weight I'm not going to see 18 and that has terrified me. I want to live. I want to do so many things.""","Maria Caprigno underwent weight-loss surgery at age 14 .

"(CNN) -- A judge, who was suspended after an online video showing him beating his teenage daughter went viral, was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court. Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said. The state's Commission on Judicial Conduct earlier ruled that Adams would receive a public warning for the incident, which cleared the way for the suspension to be lifted. The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter. ""My first feeling is extreme sadness,"" said Hallie Adams, the former wife. ""I feel sad for the public. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing."" Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset. ""I'm embarrassed to live in Texas,"" said the girl who was the buzz on the Internet last year after releasing the beating video. Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public. It showed him beating his then-16-year-old daughter because she downloaded online music and games. The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet ""to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time,"" Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father. ""It was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" she said last November. ""It wasn't any huge happening or anything."" She said she told her father she had the video, ""and he didn't seem to think anything of it, and basically dared me to post it."" The video posting said, ""Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His 'judgment' is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter."" The 7 1/2-minute video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, ""What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal."" At another point, he yells at her, ""You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?"" William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him. As a judge, William Adams handles misdemeanor cases, including family-related and juvenile court issues.","The judge is back to work, a clerk says .

"(CNN) -- A woman convicted of murder in the 2011 deaths of four children in a fire at her Houston day care center was sentenced Tuesday morning to 80 years in prison. Jessica Tata also was ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. She was silent as a judge read the sentence, which came from a jury but was confirmed by the judge. She declined an opportunity to speak at the sentencing, which took place in a Houston courtroom. Prosecutors said Tata's carelessness led to the February 2011 fire that killed the four children and injured three others at her home day care. She was convicted of felony murder last week. Tata, then 22, left seven children unsupervised at her home day care while a pan of oil was on an activated stove, authorities said. The home was on fire when she returned, authorities said. After the fire, Tata fled to Nigeria, and the U.S. Marshals Service named her one of its most wanted fugitives. She was arrested in Nigeria in March 2011 and brought back to the United States. The Marshals Service said it worked ""with international investigative resources in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, to bring Tata to justice.""","Jessica Tata was convicted of murder in the 2011 deaths of four kids at her day care .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan spurned the chance to close the gap on Italian league leaders Juventus after they had to rely on a late own goal to salvage a point at home to Cagliari. Andrea Stramaccioni's side could have pulled to within three points of the Serie A champions had they beaten Cagliari but despite taking the lead they were thankful to Davide Astori for putting through his own net with eight minutes remaining. Rodrigo Palacio had given Inter the lead after just ten minutes when he nodded home a cross from Antonio Cassano. But just before halftime Italian striker Marco Sau grabbed the first of his two goals when he fired Andrea Cossu's cross into the bottom corner. Inter's Argentinean forward Diego Miltio squandered a glorious chance to restore Inter's lead when he hit Yuto Nagatomo's pass over the bar from six yards with the goal gaping. It was to prove a costly miss as Sau got his second on 66 minutes, turning home the loose ball after Mauricio Pinilla's overhead kick cannoned back off the upright. But Cagliari couldn't hold on for their first league win at the San Siro since 1995 as Astori fired into his own net when attempting to clear a cross. Stramaccioni was sent to the stands for his complaints after the referee turned down a penalty appeal as Andrea Ranocchia was fouled but despite intense pressure in the closing minutes Inter couldn't find a winner. Elsewhere, two goals from Alberto Aquilani helped Fiorentina to a 4-1 victory over Atalanta as they moved into third while Udinese and Parma drew 2-2. Francesco Valiani's goal helped Siena beat US Pescara 1-0, Bologna thrashed Palermo 3-0 and Catania beat Chievo Verona 3-1. Sunderland grabbed only their second victory of the season in the English Premier League as they got the better of 10-man Fulham at Craven Cottage. The match turned on the first half dismissal of Fulham's Norwegian defender Brede Hangeland who was shown a straight red for a lunging tackle on Lee Cattermole. Sunderland, who had scored just seven goals in their opening ten games took the lead through Scotland striker Steven Fletcher after he ran on to a pinpoint ball from former Manchester City winger Adam Johnson. Fulham drew level when substitute Mladen Petric fired home from close range but Carlos Cuellar restored Sunderland's lead almost immediately, before Stephane Sessegnon completed the scoring with a superb shot from range. In Spain, 10-man Atletico Madrid beat lowly Granada 1-0 to go second in the table behind leaders Barcelona. Turkish international Arda Turan got the winner before Mario Suarez was sent off. Levante moved up to fourth after a 2-0 away win at Deportivo La Coruna despite having Pedro Lopez sent off. Sevilla thrashed Real Betis 5-1 in their derby clash as Jose Antonio Reyes and Federico Fazio both grabbed two goals. Celta Vigo drew 1-1 with Mallorca while Getafe beat Valladolid 2-1. In Germany, Werder Bremen moved up to seventh in the Bundesliga with a 2-1 victory over Fortuna Dusseldorf, Kevin De Bruyne grabbing the winner eight minutes from time. Wolfsburg moved away from the relegation zone and above opponents TSG Hoffenheim as they won 3-1 thanks to goals from Makoto Hasebe, Bas Dost and Naldo. Meanwhile Lyon moved top of Ligue 1 in France, capitalizing on Paris Saint-Germain's shock defeat to Rennes on Saturday, as they defeated Reims. Anthony Weber's own goal set them on their way before second half goals from Bafetimbi Gomis and Lisandro Lopez added gloss. Bordeaux moved up to second after Yoann Gouffran's winner helped them beat Marseille 1-0. Dario Cvitanich's goal secured a 1-0 win for Nice in their mid-table clash with Toulouse.","Inter Milan miss the opportunity to close the gap on Serie A leaders Juventus .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Police Department has arrested a man in the shooting deaths of three New York City shopkeepers, according to Commissioner Raymond Kelly. Salvatore E. Perrone, 63, was arrested after ballistics tests showed the .22-caliber rifle found in his duffel bag was the same one used in the three crime scenes, Kelly said. Detectives recovered the duffel bag from the house of Perrone's girlfriend on Wednesday morning and found the carbine with a sawed-off stock and a combination laser/flashlight attached to its barrel with duct tape and two thick, pink rubber bands. They also recovered a box of .22-caliber long-rifle ammunition, an empty magazine and a 12-inch kitchen knife with dried blood on it as well as two Buck folding knives, each with 7-inch blades. Perrone is charged with three counts of murder and faces life in prison if convicted. Police said the .22-caliber rifle was used to kill Vahidipour Rahmatollah, 78, at his She-She boutique on November 16; Isaac Kadare, 59, at Amazing 99-Cent Deals on August 2; and Mohamed Gebeli, 65, on July 6 at Valentino Fashion in Brooklyn. Kelly didn't provide a motive for the murders. ""I think it's reasonable to assume that he was going to continue doing this and by arresting him, we have saved lives,"" said Kelly. Perrone was an independent seller of men's and women's clothing to boutiques in Brooklyn, said Kelly. ""After his photograph was circulated, we received several calls from proprietors of similar stores to inform us that they recognized Perrone as a salesman who would periodically visit their stores,"" he said. He was spotted at a pharmacy in Brooklyn on Tuesday evening and voluntarily agreed to come to the precinct. In 2001, Perrone was also arrested in Franconia Township, Pennsylvania, on a forcible entry charge. He has a house on Staten Island but has been residing with his girlfriend in Brooklyn for the past several years, police said. It was not immediately clear whether Perrone had any legal representation. Police: One shooter may be behind 3 killings . Etan Patz suspect falsely confessed, attorney says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber dragged his date on stage with him to accept the American Music Awards artist of the year honor Sunday night. It was his mom. ""I want to thank you for just always believing in me,"" the 18-year-old singer said, looking into the eyes of his mother, Pattie Mallette. Bieber was the biggest winner at the 40th annual American Music Awards, winning artist of the year, favorite pop/rock artist and favorite pop/rock album. Carly Rae Jepsen, who won new artist of the year, introduced Bieber as the ""current generation's biggest superstar."" Bieber used one of his acceptance speeches to address ""all the haters who thought that, you know, that maybe I was just here for one or two years."" ""I feel like I'm going to be here for a very long time,"" he said. Missing from the three-hour show in Los Angeles' Nokia Theater was its originator Dick Clark, who was remembered in a musical tribute performed by Stevie Wonder. Clark, known as ""America's oldest teenager"" died April 18 at the age of 82. ""This show, on its 40th anniversary, still reflects Dick's original vision,"" host Ryan Seacrest, a Clark protÃ©gÃ©, told the audience. ""Bring the top artists on the planet together on an equal stage and then let the music speak for itself."" It was, perhaps, that inspiration that produced one of the show's most energetic moments: South Korean rapper Psy's collaboration with MC Hammer in a dance medley to a mash-up of Psy's online viral hit ""Gangnam Style"" and Hammer's 1991 sensation ""Too Legit to Quit."" ""That was so awesome,"" Psy told CNN backstage after the show. ""We experienced miracle tonight."" Hammer, who triggered a dance craze in the early 1990s, said he and Psy are ""kindred spirits"" and they may work together again. ""He's got the whole world dancing,"" he said, comparing Psy to James Brown, Michael Jackson and himself. Nicki Minaj, who performed twice, walked away with two honors, including favorite rap/hip hop artist and favorite rap/hip hop album. ""Man, I been did dat,"" Minaj said as she accepted the artist award, referencing her win in the same category last year. ""Man, I been popped out."" Carrie Underwood's ""Blown Away"" was chosen favorite country album. All four albums Underwood has released have won the honor. ""I couldn't love my life anymore than I do right now,"" she said. Luke Bryan, who won favorite country male artist, used his first AMA acceptance speech to thank his sons ""Tater Bug and Bobo."" Taylor Swift won favorite country music female artist, her 11th AMA trophy. Electronic dance music, known as EDM, was added as a category this year. The first award was bestowed on David Guetta. Other winners included Katy Perry for favorite pop/rock female artist; Maroon 5 for favorite pop/rock band, duo or group; Lady Antebellum for favorite country music band, duo or group; Usher for favorite soul/R&B male artist; Beyonce for favorite soul/R&B female artist; Rihanna for favorite soul/R&B album; Linkin Park for favorite alternative rock artist; Adele for favorite adult contemporary artist; Shakira for favorite latin music artist; and tobyMac for favorite contemporary inspirational artist.

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers in Uganda are preparing to vote on a new anti-homosexuality bill that proposes tough jail sentences for consensual same-sex behavior. Homosexual acts are already illegal in the east African nation, where most gays and lesbians face physical attacks and are treated as social outcasts, but the new bill proposes harsher penalties. Uganda's maximum penalty would be life in prison. Amnesty International said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the bill and called on the Ugandan parliament not to pass it. ""The bill would have lasting, harmful effects on Ugandans who are thought to breach its far-reaching provisions and it would significantly hamper the work of human rights defenders and public health professionals,"" the rights group said. ""Although Amnesty International has been informed that some provisions of the bill have been amended, the content of these amendments have not been made publicly available. ""This bill violates the principle of nondiscrimination as guaranteed under international and regional treaties to which Uganda is a party."" ""We are outraged,"" said Noel Kututwa, the rights group's director for southern Africa. ""This goes beyond the principle of nondiscrimination. It goes against the principle of privacy of individuals. And sexual orientation is really a question of the right of an individual to choose how they want to live their lives."" Uganda's parliamentary speaker has reportedly said she wants the legislation to pass before Christmas. World leaders condemned the anti-gay legislation when it was first proposed in 2009. Some nations have also threatened to withhold aid to Uganda over its record on same-sex rights. Prominent gay rights activist David Kato was beaten to death in the country in 2011, a slaying that rights activists believe was motivated by homophobia. A British producer was also briefly jailed in Uganda in September this year for staging without permission a play about the challenges facing homosexuals in the African nation. If convicted, David Cecil could be imprisoned for two years, his lawyer said. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. The death penalty can be imposed in a handful of nations worldwide for consensual same-sex relations, including Nigeria, Sudan, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.

"(CNN) -- Seeing more mustaches this month? Many of them may be fighting cancer. On November 1, global health charity Movember kicked off its signature event, a monthlong campaign encouraging participants to grow mustaches (or ""mo""s) to raise cancer-fighting awareness and funds. Why I'm growing the 'stache . According to Adam Garone, Movember's CEO and co-founder, there are already more than 700,000 registered participants this year, and he expects to break 1 million -- a record for the organization. That's quite the growth for a project that started with 30 guys in Australia in 2003. It was a social experiment back then, Garone said, with a simple goal: ""It was really just for fun. We wanted to bring back the mustache."" But people quickly caught on, and it began generating a ""surprising amount"" of conversation, Garone said. The following year, four of the original 30 got together and decided to do it all over again -- for a cause. With a little research, they discovered that prostate cancer was a major health concern for men and decided it could benefit from an open, ongoing conversation. Unlike breast cancer, which has been supported by major educational and fund-raising campaigns for years, prostate cancer hadn't been spotlighted in a substantial way. ""Growing a mustache is a very manly pursuit,"" Garone said, so the group chose prostate cancer as its primary cause, with men using their mustaches, and faces, as billboards. That year, 450 guys participated, raising $43,000. Last year, 855,203 people participated around the world, raising $126.3 million. The funds go directly to Movember and its partners, the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the Livestrong Foundation. The organization's strategy is simple: Keep people talking -- about mustaches, and the larger issue of men's health. Research last year showed that participants have, on average, 2,400 Movember-related conversations a month, Garone said. About 30 are face to face. Social media causes that message to amplify, he said. Users have taken to Facebook pages and Twitter accounts to document their individual, ongoing facial hair activism. It isn't just one person asking another, ""Why the mustache?"" The answer spreads to 100 -- or 1,000. ""The conversations do lead to a greater understanding,"" Garone said. Movember encourages both men and women (nicknamed ""Mo Sistas"") to participate throughout the month by registering through Movember.com. The website has evolved an elaborate internal slang, including terms such as ""Mo Mentor"" and ""Gala PartÃ©,"" which is what participants call their end-of-the-month celebrations, and it has information on everything from grooming tips to health risks. The rules are simple: Don't start with any facial hair and end with a lot. Garone's been asked before: Why a mustache, not a goatee or beard? ""It is a mustache,'"" he said. ""And it's a mustache for a reason.""","Movember encourages men to grow mustaches to raise cancer awareness .

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy caused $29.4 billion in damages in New Jersey, one of the hardest hit states, said Gov. Chris Christie. The preliminary estimate, which is subject to change, includes damage to personal property, businesses, infrastructure and to the state's tourism industry. The figure also includes aid from federal sources like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration. ""This preliminary number is based on the best available data, field observations and geographical mapping, and supported by expert advice from my Cabinet commissioners and an outside consulting company,"" Christie said in a statement Friday. ""In a short period of time, we put together a comprehensive and responsible estimate, which may increase in the weeks ahead, and I stand ready to work with our Congressional delegation and the Obama Administration to get the funding support New Jersey expects and deserves in the aftermath of this catastrophe,"" he added. Meanwhile, odd-even gas rationing ended early Saturday in New York City, a milestone as the city continues to recover from Sandy, which hit more than three weeks ago. Rationing began on November 9 to keep escalating lines and chaos at the gas stations manageable after the storm left many stations closed just as people without power needed fuel for generators. The city extended the rationing system through Thanksgiving so the lines would remain manageable during the heaviest travel days of the year. Volunteers help Sandy victims start over . ""With more than 85% of gas stations now operating -- a substantial increase from just 25% two weeks ago -- and Thanksgiving and Black Friday behind us, the odd-even license plate system will be rescinded starting tomorrow morning,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced on Friday. Over Thanksgiving, the mayor's office distributed thousands of Thanksgiving meals at 30 sites in the areas affected by Sandy. Since the storm recovery began, the city and FEMA have distributed more than 2.7 million meals, 704,260 bottles of water and 170,856 blankets, along with thousands of other supplies that are helping people survive after their belongings were washed away and destroyed in the storm, according to the mayor's office. Despite the progress, the recovery is far from complete. More than 30,000 people remain without power in New York and New Jersey. Many of those people are also without heat. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy . The NYC Health Department said Friday that it will start distributing electric blankets to people who were affected by Sandy, but also urged those people to try to find a warm place with friends or relatives. ""The weather is getting colder and winter is not far off,"" said Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley. ""Living in cold buildings is not good for your health. If your building heat is not going to be restored very soon, look for another warm place to live until it is,"" he said. The traffic pattern in and out of the city is almost restored. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that signal problems that prevented some of the traffic lanes to be open at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel are fixed in time for the post-holiday rush hour commute on Monday morning. The tunnel connects the island of Manhattan to Long Island and Queens. So far, sanitation crews have collected more than 280,000 tons of trash and debris from the storm, officials said. Bloomberg has authorized $1.2 billion for cleanup and damage repairs to homes, public schools, public hospitals and city property. Bloomberg's office also said that donors from around the country have contributed nearly $41 million toward Hurricane Sandy relief.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If there's been one consistent thread running through the U.S. economic story since 2008, it's been the steady drumbeat of gloom. Outright recession or sub-standard growth, stubbornly high unemployment and fiscal crises have been the topics du jour when it comes to the world's biggest economy. But now an unlikely champion for U.S. growth under the Obama administration has emerged -- a former adviser to a Republican Party presidential candidate and Harvard history professor, Niall Ferguson, who says America could actually be heading toward a new economic ""golden age."" And it has nothing to do with Washington and everything to do with energy. Ferguson, who is also an author and commentator, believes the production of natural gas and oil from shale formations via a process known as ""fracking"" -- forcing open rocks by injecting fluid into cracks -- will be a game changer. ""This is an absolutely huge phenomenon with massive implications for the U.S. economy, and I think most people are still a little bit slow to appreciate just how big this is,"" he said in Hong Kong this week. ""Conceivably it does mean a new golden age."" U.S. energy production has been booming in recent years. The International Energy Agency made a jaw-dropping forecast two weeks ago that the U.S. would pass Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer by the end of this decade -- and would achieve near energy independence by the 2030s. That energy boom, asserts Ferguson, will create jobs in the United States. Lots of jobs. The energy sector currently supports 1.7 million American jobs directly or indirectly, according to economic forecaster IHS global Insight. That could rise to 3 million by 2020, it says. ""It's not only in the extraction industry and infrastructure, but more importantly cheap energy is going to create employment in manufacturing. I think you'll see a renaissance in manufacturing,"" said Ferguson. ""That is being helped by the fact U.S. labor costs have been pretty competitive over the past decade, even as labor costs are going up in China."" Alaska drilling: From 'hell no!' to... 'OK"" It is also, he says, a big deal for the dollar. ""As the U.S. moves towards energy independence and becoming the biggest producer in the world, the dollar can only benefit. Anybody who thought the financial crisis was going to lead to the demise of the dollar as an international currency is wrong -- it's quite the opposite."" And what of U.S. engagement in the Middle East? Ferguson says it would be naive to assume that Washington would withdraw in any significant way from the region. ""Nobody is going to step in and take the job of being global policeman in charge of Middle Eastern stability. I think everyone would be nervous, if the Chinese suddenly volunteered to take that job on, which by the way they are not going to do anytime soon,"" he said. Protesters: Jobs not worth the environmental risk . For the recently reelected U.S. president though, the energy boom looks like it could provide a welcome tailwind for his second term. It's something that Ferguson acknowledges -- though one suspects through gritted teeth. As a supporter of Mitt Romney he penned a controversial pre-election cover story in Newsweek headlined ""Hit the Road, Barack,"" which was highly critical of the president's first term. He concedes the irony that the president will now be the beneficiary of the ""good times that lie ahead.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China has complained to the United States about the sale of advanced Patriot air defense missiles to Taiwan, which Beijing does not consider an independent legitimate state. The sale of the missiles by Lockheed Martin, announced Wednesday in Washington, will undermine Sino-U.S. cooperation and will have severe consequences, China said. ""China firmly opposes and is strongly dissatisfied with arms sales to Taiwan by the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said in a statement published Thursday by the state-run Xinhua news agency. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said the United States reserves the right to sell arms to Taiwan. ""We do make available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act, and we will continue to do that,"" Crowley said at a Thursday news briefing in Washington. The missiles are part of a $968.7 million contract awarded to Lockheed Martin on December 30. The sale completes a broad $6.5-billion arms package approved under former President George W. Bush in late 2008, the government-run China Daily newspaper said. Jin Canrong, deputy dean of the International Studies School at Renmin University of China, told China Daily that Beijing is nearly certain to retaliate against the United States if the deal is consummated. ""It is likely to freeze military exchanges. It will make the U.S. very uncomfortable because of all the world's strategic military powers, the U.S. is most eager to learn about the [People's Liberation Army],"" Jin is quoted as saying. Rear-Admiral Yang Yi of the Institute of Strategic Studies of the National Defense University was quoted as saying China needs to sanction the U.S. arms companies behind the deal. ""When it comes to a question of principles, we should never make concessions,"" he said. Some U.S. companies that sell weapons to Taiwan also want to sell aircraft and other goods to China, added Yang, without naming any firms. ""Why don't we take defensive countermeasures against them?"" he asked. ""Apart from just protesting to the U.S. government, why don't we impose sanctions on these troublemakers?"" The government in Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China until a Communist insurrection proved victorious in 1949. With the Communist takeover of mainland China, the losing faction fled to the island of Taiwan . Taiwan is formally known as the Republic of China, while Communist China's official name is People's Republic of China. Many Western nations and the United Nations recognized Taiwan as the legitimate Chinese government until 1971. China considers Taiwan as a breakaway province and does not recognize it as a sovereign nation.","China: Sale of the missiles by Lockheed Martin will undermine Sino-U.S. cooperation .

"(CNN) -- International credit rating agency Moody's announced Monday it has once again downgraded Greek's sovereign debt rating - just four days after European leaders agreed on a second bailout for the debt-strapped nation. A default on Greek debt instruments was near to certain, Moody's said in an announcement published to its website Monday. But EU bailouts to Greece will likely help the country to stabilize down the road and prevent a default domino effect in the Eurozone, Moody's added. ""Moody's Investors Service has today downgraded Greece's local- and foreign-currency bond ratings to Ca from Caa1,"" Moody's said, calling the probability of a default on Greek government bonds ""virtually 100%."" The agency based the default assessment on the ""announced EU program"" and a statement on debt reassignment by the Institute of International Finance (IFF), which represents financial institutions. The IFF has indicated that private creditors holding Greek debt instruments would likely take losses over 20%, Moody's said. Under debt reassignment, holders of current bonds would receive new ones in their place. The lower market value of the replacement bonds would account for the investor losses. The EU bailout to Greece protected all countries holding Europe's common currency the euro, Moody's said, by ""containing the severe near-term contagion risk that would likely have followed a disorderly payment default or large haircut on existing Greek debt."" A ""haircut"" is slang for repaying bondholders less than they were promised when they bought the bonds. European leaders agreed on Thursday to provide a second bailout package for Greece and drastically expand rescue funds to prevent financial crisis spreading through the eurozone. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said the rescue deal would be financed by both the EU and the International Monetary Fund. European governments and the IMF will contribute a total of 109 billion euros (about $157 billion). The private sector's share will amount to 49.6 billion euros (about $71 billion). But other weaker European economies such as Italy and Spain -- seen as too big to bail out -- could falter, tearing apart the eurozone, and hurting other nations exposed to the debt take. Greece has been forced to impose harsh austerity measures, provoking violent scenes of protest, in an attempt to cut its debts. Taxes have been raised and public sector jobs cut. It is also selling off numerous assets. CNN's Ben Brumfield and CNNMoney's Ben Rooney contributed to this report.","Moody's downgrades Greek government bonds from Ca to Caa1 .

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- The former personal assistant of Adam Clayton of the Irish rock band U2 was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison for stealing 2.8 million euros (about $3.45 million) of Clayton's money. Carol Hawkins, 49, was convicted last week of 181 counts of theft from Clayton's bank accounts over a four-year period while she worked for him. The jury at the Circuit Criminal Court in Dublin was told that Hawkins embezzled the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, including luxury holidays, cars, shopping at designer boutiques in New York and buying 22 horses. In the sentencing, Judge Patrick McCartan said that ""these were crimes rooted in greed and nothing else."" ""Nothing, frankly, could explain away the scale of this dishonesty other than the greed in pursuit of a lavish lifestyle that was no responsibility of Mr. Clayton's,"" the judge said. The judge also ordered that the proceeds of a sale of an apartment in New York bought by Hawkins be handed over to Clayton. Clayton -- the bass guitarist with U2 -- wasn't in court for sentencing but had given evidence for the prosecution during the case. Hawkins, who is originally from England but lives in Dublin, has insisted on her innocence. The court was told that the mother of two had gained the musician's ""absolute trust"" during the 17 years she worked for him. However, her deception emerged in 2008 when she confessed to booking herself flights worth almost $19,000 on his account to visit her children in the United States and London. Jurors were told that Hawkins was a signatory on two of Clayton's bank accounts and wrote 181 checks to deposit into her own accounts. She was originally employed as a housekeeper for Clayton in 1992 but her duties eventually evolved to include helping to take care of Clayton's accounts. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Carol Hawkins, 49, was the personal assistant to U2's Adam Clayton .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Old-fashioned detective work has unraveled a complicated but flawed scheme to extort an Australian family by strapping a fake bomb to an 18-year-old woman, court documents reveal. The documents were filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, Kentucky, because the suspect was arrested near there Monday after allegedly leaving Australia last week. Arrest in baffling collar-bomb case . Surveillance video, a memory stick and Internet records helped officials track down Paul Douglas Peters, 50, according to the complaint for provisional arrest. Australian police plan to seek charges against Peters that include kidnapping, aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offense, and demanding property by force with intent to steal, according to the complaint. They are expected to ask for his extradition. Authorities in Australia and the United States linked Peters to the case through files in a USB thumb drive that was attached to the fake bomb placed around the neck of the 18-year-old daughter of the targeted family, according to the complaint filed on behalf of Australian authorities. On August 3, Peters allegedly broke into a home in Mosman, Australia, wearing a mask and carrying a baseball bat that he purchased using his own credit card, the complaint says. He allegedly looped a black box around the young woman's neck, claiming in an accompanying note that it contained ""powerful new technology plastic explosives,"" according to the complaint. He instructed the family to contact an e-mail address for further instructions. Authorities were able to determine the e-mail account was created May 30 at a Chicago airport, when Peters was traveling there. It was accessed only three times, all in the hours following the break-in, police said. One access occurred at a library in Kincumber, Australia; the other two were at a business in Avoca Beach, Australia. Each of the log-ins coincides with the video-recorded arrival of a man resembling Peters at the library and near a video store where the account was accessed, according to the complaint. The USB drive draped around the victim's neck also contained a file that had been created on a computer named ""Paul P,"" according to the complaint. Analysis of the memory stick showed an undeleted PDF file that contained ""an exact replica of the demand letter that was left"" with the young woman, it said. Deleted files included letters of demand and references to explosive devices and demands for money, the complaint alleges. The documents were signed off with the suspect e-mail account. Video showed a silver Range Rover parked near the library at the time of the incident. Police learned it was made between 1996 and 2001, according to the complaint. A search of Ranger Rovers on record in the area led police to Peters' address, according to the complaint. The investment banker left the country August 8 for Chicago and subsequently traveled to Louisville the next day, the complaint states. On Thursday, an FBI agent spotted Peters in the back yard of his former wife's residence in Buckner, Kentucky, and arrest warrants were issued by Australian authorities on Friday and Saturday. The complaint says that ""police have obtained information that Paul Douglas Peters was formerly employed by a company with which the victim's family has links.""","U.S. District Court documents reveal new details in collar-bomb case .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The commemoration of Ashura, arguably the holiest day on the Shiite Muslim calendar, passed without significant violence in Iraq Sunday. The peace was a marked contrast to the last eight years in which hundreds of people died in sectarian attacks. The period commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D.. His death was one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. Iraqi troops and police were deployed in the streets of Baghdad and Karbala, a holy Shiite city where 2 million Shiite pilgrims from across Iraq converged for the festival over the weekend. No attacks against Shiite pilgrims were reported in Baghdad and Karbala in the last several days, police officials in both cities told CNN. Abut 30,000 security members from the army and police were on duty in and around Karbala, establishing four rings of security around the holy shrine of Imam Hussein. More than 200 female security workers were placed at checkpoints to search women passing through, Karbala police said. Pilgrims chanted, beat their breasts in penance, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whipped themselves in synchronized movements from Saturday through Sunday morning. Most people in Iraq are Shiites, and the commemoration of Ashura was almost banned under Saddam Hussein, a Sunni. The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni extremists. In 2005 nearly a thousand Shiite pilgrims died in a stampede over a Baghdad bridge triggered by a rumor that a suicide bomber was among them. Shiites gained the upper hand politically after Hussein was overthrown by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Sunnis felt disenfranchised amid that political backdrop, and many backed insurgent actions against the government. As a result, Sunni-Shiite violence exploded in the early 2000s. While full-blown sectarian violence had ebbed by the end of the Iraq War, Sunni extremists continued to launch attacks against Shiite pilgrims over the years. Paris Hilton stirs up a storm in Mecca .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan boss Jose Mourinho insists he should not have been sacked by Chelsea, stoking the tension ahead of Tuesday night's Champions League last-16 tie in London. Italian champions Inter hold a 2-1 lead after winning the first leg in the San Siro, with Mourinho making an emotional return to the club where he is still adored by fans after winning two English Premier League titles despite his acrimonious departure in 2007. The Portuguese coach was axed by Chelsea's billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich just two months into the season following a disappointing 1-1 draw with Norwegian club Rosenborg in the Champions League. He led Inter to the Serie A title in his first year in charge and the Nerazzuri top the Italian table again this season, though their lead has been cut to one point following Friday's shock defeat by Catania. Blog: Real Madrid need Mourinho's magic . Chelsea, meanwhile, have won only the English FA Cup since his departure, with his replacement Avram Grant and then Luiz Felipe Scolari being sacked before current manager Carlo Ancelotti took over from interim boss Guus Hiddink in July 2009. ""I feel sorry but I look forward. I feel sorry because, when I look at the big four teams while I was in England, [their managers] are all there,"" Mourinho told reporters on Monday. ""Sir Alex Ferguson is here. Arsene Wenger is here. Rafa Benitez is here. I did more than enough to be here. But the decision was made. ""Chelsea looked forward. I look forward. They move on. I move on. I keep winning important things. They keep winning... something. They won an FA Cup. ""The most important thing is the relation we have. No regrets, no big problems. Just respect. In football, coming back to an old team, it's important to feel like I feel. It's one of the most beautiful things in football. They move on, I move on."" However, the 47-year-old admitted having one regret about his time at Stamford Bridge -- he would have preferred to leave on his own terms after winning the FA Cup in May 2007. ""I would have left the day after the FA Cup final after my third season. The timing was wrong. I waited three or four more months more and, after that, I left in September and I didn't enjoy my time from then to the day I went to Inter,"" he said. ""For me, being away from football is too painful. If I had left Chelsea in May, I would have started the next season in a new club and I would not have been without football for six or seven months."" Mourinho, who won the Champions League in 2004 before joining Chelsea, said he still wishes to return to England in the future. ""I have, as I said before, three things to do in my career. One is to come back to English football, another thing is to win the Spanish championship, because no-one has won Italian, English and Spanish titles. And another one, when I'm old, is to coach my national team. But, for now, I would like to keep winning with Inter."" Mourinho has had a difficult relationship with the Italian media since taking over from Roberto Mancini, now manager of English club Manchester City, and he has now come under more pressure following his latest falling-out with young striker Mario Balotelli. The 19-year-old, who was dropped by Mourinho for a month last season for reportedly not training hard enough, did not make the trip to England after missing the Catania game. Media reports claimed that the highly-rated Balotelli argued with Mourinho following a below-par performance in the previous game against Genoa, a 0-0 draw, claiming that he was ill. ""I don't want to talk about him,"" Mourinho said. ""He won't be here. He won't be at the match. ""I can explain whey I called up the other 20 players. It's more important to talk about the players who will be there, not those that are not."" Spanish club Sevilla host CSKA Moscow in Tuesday night's other Champions League match.

"(CNN) -- A wonder goal from French international Philippe Mexes helped seven-time winners AC Milan into the last 16 of the European Champions League with a 3-1 win at 10-man Anderlecht Wednesday. With an effort reminiscent of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's incredible goal for Sweden against England earlier this month, Mexes scored with an acrobatic bicycle kick to put Milan 2-0 ahead in a vital game. Anderlecht conceded a 70th minute free kick after Bram Nuytinck was shown red for bringing down Alexandre Pato as he burst clear. Ricardo Montolivo took the kick to set up Mexes to control the ball on his chest before unleashing his strike from outside the penalty area and into the home goal. With Group C winners Malaga held 2-2 at Zenit St Petersburg earlier in the day, both teams sought three points to seal the runners-up spot. Stephan El Shaarawy put the Serie A side ahead just after half time before Mexes added his stunning effort. Tom De Sutter pulled one back for the Belgian side, but Milan had Pato to thank for a late third to seal the victory. In the formidable Group D, Manchester City exited the competition as they were held to a 1-1 home draw by 10-man Real Madrid. It is the second successive year the English Premier League champions have failed to progress from the group stages and with a round of matches still remaining. Borussia Dortmund have won the group after their 4-1 drubbing of Ajax Amsterdam, with Real advancing to the last 16 in second place. Real went ahead through Karim Benzema in the ninth minute, allowed time and space by City defender Maicon to convert an Angel Di Maria cross. Jose Mourinho's men had ample opportunities to make the game safe, with Cristiano Ronaldo wasting the best chance. The home side improved in the second half and were rewarded for their efforts when Alvaro Arbeloa clumsily pulled down Sergio Aguero to concede a penalty and earn his marching orders for a second yellow card. Aguero converted from the spot in the 73rd minute, but Roberto Mancini's side could not press home the advantage of an extra man. German champions Dortmund continued their impressive form in Amsterdam with Marco Reus putting them ahead early against their Dutch counterparts. Mario Goetze capped a fine display with the second goal while Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scored either side of half-time. Striker Danny Hoesen grabbed a late consolation for the hosts who are still battling Manchester City for the Europa League spot for third place in the group in the final round of games. In Group B, Schalke and Arsenal booked their passage to the knockout stages with home victories over Olympiakos and Montpellier. Royal Blues Schalke needed a late strike from Christian Fuchs to seal their 1-0 win and stay one point clear of the EPL side at the top of the section. Arsenal beat the French champions 2-0 with Jack Wilshere, returning to his best form after injury, setting them on their way just after half time. German international Lukas Podolski fired a magnificent second goal for the Gunners on 63 minutes. Big-spending Paris Saint Germain qualified for the group stages for the second time with a 2-0 win at Dynamo Kiev. Ezekiel Lavezzi scored both goals for PSG, who are still pressing Porto for top spot in Group A.

"(CNN) -- Bloggers in Myanmar, Iran and Syria work under some of the most repressive conditions in the world, facing tactics such as regulation, intimidation and even imprisonment, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. The organization released a list of the ""10 worst countries to be a blogger"" to call attention to online oppression in connection with World Press Freedom Day, which was observed Sunday. ""Bloggers are at the vanguard of the information revolution, and their numbers are expanding rapidly,"" the group's executive director, Joel Simon, said in a report posted on the organization's Web site. ""But governments are quickly learning how to turn technology against bloggers by censoring and filtering the Internet, restricting online access and mining personal data. ""When all else fails, the authorities simply jail a few bloggers to intimidate the rest of the online community into silence or self-censorship."" Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- is the worst place in the world to be a blogger, Simon's organization says. A military government restricts Web access and throws people into jail for posting critical material. Burmese authorities have the capability to monitor e-mail and other communication methods and can block users from viewing the Web sites of political opposition parties, the organization says, citing research group OpenNet Initiative. One Burmese blogger, Maung Thura, is serving a 59-year prison term for circulating video footage after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Committee to Protect Journalists says. Number two on the list is Iran, whose authorities, the group says, regularly detain and harass bloggers who dare to criticize religious or political figures, the Islamic revolution or its symbols.

Its government now holds in jail 21 writers who led online journalism in the early part of the decade, the organization says.

"(CNN) -- Carlos Acosta is the ballet dancer who breaks all the rules. Perhaps the most famous dancer of his generation, his is a career that wasn't meant to be -- a tough kid from the backstreets of Havana who was forced to study ballet and became a reluctant star. Carlos Acosta: ""Ballet was my best friend."" His combination of talent, dedication and charisma have made him principal guest artist with the Paris Ballet, the Russian Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London. Acosta is that rarest of things -- a ballet dancer who has pirouetted into the public consciousness. But success has its price. His career has taken him away from his beloved Cuba and Acosta's story is one of displacement and a sense of longing for his family and homeland. ""My heart is in Havana,"" he told CNN. ""When I'm there I can get close to the life that I don't have anymore because of my career."" Acosta was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1973. The youngest of 11 children, his early passions were football and breakdancing, but in a country with a proud ballet tradition, his lorry-driver father decided that the discipline of ballet school would keep young Carlos out of trouble, hoping that dance might one day provide his son with a way out of poverty. Watch Carlos Acosta take CNN on a tour of Havana. » . Aged nine, Acosta was enrolled in the National Ballet School of Cuba, and he hated it. He found the repetitive exercises boring and longed to play football with his friends instead. While Acosta was struggling to fit in, his father was jailed over a traffic accident and his mother suffered a stroke. Acosta played truant once too often. He was expelled and sent to a boarding school in Pinar del Rio, his first taste of life parted from his loved ones. It wasn't until he was 13 that Acosta saw his first real ballet. Watching the Cuban National Ballet perform he began to see the possibilities of the vocation that had been thrust upon him. See photos of Carlos Acosta in action » . He turned out to be a natural at it and began to apply himself to his dance classes. At the age of 16, he won a scholarship with the Turin Ballet, winning the Gold Medal at the Prix de Lausanne. ""I found that ballet was my best friend. It was everything I had, the opportunity to become something else completely and to be fulfilled,"" he told CNN. ""It took me a while to understand that and once I did, there was no turning back. I was determined to be the best I could."" He went on to dance as principal with the English National Ballet from 1991 to 1992, the National Ballet of Cuba from 1992 to 1994, and was a principal with Houston Ballet between 1993 and 1998. In 1998 he made it into the ranks of London's Royal Ballet, advancing to principal guest artist in 2003, to become the Royal Ballet's first black principal. His rise to fame, which had taken him from the streets of Havana to the biggest stages in the world, was mirrored in his semi-autobiographical show ""Tocororo,"" which Acosta created and choreographed. After it received a rapturous reception in London, he took ""Tocororo"" to Cuba in 2003, where he performed it in front of Fidel Castro. Acosta has described that triumphant homecoming as the highlight of his career. Never one to shirk from a challenge, he traveled to Moscow to perform the lead in ""Spartacus"" with the Bolshoi Ballet, a notoriously demanding and exhausting role. He often speaks of the need for ballet to take risks, to evolve and to speak a contemporary language -- ideals that Acosta embodies. Not just a virtuoso performer, it is Acosta's ability to connect with his audience that has made him an international star. Conversely, Acosta says his audience is what inspires him. ""When I find people that express how much my art makes them feel, this is priceless,"" he told CNN. ""You can't buy that with money, you can achieve that only with art -- you really touch people. Once you do that it lives on forever."" But he sees himself as more than just a dancer. In 2007, his autobiography ""No Way Home"" was published to widespread acclaim. The book offered a glimpse of the sense of isolation he felt at living away from Havana. He once told an interviewer, ""I had to leave Cuba to be the best I could be. I now have a very high status, but my family has never been able to share it with me."" Acosta is at his peak as a performer, but a ballet dancer's career has a short span. He has said he does not want to be a choreographer once he retires, but he does have plans for the movies. There is talk of his autobiography being made into a film and Acosta has said he would like to play himself  -- after all, who else could match his incredible leaps, fearless athleticism and effortless charm?","Carlos Acosta went from backstreets of Havana to being a ballet superstar .

"JAIPUR, India (CNN) -- Baby Manjhi has no nationality, no legal mother and no clear path home from India to Japan to a father and grandmother who desperately want her. Baby Manjhi, a surrogate child, has been stuck in legal limbo. Her adoptive parents divorced before her birth. ""From deep inside my heart, I want to return immediately to my own country with my grandchild,"" said Emiko Yamada, the girl's grandmother. At just two weeks old, Manjhi Yamada is stuck in legal limbo -- the offspring of commercial surrogacy and a divorce before she was even born. Some countries and parts of the United States have banned surrogacy as a money-making venture, but India legalized it in 2002. Under the practice, infertile couples are matched with local women to carry babies for $12,000 to $30,000.  Watch grandmother plead for baby's release » . It's a booming business, worth an estimated $445 million a year. ""Cheap mothers are available here. There is so much poverty. ... It's employment for them,"" says Dr. Sadhana Arya with India's Arya Hospital. ""You have treated the surrogate mother like an object, used her as a factory, produced something, given money for it."" But, she says, the final product ""is a live child."" Arya, who is part of the team now treating Manjhi, says such pregnancies -- dubbed ""wombs for rent"" by critics -- can have a broader human toll. She feels especially anguished for the father and grandmother in this case. ""It is absolutely traumatic, especially for the grandmother, because they have a visa for a limited period of time,"" Arya said. ""What happens if the period expires? How do they manage the problem? Where do they leave the baby? Where does the baby stay? Who cares for the baby?"" Baby Manjhi was created when a Japanese husband and wife paid a clinic in India to have the husband's sperm and an anonymous donor's egg implanted in the womb of an Indian surrogate. The plan worked. But a few months before Manjhi was born, the Japanese couple divorced. The intended Japanese mother decided she did not want the baby as well. She was born July 25 in Anand, a town near Ahmedabad in western India. Kaival Hospital, which contracted with the couple to create the child, has become extremely popular with foreigners from around the world who want surrogate children. As soon as Manjhi was born, her father, Ikufumi Yamada, and grandmother traveled from Japan to pick her up and take her to her new home. But Indian law stopped them. In order to get a passport for the baby, the mother must be present. In this case, neither the birth mother nor the mother who had originally sought the child wanted to be involved. Manjhi's father looked into a legal adoption, but Indian law says a single man is not fit to adopt a baby girl. The Japanese Embassy says it cannot help without some sort of travel documents from India as well. ""I think obviously India owes an obligation to speed up the legal and judicial process so that the child is able to travel as soon as possible,"" said Indira Jaising, a senior advocate for India's Supreme Court. Then, with Manjhi stuck in legal limbo, she became sick and had to be hospitalized. Without her birth mother around, the tiny child refused to eat and became dehydrated. She also contracted septicemia. Her father and grandmother were heartbroken as they found themselves in a legal mess with a sick baby girl in a country where they didn't know the law and didn't speak any of the languages. The father, who happens to be a doctor, has gone back to Japan to see patients and seek further legal counsel. The 70-year-old grandmother, Emiko Yamada, has stayed put. Uneasy about how the baby was created, she comes to the hospital to cradle her granddaughter day and night, and has become so attached, she says, she cannot imagine going home without Manjhi. ""I am very worried and stressed. Why can't they let her father take his child?"" the grandmother says. Arya is one of two doctors now caring for the child. Her hospital had nothing to do with the surrogacy. Baby Manjhi was brought to her hospital in Jaipur because the Yamadas had a friend there who could help them communicate. The doctors have stabilized Manjhi. When they heard the extent of the child's legal jeopardy, their immediate reaction was to get personally involved. ""I think this should end. There should be stricter laws,"" Arya said. From Japan to America, people are coming to India in droves for surrogates. Peter Kaestner with the U.S. Embassy in India says demands on its staff from U.S. citizens with surrogacy issues in India are on the rise. ""Half of the citizenship cases that they do now in Mumbai are from surrogates,"" Kaestner says. In this case, it's a Japanese national who is facing the tangled legal and ethical issues surrounding the business of surrogacy. As for Manjhi, there is hope. She has finally been issued a birth certificate with just her Japanese father's name on it, which might be enough to get her visa to travel to Japan. ""I will not leave India without her, no matter what,"" the child's grandmother says.","Commercial surrogacy in India is a booming business, worth an estimated $445M .

"(CNN) -- For the second time, an international tribunal has acquitted a former Kosovo prime minister and two others of abusing and killing Serbs, raising fears that the Thursday ruling could further strain tense relations between the two countries. The judges ruled there was no evidence that Ramush Haradinaj, who was a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army before becoming prime minister, and two other former commanders murdered, tortured and unlawfully detained Serbian civilians, according to the summary judgment. It was the second recent high-profile acquittal on appeal by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Two former Croatian generals were cleared of war crimes on November 16. In a statement after the verdict, Amnesty International urged authorities to hold accountable those responsible for abducting and murdering members of minority communities in Kosovo. ""Today's verdict raises the question of if, as the court has established today, the three former high-ranking KLA members are not guilty, who then committed those crimes?"" John Dalhuisen, director of Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program, said in the statement. ""Is anybody ever going to be brought to justice? These are the questions that the victims and their families ask, and will continue to ask, until they see justice,"" he said. The indictment alleged that Haradinaj, and former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj, were part of a joint criminal enterprise to consolidate control over the Dukagjin area of western Kosovo through the unlawful removal and mistreatment of civilians. The charges against the former prime minister stemmed from 1998, when he was a commander in the army and Kosovo was fighting for independence from Serbia. Kosovo declared its independence in 2008, but Serbia has refused to recognize the move. The three men were initially indicted in March 2005. Haradinaj was originally charged with 37 counts, but the trial court decided in April 2008 there was insufficient evidence to back up the charges and acquitted him, along with Balaj and Brahimaj. Prosecutors appealed, and the appeals chamber reinstated six counts against all three men, including murder, torture, cruel treatment and unlawful detention.","NEW: Amnesty International: ""Is anybody ever going to be brought to justice?""

"(CNN) -- A construction crane caught fire Tuesday in Sydney, Australia, spitting flames nearly 32 feet (10 meters) into the air before partially collapsing. No one was injured in the Tuesday morning incident, crane operator Lend Lease said. The worker steering the crane escaped down a ladder as it burned overhead, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported, citing acting Fire Superintendent Josh Turner. The company is the same one that was managing a New York construction site where a crane partially collapsed during Superstorm Sandy in October. The collapse Tuesday at the University of Technology Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology construction project happened two weeks after union officials shut the site down over concerns about diesel fuel leaking from the crane, the Morning Herald reported, citing union official Brian Parker. It was not immediately clear if that reported leak had anything to do with Tuesday's collapse, but firefighters believed diesel fuel was involved in the fire, the Morning Herald cited Turner as saying. Lend Lease said the site is regularly audited for safety. The crane was 213 feet (65 meters) tall, the Morning Herald reported, citing fire and rescue authorities. The fire and collapse drew hundreds of gawkers onto the streets to record the incident with cell phone cameras. The company said it was working with authorities and unions to investigate the incident. In late October, gale-force winds from Superstorm Sandy caused a construction crane to collapse atop what will become an upscale apartment high-rise. The collapsed New York crane was operated by Pinnacle Industries. Lend Lease, the construction manager on the project, said the crane had been inspected days before the storm and was determined to be properly placed for hazardous weather.","Crane collapses in Sydney, Australia .

"Windsor, England (CNN) -- Four portraits of Queen Elizabeth II by pop artist Andy Warhol have gone on display at her home, Windsor Castle, for the first time as part of an exhibition of official images of the monarch marking the end of her Diamond Jubilee year. Warhol's series of sparkling ""diamond-dusted"" portraits of the Queen was acquired earlier this year to mark the Diamond Jubilee. Royal Librarian Jane Roberts told CNN they were the ""most iconic"" images in the exhibition, ""The Queen: Portraits of a Monarch,"" which features pictures, paintings and sculptures by some of the world's best-known artists and photographers. Warhol, who once claimed he wanted to be ""as famous as the Queen of England,"" used a 10-year-old official portrait of Elizabeth II, by royal photographer Peter Grugeon, to create the four screenprints for his ""Reigning Queens"" series in 1985. ""What Warhol did was he grabbed a pre-existing image of the Queen and wiped it clean, so what you're left with is the outline, with the tiara,"" Roberts told CNN. ""Then he played around with colors, and lighting, and 'diamond dust' [cut glass], really treating the likeness as an icon."" Capturing a Queen: Images of Elizabeth II . Queen Elizabeth's global significance -- as head of the Commonwealth -- is hinted at by the number of works by international photographers and artists in the exhibition: American Annie Leibovitz, Canadian Yousuf Karsh, Italian Pietro Annigoni and Czech Franta Belsky, among others. So which, of the millions of pictures of the monarch, will be the one which is remembered long after her reign, the defining image of Queen Elizabeth II, who Roberts says is ""probably the most photographed person in the world""? With so many to choose from, she says it is hard to be sure. ""I suspect in this age of photography, that it will be a photograph,"" said Roberts. ""Probably one of the incredibly glamorous photographs taken by Cecil Beaton. ""But having said that, it could be one of the photographs taken very early in her reign, between the accession and the coronation, by Dorothy Wilding, because they were then reproduced on coinage and stamps, again and again."" ""Or it could be the Warhol. Who knows?"" ""The Queen: Portraits of a Monarch"" is on at Windsor Castle until June 9, 2013.","Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- It is the breakthrough signing that has confirmed Paris Saint-Germain's arrival as a potent force in European football as they unveiled Swedish superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Tuesday. The striker has been tempted away from Italian giants AC Milan to ply his trade in the French league, signing on a three-year contract for a reputed fee of $24.5 million. Ibrahimovic's capture again underlines the intentions of PSG's owners, Qatar Sports Investment, who have repeatedly stated their intention to transform the club into one of the world's biggest and best. And they have certainly put their money where their mouth is in the transfer market, signing Brazilian defender Thiago Motta as well as Argentina playmakers Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore for enormous fees. Putting pride back into PSG: Qataris aim to be world's best . But none of those who have joined the fledgling project can match the profile of Ibrahimovic, who was top scorer in Serie A last season with 28 goals. ""I want to thank Paris Saint-Germain and (sporting director) Leonardo for the great work they've done,"" Ibrahimovic told a press conference at the club's Parc des Princes stadium. ""I think they've made something that looked impossible, possible. I'm very happy to be sitting here. After lots of talks, I'm finally a PSG player. It's a big step in my career, another dream come true. ""I think this is a very interesting project and I had no doubts. In my mind I was very clear, and I knew what I wanted. ""I want to be part of this club's history and I'm pretty sure we will make history. I came here to win, not for anything else, and I'm pretty sure we'll win some trophies."" Ibrahimovic has played for many of Europe's top clubs in his glittering career to date. He won two Dutch titles during a three year stay at Ajax Amsterdam before moving to Juventus in Italy. He then moved to Internazionale where he helped the Nerazzurri claim three league titles before he moved to Barcelona, winning five trophies in his two seasons at the Spanish club. Ibrahimovic left after falling out with former coach Josep Guardiola and returned to Italy to play for AC Milan. There he won the Italian Cup and Serie A title. French football's $56M man: PSG poster boy Pastore . His decision to leave Italy for a league many believe to be inferior could prove a watershed moment for PSG and the domestic French competition. But the Swedish star denied some press reports that he was pushed out of Milan because the club were keen to trim their wage bill. ""No-one at Milan influenced me,"" he said. ""It was my choice and my choice alone. I was very happy to be at Milan. They gave me my smile back. ""It's a club that will stay in my heart. They helped me and my family, and I don't want to put a shadow over my time there. They made it easy for me to come to PSG so I thank them and I wish them all the best."" PSG also announced the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Marco Verratti from Serie A club Pescara and the club's sporting director Leonardo said that their transfer business had now been completed. ""The market is closed for new arrivals,"" he said. ""With Zlatan we've finished in the transfer window this year.""","Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic signs for French club Paris Saint-Germain .

"(CNN) -- Four servicewomen who have done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan filed a suit against the Defense Department Tuesday challenging the military's longstanding policy against women in ground combat. Some of the plaintiffs led female troops who went on missions with combat infantrymen, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the women. ""Their careers and opportunities have been limited by a policy that does not grant them the same recognition for their service as their male counterparts,"" the ACLU said. ""The combat exclusion policy also makes it harder for them to do their jobs."" Air National Guard search-and-rescue helicopter pilot Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar flew medevac missions in Afghanistan. While she was rescuing three injured soldiers, she and her crew were shot down and forced to engaged in combat, according to the ACLU. Hegar suffered shrapnel wounds, and she was later awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor, the ACLU said. She returned to flying status within a week. Despite that, the combat exclusion policy prevents her from seeking some combat leadership positions, the ACLU said. An IED took a veteran's leg, not her fighting spirit . Hegar said serving has very little to do with gender, and that the military's policy is ""an injustice to women who have come before us and who continue to put their lives on the line for their country."" She wanted to be an Air Force pilot since she was a kid. ""I have proven my ability every step of the way,"" Hegar said, according to a news release from the ACLU. Two of the plaintiffs led Marine Corps ""female engagement teams"" in Afghanistan, according to the ACLU. They lived with and conducted missions with combat infantrymen. Another plaintiff was sent on similar missions in the Army, accompanying combat troops in Afghanistan, the ACLU said. Those jobs were considered temporary duties outside of the servicewomen's official specialties, so their combat experience is not given official recognition, the plaintiffs contend. The Service Women's Action Network, a national female veterans group, is also part of the suit, and the plaintiffs are being further represented by the ACLU of Northern California and a California-based law firm. Women make up more than 14% of 1.4 million active military personnel, the ACLU said. The military's policy excludes women from more than 238,000 positions, according to the ACLU, arguing that that situation prevents commanders from mobilizing their troops effectively. The ACLU and others who represent the woman said the policy denies training and recognition for service, puts women at a disadvantage for promotions or moving up in rank and prevents them from competing for jobs that they've shown they're capable of. Pentagon spokesman George Little took questions about the suit Tuesday, saying that he couldn't comment about pending litigation, but he added that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ""remains very committed"" to examining role of women in the military.","Servicewomen who served in Iraq, Afghanistan say military discriminates against them .

"(CNN) -- The scene is set for a thrilling climax to the 2012 Formula One season after Lewis Hamilton upstaged title contenders Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso by claiming pole position for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix. Hamilton, who beat the duo to win the penultimate race in the U.S. last weekend, headed off McLaren teammate Jenson Button in Saturday's qualifying at Interlagos. Championship leader Vettel had to settle for fourth on the grid behind Red Bull teammate Mark Webber, while second-placed Alonso was back in eighth -- later bumped up to seventh -- as he was again out-qualified by Ferrari colleague Felipe Massa. Alonso was handed a small boost when Williams' Pastor Maldonado was relegated from sixth to 16th after receiving a reprimand for failing to take his car to the weighbridge when requested to do so by stewards. Who is F1's greatest driver? Vettel will clinch his third successive title if Alonso -- also seeking to become the sport's youngest triple champion -- finishes outside the top three. The German, who holds a 13-point lead after finishing second in Austin, will be champion whatever his rival's result if he places in the top four. However, with rain expected on Sunday the title race is far from over -- especially as Alonso has overcome poor qualifying form many times this season to consistently finish on the podium. ""Ninth in the USA and eighth here so more or less as I expected,"" he said. ""I will try to achieve the podiums which we achieved in Abu Dhabi and Austin from those positions. ""No big changes in our race. F1 is dominated by aerodynamics. We ran with maximum downforce in dry and same in the wet so no big changes today, no gamble. It is minimum changes."" Latest F1 standings . The Spaniard, who won his two titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, triumphed in the season's only rain-affected race in Malaysia in March. He was helped in Texas when Ferrari gave Massa an automatic five-place grid penalty by changing his gearbox, but this time the Brazilian will be looking to impress on his home track -- where he was denied the 2008 world title by Hamilton on the last lap despite winning the race. ""I will try everything I can,"" said Massa, who qualified fifth ahead of Venezuelan driver Maldonado. ""I don't know what the weather will be but everyone says it is wet. We know Interlagos and that anything can happen. The only thing I need to do is concentrate on my own race in front of my own people."" Vettel has recovered from a difficult start to the season, making the most of improvements provided by Red Bull designer Adrian Newey to win four races in a row before finishing third from a pit-lane start in Abu Dhabi and then second last weekend. ""It was not quick enough and I know I could have done a little better,"" the 25-year-old said. ""But let's wait and see what happens tomorrow."" Hamilton claimed his seventh pole this season and is seeking to end his career-long spell at McLaren with a second successive victory. ""I am grateful to be able to put the car on the front row and to have had my last qualifying with McLaren as a one-two, it is a fantastic job by the team,"" said the Englishman after the team locked out the front row for a record 67th time. ""I think the weather will be tricky tomorrow, it will make it more of a lottery."" Next season Hamilton will move to Mercedes to replace Michael Schumacher, who will start the final race of his career 13th out of 24 drivers. The seven-time world champion, who was fourth at Interlagos before his first retirement in 2006, missed out on the third and final qualifying session. The 43-year-old was almost two seconds slower than Hamilton's leading time of 1:12.458, finishing behind the Englishman's replacement at McLaren next year -- Sergio Perez of Sauber. ""I am not particularly happy about the qualifying session,"" Schumacher said. ""We might have compromised the car too much for the rain which is expected for tomorrow and was also forecast for qualifying. ""My starting position is now quite tricky, and I will have to see what we can make out of it. Sauber's new signing Nico Hulkenberg will start sixth in his final race for Force India at a track where the German claimed a surprise pole position in 2010. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen, seeking to hold off Hamilton for third place in the drivers' standings, will be eighth on the grid ahead of Mercedes' Nico Rosberg and Force India's Paul di Resta. Bruno Senna will start 11th as he seeks to earn a new deal with Williams at the circuit where his three-time world champion uncle Ayrton made his name as a Brazilian folk hero.","Lewis Hamilton wins his seventh pole position of 2012 season at last race in Brazil .

"(Time.com) -- Rick Stengel: Abraham Lincoln is in many ways the most compelling figure in U.S. history, yet the popular culture around him in terms of movies has been pretty minimal. Why is that? Steven Spielberg: It's one of the big mysteries. They float so many trial balloons with Lincoln's face every year in the form of advertising, spoofs, parodies, ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, Presidents' Day commercials. Lincoln has kind of become a caricature. One of the last movies, which I haven't seen in 15 or 20 years, that was about Abraham Lincoln was in the '30s, with Henry Fonda — ""Young Mr. Lincoln."" I don't understand why it's taken so long for anybody, let alone our group, to bring Lincoln to a movie theater. Stengel: You use a fascinating framing device for the movie: the passage of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery. Spielberg: The 13th Amendment was critical to Lincoln, because he knew that if the war ended, this would never get through. The South couldn't live without slavery. They might cease hostilities, but Lincoln always believed that unless we abolish slavery before this war ends, the end of this war will just be a momentary pause between this war and the next war. So he knew he had to get this thing done, but he didn't have the votes. That's at the heart of our movie, this fight to get the votes, to do the right thing. Stengel: There's an English expression, ""Cometh the moment, cometh the man."" How much of it was Lincoln at that moment, or did the moment make him? Spielberg: Lincoln had the ambition. He had a beautiful vision for America. But I don't know what kind of progress he would have made without the crisis that fell into his lap. I also don't know what kind of a president FDR would have become without the Great Depression and World War II, or what Kennedy would ultimately have been remembered for without all of us standing on the brink of nuclear holocaust during the Cuban missile crisis. Time.com: How the greatest living actor became Lincoln . Stengel: Let's talk about his temperament. His leadership style in many ways seems so alien to what we value today. Spielberg: Taking all of his traits—of long, deep thought, of staring deeply into the future, taking the broad view, respecting the past, exploring deep into the cold depths of himself while his entire Cabinet sat around waiting for him to make a decision about anything—I'm not sure there's a mayoral position that would be suitable for him in this kind of adrenaline-fueled era that we all exist in. Even then, the newspapers were going after him. Stengel: One of the things that comes through in the movie is Lincoln's relationship with his wife, his relationship with his youngest son. He would get down on the ground all the time. It showed that he wasn't that statue that was standing up there 20 feet high. Spielberg: He certainly did everything that he needed to do to hold his family together, not just this country. He had lost [his 11-year-old son] Willie two years ago to typhoid fever. Mary spent years mourning the loss of Willie. In [Doris Kearns Goodwin's] book ""Team of Rivals,"" what precedes our story is two years of Mary shunning the whole family and spending time holding séances and trying to reach out and communicate across the thin veil to Willie. Lincoln had that burden on his shoulders. He was really carrying a lot of weight during that time. Stengel: Daniel Day-Lewis' performance integrates all these different sides of Lincoln in a really extraordinary way. What was that like directing him? Spielberg: Daniel did something at first that made me sad. He wanted to wait a year. And it was a masterstroke, because he had a year to do research. He had a year to find the character in his own private process. He had a year to discover how Lincoln sounded, and he found the voice. He had Lincoln so embedded in his psyche, in his soul, in his mind, that I would come to work in the morning and Lincoln would sit behind his desk, and we would begin. Stengel: I believe you called him Mr. President? Spielberg: All during the picture I called him Mr. President, but that was my idea. I also wore a suit every day, which I don't usually do when I'm directing. Everybody was dressed up in their period wardrobe. I did not wear 19th century wardrobe. I wore pretty good clothes from this era. I just wanted to blend in. We knew we were in the 21st century at all times. But once you stepped onto the stages of the White House, everybody really felt that they were making a contribution to remembering this critical moment in our shared history.

"(CNN) -- Sweden's royals will soon be welcoming an American into the family, after the royal court announced Thursday the engagement of Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill, a wealthy New York financier. The brown-haired, blue-eyed princess described O'Neill as her ""soulmate"" and said he had opened her heart -- perhaps reflecting her heartbreak after a previous engagement was called off in 2010 amid reports of infidelity by her then fiance. Princess Madeleine Therese Amelie Josephine, to give her full name, is the youngest child of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia and fourth in line to the Scandanavian nation's throne. The couple, who live in New York, met through mutual friends, Madeleine said, in an interview released by the royal court along with the engagement announcement. Madeleine, 30, said they had been great friends at first before romance blossomed, sharing the same humor and having ""a lot of fun together."" Read more: When UK's William and Kate got married . ""I appreciate Chris for his warmth and his humor. He has a very big heart and he manages to make everyone in his presence feel good. Christopher is a very thoughtful and generous person,"" she said. Love struck quicker for O'Neill, who said that ""from the very outset, I immediately felt something special with Madeleine."" Princess Madeleine said the proposal, earlier this month, had been ""very romantic and intimate"" but that they wanted to keep the details to themselves. O'Neill, who has dual British-American citizenship, confirmed he had taken the traditional route and asked her father, the king, for her hand in marriage. The king gave his consent and ""requested the approval by the Swedish Government, in accordance with the procedures set out in the Swedish Constitution,"" the court announcement said. Queen Silvia is quoted by Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet as saying: ""The princess is very happy and so are we. He is a real dream-son-in-law."" The wedding will take place in summer 2013 but a date has not yet been announced. O'Neill may have been reassured by the fact he's not the first commoner to marry into Sweden's royal family in recent years. Madeleine's elder sister, Crown Princess Victoria, wed her former personal trainer in June 2010. Gym owner Daniel Westling was given the title Prince Daniel, Duke of Vaestergoetland, on their marriage. The couple had a daughter in February who became second in line to the throne of Sweden, as the first grandchild of the king and queen. O'Neill, 38, says he is still working on learning Swedish but has been given a warm welcome by the royal family. Brides no longer wedded to white . ""I felt part of the family right from the very beginning. Madeleine's family is very warm and we have a very good time when we all see each other,"" he said. Born in London, where his late father Paul O'Neill was posted from his native New York, Christopher was educated at a Swiss boarding school before gaining an MBA from Columbia Business School in New York, according to an official biography provided by the Swedish court. A 16-year career within the field of finance followed. He is currently a partner and head of research at Noster Capital, which has offices in New York and London -- as well as being a keen sportsman and Chelsea Football Club fan. His mother, Eva Maria O'Neill, is quoted by the court as saying: ""As the mother of Christopher O'Neill I am delighted at the happy news. I look forward to welcoming Princess Madeleine, who I am very fond of, into our family. I wish them both all possible happiness."" The couple will remain in New York for the time being but have not ruled out a move to Sweden in future. Madeleine reportedly moved to New York in 2010 to get over her split from ex-fiance Jonas Bergstrom, which came just two months before her sister's wedding. The broken tryst followed reports that Bergstrom was ""intimate"" with a Norwegian college student and handball star while they were engaged. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill met through mutual friends in New York .

"(CNN) -- South Korea is stripping the title of ""honorary consul"" from Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite embroiled in the scandal that brought down CIA Director David Petraeus, a South Korean official said Monday. Kelley will lose that designation after a New York businessman accused her of trying to use the honorary title to solicit business, Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kyou-hyun told the semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap. ""It's not suitable to the status of honorary consul that (she) sought to be involved in commercial projects and peddle influence. It's also inappropriate as honorary consul,"" Yonhap quoted Kim as telling South Korean reporters during a visit to Washington. The Petraeus affair: Who is Jill Kelley? Kelley's title, which carries no official responsibility, came to light after Petraeus abruptly resigned on November 9 and admitted to an extramarital affair. Federal investigators learned of the affair after Kelley complained to an FBI agent that she was receiving harassing e-mails from a woman later identified as Petraeus's mistress, Paula Broadwell. Kelley and her husband, Scott, a doctor, hosted parties at their Tampa home for top officers at the nearby headquarters of U.S. Central Command. After Petraeus resigned, Kelley soon found herself facing questions about flirty e-mails shared with another top U.S. commander, Gen. John Allen, and she invoked her honorary title when she called police on November 11 to complain about reporters besieging her home. Kelley asked for $80 million to influence South Korea deal, businessman says . ""I am an honorary consul general,"" Kelley tells police on a recording of the call. ""... I have inviolability. They should not be on my property. I don't know if you want to get diplomatic, uh, protection involved as well."" South Korean officials tell CNN that ""an honorary consul can generally play a role of promoting trade and economic cooperation between the two countries."" It does not, however, carry diplomatic immunity. A few days later, a New York businessman told CNN that Kelley asked him for an $80 million commission if she used her influence to win a South Korean business contract. She claimed to have been a high-level representative of the South Korean government, energy executive Adam Victor said. Tricky nature of investigating Gen. Allen's emails . Kelley has kept a low profile and has not returned CNN phone calls seeking comment about the ""honorary consul"" title. Allen, the current U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has denied any wrongdoing, a senior defense official told CNN, and sources familiar with Kelley have said the relationship between the two was not sexual. The White House has said that President Barack Obama continues to have faith in Allen's leadership -- but Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied commander has been put on hold pending the outcome of an investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.","A South Korean official says Jill Kelley's use of her honorary title was ""not suitable""

"(CNN) -- Mexico's new leader has a message for U.S. officials as he heads to Washington this week: Ties between the neighboring nations must go beyond the drug war. Just four days before his inauguration, Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto will meet with U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday. And he says he wants to reshuffle the list of priorities the United States and Mexico share. ""It is a mistake to limit our bilateral relationship to drugs and security concerns,"" the president-elect wrote in an editorial published by the Washington Post on Friday. ""Our mutual interests are too vast and complex to be restricted in this short-sighted way."" A crackdown on cartels was a hallmark of outgoing President Felipe Calderon's six-year tenure, and the United States voiced its support, offering $1.6 billion to aid in the fight. Pena Nieto has said he plans to focus more on reducing violence, but he's offered few specifics about that approach. The 45-year-old former governor, who won Mexico's presidential vote in July, has said a top priority is to deepen economic ties with the United States. ""Perhaps the most important issue is finding new ways to bolster our economic and trade relationship to attain common prosperity in our nations,"" Pena Nieto wrote last week, noting the potential for more trade, manufacturing deals and energy investment. The United States is Mexico's largest trading partner. The two countries share billions of dollars in imports and exports and a border that stretches nearly 2,000 miles. For the first time in more than a decade, economic issues are likely to dominate the agenda shared by Mexico and the United States, the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars said in a policy brief this week. That's because drug-related violence appears to have plateaued and illegal immigration in the United States from Mexico has dropped dramatically, according to Andrew Selee, director of the center's Mexico Institute. FBI most-wanted fugitive captured in Mexico . ""What's driven the U.S.-Mexico agenda for the past 10 years has been the influx of undocumented immigrants and the headlines about increasing violence, and now both of those have leveled off. ... It allows the two governments to begin to talk about other issues that matter for their long-term well-being,"" Selee said. In Mexico, analysts said on CNN en EspaÃ±ol's ""Mexico Opina"" that Tuesday's meeting could signal a new approach to the relationship between the two countries. ""Pena Nieto should convince Obama that Mexico deserves more attention. ... This is the moment to change the style and propose a higher agenda,"" said Olga Pellicer, a professor at Mexico's Autonomous Institute of Technology and a former diplomat. Political analyst Gabriel Guerra said Pena Nieto's government should push to have a greater influence on affairs within the United States, convincing U.S. officials that Mexicans are ""important and relevant."" ""The image of the country is very negative. There is a perception that we are corrupt and drug associates. This is a result of accumulated neglect,"" he said. Pena Nieto ""is inheriting a neglected relationship."" Mexican beauty queen killed in shootout . Some critics have said Obama neglected Latin America during his first term, and lambasted the U.S. president for not bringing up Mexico or other countries in the region during last month's foreign policy debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. At a forum hosted by the Spanish-language Univision network in September, Obama said the United States is committed to continuing to work alongside Mexico to fight organized crime. ""What I will be saying to the new president of Mexico when he takes office is that we want to continue this cooperation and we recognize this is a threat on both sides of the border. We obviously generate a lot of demand for drugs on this side of the border, and cash and guns flow south just as drugs flow north,"" Obama said. ""If we can reduce demand, that means less cash flowing into these drug cartels. The other thing we need to do is work much more aggressively in preventing the flow of guns and cash down to Mexico."" Both the White House and Pena Nieto's transition team have said security will be a key topic during Tuesday's meeting, and U.S. officials should continue to push for justice and human rights reforms south of the border, the Washington Office on Latin America said in a statement Monday. ""While Pena Nieto has expressed his desire to shift the focus of the bilateral relationship away from the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime in order to place more emphasis on economic issues such as investment, trade, and energy, a dramatic shift in the focus of the U.S.-Mexico relationship seems unlikely,"" the statement said. Immigration also is likely to come up Tuesday, since the topic is important to residents on both sides of the border, said the Mexico Institute's Selee. Topics such as education partnerships between the two countries and global issues could also be on the table, he said.

"(CNN) -- Speculation abounds ahead of the awarding of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, on Friday, as the eyes of the world turn to those who are trying to end its many conflicts and injustices. This year's winner (or winners) will be picked from 231 different nominations, 43 for organizations and the rest for individuals, the five-member Nobel committee says. The names of the nominees are not revealed. Last year's prize came as a surprise to many observers, split as it was among three women: Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and grassroots activist Leymah Gbowee, and Yemeni media freedom campaigner Tawakkul Karman, a symbol of the Arab Spring. Will this year's winner of the coveted prize also come out of the blue? Here's a list of some possibilities, compiled with the help of Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo and a keen Nobel Prize watcher. Gene Sharp . At the top of Harpviken's list and in the top two on betting sites Unibet and Paddy Power as of Thursday lunchtime, Norwegian time, is the American academic Gene Sharp. Gene Sharp: A dictator's worst nightmare . Sharp, the understated star of the 2011 British documentary film ""How to Start a Revolution,"" is professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and author of numerous works considered to have influenced the peaceful Arab Spring uprisings. He's ""one of the world's most prominent thinkers on the use of nonviolence,"" Harpviken said. ""His writings have been very widely used. They were read on Tiananmen Square in 1989, they were read on Tahrir Square in 2011 and 2012."" Maggie Gobran . Also known as ""Mama Maggie,"" the Egyptian Coptic Christian was jointly nominated by five Republican U.S. congressmen for her work helping families and children living among the garbage slums of Cairo. ""This is a woman who has dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor in Egypt and has often been referred to as the 'Mother Teresa of Cairo,' "" the nominating letter read, posted on the website of one of the five, Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia. ""She has given a voice to the poorest of the poor."" Gobran, whose charity Stephen's Children provides health services, education and training for needy Egyptians of all faiths, including Coptic Christians and Muslims, was the favorite on betting outlet Unibet as of Thursday lunchtime. Thein Sein . Could this year's winner come from Asia? If so, Myanmar's President Thein Sein could be an interesting dark horse candidate, Harpviken said. ""He comes out of a military junta of course, has a background within a repressive regime, but once he came to power himself he initiated major political reforms,"" Harpviken said. Read more: U.N. envoy warns of 'serious' human rights situation in western Myanmar . Under Thein Sein, the Myanmar government has released hundreds of political prisoners and allowed the opposition National League for Democracy to compete in elections. Western governments have responded to the efforts by starting to ease sanctions put in place to pressure the military regime. Read more: Myanmar removes names from blacklist . Myanmar's longtime opposition leader and pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi was honored with a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but was under house arrest. Freed in 2010 and elected to the Myanmar parliament this year, she finally gave her Nobel speech in Oslo this summer. Bookie Unibet says her odds of winning the prize a second time this year are 25 to 1. Radio Echo Moscow . Rights groups and European leaders have raised concern about the growing crackdown on free speech and intimidation of opposition activists in Russia -- making those people with the courage to speak out all the more important. Opinion: Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' For this reason, Harpviken names Radio Echo Moscow, which has been critical of President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin policies, as one of his top picks. ""Radio Echo Moscow is one of the most important free media outlets in Russia,"" he said. Putin earlier this year accused the radio station of ""pouring diarrhea"" over him day and night, according to state media reports. Radio Echo Moscow is majority owned by Russia's state gas monopoly Gazprom. Memorial . In a similar vein, Harpviken highlights the work of the Memorial Human Rights Center, ""a very interesting organization that is devoted to documentation of power abuse, repression within Russia and the former Soviet Union."" A win for the Russian rights group, given odds of 20 to 1 by betting outfit Paddy Power, could be embarrassing for Putin's government. Fellow rights group Human Rights Watch highlighted the challenges its staffers face in its World Report 2012. Lina Ben Mhenni . A Tunisian online activist, blogger and university teacher, Lina Ben Mhenni was placing third in Paddy Power's list of Nobel Peace Prize contenders as of Thursday with odds of 10 to 1. Lina Ben Mhenni on how the web fed the 'dignity revolution' Ben Mhenni, who criticized the regime long before the uprisings began, became a prominent voice of the Arab Spring through her blog, ""A Tunisian Girl."" She was one of very few to blog from the ground as Tunisian authorities cracked down on protests, posting accounts and photographs of the violence online. Another voice of the Arab Spring, Wael Ghonim -- a former Google executive who used social media to jump-start social change in Egypt -- is given odds of 12 to 1 by the same betting outlet. Opinion: Ghonim electrified Egypt's revolution . Oscar Elias Biscet Gonzales . The Cuban human rights advocate and medical doctor was nominated last year for the Peace Prize and may well feature among the nominees again. Unibet gives him odds of 8 to 1 to win. Gonzales was among scores of people imprisoned during the Cuban government's 2003 crackdown on political dissidents. He founded and ran the Lawton Foundation for Human Rights and also led the Friends of Human Rights group in Cuba, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit group Freedom Now.

"(CNN) -- Four separate times, prosecutors say, Gregory Peterson lured women under the pretext of a movie or lunch -- and sexually assaulted them. He kept one captive in his mother's house for several days, they said . He threatened to report another, whose visa had expired, for deportation, charging documents alleged. And in each case, authorities said, he forced the women to engage in sex acts by pointing to guns he possessed. For those alleged crimes, Peterson was awaiting trial on more than two dozen charges. But the criminal case ended Tuesday when the Utah man -- who'd bailed out of jail just four days earlier -- was found in his cabin, dead of an apparent suicide. ""This has been a tragedy of a case from the beginning,"" said Wasatch County Attorney Scott Sweat. A bail bondsman found Peterson in his Wasatch County cabin Tuesday evening while checking on him because his ankle monitor signal was getting weak, Sheriff Todd Bonner said. It's unclear whether he left a note, Bonner said. Deputies noticed ""activity"" with his monitor early in the afternoon as Peterson walked around outside his cabin, Bonner said. Peterson had a number of weapons inside his home, he added. Cara Tangaro, one of two lawyers representing Peterson, said she was ""completely 100% shocked by the news."" ""If we thought he had been suicidal at all, we obviously would have taken that into account, or tried to get him help, or talk him out of bailing out,"" she said early Wednesday morning. ""We actually felt we had a trial-able case,"" she added. ""We were very much looking forward to getting his side of the story out there and having our day in court."" The Salt Lake County district attorney charged Peterson, 37, in July with a range of crimes including rape, assault, and forcible sexual abuse against the four women. After spending three months in jail, he was released Friday on a $2 million bail. The women detailed the alleged sexual abuse in a July charging document. The first woman, identified only as S.M., described meeting Peterson at a church event in March 2011 and agreeing to go to a movie with him. Instead of going to the theater, she said, he drove her to his cabin, assaulting her both on the drive and during the night. The woman said she was scared because there were weapons both in the car and in his cabin. Peterson drove her back to her car the next morning, she said. The other women said they met Peterson online. One said Peterson asked her to dinner in July 2011 but instead drove her to his cabin, sexually assaulting her on the way and through the night. She said he talked about her expired visa and threatened to deport her. Peterson then drove her to his mother's house and kept her there for three days before driving her home and assaulting her again, she said. The other assaults allegedly occurred at the women's homes in December 2011 and last April when he arrived to take them to lunch, they said. ""He maintained his innocence to us from Day 1 and never wavered from that,"" Tangaro, his attorney said. Asked whether the apparent suicide indicates Peterson was guilty of the crimes, Sweat -- the Wasatch County attorney -- said: ""I think everyone's going to have to make up their minds on that.""","NEW: His attorney says she was ""completely 100% shocked by the news""

"(CNN) -- Salvatore Iaconesi's essay on his decision to post his medical records on the Internet in hopes of finding a crowd-sourced cure for his brain tumor has sparked a lively conversation on CNN.com. Readers raised a lot of thoughtful questions about his methods and what he was trying to accomplish, so Iaconesi jumped into the comments to respond. Many of the questions were too long to duplicate here, so we included excerpts and a link to the full comments. Some questions and responses have been edited for clarity. You can read his full essay and participate in the discussion on CNN's opinion page. 1) Can this help a lot of people? momza: His idea does not scale well. As long as he is the only one, he has a good chance that an idle doctor stumbles upon his files. If all the people publish their records, the chances will be extremely low. (Read the full comment) Iaconesi: Hello. Yes, it does not scale if we start from the assumption that I'm doing it for myself, and that what I'm doing is to find the best doctor. But this is not the way I would want it to be. What I'm really looking for is to suggest a vision in which this process happens and its results (and the process itself) is shared/shareable and replicated by everyone. Imagine that the results of this remain accessible. If you, tomorrow, have to go through cancer, you will be able to benefit from all this work already done, with contacts, different strategies combined in critical, harmonious ways, documented testimonies, ways to access the various services etc. What I am also asking is to go beyond the idea of eHealth, and to not limit this whole thing to an ""administrative"" or, even worse, ""bureaucratic"" process, because this is really harmful to people, both the ""diseased"" ones and the rest of the members of society. A ""cure"" should really confront with the whole human being. From what we're understanding now, it would have benefits at multiple levels, including financial and technical ones (and, obviously, at the level of health and well being) 2) How do you pay for the treatment? Baba Louie: The one thing the guy doesn't mention is insurance. ... When average Americans get diagnosed, they have to think of how they can get effective treatment without losing their house because they have lousy insurance policies and Medicare, none of which pay for the advanced treatments that can keep you alive. (Read the full comment) Iaconesi: Ahhh, Baba, that is an incredible issue! In Italy, for example, we have a very good welfare system for health. Hospitals and infrastructures are not very good, but doctors are really excellent and many things are really covered by the national health system. So this can be a somewhat lesser problem for us. But as soon as you want to access something that is not ""standard"" (even a simple blood test of a specific kind, to analyze the presence of cancer markers) costs rise exponentially. This is another thing we're confronting -- also trying to imagine ways to help people (including me) to integrate in the ""cure"" the possibility to raise money to actually perform it. 3) Can't advice from non-doctors do more harm than good? Tim: Please seek qualified, legitimate sources for your treatment. ... While one may want to believe that ""spiritual healers"" or ""artists"" can contribute to your treatment, the truth is that they will not, and they may actually be harmful by distracting from legitimate treatments. (Read the full comment) Iaconesi: Dear Tim, actually ""ordinary people"" have been incredibly helpful, through their testimonies, experiences and evaluations. Where clinical trials often are performed with as few as 30 people, I have been able to compare the documented testimonies of hundreds of people. And this is just one example of the ways in which this kind of process has been really helpful and productive. I won't even go, for now, into the enormous implications at a psychological, social and cultural level which I myself and many, many people are perceiving. But I do agree: If I eventually have to have a surgery performed, it will be by a professional doctor :) 4) Will opening the records do any good? jamesrav: I'd be interested to know how making it 'open' actually benefited his condition versus keeping it 'closed'. I'm thinking the specialist who gave him his results and options knew the very best that medicine could offer for what he has. (Read the full comment) Iaconesi: Great point. And that's one thing I'm really caring about: combining things in effective ways. To do this, I explicitly ask people (doctors, researchers, regular people... ) who contribute, to compare their approaches, also critically, and to try to understand how and if they should/could be combined, and to what extent. Even in this scenario doubts remain, obviously. But at least you can benefit from a wider set of competences, technologies, strategies, philosophies and you can have an active role in the decisions which will affect your health. Also because everyone involved will dedicate energies to make sure that they keep you informed and in the loop, making sure that you are actually able to understand what they're talking about, the implications and side effects, the dangers and problems. 5) Can cancer treatment be crowd-sourced? Joe Michaels: It would be wonderful if a crowd-sourcing site existed for cancer. Options for treatment (offered by physicians / treatment facilities) could / should include research data on outcomes, side effects, and so on. This would greatly simplify a mystifying experience for many patients. Iaconesi: This is one of the things we're working on, with a lot of researchers and designers. Something which goes beyond eHealth, and looks at the whole story of people: emotional, lifestyle *and* medical, including data, imaging, history etc. And also taking into account the important issues of privacy and ethics of a thing of this kind -- really really important. We will publish a few things about this in just a bit. 6) Can the Internet make you a medical expert? Kropotkin:  I wish him the best, but it's dangerous to think that because you have access to a wealth of information on a particular subject, you are an expert at interpreting and applying the information. (Read the full comment) Iaconesi: That is a good point, actually. And, in fact, I feel that I ""have become an expert,"" but through the possibility of accessing the knowledge and competences of people who have expertise on this subject, from a variety of points of view, and also by asking them, if they can, to speak, and confront, and compare, and criticize. 7) Shouldn't you just trust your doctors? Mr1Man: Truth and knowledge are not democratic. Trust your doctor over the Internet. Do what they say and get better soon. Good Luck. Iaconesi: I do trust my doctors. All of them. And they trust each other, as well. So much that they are collaborating among . (themselves) and with the other people as well. (They are) also helping out to understand the best ways in which collaboration of this kind can take place with the least amount of possible risk, by filtering out useless and dangerous nonsense, and by working together to understand how to combine techniques and how to really *care* about the human being, in the process, by taking into account their lifestyle, their creativity, their engagement. ... 8) Isn't this just nonsense? Christopher Carr: Homeopathy does not and can not contribute to curing anything. It's just water. And it's not your ""spirit"" which needs healing. It's your brain -- specifically that tumor -- which is a real thing in your real head. Iaconesi: Dear Christopher, I hope you never have to deal with this kind of thing. But if you really speak (and I mean really) to someone who has, you will learn some incredible things. There are many, many approaches to confront this kind of problem. And most of the time they are inaccessible to you, either economically, technically, or even because you don't know about them. Cancer, like many complex things of our time, is not something for which a ""truth"" exists. Many explanations are possible and available, as well as techniques to try and cure it. Furthermore, many of them are compatible with each other. And, by combining them harmoniously, you have the chance to really send powerful messages to your body, working on immune system, cell multiplication and differentation, metabolism, etc. This is what, for me, is looking like the best possible option. For now it has proved effective. And, BTW, I also don't plan on excluding surgery at all. On the contrary: I wish to use every possible, positive, useful technique, as a combination. Just like science says.","Salvatore Iaconesi posted his medical records online after being diagnosed with a brain tumor .

"London (CNN) -- The British press should be regulated by an independent group supported by law and with the power to fine, a judge recommended Thursday in a long-awaited report sparked by a phone-hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid. Judge Brian Leveson said he was not recommending that Parliament set up a press regulator, but that the industry should create its own, which would be backed by legislation to make sure it meets certain standards of independence and effectiveness. Prime Minister David Cameron, who asked the judge to prepare the report, told Parliament after its release that he agrees with Leveson's recommendations for a new, strong, independent press regulator. He said the onus is now on the press to implement the report's recommendations, ""and implement them radically."" CNN Radio: British press react to hacking report . But Cameron said he is not convinced that legislation is needed to underpin the new body -- and he has serious concerns about taking that approach. At the same time, the prime minister said that the ""status quo is not an option"" and that the victims of press abuses have ""suffered in a way that we can barely begin to imagine."" News International, a subsidiary of the Murdoch-owned News Corp., backed Cameron's call for regulation without legislation. ""We accept that a new system should be independent, have a standards code, a means of resolving disputes, the power to demand prominent apologies and the ability to levy heavy fines,"" the company said in a statement. Signaling a difference of views within the coalition government, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who leads the Liberal Democrats, said he believes new legislation is needed to ensure the regulator's long-term independence. Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, also said he favors full implementation of Leveson's recommendations, including the new legislation. Cross-party talks are expected later Thursday to discuss a way forward. Read the report summary (PDF) In his report, Leveson said that he had no desire to jeopardize the freedom of the press, which he acknowledged plays a ""vital"" role in safeguarding the public interest, but that changes are needed to tackle abuses. The British press has ignored its own code of conduct on ""far too many occasions over the last decade,"" causing ""real hardship"" and sometimes wreaking ""havoc with the lives of innocent people,"" Leveson said. ""This is not just the famous but ordinary members of the public, caught up in events (many of them, truly tragic) far larger than they could cope with but made much, much worse by press behavior that, at times, can only be described as outrageous,"" he said. At the same time, no one proposed that the government or Parliament should be involved in regulating the press, Leveson said. The judge recommends that the new body have new powers to impose tough sanctions against newspapers that break the rules, including the imposition of fines of up to 1% of turnover, to a maximum of 1 million pounds ($1.6 million). Opinion: Why the UK should avoid muzzling its free press . The judge said the relationship between the press and politicians is mostly ""robust,"" but sometimes the links can be ""too close."" He highlighted as a concern ""relationships between policy makers and those in the media who stand to gain or lose from the policy being considered."" This risks undermining public confidence in the press and politicians, he said. Cameron said he accepted that more transparency was needed over such links. But the prime minister pointed out that Leveson had ""emphatically"" rejected allegations that the Conservative Party had struck some kind of deal with News International. This related to claims that its newspapers might have offered favorable coverage to Cameron in the expectation of ""policy favors."" Cameron's government faced uncomfortable questions earlier this year over its handling of a bid by Murdoch's News Corp. to take over British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The bid was eventually dropped. Opinion: Why UK's shamed newspapers need regulating . The prime minister also backed Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations to break an ""excessively cozy relationship"" between the police and the press. Leveson said there was a perception that some senior police officers within London's Metropolitan Police were too close to News International. But he found no evidence that decisions to limit its earlier inquiries into phone hacking were due to undue influence or corruption. Leveson said senior police officers should ensure greater transparency over their meetings with the press in the future, and they should not be able to move immediately from the police into jobs in the media. The Metropolitan Police said that the integrity of its officers had not been questioned but that it would study the criticisms made in the report. Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said he had already taken ""decisive action"" to address issues that emerged during the inquiry. ""Our priority now is the victims of phone hacking and making sure they get justice,"" he said. Opinion: Press dishes it out, but can it take it? Leveson described his inquiry, which heard from hundreds of witnesses during eight months of hearings, as ""the most concentrated look at the press this country has ever seen."" Those testifying included politicians including Cameron and former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown; police and media players such as Murdoch; and victims of press abuses. The inquiry was first announced by Cameron in July 2011 in response to public outrage over a newspaper phone-hacking scandal. The trigger was the allegation that in 2002, the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, had been hacked by an investigator working for the News of the World newspaper before she was found murdered. Compounding the anger was the claim (later dismissed by police) that messages were deleted by him from the schoolgirl's full voice mail box, giving her parents false hope that she was alive. The furor forced the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World, owned by News International. It also prompted a new appetite among Britain's public and political establishments to see the sleazy underbelly of (often tabloid) reporting exposed and steps taken to clean up the media's act. Leveson's report was the subject of much speculation before its release. Freedom of expression groups warned of a potential impacts on freedom of speech, while campaigners for greater controls said regulation is essential. The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, David Hunt, said he did not agree with all Leveson's recommendations but all those involved must seek to unite around ""common ground."" ""We all agree that we must regain the trust and confidence of the British people to make sure that unacceptable, outrageous and illegal behavior can never be allowed to happen again,"" Hunt said in a written statement. The Committee to Protect Journalists issued a release saying it is ""deeply concerned"" about the recommendations. ""A media regulatory body anchored by statute cannot be described as voluntary,"" the committee's executive director, Joel Simon, said in the release. ""Moreover, adopting statutory regulation would undermine press freedom in the UK and give legitimacy to governments around the world that routinely silence journalists through such controls."" Index on Censorship, a free speech group, urged ""serious, considered debate"" about the points made by Leveson. Chief executive Kirsty Hughes said: ""We share David Cameron's concerns that statutory underpinning would undermine free speech, and could be the start of a slippery slope of government interference in the media."" Media reform campaign group Hacked Off launched an online petition that calls on the leaders of the three main parties to implement the Leveson Report's recommendations in full ""as soon as possible."" Timeline of the UK phone hacking scandal . The actions of staffers at News Corp. and News International came under close scrutiny during the inquiry. Among those to testify were Murdoch protege Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International and onetime editor of the Sun and News of the World, and Andy Coulson, who also edited the News of the World. He went on to become Cameron's director of communications before resigning from that post early last year. Both appeared in court Thursday morning to face charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office in connection with alleged illegal payments to public officials. They and three other accused were released on bail and ordered to appear in court again next week. The scandal has also raised the specter of possible legal action against News Corp. staffers in the United States under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws the bribery of foreign officials by U.S. firms. However, analyst Porter Bibb in New York said the release of the Leveson report is ""a nonevent"" from the point of view of U.S. investors and would have no real impact on News Corp. stocks. The corporation is doing well and Murdoch has come back ""stronger than ever"" following the pressure he was under to cede control of parts of his media empire early this year, Bibb said.

"Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Someone has turned a crucial dolphin birthing area off the U.S. Gulf Coast into a killing zone and the race is on to find the culprit or culprits before the marine mammals begin giving birth and the newborn dolphins are put at risk. ""There is a sense of urgency. It is important that we find the person or persons who is perpetrating this heinous act,"" said Moby Solangi, lead biologist of The Institute of Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. ""It looks like somebody is deranged. It's really senseless. It's repugnant. It's illegal. I don't understand what sort of person would do such a cruel act,"" Solangi told CNN during an aerial tour of the sites where many of the dolphin carcasses were found. At least seven carcasses have turned up along a 120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast, from Louisiana in the west to Florida in the east. Some have gunshot wounds, others have been mutilated, including one with its jaw cut off. Solangi, who performed necropsies of all the slaughtered dolphins, said the cruelty of what he's seen is the equivalent of having your pet dog's neck sliced. ""This is gruesome really,"" Solangi said. ""It's not only killing them, it's also mutilating them. And the parts that are taken are disposed of; not next to the animal, they are taken. And they are not worth anything."" The first dolphin was found January 8 with a bullet wound on Deer Island, near Biloxi, Mississippi. In June, a bottlenose dolphin was found in Perdido Bay, Florida, near the Florida-Alabama state line, with a screwdriver stuck in its head. In September, one was found on Elmers Island, Louisiana, with a gunshot wound. On October 10, a dolphin was found on the beach in Dauphin Island, Alabama with its fluke cut off. The list gets worse from there. On November 6, a dolphin was found in near Ocean Springs, Mississippi, dead from numerous cuts. Three days later two more were discovered; another one with bullet wounds near Ocean Springs, and one on Ship Island, a remote barrier island off Biloxi, Mississippi, that was found with its jaw cut off. Authorities are still trying to determine if a dead dolphin found November 2, in Bayou Julia, Louisiana, is linked to the other killings. To stop the slaughter before the dolphins' birthing season, which begins soon, federal authorities say they need the public's help. ""We need to have witnesses come forward. We need public input and information,"" said Jeff Radonski, a deputy special agent for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is leading the hunt for the dolphin killer or killers. Investigators hope the culprit has bragged to friends or acquaintances about the killings. The large area over which the carcasses have been found make the investigation more difficult, Radonski said. There could be several motives for the slaughter -- it might be someone who is a ""thrill seeker,"" or fishermen who found the dolphins interfering with their operations on the water, he explained. In at least two previous cases, fishing charter captains have been found guilty of shooting at dolphins that approached their boats, or the fish their passengers had hooked, NOAA told CNN. The Marine Mammal Protection Act states that anyone convicted of killing a dolphin could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $100,000. The law also makes it a crime to feed dolphins in the wild. Lt. Col. Claude Pittman, who patrols in the area of the killings for the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, said he hasn't seen a dolphin shot in his 22 years of work. But these dolphin killings are making him fearful. ""You don't know what type of person is doing this,"" he said. ""Would they carry it any further? I have no idea.""","At least seven dolphins have been slaughtered off the Gulf Coast .

"(CNN) -- Medical tourism is one of the hottest topics in health care as patients around the world are increasingly traveling abroad for treatment. Wockhardt Hospitals in India actively target international patients. Josef Woodman, author of Patients Beyond Borders, a guide to medical tourism, told CNN that two to three million people travel outside their home country for treatment each year, while consultancy firm Deloitte calculates that 750,000 Americans traveled abroad for treatment last year. The top regional destination for medical tourists is Asia, with Singapore, Thailand and India leading the way. Those countries are home to private health care chains that target international patients and are building modern, high-tech hospitals with a reputation for quality care.  See more medical tourism hotspots » . Bumrungrad International Limited (BIL), based in Thailand, owns and operates over 70 health care facilities in seven countries. According to BIL, its Bangkok flagship hospital treats over 400,000 foreign patients a year, with over 90,000 coming from the Middle East. Parkway Health, a Singaporean hospital chain, says the city of Singapore attracted approximately 450,000 international patients last year, and in India, the Apollo Hospitals Group says it has treated more than 60,000 foreign patients in the last five years. What these chains have in common is that at least some of their hospitals are accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI), the global arm of an American nonprofit organization that accredits most U.S. hospitals. That provides overseas patients with the assurance that their treatment will be of an internationally recognized standard. Dr. Ajaya Jha, director of neuroscience at Max Hospital in New Delhi, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that medical tourism to India was being driven by a lack of available health care in neighboring countries, and by the lower cost of treatment in India compared with developed countries. ""Slowly we're developing a reputation for having the best technology in the world and some of best people in the world to do this,"" said Jha. For uninsured or underinsured Americans, low prices make treatment in Asia an attractive option. Surgery in Thailand and Latin America can cost a quarter of its U.S. price, and JCI-accredited Wockhardt Hospitals offer open heart surgery in India for $8,500, compared to around $100,000 in the U.S. and $28,000 in the UK. In countries with state-run health services, such as Britain and Canada, long waiting times for surgery are encouraging patients to look overseas for a cheaper alternative to private treatment in their own country. Would you travel abroad for medical treatment? Share your views in the SoundOff below . But contrary to the popular view of patients traveling from wealthy nations to developing countries for cheap medical care, a recent survey by consultancy firm McKinsey found that most medical tourists travel in search of advanced medical technologies or to receive better care than they would at home. Woodman says 250,000 Indonesians are treated in Singapore each year, while Cambodian and Vietnamese resident choose Thailand for treatment and patients from the Middle East favor Singapore and Thailand. While medical tourism is targeted as a growth industry in some developing countries, there is concern that it will result in a ""brain drain,"" where doctors migrate from public hospitals to private hospitals that cater to international patients. South Korea recently limited foreign patients to no more than five percent of its hospital beds, to ensure domestic patients do not lose out. Woodman says the ""brain drain"" isn't an issue in India, because there are so many talented surgeons and physicians there in the public and private sector. He adds that developing countries can benefit from medical tourism. ""The presence of medical tourism brings a lot of economic clout into a country and raises the bar by forcing at least certain hospitals to rise to the top standards of healthcare,"" he told CNN. While the bulk of medical tourism is for private care, there is a move towards a kind of state-funded medical tourism within the EU. Rulings by the European Court of Justice in recent years have verified the right of all EU citizens to receive healthcare in another member state, paid for by their own country's health system. Diane Dawson, a senior research fellow at the Center for Health Economics at York University, England, told CNN that patients can only take advantage of this if their own country cannot provide treatment without ""undue delay."" That limitation, as well as the difficulty in getting authorization from their own national health system, means that relatively few patients currently travel within the EU for treatment, she said. But an EU draft directive published last year aims to make the approval process easier and more transparent. Keith Pollard, director of British Web site Treatment Abroad, told CNN that the new directive will mean patients will be able to receive treatment abroad regardless of waiting times in their own country. But patients will only be reimbursed up to the amount their treatment costs in their home country and they will probably still require some degree of approval from their own health system. Pollard says that while he doesn't foresee a boom in medical tourism within the EU, he believes the new legislation will encourage patients to seek treatment abroad and help create a European health care market.","Two to three million people travel abroad for medical treatment each year .
Leading destinations for medical tourists include Singapore and Thailand .

"Washington (CNN) -- Flush with re-election vigor, President Barack Obama called Friday for House Republicans to immediately pass a bill already approved by the Senate that would maintain current tax rates for middle-class Americans while increasing taxes of wealthier citizens. In his first public comments since winning Tuesday's vote, Obama expressed openness to negotiate with Congress on how to deal with pending tax hikes and spending cuts that create the so-called fiscal cliff facing the economy at the end of the year. However, he also repeated his longstanding demand that Republican opponents to any kind of tax increase relent to the will of the White House and the Senate -- and now the American people -- in letting tax rates increase on income over $250,000. Nobody in either party wants the middle class, identified as families making less than $250,000 a year, to see taxes increase at the end of the year when lower rates set during the administration of former President George W. Bush will expire, Obama said. ""That makes no sense. It would be bad for the economy,"" he told a White House gathering of what aides described as middle class Americans. ""Let's extend middle class tax cuts right now. Let's do that right now. That one step would give millions of families, 98% of Americans, 97% of small businesses, the certainty that they need going into the new year."" Noting the Senate previously passed a bill to extend the tax cuts to the middle class, but not income over $250,000, Obama said: ""All we need is action from the House."" ""I've got the pen,"" he said, reaching into his pocket to hold one up as the crowd applauded. ""I'm ready to sign the bill right away. I'm ready to do it."" The president also announced he invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House next week to launch talks on finding a solution to the fiscal cliff, as well as consensus on how to strike a comprehensive deal to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. Separately, a bipartisan group of senators known as the ""Gang of Eight"" will reconvene next week to ""assess where they are"" in working out a bipartisan compromise on a long-term deficit agreement, a Senate aide told CNN on Friday. The group's previous talks have yet to bring a breakthrough. The gang of eight includes Democrats Mark Warner of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Bennet of Colorado and the retiring Kent Conrad of North Dakota, along with Republicans Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Mike Crapo of Idaho, and Mike Johanns of Nebraska. Opinion: Leave crisis to Congress . Long and tough negotiation . While offering to consider unspecified reforms to costly entitlement programs sought by Republicans, Obama' s initial salvo in what will be a long and tough negotiation signaled he was unwilling to back down on the tax issue that was a central theme of his election campaign. ""On Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach and that includes Democrats, independents and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts,"" the president said. ""That's how you reduce the deficit; with a balanced approach so our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people."" What's in the fiscal cliff? Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are positioned as the lead negotiators in a showdown between Democrats and Republicans over the issue identified by voters as a top priority: reducing the chronic federal deficits and debt considered a threat to economic prosperity and national security. Boehner, R-Ohio, signaled a willingness to deal on Friday but also maintained hard-line GOP opposition to any tax increase. ""Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want,"" Boehner said at a news conference, noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners. Later, however, he said that ""everything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at."" Boehner also called on Obama to take the lead in offering a workable plan that Republicans can accept but stopped short of providing details, saying: ""I don't want to limit the options available to me or limit the options that might be available to the White House."" Asked if tea party conservatives or others in his caucus might oppose an agreement they don't like, Boehner responded: ""When the president and I have been able to come to an agreement, there has been no problem in getting it passed here in the House."" The brewing political showdown in Washington left U.S. financial markets unconvinced the two sides would resolve their differences and come to an agreement. Analysis: Obama has limits on debt deal . All three U.S. stock indexes ended the week more than 2% lower due to investor concerns about the fiscal cliff's potential impact on the sluggish economy. Markets and American business are also concerned that brinksmanship on the deficit could influence the deadline for raising the nation's debt ceiling and eventually hamper the government's ability to pay its bills. The fiscal cliff comprises two main elements: Tax cuts from the administration of President George W. Bush will expire on December 31, triggering a return to higher Clinton-era rates for everyone. In addition, $1.2 trillion in mandatory across-the-board budget cuts -- known in legislative parlance as the sequester -- will take effect next year unless Congress finds a way to offset that amount in the federal budget. The automatic cuts were intended to motivate legislators to work out an agreement instead of letting the sequester ever actually occur. Republican leverage weakened by election results . Boehner's leverage in negotiating a deal got weakened by the election that returned Obama to the White House, broadened the Democratic majority in the Senate and slightly narrowed the Republican majority in the House. While the election resulted in another split Congress like the current session that has become a symbol of legislative dysfunction, both sides have signaled a possible new openness to an agreement that was unreachable in the past two years. In the final days of the campaign, Vice President Joe Biden referred to private talks with members of Congress on the pending fiscal impacts of expiring tax cuts and mandatory budget cuts. This week, Boehner called on Obama to work with him to complete a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement -- the ""grand bargain"" that eluded them last year. Boehner says GOP willing to compromise on fiscal cliff . Both Boehner and Obama were held back from a deal back then because of pressure from their respective bases, retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio told CNN. ""The 'no-tax pledge' people in the Republican Party yanked Boehner back and the 'don't you dare touch the middle class' entitlement people in the president's party pulled him back, and as a result those talks collapsed,"" LaTourette said. Boehner said this week that a comprehensive agreement won't happen by the end of the year in the lame-duck session of Congress. He proposed that the two sides use that time to set up a framework for substantive negotiations when the new Congress comes in next year while taking short-term steps to avoid the fiscal cliff. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, said such a timetable could work. ""We have a chance in the lame duck to at least start the process, and I think there's a chance to rally bipartisan support,"" he said. ""These are basic issues we can work out, and the president is in a position to do that."" Both sides agree the best outcome would be a broad deal addressing the overall need for deficit reduction, including reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. However, they remain far apart on exactly how to forge such an agreement. Obama campaigned on having wealthy Americans contribute more to deficit reduction efforts, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that the president will veto any package that extends the Bush tax cuts for income over $250,000. ""We can't just cut our way to prosperity,"" Obama said Friday. ""If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes."" Boehner and Republicans oppose raising taxes on anyone, and instead back a broad reform of the tax system that would lower rates further for everyone while eliminating some deductions and loopholes. While Boehner said this week that his side was open to increasing revenue from such reforms, he made clear that such increases should come from resulting economic growth instead of higher tax rates. In essence, Boehner proposed the kind of tax reform championed by failed Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney, whose plan was criticized by Obama and many economists for being unrealistic in assuming that the combination of closed loopholes and economic growth would equal the lost revenue of tax cuts. Obama's victory gives him new leverage in the budget battles after Republicans forced the president and Democrats into prolonged and sometimes bitter showdowns in the last two years. One top Democrat with close ties to leaders on Capitol Hill and the White House said that the imminent expiration of the Bush tax cuts means Obama ""doesn't have to do anything and everyone's taxes go up,"" which is a GOP nightmare. Such an increase would affect personal income tax, the estate tax, dividends and capital gains taxes. In addition, some officials are hinting the feared sequester cuts don't have to be implemented right away in the new year, giving at least a few months for a deal to be worked out. Obama, Boehner stand ground on fiscal cliff . CNN's Jessica Yellin, Ted Barrett, Joe Sterling and Allison Brennan contributed to this report.","President Barack Obama says his election victory shows America backs his plan .

"(CNN) -- Boarded up windows on austerity-hit Main Streets are a familiar site as the economic downturn bites hard, but gleaming storefronts in another corner of the retail sector prove that, for some, the worst of times can also be the best. Luxury brands, including fashion label Burberry and vehicle manufacturer Rolls-Royce, have all enjoyed bumper years, recording slump-busting profits that may raise eyebrows among consumers forced to tighten their non-snakeskin belts. Such income surges will dispel doubts raised when markets first began to falter over the resilience of the high-end market. However, they also redraw the world's shopping map, showing how emerging economies are spreading their spending wings. ""The most fundamental driver for that kind of growth is coming from sales to consumers from emerging markets like China and India,"" said Imran Amed, who runs the Business of Fashion website. ""But also I just returned from Brazil where things are booming."" For Burberry, whose signature trench coat is clearly proof against recession as well as the British weather it was designed for, this translates into a 21% leap in turnover in the last quarter alone. Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, has posted its best results in its 107-year-history thanks to 2011 sales of more than 3,500 of its stately $308,000-plus cars -- a year-on-year profit jump of 31%. Such figures are in contrast to the bleak environment elsewhere in the retail sector. European Commission figures show that sales fell by 2.5% in the eurozone between November 2010 and 2011, and by 1.3% across the European Union. Richard Perks, director of retail research at industry analysis company Mintel, said Europe's luxury brands have remained relatively unaffected by reduced spending because the global consumer base for exclusive goods is expanding, chiefly in Asia. It's a situation that has put luxury retailers in what Bernard Fornas, CEO of French watchmaker and jeweler Cartier, describes as ""a good mood."" ""The luxury market is always more optimistic than most other industries because we have the addition of a new continent -- China,"" he told CNN. ""The Chinese consume locally, but there are about 70 million traveling around the world, so we benefit from that because we sell a dream, we sell emotion and nowadays, more than ever, we need that."" While emerging market appetites have, according to Amed, caught the entire luxury sector on a ""rising tide,"" Guy Chatillon, CEO of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry, says it is important for brands to push hard for their share. However, he says, high-end brands have little to fear from rising raw material costs that have added to the pressures on other sectors of the economy. ""Luxury is about quality detail and authenticity,"" he said. ""It is long term."" Outside of Asia and Brazil, wealthy consumers are also reaching for their Louis Vuitton purses again following several years of downturn-induced caution, according to Amed. He says that while economic hard times have hit those in the middle to lower income brackets, in countries such as Britain and the United States ""there's an elite class of consumer that remains untouched by the crisis."" ""Everyone stopped shopping in 2008 because there was a crisis of confidence; everyone's financial portfolio was hit,"" he said. ""And, even if you did have money and weren't that affected by everything, it was seen as a bit crass to go out spending on luxury goods. Now that a certain amount of time has elapsed, I think that hesitation to shop has dissipated somewhat and the big spenders are out spending again.""","Luxury brands including Burberry and Rolls-Royce report strong profits .

"(CNN) -- Scientist and conservationist Eugene Ratagarama has spent 20 years protecting Africa's endangered mountain gorillas in war-torn Rwanda. Today he is the Director for the International Gorilla Conservation Program (IGCP), the first African to be appointed. But it has not been an easy task. In his quest to preserve the mountain gorilla, Ratagarama has faced persecution, death and has seen a number of his colleagues killed during one of the worst ethnic conflicts of the 20th century. Ratagarama first became involved with mountain gorillas in 1990, when he worked as a plant researcher for the Karisoke Research Centre, in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. It was during this time a rebel group calling themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front attacked the country. Ratagarama was arrested as a Tutsi and persecuted. Released in 1991, he fled to Burundi, lucky to escape with his life, he told CNN. He lived in exile for three years and at the end of the 1994 genocide, Ratagarama returned home determined to protect the mountain gorilla and its natural habitat. But he was unprepared for the devastation his country had suffered, and returned to find his entire family, including his mother, father and three brothers dead; slaughtered during the genocide. Speaking of the genocide, Ratagarama said: ""Rwanda was devastated. You would see the bodies of dead people, thousands of people. The whole country had to resume from scratch. My attention went to the national park,"" he told CNN . In order to save the mountain gorilla, his goal was to maintain and preserve the national parklands. But after so many years of war the environmental degradation was extensive. Extremist militia groups and government officials continued to fight in the parks. This was perhaps the most dangerous time for the conservationists, with a number of park rangers and guides killed, either by the numerous land mines scattered along forest paths or caught in the cross fire of the warring factions. But it was the mass movement of refugees that was the greatest threat to the regions' mountain gorillas. Forced from their homes, they swarmed into national parks on an unprecedented scale. The sheer numbers of displaced people could have spelt the end for Volcanoes National Park, but it was Ratagarama's persistent efforts and intense lobbying that ensured huge areas of wildlife were preserved, as the country struggled to resettle more than two million people. Today things are looking brighter. Ratagarama and his team are at the forefront of eco-tourism, with the money they make going towards the preservation of mountain gorillas and the neighboring communities near the parks. Not only has Ratagarama helped to save the endangered mountain gorilla, but his conservation tactics are now used in other war-torn regions struggling to preserve their wildlife. For his tireless efforts, Ratagarama was awarded the Jean Paul Getty Prize in 1996, the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2001 and recognized as a CNN Hero in 2007.

"New York (CNN) -- About this time last year, Kate Rigaut was surrounded by 15 of her closest relatives, heaping turkey, stuffing and two kinds of potatoes onto her plate. Football was on television, beers were in the fridge and the family was together. ""That's how it should be,"" she said, stirring the cranberry sauce for this year's Thanksgiving dinner. Her tight-knit Irish-American family lives on New York's Rockaway Peninsula in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, where a powerful mix of converging weather systems flattened homes on October 29. When the storm hit, a series of tidal surges crashed through the neighborhood as high winds whipped along the coast, leaving billions of dollars in damage and thousands homeless. Volunteers help Sandy victims start over . ""We normally don't evacuate, but did this time,"" Rigaut said. She fled with her family to her sister-in-law's place in New Jersey one day before Superstorm Sandy made landfall. But her neighbor, Christine Mahoney-Schneider, decided to stay and brave the torrents unleashed on this coastal community and others like it along the East Coast. After each storm surge, she uploaded photos of the aftermath to Facebook, keeping Rigaut abreast of the condition of her home. As the hours progressed and the photos streamed in, tension mounted. By late evening on October 29, it became clear that Sandy had rendered the Rigaut family homeless. ""My knees buckled, and I fell,"" said Rigaut, who is 52 and an attorney. ""I inherited that house from mom and dad. And we had spent the year renovating."" The ""Douglas family compound,"" as she called it (referencing her maiden name), had been in the family for generations, serving as a gathering spot for neighborhood get-togethers and holiday festivities. Built in 1937, it was where her parents hosted beach parties and entertained neighbors with beer, wine and music that would often carry along a beachfront that residents lovingly coined the ""Irish Riviera."" During the holidays, throngs of Rigaut's nieces and nephews squeezed onto mismatched chairs set around a cherry oak dining-room table that she inherited from her grandmother. Filling their stomachs with stuffed sausage and mushrooms, bread with raspberry and walnuts and sweet potato pie with marshmallows, they would then retire to the family-room couch or their own homes just a few doors down the block. ""It's the kind of thing that's lost in America today. Having that fabric of the family in the same neighborhood,"" she said. Now, many of those cherished physical spaces in the Rockaways are gone in Sandy's wake. The first floor of Rigaut's two-story home collapsed, and its two decks all but disappeared into the sand. Rigaut's husband, Mike, uncovered the frayed wooden leg of that dining-room table -- one of many family heirlooms lost in the storm -- down the block, sticking out from a pile of trash. Still, Rigaut seemed determined to celebrate this year's holidays in the same fashion to which she was accustomed: surrounded by her family. Jersey Shore community gives thanks even after Sandy . ""For us, it's like the house died, but we didn't,"" she said. Sandy caused 119 deaths in the United States, including 43 in New York City and 33 in New Jersey. The Rigauts and their neighbors managed to escape with their lives. Yet three weeks after the storm, they say they still have not received any form of compensation. ""On top of all of this sadness, we are struggling with the insurance companies,"" said Rigaut, whose family is now holed up in a rental home in southern New Jersey. Undeterred, they say they plan to pile into the car Thursday and head north, joining 13 other relatives for Thanksgiving dinner in Belle Harbor at her sister's storm-battered, though still functional, home. ""My sister was out buying air mattresses,"" she said. ""It's going to be a little tight, sleeping like the Irish did after Ellis Island: 12 to a room!"" But with a daughter who is ""borderline asthmatic,"" the Rigauts say they plan to stay only one night. What local residents call ""the Rockaway dust"" has them concerned. Rotting drywall, mold and piles of garbage across the Rockaway Peninsula have residents worried about worsening air quality in the region, though officials were not immediately available to comment on the relatively new phenomenon. A red sticker on the Rigauts' old front door signifies that the city has condemned the building and plans to demolish it. The remains of their home will now likely join the massive garbage heaps along the Rockaway shore, adding to potential health concerns. iReport: Who's at your Thanksgiving table?

"(CNN) -- Jessica Ridgeway's suspected killer is a 17-year-old neighbor who authorities plan to try as an adult, officials in Colorado said Wednesday. Formal charges against Austin Reed Sigg, a high school student who lived about one mile from the 10-year-old and her family, likely will be filed Monday, Jefferson County District Attorney Pam Russell said. As a general policy, CNN does not show the booking photo or name suspects who are juveniles, but in this case, police had mentioned Sigg's name and released his photograph in hopes the public could provide information related to the case. Sigg will face murder and kidnapping charges in death of Ridgeway, who was found a few days after she disappeared on her way to school on October 5. Her body -- which was ""not intact,"" according to police -- was found at a park in Arvada, a Denver suburb just five miles from the family's home in Westminster. ""We hope and pray that this arrest gives them some measure of closure in dealing with this horrible loss and tragedy they have suffered,"" Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk told reporters. Ridgeway's family was told Wednesday morning that an arrest was made, police said. One of her great-grandmothers said she feels like she wants to set the suspect on fire. ""I don't think I can look at this person, into his face and not be judgmental,"" Donna Moss told reporters outside her home in Independence, Missouri. ""I think what I have, it's all I've got within me to not want to just burn him. And I mean burn him."" A warrant was served Wednesday at Sigg's home. He will have his first court appearance at 8 a.m. Thursday. Police said a tip led them to Sigg's home, police said in a news release. That visit allowed police to make an arrest in the Ridgeway case, as well as another case -- an attempted abduction near Ketner Lake. Sigg also will be charged with attempted kidnapping and attempted murder charges, the district attorney said. CNN's Carma Hassan and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Formal charges against Austin Reed Sigg, 17, expected to be filed Monday .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Amid the celebrations that greeted the declaration of a winner in Egypt's first freely elected presidential vote, a British student journalist was being sexually assaulted by a mob in Tahrir Square. Natasha Smith recounted the experience on her blog and in an interview with CNN. Smith, who has since left Egypt, wrote that the moving demonstrations of freedom turned to horror ""in a split second"" when dozens of frenzied men dragged her away from two male companions and began to grope her ""with increasing force and aggression."" ""Men started ripping off all my clothes,"" she told CNN. ""First of all, it was my skirt, and that just went straight away, and I didn't even feel my underwear being removed. Then my shoes went and clothes on my upper half were just being ripped off me, and that was quite painful."" During the assault, ""I was just in this weird, detached state of mind, and I just kept saying, 'Please God, please make it stop. Please, God, make it stop.' "" Her experience echoes the assaults faced by two prominent female reporters, CBS News correspondent Lara Logan and Egyptian-American columnist Mona Eltahawy, who has said her attackers were officers at a police station. One of Smith's friends, Callum Paton, told CNN the mob dragged Smith naked across the ground before another group of men stepped in to protect her. Read Natasha Smith's account. ""There were several moments at which I thought she was going to die,"" Paton said. ""And I think that really the fact that we are still alive, and especially Natasha's still alive, was because there were so many people who were willing to help us and were willing to risk their own lives and put them in direct danger to get her out of that situation."" Smith was on her first international assignment, shooting a documentary on women's rights in Egypt as her final college project. A doctor who treated Smith and a British Embassy official who met her at the hospital corroborrated her account for CNN. ""If there hadn't been a small group of men around me, I would have been raped and killed,"" she said. ""That's just without question, because that's what the men were trying to do. It was very clear what they were trying to do to me. They weren't just trying to play around with me, they were gunning for me for whatever reason."" On her blog, she wrote that an ambulance pulled up at one point, but it was forced to leave when it ""was invaded by tens of men."" Even after being escorted to a medical tent by volunteers who formed a cordon around her, her attackers surrounded the tent. Women who assisted her told her the attack ""was motivated by rumors spread by troublemaking thugs that I was a foreign spy, following a national advertising campaign warning of the dangers of foreigners."" ""Arab women, Muslim women were all around me, just crying, saying 'This is not Egypt! This is not Egypt! This is not Islam! These are thugs!' "" she told CNN. She said she responded, ""I know, I love Egypt, I know this is not Islam, it's OK. ""And they were stunned, 'cause they thought I was going to be so full of hate and so full of fear. But from the very beginning, I don't blame Egypt for this. This is not the workings of the Egyptian people. This is not representative."" To escape, she said, ""I was told I had to put my trust in this Egyptian man. I was disguised in a burqa and let out of this tent with this man, barefoot and I had to pretend to be his wife and walk through the streets and he kept just saying to me, 'Don't cry. Do not cry. If you cry, people will know.' "" On her blog, she complained about her treatment at the hospital, noting that the doctor's first question was whether she was married, ""which is of course the most important question to be asking a victim of mass sexual abuse."" ""He and a female nurse (who only reluctantly kept me covered up) looked briefly at the damage and just wandered off, saying that because I didn't have internal bleeding, they couldn't do anything,"" she wrote. ""A useful trip, that was."" But the doctor, Mohammed Meligi, said Smith's account may be ""a misunderstanding, because she was here first time to enter the Egyptian hospital."" Smith said her case will get attention ""because I'm British and I'm young and I'm a girl,"" but she said other Egyptian women ""will often suffer these attacks and worse attacks and there'll be no justice done."" ""There's been an outpouring of support, and I'm so grateful for that,"" she said. But she said she wished that support could be shared with ""all women, of all nationalities, wherever they are."" ""I'll be so happy if this could make any difference to other women who are in this situation, not just in Egypt, not just in the Middle East, but everywhere,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice made a second trip to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to answer questions from Republican senators about the September 11 attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Rice, who is believed to be President Barack Obama's choice to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, triggered controversy with her appearance on television talk shows in the days after the Benghazi attack to explain what was known about it. She spoke from unclassified talking points provided by the intelligence community which said the armed assault was spontaneous and fueled by an anti-Islam video produced in the United States that had already sparked a notable protest in Egypt. U.S. officials have since described it as a terror attack aimed at American interests. In a statement released after her Senate meetings on Tuesday, Rice said that she explained to senators that ""the talking points provided by the intelligence community -- and the initial assessment upon which they were based -- were incorrect in a key respect: There was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi. While we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack, as is often the case, the intelligence assessment has evolved."" Opinion: Republican obsession with Benghazi makes no sense . Here are five questions around Rice's involvement in the controversy. Q: Why is Rice the focal point in the Benghazi attack? A: Rice was the the Obama administration's spokesman on Sunday talk shows several days following the attack and made several claims that turned out to be wrong. The primary complaint from Republicans is that Rice's remarks were centered on anger over the anti-Islam film, ""Innocence of Muslims,"" when there was classified intelligence available suggesting a possible al Qaeda link. Ayotte: Rice 'certainly' misled on Benghazi, but unsure of motive . Republicans feel that the administration misled the American people before the presidential election, won by Barack Obama, because an al Qaeda attack countered the narrative that Obama's policies, in Rice's words, had ""decimated"" al Qaeda. For Republican critics, Rice illustrates their problems with how the Obama administration has responded to the Benghazi attack and its fallout. Q: What are Republican problems with her possible nomination as secretary of state? A: Most opposition to Rice as a candidate to replace Clinton centers around her role in the Benghazi affair. Sen. Lindsay Graham, who has been supportive of Obama's nominees for the Surpreme Court, says he does not feel comfortable with someone who, in his view, was involved in using misinformation as a Cabinet-level official. Other Republicans argue that Rice is not independent enough to be America's top diplomat. They see her as someone who blindly follows Obama and puts politics over national security. In a dig at Rice, Sen. Bob Corker, who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Rice would be a better fit for chairman of the Democratic National Committee than secretary of state. Could the GOP block Rice for secretary of state? Rice is not without her supporters, however. In addition to staunch backing among Senate Democrats, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Independent and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, met with Rice and said he was satisfied with her answers. ""Based on her public record and her public service, I would not feel that her appearances and anything she said on those Sunday morning talk shows September 16th would disqualify her for appointment to any other office,"" Lieberman said. But Rice's biggest champion is Obama. During a news conference earlier this month, he said: ""Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill, and professionalism, and toughness, and grace."" Rice fails to subdue Republicans' criticism over Libya attack . Q: How much of the GOP's questioning of Rice is politically motivated? A: To some extent, the harsh treatment of Rice is motivated by politics. Republicans believe the president's handling of the aftermath of the Benghazi attack shows a lack of leadership and tried to make that a campaign issue. Ironically, some are frustrated that Obama's challenger, Mitt Romney, did not take enough advantage of this in the presidential campaign. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid this week called the attacks on Rice ""outrageous, utterly unmoored from facts and reality."" In a statement, Reid said, ""The election is over. It is time to drop these partisan political games, and focus our attention on the real challenges facing us as a nation."" Q: Are there other issues besides political ones? A: For some senators like John McCain, this is personal. Christopher Stevens was a good friend of McCain, which is why he is working hard to avenge his death. Others have voiced questions about whether Rice is the best choice for the job -- she is a tough talker who some might see as too blunt to be secretary of state. However, most Republican senators have generally had positive remarks about her record as U.N. ambassador and said their criticism centers around her role in the Benghazi affair. Q: Are there others they would rather see Obama nominate to replace Clinton? A: McCain and several other senators have said that Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, would make an excellent choice. Kerry is another top contender for the position who has made no secret of the fact he would like the job. After meeting with Rice on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said, ""I think John Kerry would be an excellent appointment and would be easily confirmed by his colleagues."" Some political experts speculate that part of the enthusiasm for Kerry could be that his departure would trigger a special election in Massachusetts, where recently defeated Republican Scott Brown could run again and give the GOP another seat in the Senate. Collins leaves Rice meeting with questions; says Kerry would be confirmed easily .","Rice is focal point in Benghazi response; GOP feels she misled Americans in comments .
Some Republicans don't think Rice is independent enough to be secretary of state .
For John McCain, the fight over a possible Rice nomination may be personal .

"(CNN) -- It was a remarkably short interview by cable news standards. The moment that veteran military reporter Thomas Ricks, in an appearance on Fox News, begin to unload on Fox, he found his segment abruptly ended. Thank you, very much. Nice of you to drop by. Adios, amigo. Some of those who love to dish it out, it seems, aren't very big on taking it. The self-protective shield that some media organizations erect around their companies is hardly limited to Rupert Murdoch's network. But what happened with Ricks this week is a case study in sidelining a guest who dared challenge the premise of a story. To be sure, anchor Jon Scott was polite and didn't interrupt Ricks, but he couldn't have hustled him off the set faster if he had used a vaudeville-style hook. Watch: Should Fox have pulled plug on Tom Ricks for ripping the network? Ricks, a longtime reporter for the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, has been making the rounds to talk about his latest book, ""The Generals."" (He appeared on ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday, and I welcomed his criticism of the media.) Fox, not surprisingly, wanted to focus on an issue that it frames as a scandal: the Obama administration's handling of the fatal attack on American diplomats in Libya. Watch: Twitter on fire as Chris Brown slimes a female critic . Fox's angle was clear from Scott's setup: ""Right now, pressure mounting on the Obama administration over its response to the deadly attack on our consulate in Benghazi."" But Ricks didn't pull his punches based on the venue. ""I think Benghazi was generally hyped by this network especially,"" he said. Scott pushed back, which he had every right to do: ""When you have four people dead, including the first U.S. ambassador in more than 30 years, how do you call that hype?"" That's when Ricks, after explaining the difficulty of determining what happened in a firefight, went for the jugular: ""I think that the emphasis on Benghazi has been extremely political, partly because Fox was operating as a wing of the Republican Party."" The interview was over, less than 90 seconds after it started. Was Ricks being deliberately provocative? Perhaps he was, for controversy sells books. And maybe his criticism was overstated. But the fact remains that he was invited as a guest, was asked about the Libya attack and responded in a way that made Fox's relentless coverage of the controversy part of the story. And that was deemed unacceptable. Watch: Is it time for Chelsea Clinton, gay rights activist, to leave NBC? Michael Clemente, Fox's executive vice president, told me that Ricks's conduct ""felt like a stunt ... That was just bush league, especially for a veteran reporter."" Ricks wasn't answering the anchor's question, says Clemente, and Scott, feeling ""offended,"" decided that ""I'm not going to give this guy any more airtime."" What's more, Clemente says, Ricks ""apologized"" to a Fox staffer on the way out. Ricks denies this, saying he told the staffer, who accused him of being rude, that he ""might have been a bit snappish"" because he was tired from his book tour. ""This was in no way an apology,"" Ricks told me, ""but rather an explanation of why I jumped a bit when the anchor began the segment with the assertion that pressure on the White House was building, which it most clearly was not."" As for the interview itself, ""I was not picking a fight with Fox. I was answering their questions."" Watch: Why Matt Lauer is getting a bum rap on Twitter . Had Scott wanted to argue that his network was right to pound away at the administration's shifting stories on Libya, and that it was the rest of the media that was underplaying the matter, they could have had a substantive discussion. Instead, it was over before it began. ""You have a point,"" Clemente said. ""It could have been a back-and-forth debate. But that's just not Jon's style. Jon is a more traditional anchor-reporter."" The episode reminded me of an uncomfortable clash in 2010 when Fox anchor Megyn Kelly repeatedly berated Kirsten Powers, a liberal contributor to the network, for challenging her constant harping on a minor scandal involving the New Black Panther Party. Kelly repeatedly interrupted her guest, told Powers she didn't know what she was talking about and at one point threatened to cut her mike. The difference is that Kelly later realized she had gone too far and told me she had apologized to Powers. The anchor, of course, holds the power in such situations. In May, MSNBC's Tamron Hall was interviewing Tim Carney, a conservative columnist for the Washington Examiner. She asked about Mitt Romney's testy reaction to a reporter's question, the day after a report that the candidate had bullied another student in high school, when Carney tried to turn the tables. ""What you're doing here is a typical media trick,"" he said. ""You hype up a story and justify the second-day coverage of the story."" Hall began lecturing Carney, saying ""you don't have to answer a single question and you didn't have to accept the invitation to come on ... You're kind of in my house here,"" as if he were an unruly dinner guest. As Carney tried to get a word in, Hall kept talking over him: ""You're irritating me right now ... You're not gonna come on and insult me, you're not gonna come on and insult the network when you knew what we were gonna talk about. Done."" And he was. The anchor went to another guest and Carney had been summarily dismissed for challenging MSNBC's handling of the story. Watch: Media buzzing as Newt Gingrich says he may run again . What's at issue here is not that on-air personalities sometimes let their tempers flare; anyone spending many hours on the air (including me) may get a little peevish now and then. It's an attitude that one's own organization is so above reproach that a guest's criticism amounts to insulting behavior. And since anchors pride themselves on their aggressive questioning, they look small and defensive when they shut down the guest. Not everyone fits this description, of course. In fact, Fox's Bill O'Reilly seems to relish the chance to repeat the swipes of anyone who takes him on, punch back and invite the offender on for a debate (which many decline). Cable news can be a rough arena. But honest debate, even with puglistic guests, ought to be a two-way street. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","A Fox News interview with author Thomas Ricks was cut short .

"(CNN) -- Human error is to blame in last week's gas-fueled explosion that ripped through a strip club in the western Massachusetts city of Springfield, officials said Sunday. The blast injured at least 21 people, including firefighters. A utility worker, responding to a report of a gas odor inside a building, inadvertently punctured a hole in a high-pressure gas line at the foundation of that building, according to a statement from the Office of the State Fire Marshal. Markings on the sidewalk incorrectly indicated where the line was. Once the pipe was punctured, the worker called the gas company and the fire department to shut off the gas, and the area around the building was evacuated. Investigators believe gas from the leak entered the building and later ignited. ""They (investigators) have determined that human error as opposed to a fault of the gas infrastructure provided the fuel for the explosion. Exactly whose human error will be the subject of the Department of Public Utilities' ongoing investigation,"" the statement read. The blast occurred at 5:25 p.m.Friday. Twelve of the 14 firefighters on scene were injured, according to Springfield Fire Commissioner Joseph Conant. ""All have been treated and released but several will face a long recovery road,"" he said. Four gas company employees, two police officers, a municipal water and sewer department employee and two civilians were also injured, according to the city's mayor. People as far away as South Hadley, 10 miles north, felt the blast. Video showed that the facade of one building was shredded by the blast, while glass from blown-out windows littered streets blocks away. Besides the leveled multistory structure that housed Club Scores, 12 buildings suffered significant damage, and at least a dozen others had collateral damage, Conant said.","A utility worker inadvertently poked a hole in a gas line in Springfield, Massachusetts .

"Cincinnati, Ohio (CNN) -- The build-up has been years in the making. From the cartoons that many of us watched as children, we envisioned a world where machines and robots would penetrate every aspect of our lives, where each household would have a Rosie the Robot to cook, clean, and put the kids to bed. Well, for most of us that washed our own dishes last night, we know that we are not there yet. The questions are: why aren't we there yet and when will we get there? Well, the world of machines is real and it's coming. Many refer to it as Machine-to-Machine (M2M), the Internet of Things, or the Industrial Internet. All of these terms describe the same thing: automated technology that allows machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit. This exchange of information is rapidly changing the way we work and live. You likely benefit from this technology every day without even knowing it. M2M applications are guiding you in your connected vehicles to the nearest Starbucks, or allowing you to remotely monitor your home from a smartphone. The applications bleed even more heavily into the enterprise space where companies are using M2M solutions to do everything from tracking the position of a high-value asset traveling through Europe to controlling the flow rate of an oil pipeline in North Dakota from an office in New York. Read related: 7 craziest things connected to the internet . So, with this technology available, why aren't we there yet? Why isn't M2M permeating every aspect of our business and personal lives yet? And, more importantly, why am I still doing my own dishes? Well, it is not due to lack of demand. Analysts and industry experts project that the Internet of Things will grow from connecting about 100 million devices today to more than two billion devices by 2021 -- representing a staggering 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Do I think that this type of growth will become a reality? Yes, but there are a couple of complexities that will first need to be worked out. As a matter of fact, complexity is the first of two threats to M2M growth. Many enterprise M2M solutions require months, if not years, and a significant financial commitment to get to deployment. With those daunting hurdles facing many technology decision makers, and despite an average return on investment at around 40%, companies are deferring their M2M strategies. Obviously, this has to change in order for M2M to reach its immense promise. We need to get to a point where implementing an M2M strategy involves a matter of hours or days instead of months and years. When that is a reality, then we will start to see the realization of what M2M can be for both enterprise and consumer use. Read related: Cisco's new, smarter network for the Internet of things . The second threat to M2M growth has to do with the shift in the mobile industry towards 3G and 4G networks. At first glance, that seems a bit odd. How could enhancing the technology that M2M sits on pose a threat to its very future? As mobile carriers negotiate with limited spectrum to support 4G rollouts, 2G networks are often sacrificed. The problem created is that M2M applications not only lose support, but they face significant expenses to enter into a 3G or 4G system where their data usage does not come close to justifying the costs, not to mention the significant capital investment required for a pricey 3G or 4G compatible device. Although I believe that M2M applications will evolve to a point where a 4G network will make sense, I don't believe that we are there yet, nor will we be there for at least a couple more years. Thus, 2G will have to remain an integral part of the growth of the industry for the time being, and fortunately there are carriers that have pledged ongoing support for 2G. As momentum for the proliferation of the Internet of Things builds to forecasted levels and enterprises and individuals enter this brave new world, there will be some bumps along the road. However, it will be a much smoother and quicker ride into the future if application providers can find easy-to-implement solutions supported by networks that meet their tactical and financial objectives. When we get to that point, then you might just be able to kick back a little and let Rosie handle things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Horn.","M2M technology allows machines to exchange information with one another .
100 million devices are already connected .
Industry analysts predict there will be two billion M2M-connected devices by 2021 .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's Christmas in 1787 at Mount Vernon, George Washington's stately home in Alexandria, Virginia. Holidays in the 18th century were usually pretty low key, according to Dean Norton, director of Horticulture at the first president's estate. ""It was just all a matter of family being together to enjoy good food, good drink, good family time. And certainly when you add a camel to the mix, it adds a little bit of specialness to the whole atmosphere,"" he said. A camel? According to Washington's ledger, he paid 18 schillings, a pretty hefty amount for that time, to ""the man who brot. A Camel from Alex. for a show"" on December 29, 1787. Historians know that Washington paid to see exotic and rare animals throughout his life including a lioness and a tiger. ""During his presidency, he paid to see a cougar, a sea leopard, which is kind of like a sea lion, an elephant, and three dollars to see a very smart dog who apparently could beat anybody at this particular card game,"" according to Norton. He spent the equivalent of $1.75 to see the elephant during his presidency and was so impressed that several months later he went back with the whole family. But as to the reason he brought a camel to Mount Vernon that Christmas, no one really knows. It's possible that he heard that the camel was being shown in Alexandria and he asked if the owner or handler would bring it to Mount Vernon. At the time, entrepreneurs would acquire rare or exotic animals and travel around with them charging the populace to see the animal. Then again, the camel's owner or handler may have found out that George Washington lived down the road and may have visited Mount Vernon hoping that the ex-president would pay to see the camel. Regardless, it wasn't cheap. ""If I were the gardener at that time in 1787, I would have been making 20 pounds a year, so it would have come out to about 400 schillings, so it would be half a weeks salary for me for me to pay to see a camel and I certainly wouldn't do that today,"" said Norton. Mt. Vernon historians estimate that Washington paid enough for 24 adults, or 48 children to see the camel at the going rates for that time. Today, in honor of that Christmas in 1787, visitors to Mt. Vernon during the Christmas season can see and pet a dromedary, or a one humped camel, named Aladdin.","Washington paid paid 18 schillings, a pretty hefty amount, for a man to bring a camel to Mount Vernon .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Must art always serve politics? To audiences overseas, contemporary art in China is typified by Ai Weiwei, the most trenchant critic of China's artistic and political restrictions. But not all Chinese artists subscribe to Ai Weiwei's approach. Ai Jing (no relation), once a popular singer-songwriter, is back in Beijing from a long hiatus, this time representing one school of China's contemporary art scene. Her style is mostly uplifting and features politics as an afterthought, if at all. Small wonder, perhaps, that she is the first Chinese contemporary artist to hold an exhibition in the iconic National Museum of China, next to Tiananmen Square, which is better known for revolutionary history exhibits than modern art. Ai Jing's solo show opened just a few days after the Communist Party concluded its leadership transition in the Great Hall of the People, across the sprawling square. ""We chose Ai Jing based on our understanding of her artwork and of public expectation,"" said Chen LÃ¼sheng, the deputy director of the National Museum. ""We believe Ai Jing's art pieces will connect China's 5,000 years history with modern art."" Chinese art-lovers know Ai Jing best as a pop singer and song-writer. The 43-year-old Ai has cut five albums since 1992, becoming a widely popular folk and pop singer in the 1990s. She moved to New York in 1997 and spent nearly a decade there honing her skills as an installation artist. Her work has been featured in several New York art galleries, including the Urban Art Infill, which exhibited her piece ""Sounds of New York"". Richard Vine, a New York-based art critic who has been visiting China since 2000, likes the universality of ""My Mom and My Hometown,"" a tapestry of woolen patches knitted by Ai's mother and bedecked with the English word ""LOVE"". ""It expands outwardly, first for the family, community, nation and then the world. With one piece like this, she is able to touch both poles,"" Vine said. Ai does not shy away from love's racier themes. One section shows square panels printed with ""I love sex,"" and ""love me, suck me."" She looks at the darker side too. ""The Tree of Life,"" an installation art, depicts a lonely raven perched on a leafless oak tree made of disposable chopsticks. Her Warhol-inspired pop-art reproduces Marc Riboud's picture of ""Flower Girl,"" which shows a woman holding a flower in front of gun-toting soldiers during an anti-war march in the United States during the 1960s. ""We hope to present the public with multiple styles of modern art to show that not all art is the same,"" Chen of the National Museum said. ""Ai Jing may not be the most popular contemporary Chinese artist, but she is one of the most special."" Ai Jing's works are typically wholesome and uplifting, unlike many Chinese contemporary art works now popular overseas. The paintings of Zeng Fanzhi, for example, are typically bold and edgy, sometimes dark -- and selling for millions of dollars in galleries and art auctions. (An art collector has called Zeng ""The Jackson Pollock of the 21st century."") Lin Tianmiao is now known for her bold surrealism, using naked body casts of herself or building a walk-in human ""womb"" strewn with disfigured bodies. She recently had her work featured at Asia Society in New York. Also popular overseas are the irreverent creations of Ai Weiwei, some of which are blunt commentaries of what he sees are the dark side of life in China. ""We don't want extremist and esoteric pieces,"" Chen said. Ai Jing's message of love, he says, is what the Chinese public wants. Her theme of love may seem ""corny,"" art critic Richard Vine agreed, but ""it's not something that she is just falling into thoughtlessly. It's a very considered conviction that this is after all the best response to the difficulties of life.""","Ai Jing, a popular singer, represents one school of China's contemporary art scene .

"(CNN) -- A bridge failed in Paulsboro, New Jersey, on Friday, sending four train cars -- at least one leaking a toxic chemical -- crashing into a creek near the Delaware River. Four of the cars involved in the crash were carrying the chemical -- a highly toxic and flammable substance called vinyl chloride -- which leaked from at least one tank car into Mantua Creek, New Jersey emergency and environmental officials said. A total of seven rail cars derailed. Some 71 patients with respiratory issues and scratchy throats went to Underwood-Memorial Hospital, officials said. Sixty-eight were later discharged; three remained in stable condition, said hospital spokeswoman Molly Tritt. Nearby schools placed students on lockdown, and authorities ordered evacuations in a very limited area around the accident. At a news conference, a state environmental official indicated that much of the danger had passed, but he warned residents to stay alert for public safety announcements. ""It appears that all of the vinyl chloride that was in the particular car has dissipated,"" said Larry Hajna of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ""There's no more release going on."" Booms have been placed in the creek as a precaution, he said, to contain about 180,000 pounds of chemicals that leaked. The air surrounding the wreck is being monitored and is safe, the official said. Later, department spokesman Larry Ragonese offered CNN a more definitive assessment, saying, ""There is no environmental emergency."" Video of the train wreck site from CNN affiliate WPVI showed two tanker cars dangling from the collapsed railroad bridge. Other cars were in the creek, partially sunken amid rising smoke. Watch helicopter video of the collapsed bridge and train wreckage . Vinyl chloride is used to make plastic and vinyl products, including PVC pipes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which has labeled the chemical a Group A human carcinogen. ""Short-term exposure to high levels of vinyl chloride in air has resulted in central nervous system effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and headaches,"" the EPA says on its website. The remaining overturned railroad cars ""are going to have to be righted,"" said Paulsboro spokesman John Burzichelli. Mindful of the two cars dangling from the wrecked bridge, Burzichelli said that ""there's probably going to be one car that's going to be a very delicate move."" ""It's a time for caution,"" he said, warning residents to listen for announcements as the emergency is assessed. Burzichelli described the bridge as ""a very old structure"" that underwent ""a major rebuild"" three years ago. Officials said some posts had failed before the work. Three ""major trains"" go across the bridge each day, he said. Federal safety officials will look at maintenance histories for the track and bridge and conduct standard drug and alcohol testing of the crew. Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters near the scene that the freight-only bridge is owned and operated by Conrail. It was too early to determine a cause of the incident, she said. Other agencies will work to remove the wreckage and get the rest of the material out of the breached tank car. ""We will be proceeding with caution,"" Hersman said. The train consisted of two locomotives, 82 rail cars and a caboose and originated from Camden. Conrail said it will work closely with local, federal and public health authorities in the wake of the crash. ""We very much regret the impacts to the community and deeply appreciate the efforts of the first response teams and officials,"" it said in a written statement. Related: Residents told to remain aware . Immediately after the wreck, residents told WPVI that they smelled an odor in the area. Authorities warned residents to stay indoors as a precaution and to keep windows closed. The Coast Guard sent crews to the scene to begin cleanup efforts.

"(CNN) -- A member of American Front, a white supremacist group, has pleaded guilty in Florida to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and will serve three years in prison, prosecutors said. Christopher Brooks, 27, was one of 14 people charged this year in connection to an investigation into the group. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dropped two other felony counts -- participating in paramilitary training and conspiracy to shoot into an occupied dwelling -- according to Osceola County State Attorney's Office spokesman Bernie Presha. Brooks, who pleaded guilty Wednesday, is the first of the 14 to resolve his case. The alleged ringleader of the group, Marcus Faella, is scheduled to go on trial this month. According to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups. Faella, police documents say, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California. The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL. ""Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race,"" investigators wrote in an affidavit, referring to the group by its initials. ""Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities."" According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at a compound in Saint Cloud, Florida, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote. The group was allegedly making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation. The charges came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound after Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had made of training exercises, according to the arrest affidavit.

"(CNN) -- Thinking about Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' efforts this week to gain observer status as a nonmember state, I'm reminded of one of my favorite ""Seinfeld"" episodes. Sitting in the Restaurant -- the venue for so many of the best ""Seinfeld"" bits -- George and Jerry conspire to produce a new sitcom, a show literally about nothing. Not surprisingly, the idea comes to nothing as well, though the ironic brilliance that the very show they want to produce already exists adds a cool philosophical edge to the comedy. Sadly, like the ""Seinfeld"" episode, the Palestinian effort to gain entry into the U.N. General Assembly as an observer state will come to nothing as well, even if -- as is likely -- he succeeds. And that's the real tragedy. Success will neither provide the gains Palestinians hope to achieve nor the disasters that opponents of the initiative predict. In the end, Abbas and the Palestinians will be no closer to statehood and perhaps even a little further away. Motives . Frustrated by the world's seeming indifference to the Palestinian issue and weakened by his inability to deliver anything, Abbas is desperate for an end-of- the-year success of some kind. Blocked by Washington and the U.N. Security Council last year from gaining admission as a state, he's fallen back on the idea of observer status, an initiative that can't be vetoed by the Americans and is likely to succeed in the General Assembly. Opinion: Why U.S., Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N. Observer status is largely a symbolic issue, but the Palestinian Authority might then have access to other U.N.-affiliated agencies, including the International Criminal Court, assuming that body would be willing to entertain Palestinian claims and charges against Israel. Indeed, Palestinian desperation is accompanied by a Palestinian assessment that the international arena offers a fertile field to score political points and to pressure and isolate the Israelis. Call it a kind of global station identification for an organization -- Fatah -- that's run out of options. What matters is what happens on the ground . If the history of this issue shows anything, it demonstrates that what really counts is what happens between Israelis and Palestinians in the region. How sad and ironic that it was Hamas' rockets, not Abbas' diplomacy, that put the Palestinian issue on the map again. And that's likely to be the story again -- whether through violence or diplomacy. What counts is whether Israelis and Palestinians can offer incentives and disincentives to one another in currency that matters -- prisoners, land, cease-fires, economic assistance, etc. It matters not a whit what goes on in New York at the United Nations. Abbas might well be the best partner Israel will ever have, but if he can't deliver or if the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't want to deal with him, well Houston, we have a problem. And at the moment, it is Hamas -- not Abbas -- that counts more and the Gaza/Egypt arena, not the U.N., that's more relevant. Washington's calculations . Why not support the Abbas move? Doesn't the U.S. have a stake in bucking him up and reinforcing the two-state solution? Obama's calculations in opposing the observer initiative are three. First, philosophically, ever since we've had Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the American talking points have been pretty consistent. What matters is negotiations, not moves, at the U.N. And even though there are no talks now, the U.S. position is correct; the only thing that can produce two states are two -- maybe three -- parties talking. Second, there's no doubt that Obama understands that observer status will only deepen the adversarial relationship between Abbas and Netanyahu, give the Israelis another reason not to negotiate and get the president into a fight with Congress should he support the Palestinian bid. Indeed, that's the last thing he needs at a time when he's wrangling with Congress about the fiscal cliff and fighting with the Republicans about Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Finally, if he is going to consider an initiative on the big Israeli-Palestinian issues during his second term, he needs to build up credibility with the Israelis -- as he's done on the cease-fire in Gaza -- so he can be in a better position to push and persuade them later. News: Palestinians again take status case to U.N. An initiative about nothing . The observer state initiative won't make the difference that either its advocates or detractors imagine. Congress might further restrict aid to the Palestinians at a time when the Palestinian Authority is in the red. Abbas will look feckless -- and Hamas even stronger -- because in the end, the results in New York will change nothing on the ground for the better in the region. Indeed, Israel might well retaliate by withholding tax revenues it collects for the Palestinian Authority under agreements reached in the mid-1990s. And sadly, unlike a ""Seinfeld"" episode, what happens between Israelis and Palestinians actually matters. For the time being, these two peoples will remain suspended between a peace they cannot have and a confrontation neither wants but might well come nonetheless. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas seeking nonmember state status at U.N.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, a prominent 16-term liberal Democrat from Massachusetts and arch-enemy of political conservatives nationwide, announced Monday that he does not intend to seek re-election in 2012. Frank, 71, said his decision to retire from Congress was prompted partly by changes made to the boundaries of his U.S. House district. As part of Massachusetts' recently concluded redistricting process, Frank's 4th Congressional District will lose the heavily Democratic blue-collar port city of New Bedford while gaining several smaller, more conservative towns. ""I will miss this job, (but) the district is very substantially changed,"" with roughly 325,000 new constituents, Frank told reporters. The veteran congressman said he was planning to retire after 2014 regardless, but said he didn't ""want to be torn"" next year between the need to serve his existing constituents, reach out to new district residents and protect his signature Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law. President Barack Obama issued a statement praising Frank's public service, calling the congressman a ""fierce advocate for the people of Massachusetts and Americans everywhere who needed a voice."" While Massachusetts' entire House delegation is Democratic, local Republicans insist Frank's retirement will put the reconfigured district in play. ""It is clear that Congressman Frank was not looking forward to another hard fought campaign after losing his gerrymandered district and spending nearly every penny he had in 2010,"" Massachusetts Republican Party Executive Director Nate Little said in a written statement. ""Republicans were already gearing up for a strong race and Frank's sudden retirement injects added optimism and excitement into the election."" Frank, first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, is the top Democrat on the powerful House Financial Services Committee. The controversial 2010 Dodd-Frank measure, designed to rein in Wall Street excesses after the 2008 financial collapse, passed the House without any GOP support. Frank made headlines earlier in his career by becoming one of the first openly gay members of Congress. He was formally reprimanded by the House in 1990 for allegations relating to his association with a male prostitute. Launching his career as an aide to Boston Mayor Kevin White in the late 1960s, Frank quickly became known for an acidic political wit. ""One of the advantages to me of not running for office is I don't even have to pretend to try to be nice to people I don't like,"" Frank joked with reporters Monday. ""Some of you may not think I've been good at it, but I've been trying."" Frank's current district -- which extends from the affluent, liberal Boston suburbs of Newton and Brookline to the cities of New Bedford and Fall River -- is considered safe Democratic political terrain. Frank did, however, receive an unusually strong challenge from Republican Sean Bielat in 2010. Frank ultimately defeated Bielat, 54% to 43%.","Frank says his new district boundaries contributed to his decision to retire .

"(CNN) -- The crew aboard a train that derailed near Baltimore, killing two young women, did not apply the emergency brakes just before the accident, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The air brakes were automatically triggered, agency spokesman Jim Southworth said Wednesday, noting that a possible rupture in an air line may have caused the emergency braking. But Southworth said the investigation was just in its beginning stages. He added that the train -- with two locomotives and 80 cars -- had been traveling about 25 mph when it jumped the tracks. The first 21 cars behind the locomotives derailed. Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass, both 19, were killed early Tuesday when the train derailed on the bridge on which they were sitting, spilling coal and burying them, police said. Maryland train derailment delays terrorism trial at Guantanamo . The derailed train also damaged fiber-optic lines and temporarily disrupted Internet service at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, delaying the trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others facing terrorism charges this week, a base spokesman said. The facility lost about 50% of its connectivity, which is serviced by satellite downlink locations in Maine and Maryland, according to Capt. Robert Durand. The service was restored withing 24 hours, a spokesman for Verizon, which maintains the line, said. Howard County Executive Ken Ulman said that once the initial investigation has been completed, authorities will assess how Mayr and Nass got access to the bridge. They were apparently sitting on the bridge ledge in Ellicott City, Maryland, just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed, according to a written statement from Howard County police. The two posted photos to Twitter shortly before the crash. One showed feet dangling over a road, with the caption ""Levitating."" Another appeared to look down Main Street. Nass tweeted, ""Drinking on top of the Ellicott City sign with @ r0se_petals."" The name Ellicott City is painted on the railroad bridge. Mayr and Nass were high school classmates of David Butko's. He said he grew concerned when he heard about the accident and saw the pictures on Twitter that indicated Mayr and Nass were on the bridge. iReport: Fatal train derailment in Ellicott City, Maryland . ""We went to the site ... hung around, but the police wouldn't let us in,"" he said. Nass was supposed to go back to college at James Madison in Virginia on Tuesday, he said. Classes begin in six days, according the university's website. A spokesman said Nass was an honors student in the interdisciplinary liberal studies program. Mayr was a nursing student at the University of Delaware who was about to start her junior year. ""They were both terrific kids,"" Mount Hebron High School Principal Scott Ruehl said. ""Both girls were really involved in the dance program. They were pleasant; they always said hi in the hallway."" Butko said Mayr was a very funny girl. ""She always had a smile and a joke,"" he said. ""She was goofy at times, but could be there for you when you needed it."" Marmie Edwards, a spokeswoman for Operation Lifesaver, a nonprofit organization that promotes railroad safety, said the number of fatalities in 2012 involving people on tracks was up significantly. ""It's probably just as well to stay away, not just to be off the tracks, but stay away from the train so you know you're going to be safe,"" she said. ""Because it's hard to say, 'OK, here it's safe; there it's not.' So just stay away.""

"DULUTH, Georgia (CNN) -- Neither the on-the-field fame nor the off-the-field notoriety of former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick was enough to spark a bidding war for his suburban Atlanta mansion Tuesday. No one submitted the minimum $3.2 million bid for former Falcon Michael Vick's Atlanta-area mansion. The multimillion-dollar home in Duluth was on the auction block Tuesday, but just three real estate agents showed up -- and one of them, Lance Hempen of Funari Realty, was a listing agent who had no clients interested in the property. No one offered a bid, so the auction ended before it began. The auction required a minimum bid of $3.2 million, with a deposit of $160,000. Vick, 28, is serving a 23-month sentence after pleading guilty in August 2007 to a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He is expected to be released early, possibly in May, and to serve the final two months or so of his sentence under home confinement, most likely in Virginia. No dogfights occurred in Duluth, 40 miles northeast of Atlanta. The home, in the upscale Sugarloaf Country Club community, has been on the market for more than a year. It has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a four-car garage and a movie theater, among other deluxe features. Narender Reddy of Metro Brokers/GMAC Real Estate said his client offered $3.2 million for the home two months ago, but the auction organizers said they wanted to see whether someone would offer more. Reddy said his client withdrew the bid but remains interested. ""Why would I let them use my offer as a benchmark?"" Reddy asked. ""I wanted to see who was going to bid and what were they going to offer."" He will advise his client to offer less money now, Reddy said. Seema Jain of Virtual Properties Realty also was on hand. She said that she has interested buyers but that they didn't want to bid if there was no competition. The next step is to be determined by the bankruptcy judge in Virginia who ordered the sale. Reddy said the price is too high for today's economy. ""It is the economy that is dictating the price of the houses, and I'm sure most of the people still think $3.2 million ... is higher than what the market can fetch,"" he said. Jain said no one seems turned off by Vick's reputation. ""Nobody cares about who owns it. It's just the product and the location,"" she said. Reddy said the home is ""well-built, has a lake view and an excellent floor plan.""

"(CNN) -- Shanna Kurth began biking to work three years ago to improve her health. Several times a month, she loaded her bike onto her car, drove most of the way and biked the last three miles to her office. Bit by bit, she shortened her time in the car and extended the bike ride. Now, the 50-year-old Illinois woman says she bikes all the way to work several times a month from her home in Metamora to Peoria: 25 miles each way, amounting to about two hours of travel time. It's no easy feat, and not something most Americans are willing or able to do, especially in suburban and rural communities, where bike paths are scant and cars are the only way to get around. The rate of workers commuting by bicycle doubled between 2001 and 2009, according to National Household Travel Survey data. But that still amounted to less than 1% of Americans reporting in 2009 that they used bicycles as their primary mode of transportation to work, according to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. In honor of National Bike Month and Bike to Work Week, CNN asked its Facebook fans what it would take to get them to bike to work more often. A shorter commute and more bike lanes were by far the most common responses. ""I would do it every day (if) the weather permitted, if my work was actually within biking distance,"" Kitty Dunn wrote. ""I have an hour to travel by car. Probably take a day or two by bike."" Read more comments on CNN's Facebook page . Cleanliness and body odor were also frequent concerns. Others simply preferred the solace of a morning drive. ""The climate has to be right, the distance not too far, the commuter's health not an issue, a lack of fast, simple, reliable and safe public transportation needs to exist,"" Joshua Wertheim said. ""A shower and locker to change clothes must be provided by my employer, and a way to blast Springsteen while I peddle must be allowed. Otherwise I ain't doing it."" Some suggested that the idea itself was outdated. ""What I think we really need to focus on are more fuel-efficient vehicles, better city planning for the number and types of vehicles on the road, and more public transportation options,"" Curtis Lewis said. ""This is the 21st century after all; trying to solve modern problems with solutions over 100 years old is just simply not going to work. Why not change this to 'What's Your Solution? Week (where you send your ideas to manufacturers, politicians, city officials, etc.)"" instead of 'Bike to Work Week.' "" Or, in the words of Jun Zheng Wang: ""Bike to work? Are you crazy? Time is money!!!"" But those who bike to work swear by the financial rewards and health benefits. And yes, there's a bit of a do-gooder element to it. ""It is a good way to clear your brain from all the sh*t at work,"" Maria Olivieri said. ""The only thing I wish is there were more bike paths alongside the highways. I think if there were I bet a lot more people would be biking it to work; not only that it is good for the green factor (but) good for your health."" Bike safety 101 . Kurth acknowledged that a considerable amount of time and planning goes into her ride. A neuropsychologist with her own practice, she bikes only when her morning schedule is open. When she does, she carpools home with her husband. She takes into consideration weather and wind conditions, avoiding snow, ice and high winds. Most importantly, she said she learned to ride with a light load and keep a set of professional attire at work to change into. She said she uses side roads as much as possible, although there is a long stretch of highway that she cannot avoid. She said believes she has just as much right to use the roads as drivers. ""I don't do it more often because it requires the 'intersection' of a couple of factors,"" Kurth said in an e-mail. ""We belong on the road. It is the law. It is safest for everyone for bicyclists to be on the road -- that is why it is the law. Get over it. And STOP honking and yelling at us."" She's right, though the rules vary from state to state, said Andy Clarke, president of the League of American Bicyclists. The group is the national sponsor of Bike Month. Bicyclists are allowed to use most roads with the exception of high-speed limited access roads such as highways or interstates, which have few interchanges, Clarke said. ""As a general rule, particularly in urban areas, the road networks are such that there are viable alternatives to highways and interstates, and cyclists are able to use the rest of the roadwork,"" he said. ""Outside of urban areas, cyclists are allowed to use interstates as well because they have no other options."" Each state has its own bicycle and pedestrian coordinator within the Department of Transportation that can provide specific information, he said. If cyclists have the right to the same roads as cars, there are a few drivers who aren't happy about it. Dozens of Facebook commenters said cyclists had no place on the road if they didn't have a bike lane to ride in. ""Cyclists, stay off the roads without bike lanes!! You slow down traffic and are putting yourself in danger!"" Greg Schneider said. If cyclists want to share the road, they need to follow the same rules as cars, many said. Obey traffic lights, go in the same direction of traffic and ride single file when traveling in a group. ""Bikers need to follow the rules of the road, too. I cannot tell you how many times I'm at a four-way stop, etc., and they fly right through,"" Michelle Having said. ""Also, keep in mind if you're biking, you're not Lance Armstrong. Watch out for pedestrians. I'm sick of seeing walkers hit by bikers."" When it comes to signaling for turns, many commenters said they felt that both drivers and cyclists could do better. ""Use your flippin' hand signs cyclists!!"" Lucas McCain said. ""Can't tell ya how many times I almost turned one of you guys into street pizza because you didn't warn me of your turns."" The matter of sidewalks was an area of dispute. Some said cyclists should use them in the absence of bike lanes, while others bristled at the thought of them stealing the space from pedestrians. ""Sidewalks are for pedestrians. Cyclists need to understand bike laws; to not ride on the sidewalks and to obey traffic signals,"" wrote Amanda Goebel, who also commented that ""cuter bike helmets"" would encourage her to bike more often. On the flipsde, Schenider wrote, ""I would much rather see a cyclist use the sidewalk than the street. How often do you really see people walking on sidewalks? What's more dangerous? #commonsense."" Cyclists also had advice for other cyclists: Earn the respect of drivers by following the rules and making your presence seen. Wear a helmet all the time and reflective gear at night, make sure to have insurance and don't assume drivers are paying attention. They also had advice for drivers on how to share the road better: Put down the phone and pay greater attention. ""Stop TEXTING, EATING, PUTTING MAKE-UP (ON), TALKING ON THE PHONE while driving,"" Francisco Marcelo Gadelha said. ""Cars, depending on your city, you most likely have to treat bikes as vehicles whether you like it or not,"" Payton Powell said. ""Remember that messing with bikers often results in needing new windshields, hoods, or mirrors due to U-Lock justice."" More than anything, they're asking for respect. ""Cyclists can ride faster than you think. We respect you so respect us,"" Kayla Nicole Lingerfelt said. ""If you're worried about those five seconds to safely get around a cyclist so you won't be late for work, you should have left 30 minutes earlier. Share the road!"" What do you think?

"(CNN) -- Royal Ascot's most successful jockey Frankie Dettori won a thrilling Gold Cup on Colour Vision in Thursday's feature race. The 42-year-old sealed his first victory of this year's meeting by leading home a Godolphin one-two, with stablemate Opinion Poll second under Mikael Barzalona. Dettori had decided to switch rides from Opinion Poll, a decision that paid off when his Saeed Bin Suroor-trained gray won by half a length to earn the Italian's fifth victory in the prestigious race and his first since 2004. He is still some way behind the leading 11 victories by the legendary Lester Piggott, but nevertheless has more wins at Royal Ascot than any other jockey. Bin Suroor became only the eighth trainer to claim five Gold Cup victories and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Godolphin matched Sue Magnier's benchmark five for owners. Magnier's part-owned Fame And Glory, the pre-race favorite and the winner last year, finished down the field under Jamie Spencer. Meanwhile, there was more disappointment for England's Queen Elizabeth as her filly Momentary was well beaten in the Ribbesdale Stakes, finishing well back in the field. The race was won in convincing style by Princess Highway, who powered home to win by five lengths. The Queen, wearing mint green on the third day of Royal Ascot -- Ladies' Day -- had earlier taken her customary trip to the parade ring to inspect her filly ahead of the race and exchange a few words with her jockey, Hayley Turner. But Momentary never presented a serious threat and finished third-last in the field of 14 starters. It follows a gallant second place by the Queen's horse Carlton House on Wednesday. The Andrew Lloyd Weber-owned The Fugue -- who was an unlucky third behind Was and Shirocco Star in the Oaks -- finished second, with Shirocco Star this time coming third. The Ribbesdale Stakes for three-year-old fillies featured many of the same fillies who contested the Oaks at Epsom earlier this month.","Frankie Dettori and Colour Vision win Royal Ascot's Gold Cup race .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, all over the Web, ""Slurpee"" was the big trend. The date was July 11. Seven. Eleven. Or, put another way: 7-Eleven. Home of the Slurpee. Just add some bad character development, and you've got the basic premise of a Nick Cage movie. Of course, it's no coincidence that this particular word was trending on this particular day. July 11 was the official 85th birthday of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, and to celebrate they were giving out free 7.11-ounce Slurpees. This apparently caused the Twitterverse to have a collective aneurysm. The general consensus: ""Drink all the Slurpees!!!"" In fact, 7-Eleven was prepared to give away up to 10 million of these things across the United States and Canada. So, I attempted a little math, which ultimately ended in tears and a mild rash, and determined that 10 million Slurpees equals 71.1 million ounces. Then I did some additional math, which resulted in more tears and a uniquely different rash, and found that 71.1 million ounces equals 555,468.75 gallons. Then I got a completely unrelated rash and finally embraced the reality that I may need to see somebody. The point is, you could almost fill an Olympic-size swimming pool with all the Slurpees they were planning to give away. Granted, Michael Phelps would then promptly drink the pool to reach his daily caloric intake. But you could. And it would be cold. According to 7-Eleven, their famous ""semi-frozen carbonated beverage"" should be served at a ""frosty"" 28 degrees. Which makes this next fun fact rather amazing: The No. 1 market in the world for Slurpees is Winnipeg, Manitoba. You know, where the average low temperature in January is minus 10 degrees. It makes absolutely no sense. Perhaps they just like saying, ""Hey, let's get a Slurp-eh?"" Or maybe Neil Young goes back after each tour and lathers himself in 60,000 ounces of Mountain Berry Blast. Which would be both fascinating and disgusting. Whatever the reason, this was unbelievable information I just couldn't process. My phone conversation with the nice 7-Eleven PR lady went something like this: . Me: ""Winnipeg? Seriously? Winnipeg?"" Her: ""Yep."" Me: ""Hmm. Winnipeg. So I've got this rash..."" She also told me that, surprisingly, in the United States, the No. 1 market is Detroit. But the No. 1 store for Slurpees is in Kennewick, Washington. I'm not sure what else to do with this information. I guess ... visit Kennewick. Have a Slurpee. Or don't. Of course, when it comes to straight-up soda, 7-Eleven also has the Big Gulp. These are great for when you absolutely, positively want to pee for 17 uninterrupted minutes. And if you're really thirsty there's the Double Gulp. This is enough to completely drown a small community. So, watch yourself, Kennewick. Without question, it's a lot of soda. Seemingly more than any one person needs. But the science doesn't lie; 50 ounces of caffeine is pretty much requisite for all mid-to long-range road trips. That, and beef jerky. It's actually sort of amazing what personal health rules we'll bend in the process of getting from Point A to Point B when it requires slightly more effort than your standard commute. ""Honey, looks like we're still 20 miles from Asheville. So you fill up the tank -- I'll grab 36 Nutter Butters."" And that's why we have convenience stores. Because they're awesome. However, what's not awesome is the fact that we don't have 7-Eleven in Georgia. And now I really want a Slurpee. So, I guess I'm off to Kennewick. You know ... before the flood.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's skewed weekly look at trending social media topics .

"(CNN) -- Severed telecommunications cables disrupted ticketing and airport check-in systems at Alaska Airlines on Monday, creating long delays and cancellations for thousands of passengers traveling at the end of a busy holiday weekend. The Seattle-based airline said in a statement that it had to manually process passengers at key hubs after its Sprint network, which services ticketing, reservations and check-in, went down at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time. Service came back up around noon. Seventy mainline and regional flights affecting some 6,000 passengers were canceled. Delays, in some cases, reached four hours as the outage impacted operations at Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles and Anchorage. Alaska said it expected a handful of additional cancellations and residual delays as it worked to restore normal operations. The airline apologized to passengers, blaming the problem on a ""network outage."" Sprint spokeswoman Crystal Davis said communication cables were cut nearly simultaneously about 2,000 miles apart, knocking out service to some customers in the Pacific Northwest. The lines were severed near a railroad track between Chicago and Milwaukee and at a location between Tacoma, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. Alaska said it would place delayed passengers on later flights or arrange travel on other carriers. Passengers traveling on Monday and Tuesday were allowed to change their tickets in advance without paying a change fee. However, they were responsible for making up any difference in fares. Low-cost Alaska is the 10th largest U.S. airline, according to Transportation Department data. 'Epidemic level' of laser attacks directed at planes . Spilled soda blamed for loose jet seats .

"(CNN) -- CNN asked readers to share their experiences with sexual harassment on the street in the comments section of a recent article titled 'Hey baby! Women speak out against street harassment.' There was passionate debate about the causes and effects of catcalls, vulgar rants and even physical assault aimed at women. A few themes stood out: Who's to blame? Are women complicit in street harassment? Is it even worth talking about? Commenter Frank Montgomery saw the issue of street harassment as cultural: ""Instead of blaming men, I would suggest that our larger culture might be more responsible for this. Many people rely on instilling fear for advantage. Popular gangster culture is widely accepted by American youth, and fear is a powerful intoxicant for predators. Ladies, consider yourself fortunate that many such comments are camouflaged in sexual context. These same men are often abusive to everyone, their family members and even other men. Violence, manipulation, deceit and controlling behaviors are often their modus operandi. Also, remember women are not exempt from these trait, they are just manifest different."" Lovehope agreed: ""Much of rap music encourages this behavior. The songs are incredibly degrading to women. They are full of profanity and explicit sexual lyrics. There needs to be a public outcry against singers who promote this type of behavior and attitude. I urge people to read the lyrics of the music they listen to and not buy or support music with irresponsible messages. Those of you with daughters, remember that every woman used to be somebody's little girl. How would you feel if your little girl was treated this way."" Yet some commenters said women condone street harassment with their response to it. BourneBlogger: ""I never catcall a girl, honk a horn, or whistle at a woman. ... The rejection is too overwhelming to take that risk. ... But what's ironic about all of this is that the type of men who do catcall are the EXACT type of men that women flock to when they're at the club. ... I can't tell you how many times I've seen a woman hypnotized by the biggest d0uch3bag on the dance floor. ..."" Guest98989: ""It's also interesting to see that some guy can literally be a stalker but it's cool if the girl is into him but then you can have some poor, somewhat less attractive guy simply say hello to a girl, get viciously rejected and then hear the girls talking trash about the creepy freak stalker who dared to say hello to one of them (despite the fact that the poor dude never bothered them before or again). Give me a break. ... You are NOT helping your cause for the very, very few guys who are actually dangerous (which is very few, even 99.9% of jerks are not). ..."" Truthofdare7 wrote in response to Guest98999: ""He nailed it 100%. Don't lie to us. Girls talk a good game and then they go out with the worst of the catcallers and call it 'manly', brutish', 'alpha male' 'he is not that bad really'. I don't mind it if that is how things are and adjust accordingly but lets not lie about it. ..."" Then there were the men who were shocked that so many other men condoned catcalling in the comment thread. SurfingSumo: ""As a Man, I never realized there were so many other men that actually think it is ok to catcall and harass women. Didn't the rest of you men have mothers that taught you this was wrong? What is wrong with you guys. I thought this was only a small segment of men out there but it looks like from the comments it is at least half. This is wrong and you men that do this are COWARDS. Get it? COWARDS! Wake up and start treating women the way you would want men to treat your daughter if she was walking on the street or in a subway."" Globaldecay seemed to agree: ""This isn't a women's problem. This is a men's problem. We as men must be willing to stand up and speak up for our daughters, sisters and mothers."" As did Bill93848: ""If a woman dresses in provocative clothes and literally wears a sign reading 'Please harass me,' it is still the man's responsibility to exercise self-restraint. A man is just that -- a man, not an impulsive child."" There were also some readers who thought the issue was being exaggerated: . Gregkells: ""Many of us aren't condoning the behavior, we just find the response to it overblown. I don't condone bullying either, but I'm sick to death of the media latching on to it and creating an atmosphere of hypersensitivity. Kids will ALWAYS pick on each other, it isn't a national crisis. There will always be men who say crude things, it isn't terrorism or rape. Some of us are just getting sick of extreme cases being presented as if they are indicative of the norm. Kids aren't lining up like lemmings to commit suicide because some other kid gave them a wedgie, and people aren't getting raped and groped en masse on public transit because we let construction workers get away with whistling at pretty women. This type of sensationalism will produce a backlash, hence the crude jokes people are making here. Most of us aren't defending the behavior, we're ridiculing the response."" Badger85 didn't agree: ""Greg, I agree the media over sensationalizes things, but cases like this -- unwanted touching on the bus, graphic threats to rape, following someone home etc? It's happened to every girl. I'm glad we ARE discussing it, because it seems like guys have no idea that this is so frequent and don't realize *why* we're responding to them with distrust and fear."" Mrsczs had some advice for women: ""You mean men are still carrying on like that? I thought they'd stopped years ago. When did I grow old enough to fly beneath the radar? Take it from me, ladies, 'This, too, shall pass.' Enjoy every minute of being young and beautiful and don't waste your precious moments getting hung up on the small stuff. Wolf whistles are small stuff. Life is short."" Guylpanema also said women should just suck it up: ""This behavior is genetic, and all of you people who are arguing against it simply lack a grasp of human nature. Men will forever be trying to get some, and women will forever be the object of that desire. It is inherent in our nature. While I agree that sometimes it goes too far, trying to regulate human chemistry is a short trip down the road to fascism. I'm sorry if it bothers you when men recognize that you look great in ways that you don't approve of. Get over it. Stop trying to control things you have no right to control. Woman up. If you want to be equals, then start growing a pair instead of whining about what you don't like."" Others didn't take so kindly to that response. Stubby: ""We have control over our own bodies. You have control over YOUR actions. Making lame excuses and saying that men are just animals who can't control themselves is pathetic and insulting to men. You can recognize a pretty girl without grabbing or harassing them, millions of men are capable of this."" Commenter Cathi Cari Shudde summed up her history with street harassment: ""I've had multiple experiences during the years of this and similar experiences. Whether walking down the street, riding public transit, walking in a park with my dog, being in a public space (i.e. store, library, etc) - and here's my take on it at 56 years old. Why do people think its ok to say something to another person that you wouldn't want said to your mother, your sister, your daughter or your friend? Why must we accommodate your inability to keep your thoughts from flowing freely and without consideration, from your mouths? ... Sadly its all too common that other women and men will not intervene or step up to assist others. They don't want to get involved. I'm frankly tired of accommodating other's poor behavior and inability to control themselves in public.""","CNN commenters had strong opinions on why catcallers target women .
Some readers said men should address this problem among themselves .
Others said women play into harassment by responding favorably to ""bad boys""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When CEO-turned-whistleblower Michael Woodford exposed a $1.7 billion cover-up of losses at Olympus, he was forced to flee from Japan, fearing for his life, as the scandal sent shockwaves through the country's tight-knit corporate world. The 52-year-old Briton had barely settled in to his new role as the company's first foreign chief executive when he became aware of a potentially explosive magazine article. FACTA, a local Japanese title with only nine staff, had published a detailed expose in July 2011 questioning exorbitant fees it claimed the camera and medical equipment maker had paid consultants for a 2008 acquisition deal. It also questioned extravagant purchase prices of three small companies. ""The company had bought three 'Mickey Mouse companies' for a billion dollars: a plastic plates company for microwaves, a cosmetics company -- a face cream company -- and a recycling company, but with no turnover,"" Woodford told CNN Tuesday, as his new book about the saga, ""Exposure,"" prepared to hit bookshelves. ""They then paid $700 million dollars in fees to somebody, we didn't know who, in the Cayman Islands. I begged and begged and pleaded 'don't treat me as a gaijin (foreigner), treat me as a colleague who cares about this company.' But they didn't listen, not one of the 14 (board members), including three non-executive directors."" Instead Woodford quickly found himself out of a job after he attempted to get some answers from then-Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa and former Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori. The board voted unanimously to fire him from the post. Shigeo Abe, publisher of FACTA, gave his own blunt assessment of why Olympus had selected what he called a ""bottom-ranking foreign executive"" from 25 candidates to be CEO in the first place. ""Mr. Kikukawa's aim was to keep the fraud in secret under the foreign president because Mr. Woodford could not speak and read Japanese,"" he told CNN last year. Woodford refused to go quietly, choosing instead to unleash a firestorm of publicity that would prove costly to the board and company itself. Kikukawa and several other board members were eventually forced to resign, while Olympus shares lost around 80% of their market value in the first weeks after news of the scandal broke. A special audit of Olympus in December last year, led by a former Japanese Supreme Court judge, published a report that blasted Kikukawa's controlling style and the company culture that allowed losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for its acquisitions. ""The management was rotten to the core, and infected those around it,"" the report said. The case also raised questions about the level of transparency in Japan Inc. when to comes to business practice generally. In September this year, Kikukawa, Mori and another senior executive, Hideo Yamada, admitted filing false reports and inflating the company's net worth. The men could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 10 million yen ($128,400), Japanese media reports have said. ""It was an incredible story,"" said Woodford. ""It illustrated the dysfunctionality of corporate Japan and the way the capital markets work. ""A month after I was dismissed, the share price of Olympus had fallen by 81.5% -- $7 billion dollars had been struck off the value of the company, yet the institutional shareholders in Japan would not offer one word of criticism of the incumbent board, or one word for the ex-president in support of him trying to expose this fraud."" But almost a year after he was forced out of the company he had served since the 1980s, Woodford says no lessons have been learned from the scandal by corporate Japan. ""Nothing has changed,"" he said. ""The ruling party, the DPJ, at the height of this said they were going to put forward a recommendation that one non-executive director should be a minimum requirement under Japanese company law. ""In July of this year, the Ministry of Finance dropped that proposal, so out of the 1,600 companies on the Nikkei, over 1,000 don't have one outside director. What are they scared of? What does that tell investors who are looking at Japan?"" Woodford compared the success of South Korean electronics giant Samsung to that of ailing Japanese rivals such as Sharp, Sony and Panasonic -- all have their debts set at junk status. ""Japan is losing it,"" said Woodford. ""The companies and country can't change. They just can't change themselves. It's desperately sad.""","Michael Woodford fired as Olympus CEO after he exposed a $1.7 billion cover-up .

"(Oprah.com) -- In 1999, I moved with my wife and 8-month-old daughter from New York to Berlin. I'd been given an apartment to live in and a small stipend to survive on, compliments of the Berliner Künstlerprogramm, which has been bringing foreign artists to the city since 1961. Among the things I'd packed in my large suitcase was the unfinished manuscript of ""Middlesex."" The fellowship had come at a fortunate time. Our landlord, a mean old man who owned the brownstone we lived in (hi there, Doug, still living alone?) was kicking us out for the offense of having a kid. We had nowhere else to go and little money in the bank. My book, which I'd been working on for a number of years already, was far from finished, and the more I tried to put on an appearance of painstaking, Flaubertian calm, the more my inner self began to betray me. The shakes I had at my desk could not be entirely blamed on the massive amounts of caffeine I was imbibing. Moving to Berlin solved all these problems. We had a nice two-bedroom apartment in the sleepy neighborhood of Wilmersdorf. My wife and I slept in one bedroom, I worked in the other, and we converted the surprisingly spacious broom closet into a nursery for our daughter. Vladimir Nabokov, it turned out, had lived in Wilmersdorf during the 1920s. A building one block from us had a historical marker indicating that Albert Einstein had rented an apartment there, too. Good neighbors. Oprah.com: 7 gifts from the universe that everybody gets . When you're writing a book, not going outside much during the day, time tends to blur. Though I liked Berlin and enjoyed the anonymity of living in a foreign city where nobody cared if I ever finished my book or not, my reprieve from literary anxiety was only temporary. At some point during our first or second year in Berlin, the physical symptoms I'd been suffering back in Brooklyn—a constriction in my chest, as though a corset were being tightened over my ribcage—returned. I grew irritable. More than usual, I mean. Sometimes when we were out bike riding, or pushing our daughter's stroller through the aisles of KaDeWe, the big department store in West Berlin, hoping she'd fall asleep so we could eat, I became paranoid that we'd left the gas stove on at home. Fearing that my computer and manuscript would go up in the blaze, I made us race home, unjustifiably furious with my wife the entire way, only to find the burner off and the apartment intact. Shut up in my office all day, coming out to stand on the balcony and stare moodily down at the wet leaves on the pavement, at night either self-absorbed and silent or trying to loosen myself up with multiple glasses of German beer—that's what I was like at the time. That's what I was like to live with. And then, one night, I had a dream. I know dreams are boring, but bear with me. This one was special. Plus, it's short. All that happened in the dream was that an owl, descended out of nowhere, seized me in its talons and blew into my mouth a single breath tasting of blood. That's it. The dream lasted no more than four or five seconds. But it was one of those dreams that seems somehow more real than a typical dream, as if it were playing out at a level just below my conscious mind, or as if it originated not from my mind at all but from a source outside of me. The owl, by the way, was gigantic. And not particularly realistic. In fact, the bird was stylized in the manner of a Klimt, with lozenges of color running up and down its wings and over its breast, and a large helmeted ceremonial head. Its eyes were fierce, omnipotent, bright yellow. It fixed these eyes on mine. When the owl lowered its beak to my lips, I opened my mouth. And then the owl exhaled one long forceful breath. With a whooshing sound, my lungs inflated. This inspiration had a taste: the mineral, meaty flavor of a predatory diet. I awoke from this dream feeling that a message had been delivered to me. The great Owl in the Sky had taken a personal interest in me and my book. The owl had come to give me the power to write it. Oprah.com: Page-turners you'll tear through . Did I believe this? In my half-awake state, I did. The dream put me in such a good mood that I didn't want to debunk it, even as I came to full alertness. At breakfast, I described it to my wife in detail. Later that same morning, when my German publisher arrived to take us to a local flea market, I described the dream to him. As we walked to the flea market, the sun was shining. I was nattering on my about my dream, saying that it was ""prophetic."" My publisher responded, ""Well, I hope you are right about this dream because it would be very good, Eugenides, if you finished your book soon."" By this time we were entering the flea market. I looked up at the first table we came to and stopped in my tracks. Arrayed on the table were a few hundred owl figurines. There were wooden owls, metal owls, owls carved from stone and jade, owls made of colored glass, owl bookends, owl ashtrays and owl lamp stands. The German guy who ran the stand must have thought it was his lucky day. Here was this American, who didn't even know the German world for owl, suddenly buying up much of his stock. I got about 15 different owls that morning. Ever since that day, with increasing discrimination, I've hunted for owl-themed merchandise at any secondhand store I happen into. For Christmases and birthdays, my wife and daughter invariably give me something owl-related. I have owl cuff links, an owl tiepin and a wonderfully informative book by Desmond Morris titled, simply, Owl. From the shelves of the room I'm writing this in, these owls stare down at me. I keep them around to remind myself of the dream. Of course, there's a perfectly rational explanation for all of this. I was in the middle of writing a long and difficult book when I had my dream. My unconscious, processing the anxiety of my waking life, sent me the owl as a kind of psychic Zoloft. The owl is sacred to Athena, goddess of wisdom. Traditionally, the owl represents vigilance, knowledge and sagacity. Morris tells us that, for the ancient Greeks, the appearance of an owl was a good omen. Oprah.com: Why the best way to get creative is to make some rules . Likewise, my happening upon all those flea-market owls isn't that remarkable. As I've since learned from my collecting habit, there are always owl figurines for sale at flea markets. I'd just never noticed them before. That's how coincidence works: The signs from God people are always claiming to find are really a function of their own brain's selecting, from the myriad objects in the world, those that cohere to the story they're telling themselves. All right. But explain this to me. We now jump forward 10 years. I'm living in Princeton, New Jersey, writing the last chapters of my recent novel ""The Marriage Plot."" It's winter, and my editor has given me until the end of the year to hand the book in. Working day and night, I soon reach a state of anxiety at least as great as the one I suffered in Berlin. In this predicament, lying in bed late one night, sleepless with worry, I hear what sounds like an owl outside my bedroom window. An owl, hooting. Of course I think I'm imagining it. It's probably some other kind of bird, or not a bird at all. But the next night, it returns. Then a week later. Next, a few days after that. Finally, I go on YouTube, type ""hooting owls"" and am rewarded with a video of an owl that sounds exactly like the one I'm listening to in the darkness. A great horned owl. Indigenous to New Jersey. It's real. And it's right outside my bedroom window. Oprah.com: The best new books of October 2012 . For two straight months, as I finished ""The Marriage Plot,"" the owl visited me. As soon as I handed in the book, the owl vanished, so far for good. Did I believe Athena sent it? No. Still, it wasn't a dream owl this time but a living one, and lying in bed at night, listening to its cry in the frigid air, I couldn't help feeling encouraged, feeling that the owl was on my side. In the end, whether my owls came from my unconscious, at the prompting of the universe, or due to a migratory pattern doesn't matter. What matters is that the experience—both of my dream owl and the living one outside my window—arrived at the point I needed it, and helped me persevere. In the midst of my skeptical, cynical, often pessimistic nature exists a slender capacity to believe, if only temporarily, in a guiding, unseen power, and whenever this happens, I go with it. That's what inspiration is. You don't get it from the gods. You make it. The owl at my window was just a bird, after all, trying to get through the winter. The owl in my dream was my own creation. It was me, breathing into myself, in order to breathe out again in a flow of words. Oprah.com: 12 pieces of advice from the world's best writers .

"(CNN) -- Early in Michael Mann's vivid, incisive, but half-cocked gangster opus ""Public Enemies,"" Johnny Depp's John Dillinger returns to jail a few scant months after leaving it. Johnny Depp plays the charismatic John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies."" Only this time he's just visiting -- and he's taking his friends out with him. It's an audacious opening gambit, and when the getaway gets messy -- one of the gang panics and soon bullets are flying all over the place -- we glimpse another insight into what makes Dillinger tick. As he clings to a wounded comrade for dear life, and stares death long in the face, he has to make a decision: What to do with the guy who panicked and brought this upon them? Dillinger lets him go. Based on Bryan Burrough's well-sourced account of the Depression-era crime wave that gave rise not only to Dillinger, but also to a whole gallery of criminal poster boys -- Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the Barker gang, Bonnie and Clyde -- ""Public Enemies"" whittles the book down to its most dramatic duel: the nationwide manhunt for Dillinger presided over by J. Edgar Hoover (a knockout Billy Crudup) and led by his Chicago, Illinois, bureau chief, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Dillinger and Purvis assumed folk-hero proportions in their day. According to Burrough, when newsreels showed Dillinger -- public enemy No. 1 -- he was applauded more loudly than the president. A 20th-century Jesse James, he was an underdog with a reputation for fairness. It was said he never killed anybody, and he was gallant and jocular with members of the public, once offering his overcoat to a kidnapped bank teller he had taken as a human shield. The role is tailor-made for a self-styled rebel like Depp. He understands the outlaw's swagger, the ferocity that sits hand in glove with his soft-spoken sensitivity. All the romance in the picture comes from Depp: the graceful ease with which he vaults a bank railing, his astonishing self-confidence and his dedicated courtship of hat-check girl Billie Frechette (an eager Marion Cotillard). She's swept up less by the high life he promises than the passionate conviction of his pitch. Burrough paints Purvis as an ineffectual, even inept agent who was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to nab Floyd, Nelson and Dillinger. The movie has no truck with such revisionism, but betrays little interest in Bale's dour, narrow lawman. The film's parallel cop-and-robber structure recalls Mann's modern classic, ""Heat."" Purvis and Dillinger meet only once -- to talk -- and then face off just once more, at the climax, to kill and be killed. If the confrontation of Bale and Depp doesn't pack the same iconic punch as ""Heat's"" Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, the (entirely fictitious) exchange in a Midwestern jail cell remains central to the film. At one point, Dillinger reprimands Purvis for shooting down Pretty Boy Floyd, extending the poetic license still further -- as a point of historical fact Floyd died several months after Dillinger, and though Purvis was at the scene he almost certainly didn't pull the trigger. But Purvis did coordinate the execution of John Dillinger, an assassination as much as it was an attempted arrest, and maybe the nastiest crime in the picture. So when the incarcerated Depp advises the smug Bale that he should find a different line of work for his own peace of mind, his words carry a certain weight. Still, the movie's resolve to take Dillinger at face value feels a bit perfunctory, even old hat. At 140 minutes it takes a long time to find its rhythm; indeed, this is one film that would be better if it were 20 minutes longer. Still, there's little here that Arthur Penn didn't anticipate 40 years ago in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" except maybe the intriguing idea that organized crime pulled the plug on the old-style go-it-alone bank robber in a belated attempt to forestall Hoover's dream of a federal law enforcement agency. For all its loving period detail, the movie scarcely notices the desperate poverty of the times. Shot largely on high definition video, ""Public Enemies"" doesn't look like the old gangster films -- it looks like TV. The images gain in immediacy what is lost in luster, but left this spectator looking for more texture, more depth -- more heat. iReport.com: Depp's best film? One of the new Hollywood's last great stylists, Mann is well aware of the sacrifice involved in this transition.

"(CNN) -- In different year, the race for attorney general in Pennsylvania might have been just a footnote to the presidential election. But more people in the Keystone State voted Tuesday for Kathleen Kane to be their attorney general than voted for Barack Obama to be their president. And much of that may be attributed to the furor over the Jerry Sandusky child sex case. She beat the Republican challenger, David Freed, by almost 15 points, and the overwhelming support makes her the first woman and the first Democrat elected to the job in Pennsylvania. What may have pushed Kane over the top was her strong stance on the Sandusky scandal. She promised to look back to November 2008, when the first victim came forward, and carry out an independent review into why Sandusky was not charged until three years later. ""We need an independent investigator to look at what happened,"" Kane told CNN. ""Over 3 million people feel that I am that independent investigator."" Her promise means she'll be taking on the state's sitting governor, Tom Corbett. And her review into the Sandusky case investigation will delve into the years that Corbett was the attorney general. He launched the Sandusky investigation before he ran for governor. Despite some criticism, Corbett has denied that politics had anything to do with investigative decisions. Instead, he accused Democrats of politicizing the case when two leading state Democratic lawmakers wrote a three-page letter asking U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to look into how the Sandusky investigation unfolded. Holder's office says the letter is under review. It's a topic that comes up at almost every news conference Corbett holds â€” no matter the stated topic. ""I challenge anybody out there who says there is to bring forward one piece of evidence, one sentence of evidence, one thread of evidence,"" Corbett said in October, defending his handling of the investigation. Criticism of Corbett emerged soon after Sandusky's arrest last year, when the school's faithful began to question his role on the university Board of Trustees, which had fired the Nittany Lions' long-time football coach, Joe Paterno. Kane said most of the questions she received during more than 20 months on the campaign trail were about Sandusky. ""Everywhere I went, people from every profession, almost every county, asked me what happened and why it took so long and how I felt about it, because they knew I specialized in the prosecution of child sex abuse cases,"" she said. ""It was something that bothered them. It was something that was on their mind."" With good reason, she said: the delay in making an arrest meant that the predator remained free for years. During that time, investigators issued no subpoenas to Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, even though that's where he met his first accuser. It took investigators looking into the November 2008 accusation 25 months to find a 1998 Penn State police report in which two boys had accused Sandusky of having touched them inappropriately in a campus shower. In addition, no one from Penn State testified before the grand jury until last year, even though Sandusky had worked there for decades. But almost immediately after Corbett took office in January 2011, eight state police troopers were added to the case. Seven of the eight initial accusers were found in the second 18 months of the investigation. Corbett's spokesman, Kevin Harley, said each move was strategic and that the governor handled the case responsibly. ""If Kathleen Kane can transition from a partisan politician to a professional prosecutor and put aside her hyperpartisan views of law enforcement, hopefully she will learn how a sophisticated and complex investigation into a serial pedophile was conducted,"" Harley told CNN Thursday. Kane may be a political novice, but she's been a prosecutor since 1995, when she left a Philadelphia law firm to return home to Scranton, where she took a job as an assistant district attorney in Lackawanna County. She said it paid half of what she had made in Philadelphia and she had to share her desk with another prosecutor. But she stayed in Scranton to raise her two boys, Christopher, 11, and Zachary, 10, she said. During 17 years there, she has prosecuted public corruption cases as well as hundreds of cases involving child rape, abuse and neglect, she said. ""They are very labor-intensive,"" she said. ""You need to have a strong stomach, and you need to know that, no matter who it is, you have to follow the facts. I've done that before and I'll do it again."" When she starts the job in January, Kane will acquire the ongoing Sandusky grand jury investigation, plus the prosecution of three former Penn State officials, each of whom is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice, child endangerment, perjury and failure to report a crime. Attorneys for those men have asked a judge to delay the scheduled January trial date. Sandusky was convicted in June on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.","Kathleen Kane, a newcomer in state politics, won Pennsylvania AG job .

"(Health.com) -- I'm not one of those women who scrutinizes every new wrinkle in the mirror or tries to hide them with oversize sunglasses, but who likes seeing those tiny lines adding up? Well, un-furrow that brow because there's a lot that can be done to outsmart your skin. ""About 50 percent of aging is genetic, and 50 percent is due to lifestyle choices,"" says Francesca Fusco, M.D., an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. In fact, researchers at the University Hospitals in Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University studied 186 pairs of identical twins and found that everyday factors such as sun exposure and smoking significantly accelerated the aging process. By the age of 40, getting more than 30 hours a week of sun exposure added the equivalent of two years to the face, and every 10 years of smoking tacked on another 2.5 years. It's true that, alas, there's no fountain of youth (if there were, you can be sure the Real Housewives would be filling their infinity pools with its waters). But with some healthy-living tweaks, plus helpful products and treatments, you can slow down the clock and keep your skin looking better than you ever imagined. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin . Your age-proofing arsenal . Moisturizers! Creams! Cleansers! Serums! All of these products have a place in your routine, but here are a few of the most essential: . Cleanser . A small-grain exfoliating cleanser will work for most skin types. ""It cleans your skin and exfoliates at the same time,"" Dr. Fusco says, which zaps dullness that occurs as cell turnover slows down. Anti-aging serum . Serums contain higher concentrations of therapeutic ingredients than creams—that means faster results. Look for retinol (a vitamin A derivative), vitamin C, or vitamin E—these vitamins stimulate collagen production, strengthening skin. Eye cream . ""Choose an eye cream that contains retinol (to stimulate collagen production) or caffeine (it constricts blood vessels to reduce puffiness and dark circles),"" advises Fredric Brandt, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City and Coral Gables, Florida. Moisturizer . The key ingredients to look for are glycerin or hyaluronic acid, according to Dr. Brandt, because they help your skin hang on to moisture. Sunscreen . If you're outside a lot during the day, you need a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 in addition to your moisturizer. Health.com: The best anti-aging secrets . Cheating time—with needles . Women who look young for their age may be getting injected with muscle-relaxing drugs or fillers (or both). A few things you should know before giving these a shot: . Botox and fillers are used in different areas . Botox is a form of botulinum toxin that is typically injected into crow's feet, forehead lines, the lines between your brows, and the ""bunny lines"" at the top of the nose. It relaxes muscles, which inhibits lines from forming when you move your face. Fillers like Restylane are commonly used to add volume to cheeks, smile lines, lips, temples, and the jawline. Both start at about $550 per area. Explore your options . Botox and Restylane are still the most popular brands, but there are other choices. Many of Dr. Fusco's patients claim that Dysport kicks in faster and lasts longer than Botox. Lisa Airan, M.D., an aesthetic dermatologist in New York City, says Xeomin is the newest botulinum toxin on the block. As for fillers, Dr. Brandt loves Belotero, which he says is great for filling in lines. Botox can prevent wrinkle . Injections in your 20s or early 30s may sound insane, but if you see signs of wrinkles when you're at rest, Botox can actually help you avoid or tone down new ones. ""Getting Botox can prevent future damage by softening facial movement,"" says Doris Day, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University Medical Center. Less is more . Some derms, like Dr. Fusco, recommend so-called ""baby Botox"" for patients who are nervous about looking frozen. This involves injecting smaller amounts more frequently (every three months, as opposed to every four to six months) for a more natural look. Health.com: Have firmer skin forever . A wrinkle in time . See lines? Here's what's happening to your skin. 20s UVA rays (the ones responsible for aging) can start to break down collagen, the protein that lends skin its firmness, leading to tiny lines on the skin's surface — usually starting around the eyes. 30s During this decade, the ability of collagen to repair itself starts to slow, causing lines around the eyes to deepen into crow's feet. Forehead lines and lines between the eyebrows start. 40s Thanks to the stepped-up loss of collagen and elastin (the protein that helps skin snap back), even thicker-skinned areas will fall prey to fine lines, causing creases and little wrinkles around the mouth. 50s By now, you will have lost some fat from just below the skin's surface, causing it to sag a bit. Lines deepen and new ones are created. But those few extra pounds you've been fighting can help plump up wrinkles.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner and other conservatives shot down a proposal from a senior congressional Republican who suggested that his GOP colleagues break from their firm anti-tax position and agree to a demand from Democrats to immediately renew middle-class tax cuts. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the leadership team that helps round up House votes, told fellow GOP lawmakers that he thought they should, as a matter of political strategy, extend just the tax-rate cuts for those making $250,000 or less before the end of the year -- a position being pushed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats. Cole first floated the idea at a closed-door meeting of the Republican whip team on Tuesday and his comments were first reported by Politico. Cole told reporters after another meeting on Wednesday with House Republicans that he believed giving certainty to the majority of American taxpayers now was important. But he emphasized that he still opposed increasing tax rates for upper-income Americans. ""In my view, we all agree that we're not going to raise taxes on people who make less than $250,000. We should just take them out of this discussion right now, continue to fight against any rate increases, continue to work honestly for a much bigger deal,"" Cole said. New Poll: Majority support taxing wealthier Americans . Cole added that major issues should be worked out in the debate next year. ""We need to deal with entitlement spending. We need to deal with job creation. Rates are intimately tied to that. So let's have that discussion. But I think it's easier to have without a lot of people whose taxes we don't intend to raise being worried they might get raised."" Cole's Tuesday comments were reported and distributed broadly by Democrats as a major development in the fiscal cliff talks. But they were quickly rejected by Boehner, who is negotiating with the White House and Democratic leaders on a way to avert the combination of spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect without an agreement by year's end. ""I told Tom earlier in our conference meeting that I disagreed with him,"" Boehner told reporters after meeting with GOP rank and file. ""He's a wonderful friend of mine and a great supporter of mine but raising taxes on the so-called top 2 percent -- half of those taxpayers are small business owners that pay their taxes through personal income tax filing every year."" At the Wednesday meeting in the Capitol, Boehner also made a point in his opening remarks to tell members he disagreed with Cole, according to two GOP sources who were in the meeting. CNNMoney: Fiscal battle over mortgage deduction . One of these sources said Cole brought up his idea with GOP members in the meeting, saying he did not support raising any rates. Conservatives immediately rejected Cole's idea, and seemed annoyed that the attention on his comments was taking away from their focus to press Democrats to agree to some major entitlement reforms as part of a broad agreement to address tax rates and the automatic spending cuts. Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador didn't mince words when asked by CNN about Cole's idea. ""I think he's wrong and I think most of the conference thinks that he's wrong,"" Labrador said. ""I think he's, you know, he's a good man who's served here for a long time. But he's also a man who has voted for a lot of the increased spending in Washington, D.C., and that's the problem."" CNNMoney: It's time to fix the charitable deduction . ""I think this is a false choice between running off the fiscal cliff and damaging the economy, or raising rates on small businesses and professionals that also damages the economy,"" Texas Republican Kevin Brady, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said. Cole said he would continue to discuss his suggestion with colleagues, and predicted that if it came up for a vote, it would pass the Republican-led House. But GOP aides made it clear there are no plans for any vote on a bill to separate the middle-class tax cuts from those for higher-income earners. Even though Republicans criticized the idea, Democrats praised Cole. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, highlighted his shift in a speech on the Senate floor. ""I applaud Representative Cole for that common-sense and brave position. I am hopeful that he can persuade other Republicans to do the right thing for our families, small business owners and communities across the country who have so much at stake and who are looking to us to solve this problem,"" Murray said. Norquist's no-tax pledge has survived challenges before . That kind of endorsement probably won't help Cole make his case with fellow Republicans. Asked about potential backlash to his idea from anti-tax groups focused on enforcing a ""pledge"" not to raise taxes, Cole seemed nonplussed. ""My job is to get the best deal from the American taxpayers that I can get,"" he said. ""If by keeping the pledge taxes go up on everybody, then I don't know if that's a very good idea. If, on the other hand, we can negotiate a deal, which I think we can, which keeps rates where they are but provides revenue and certainly protects people below $250,000, I think we have a responsibility to try and do that."" After the meeting with the rank and file, House Republican leaders were sitting down in the Capitol with several CEOs who are part of the ""Fix the Debt"" coalition chaired by Erskine Bowles, the former head of Obama's deficit reduction committee. Boehner delivered a message to his members that he planned to reiterate to the CEOs, ""We won't be party to a deal that protects big businesses and preserves special-interest tax breaks while raising tax rates on the small businesses we're counting on to create jobs."" After the meeting Bowles told reporters he did not see the GOP showing any flexibility in their opposition to any tax rate increases.","Rep. Tom Cole floated idea of negotiating tax cuts leaving out earners over $250,000 .

"(CNN) -- Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who came under fire from his own troops just hours before, took to his country's airwaves Sunday, saying the shooting incident was an accident. ""I want to reassure all citizens of my well-being after the accident committed by an army unit on an unpaved road around Touela. ... Everything is fine,"" he said in an interview broadcast on official Mauritanian television. Troops shot the president late Saturday in what the government is calling a case of ""friendly fire"" -- though others believe it may have been something more sinister. Aziz's convoy mistakenly came under fire as it was heading back toward the capital of Nouakchott, the official AMI news agency reported. The gunshots came from a military unit stationed alongside the road in the west African country. Mauritania: Slavery's last stronghold . Aziz said Sunday he had a successful operation to treat minor injuries. But witnesses said they believe the incident was an assassination attempt, because unknown armed men shot their guns at the president and ran away, according to the independent Mauritania News agency. The witnesses said the armed men ""directly"" targeted the president as he was returning from his farm in Inchiri province, near the capital, Mauritania News reported. Mauritania has a history of political instability and faces threats from al Qaeda militants. A former general, Aziz came to power in a bloodless 2008 military coup -- one of many such coups the country of about 3.4 million people has had since it gained independence from France in 1960. He ousted Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who had been the nation's first democratically elected leader, according to the U.S. State Department. Aziz was elected president in 2009. Still, the CIA describes the country's leadership as a ""military junta."" Security in Mauritania has been ratcheted up in recent weeks amid concerns about ""armed terrorist groups"" in nearby northern Mali, according to Magharebia, a website sponsored by the U.S. Africa Command -- a part of the U.S. military focused on the continent. The measures include a bolstered security presence on main streets, near embassies and by government buildings in Nouakchott, as well as stepped-up patrols, Magharebia said. No official reason has been given for the enhanced security, according to the report. But the publication, quoting terrorism experts and local news reports, said it may be related to threats posed by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In May, the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning for Mauritania because of AQIM activities. ""As a result of perceived Western involvement in counterterrorism efforts, AQIM has declared its intention to attack Western targets,"" the warning said.

"(CNN) -- Interest in hunting and fishing is on the rise, and autumn's prime season for getting outside and up close to your food. The number of recreational hunters and anglers in the United States has increased significantly over the past five years, according to a recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service survey. The number of hunters has increased by 9%, while the number of anglers has jumped by 11%. While hunting has always been a way for self-sufficient people to feed their families, another theory for its current popularity is that it can also be an affordable ""staycation"" for people trying to spend less in a poor economy. Steven Rinella, host of ""Meat Eater"" on the Sportsman Channel and the author of a just-released hunting tome of the same name, says there's more to it. As an increasing number of Americans become interested in where their food comes from and want to play a part in making it, Rinella says that many are newly compelled to try killing their own meat. ""I think it's a cultural sense of people losing connection to the land and to their food, and they're looking to rekindle their fires of passion for self-sufficiency,"" says Rinella. The growing interest in farm-to-table dining is part of that rekindling. ""Meat is not just a trip to the supermarket and a Styrofoam-wrapped cut of meat. That meat starts as an animal,"" says Jeff Rupert, chief of the Division of Natural Resources of the National Wildlife Refuge System. 'The Hunger Games' bucks hunter stereotypes . Hunting takes years to master . Yet hunting is not the easiest hobby for a newcomer to master. Hunting is visceral. One is often in uncomfortable settings, and it requires a certain skill set that can take years to master. Those who still want to try hunting this fall have plenty of options all over the country in a wide array of comfort levels, and the Fish and Wildlife Service offers special hunting programs for children, novice hunters, hunters with disabilities, and women. Right now, Rinella recommends wild pig hunting in northern California and central Texas; pheasant, geese, and duck hunting in North and South Dakota; grouse hunting in northern Minnesota and Michigan; and quail hunting in the southeast. Dear deer, you're delicious . Big game hunting -- think bear or elk -- requires permits that are a little harder to obtain without a long lead time. Here are a range of hunting and fishing experiences in the United States: . High Lonesome Ranch, Colorado . Some big-game hunting accommodations are about as bare-bones as it gets -- outdoor camps, roadside motels, RVs. And then there's the High Lonesome Ranch, a sophisticated resort and ranch with guest houses and remote cabins on a property encompassing 300 square miles on the Western slopes of the Colorado Rockies. The ranch offers a range of guided big-game hunts that include access to the property's free-range elk and mule deer herds. It also offers fly-fishing expeditions for five species of trout, and phenomenal wing shooting. Due to its conservation efforts and its work with state wildlife agencies, High Lonesome Ranch has reduced the annual numbers of big-game hunters, so be sure to call to see what's available at any given time. Fly-fishing packages start at $1,530 and wing shooting packages start at $2,410. Both include three nights' lodging, meals, and guided fly-fishing for two days. Big-game packages vary based on species. 275 County Highway 222, De Beque, Colorado; 970-283-9420 . Southern Woods Plantation, Georgia . A classic quail hunt usually means sophisticated lodging, and rural Georgia -- a quail hunter's paradise -- is dotted with old-school Southern plantations that specialize in guided hunts with trained dogs. Options abound, but check out Southern Woods Plantation in the Bobwhite Belt of South Georgia. The main house is sprawling and comfortable, and the hunting expedition is led by expert guides with traditional and specially designed buggies and a set of trained hunting dogs. Hunts are $450 for a full day plus $250 for lodging, with all meals included. Also in Georgia, the Bond Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, six miles south of Macon, just added migratory bird hunting and upland game hunting to its roster and added wild turkey to its big-game hunting program. To check out Bond Swamp, drive down to Macon from Atlanta and choose from a variety of accommodations, from Hilton and Marriott to Super 8s and independent hotel operators. 2331 Georgia Highway 33 South, Sylvester, Georgia 31791; 229-776-0585 . Justin Trails Resort, Wisconsin . The Driftless Area of Wisconsin is experiencing a great white-tailed deer season this year. To see some of the action, or to hunt turkey, wild pheasant, or waterfowl during the fall migration, book a room at the ecofriendly Justin Trails Resort in the countryside of Sparta, Wisconsin, a destination for nature lovers. The property -- a series of log cabins and suites equipped with fireplaces and jacuzzi tubs -- caters to nature photographers, hikers, and golfers, but the resort has relationships with local hunting and fishing guides in Sparta and in nearby Viroqua and Onalaska. They will be able to help out with licenses and gear. Hunting also takes place on the property during the gun deer season around Thanksgiving (so hiking is off limits). Rooms range from $135 to $325 a night. 7452 Kathryn Avenue, Sparta, Wisconsin 54656; 608-269-4522 . The Webb Farm, North Carolina . For another quaint quail hunting getaway, try The Webb Farm, an inn encompassing 1,200 acres in central North Carolina. The Webb family has been organizing hunts in the Sandhills region for generations, and it puts a lot of time and resources into quality bird management and dog training, with a full kennel on the property. Webb Farm is big on encouraging the next generation of hunters to get into the sport and hosts plenty of corporate clients -- so experience and passion for hunting are not prerequisites here. Guests stay in a 19th-century style lodge with a large front porch, a great room with a fireplace, and simple but comfortable rooms. Days at Webb Farm end with a cocktail and a multi-course dinner (think fried quail, pear tarts, lobster mac 'n' cheese) prepared by the chefs. Rates range from $700 for a half-day duck hunt with lunch to $1,300 for a duck and quail hunt, lodging, lunch and dinner. Otherwise, lodging is $250 and includes breakfast and dinner. The fall season began on October 1 and will run through March. 522 John Webb Road, Ellerbe, North Carolina; 910-995-0207 . Grosse Ile Pilot House, Michigan . The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, located near the Detroit suburb of Trenton, opened for the first time this fall to migratory bird hunting, upland game hunting, and big-game hunting. It's a potential boon for a local economy that could use an influx of spending. The refuge includes islands, marshes, coastal wetlands, and 48 miles of the Detroit River. Because it is located so close to an urban area -- a rarity in the hunting world -- there are plenty of places to stay during a hunting expedition. But a unique option is the Grosse Ile Pilot house, a historic World War II officers club. Rooms are simple but not inelegant, with kitchens and queen beds, and the house itself is an old brick beauty with a white-columned porch. Rooms run from $86 to 96 per night. 9645 Groh Road, Grosse Ile Township, Michigan; 734-671-2295 . Shelter Harbor Inn, Rhode Island . Those who don't want to travel too far from major Northeastern cities to hunt may want to venture to Rhode Island's Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge, which just added deer to its big-game hunting program and is open to sport fishing. This is a great destination for RVs and camping, but those disinclined to roughing it should try the Shelter Harbor Inn about five miles away in Westerly, Rhode Island. The property includes a large main farmhouse, a barn annex, and a carriage house, and rooms run from $116 to $198 a night. 10 Wagner Road, Westerly, Rhode Island; 401-322-8883 .

"New York (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday unveiled what she described as a ""blueprint"" to guide global efforts in wiping out the AIDS virus, focusing on improving treatment and prevention practices to ""get ahead of the pandemic."" The initiative is part of a plan to ""usher in an AIDS-free generation,"" said Clinton, who hailed a 200% increase in U.S.-funded antiretroviral drug treatments since 2008. Clinton announced the plan, officially titled the ""President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Blueprint: Creating an AIDS-free Generation,"" at the State Department, two days ahead of World AIDS Day. She was joined by Eric Goosby, U.S. global AIDS coordinator. ""We can reach a point where virtually no children are born with the virus,"" Clinton said, adding that the plan also aims to further reduce transmission rates and increase access to medical treatment for those who are already infected. The program is also expected to address gender inequities that she said puts women and girls at a higher risk of contracting the virus. AIDS-related deaths have dropped more than 25% over the last six years, and countries with some of the highest rates of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -- which leads to AIDS -- are now seeing substantial drops in mortality rates, according to a recent report by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. ""The pace of progress is quickening -- what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS. ""We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow-through, we can reach our shared goals by 2015."" The AIDS Quilt, and hoping for 'The Last One' New HIV infections have dropped more than 50% in 25 low- and middle-income countries. In traditionally hard-hit places like Malawi and Botswana, the rates of new infections have dropped 73% and 71%, respectively. And yet while nearly a quarter of new cases in the United States are found in young people, more than half of them do not know they are infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent CDC report said more than 12,000 new cases occurred in people between 13 and 24 years old in 2010, and close to 60% of them did not know their HIV status. ""That so many young people become infected with HIV each year is a preventable tragedy,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said in the report. Researchers found that only about a third of people ages 18 to 24 and only 13% of high school students in the United States have ever been tested. About 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV, with roughly 50,000 people contracting it each year.","The announcement comes amid significant gains in fighting the virus .

"(CNN) -- Ten years after ""The Nanny Diaries"" became a bestseller, authors Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus have released back-to-back new books. A lot has changed in the publishing industry, not to mention in the authors' personal lives, between the bookends of their careers thus far. ""Over You"" is a young adult novel about a teenager who helps friends cope with breakups, while struggling to move on from her own heartbreak. And ""Between You and Me"" depicts a famous singer's public self-destruction, in a story reminiscent of recent real-life celebrity dramas. It's been a busy decade for McLaughlin and Kraus, both 38. ""The Nanny Diaries,"" their satirical novel about a young woman who looks after the offspring of spoiled Manhattan parents, sold four million copies. It spawned a sequel (""The Nanny Returns"") and a feature film. McLaughlin and Kraus also wrote ""Citizen Girl,"" ""Dedication,"" and their young adult debut, ""The Real Real,"" in addition to various short stories. But their prolific writing career isn't their only priority these days. The two former nannies recently became mothers: McLaughlin's son, Theo, and Kraus's daughter, Sophie, are both 2 years old. The authors live in New York City, where I went to high school with Kraus. The new mothers talked to CNN over the phone about their transition from writers, to working moms, who are also adapting to a shift in the literary landscape. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: How has becoming mothers impacted your writing? Kraus: We're definitely more efficient than we've ever been before, because we have to be. We no longer have those sweet spot, post-sugar crash, 5 to 8 p.m. hours to make up whatever we haven't gotten done during the day. We have a hard clock-out because we have to be at pickup. We have to do the parts of the day that we love: dinner, bath time and bedtime. And sometimes we get back to work after our kids go to bed, but we're usually really brain-fried by then, in a way that we didn't used to be. McLaughlin: We're a lot less precious about getting to work. We're not getting that perfect cup of tea, and waiting until the morning light is just so, and finding just the right inspiration. It's butt in the chair, when you get the kids settled, and you just go. The upside of that for our writing creatively is that you're in a constant state of thinking about the novel. Your brain is constantly firing on problem solving. Are the characters working? All those hard questions that you have to put the material through are ever-present now. CNN: Would you say that becoming mothers around the same time brought you closer together as a writing team? Kraus: Definitely. I can't imagine what it would have been like if it had been one of us years apart from the other. Because I think you can't appreciate how tired you are, or how much willpower you have to harness on some days to focus, until you've done it. It really is like nothing else. And I think that we have a lot of compassion for each other. We understand what it is when the other has been up all night with their children, if someone has the flu or something. I think it's impossible if you haven't had kids yet to really get that. McLaughlin: Becoming a parent is such an extreme change in your life. I think it's invaluable to your sanity to have somebody who understands it and is going through it with you. Just on an individual level, regardless of the work, on a personal level, it's priceless to have that support from somebody who gets it. You don't have to explain yourself in that way. It's just really comforting. CNN: You have two new books out, in different genres. Has motherhood helped you to write something that you wouldn't have been able to before? Kraus: It's funny. We look back at books that we've finished with a different lens than we have before. Specifically, we talked a lot about ""The Nanny Diaries"" in the last couple of years because when we were nannies, we couldn't really understand why so much derision and scorn was thrown the way of not just us, but our colleagues. And now that we're parents, and we're so dependent on having fantastic caregivers, so that we can step away and do things that we need to do, we're even more mind-boggled by it than we were before. We are so appreciative of the women who come in and make our kids' days awesome. And we love that our kids love these women. We appreciate the affection that these women give our children, and the structure, and the education and the discipline. And it means the world to us. CNN: Did you ever consider not coming back to work after your children were born, or was it agreed that you definitely would? Kraus: Speaking for myself, I was counting the days until my daughter was old enough to start daycare. They have a 3-month-(old) policy. I love doing both. And I am so grateful that I have a career that I am deeply committed to and that brings me so much joy. And it makes me a happy person, which I think makes me a happy mom. I am so psyched when I get to pickup at 5:30. And I try to make those hours with her as fun as possible because I've had a good day. Even the tough days are good days. And I am grateful to have both in my life. McLaughlin: I agree to all of that and I think, additionally, it was interesting for me to discover the moments I've had of: 'I should just be doing this; I should just be parenting' have not come ever from not wanting to be working or a lack of passion to be working. It comes from moments where there aren't enough hours in the day. It's wishing I had more time to do both. I feel really blessed to be able to go to work every day. I have no question that it makes me a better parent. It fulfills me so much that I am able to be so much more present with my son. CNN: Do your kids play together? Kraus: Not as often as we would like! McLaughlin: But when they do, they are quite enchanted with each other. Kraus: It was so cute. They kissed each other on the lips goodbye at Christmas. It was painfully cute. CNN: You're collaborating with Teen Vogue and EstÃ©e Lauder on ""breakup to beautiful"" makeovers at Nordstrom stores. Did you approach them? Or did they come to you? Kraus: This was Emma's brainchild. McLaughlin: We reached out. The landscape of publishing is rapidly shifting. It's a very unstable time for an author. I think we've been doing a lot of thinking about how we can continue to be out there when we've lost so much marketing via foot traffic of brick and mortar stores, and the consolidation of retailers. That was so much of how novelists depended upon connecting with readers. So we have been doing a lot of thinking outside of the box about how to do that. McLaughlin and Kraus are signing copies of ""Over You"" at EstÃ©e Lauder counters in various Nordstrom stores through December 1.","It's been 10 years since Emma McLaughlin, Nicola Kraus wrote ""The Nanny Diaries""

"TROY, Virginia (CNN)  -- ""My total sentence was 55 years -- for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,"" recalls Carolyn LeCroy. Carolyn LeCroy started The Messages Project after seeing how a lack of family visits left other prisoners unhappy. Twelve years ago, LeCroy walked out of prison, only to walk right back in -- but this time, on her own terms. After witnessing firsthand the effects of broken relationships between incarcerated parents and their children, the former inmate and mother of two now works to help repair those bonds. Her tool: video messages from prison. ""I took a bad situation and I made something good of it,"" she says. In 1994, LeCroy's life took an unexpected turn when she was arrested. The news producer claims she had been allowing a former friend to use her storage unit. ""Believe me, I knew that it was marijuana [in there]; he had told me,"" LeCroy says. ""I had no idea the amount."" LeCroy says police were looking for something else when their drug dog hit on her unit. ""The guy it belonged to ran, so I was literally left holding the bag,"" LeCroy recalls. ""I'd never had even a traffic ticket. And then this happened. And I got 55 years."" LeCroy's sentence was eventually reduced and she served a fraction of that amount. But the experience in prison changed her life. ""When I was in prison, and I would get visits, I would come back to the floor, and I would see the women who never got visits,"" LeCroy recalls. ""And they were always depressed and unhappy."" According to the U.S. Department of Justice, only 20 percent of prison inmates receive monthly visits from their children. As an exception to the statistic, LeCroy calls herself one of the lucky ones. Visits from her sons, ages 18 and 22, kept her going. ""Sometimes these prisons are a three- or four-hour drive away from home and little children have no way of getting themselves there,"" she says. ""If there isn't a caretaker who can make the commitment, the kids just do not get to see mom or dad."" Witnessing fellow inmates' sadness, LeCroy remembers thinking, ""If the women are feeling this, I can imagine what the children are feeling."" So after making parole in 1996, LeCroy used her background as a film and video producer to start The Messages Project. In December 1999, she and volunteer camera crews were granted admission to Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women in Troy, Virginia. There, they recorded video messages with mothers to be mailed to their children and families as Christmas gifts. Since then, The Messages Project has worked in six state prisons at least three times a year.  Watch LeCroy describe the personal experience that led her from marijuana to messages » . ""For many of the inmates, these videos are the first time they have taken responsibility and apologized to their kids, and the first step to establishing a bond that was lost when they went to jail,"" LeCroy says.  Watch how LeCroy's Messages Project helps inmates connect to their children » . LeCroy and volunteers have recorded roughly 3,000 video messages, stories, poems and wishes from inmates to their children and families.  Watch LeCroy and volunteers help an incarcerated mother record her emotional message » . ""One inmate taught his son how to shoot hoops; others have read their children bedtime stories,"" she says. ""The kids play it over and over. Some won't go to sleep unless mom reads them that book."" When funds allow, LeCroy sends the book with the inmate's video. ""I think a lot of people have a preconceived notion of what an inmate is,"" says LeCroy. ""One of the things I try to do is to show that they're humans; they're real people. And they have children and they have families and they all love them.""","In prison, Carolyn LeCroy saw other inmates depressed by a lack of family visits .
Out on parole, LeCroy used her video experience to start The Messages Project .

The bodies of Michael and Thelma King of South Carolina were discovered Friday at their residence in Cupecoy, according to Taco Stein, St. Maarten's solicitor general, who described it as ""an ugly scene."" An unidentified suspect was taken into custody early Sunday and is being interviewed, Stein said.

"(CNN) -- A DNA link may signal a break in a 36-year-old investigation into the slaying of four children, the Oakland County, Michigan, prosecutor's office announced Tuesday. The so-called Oakland County Child Killer is believed to be responsible for the deaths of Mark Stebbins, 12, Jill Robinson, 12, Kristine Mihelich, 10, and Timothy King, 11, who were kidnapped and found dead between 1976 and 1977. Using technology unavailable to investigators at the time of the crimes, the FBI DNA unit at Quantico tested and analyzed human hairs found on the bodies of Stebbins and King, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators were able to establish a mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, profile link between the hairs, establishing they came from the same person, essentially proving the two crimes were connected. Source: DNA at Occupy protest similar to material on victim's CD player . ""This is the first piece of evidence that actually links any of the victims together. It was always believed that these two killings were linked to the same person, however that was an assumption based on the similarities in the crime,"" said Jessica R. Cooper, Oakland County Prosecutor. Armed with proof the boys' death was connected, authorities pulled up more evidence from the 1970s investigation. At the time, police had found a person of interest and were able to search his car. The car was a 1966 Pontiac Bonneville. The investigators took samples from the interior of the car and found small hairs, fibers and fur. They were placed in evidence where they remained for decades, until this material, too, was submitted to the FBI DNA unit for testing and analysis. According to prosecutors, the testing revealed that the hairs recovered from the Bonneville had the same mtDNA profile as the hairs recovered from the boys' bodies. The owner of the car, 70-year-old Archibald ""Ed"" Sloan, is serving a life sentence for two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Sloan was tested for a DNA match, but it was determined he did not share the same DNA profile: The hairs found on the boys and in the car were not his. ""It is believed that Sloan would allow others to use his 1966 Bonneville, as well as the other described vehicles, so investigators are looking for information concerning any other people who may have used this car, or had access to any of these vehicles. Finding anyone like this who turns out to be the donor of the hair may be the key to solving these two murders,"" Cooper said. Cold case: 'Dating Game' suspect pleads not guilty . The mtDNA results are not absolute. According to prosecutors, the hairs recovered from the boys' bodies were not suitable for autosomal DNA testing, or nuclear DNA testing, the testing most commonly referred to in movies and television. Investigators had to use mtDNA testing, which is less definitive than autosomal DNA testing. ""With nuclear, autosomal DNA ... you're dealing with absolute identification. It's like a fingerprint, unique to each person except twins,"" said Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky, forensic scientist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, ""Mitochondrial DNA is completely different. If you have a hair from a person, that person's siblings and all maternal relatives would share that mitochondrial profile. It's not unique to a particular person."" On the other hand, Kobilinsky said an mtDNA link is still significant, and enough to cast suspicion on anyone who shares the mtDNA profile, ""People have been convicted on mtDNA evidence alone,"" he said. Authorities are hopeful the new evidence will help them catch the killer. ""We are excited about this new opportunity,"" said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, ""This haunts every police officer who was around then and is around today."" Authorities encourage anyone with information to call the tip line at 1-800-442-7766.

"(CNN) -- Some of the bravest people I know are cowering today in eastern Congo, wondering where their supporters are. While our daily news zeroes in on Syria and Gaza, the fiscal cliff and Christmas sales, our friends in the war-ravaged part of the immense, mineral-rich Democratic Republic of the Congo are once again convulsed in a conflict they did not choose. A resident from Goma, in North Kivu province, who for security reasons must not be named, sent me a heartbreaking e-mail accompanied by a photo taken by The Associated Press' Jerome Delay. It shows a tiny girl leading a long line of displaced women who carry enormous loads on their backs, a look of utter desperation on her face as tears stream down her cheeks. The e-mail says, ""This girl is a future mother, barely four years old and she must walk many kilometers due to the attack on her village. She cries, but who is listening? No one takes care of her, no one to console her. Her mother can't help because she is carrying their entire household's possessions on her back. Just one attack on this column of displaced people and she will find herself alone in the jungle. We only ask for peace. It's unacceptable that we deny her the chance to grow up and become a mother one day."" It is shocking how ill-prepared the international community has been for this latest round of violence in Africa. A leading hospital in Goma, where guerrilla forces have been poised to enter the city for months, sent desperate e-mails to friends around the world pleading for antibiotics, painkillers, plaster and bandages, as international agencies focused on evacuating their staff members from border areas. E-mails I received showed bloody, shattered limbs of children and badly wounded patients with expressions of horror and despair. Many call Congo the ""rape capital of the world,"" and when you work as I have with the doctors and nurses who have treated tens of thousands of rape survivors, it's hard not to acknowledge some truth to this terrible epithet. For the past 16 years, armed factions supplied by Rwanda, Uganda and the ragtag and ill-paid army of the Congolese government itself have carved up the Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu, marauding, pillaging, killing, abducting children to be soldiers and, yes, gang-raping women and girls as well as men and boys. All the while, gold, diamonds and precious coltan ore have continued to be extracted and exported as the people of the Kivus have suffered without electricity, roads, schools and good government. The single largest U.N. peace-keeping force in the world, MONUSCO, stood by virtually impotent last week as some 1,500 M23 rebels overran Goma. Congolese troops, many of them hungry and penniless, ran for the hills. And while we gathered around our Thanksgiving tables, the people of Goma hid in their homes or fled. For months, refugees from North Kivu have streamed across the border into Rwanda as the rebels, led by indicted war criminal Bosco Ntaganda, have mounted increasingly brazen attacks on North Kivu villages. While driving across the Rwandan border into Goma in May, I saw buses and cars loaded with families carrying their meager possessions, once again fleeing chaos in their country and renewed attacks by the M23 rebels. Last month when I traveled to South Kivu, Goma was under curfew. In Goma, people who have bravely defended the rule of law and supported human rights for more than a decade were terrorized into silence amid reports of targeted assassinations and disappearances. The Goma prison emptied out mass murderers and rapists, previously convicted by courageous magistrates in the mobile courts set up across the region in recent years. MONUSCO reported that it was airlifting the magistrates to safety, an ominous sign that justice is giving way to guns. In 2008, the International Criminal Court accused Bosco Ntaganda of conscripting children and called for his immediate arrest. The court's prosecutor has stated that he is as dangerous a war criminal as the Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony. Once again, governments responsible for setting up and subsidizing the international rule of law have failed these very institutions. Meanwhile, in South Kivu's capital of Bukavu, a two-hour boat ride across the lake, residents prepared for the unknown. Who launched the brazen armed attack in October on our beloved medical colleague, Dr. Denis Mukwege, whose hospital near Bukavu has treated tens of thousands of rape survivors? Was this a warning shot? Amazingly, in the midst of the current convulsions, military magistrates in this city are prosecuting rapes and pillaging by their own government's troops as they defend the rule of law despite the chaos. As one of the magistrates told me Wednesday, ""It's our country, and we will defend justice here until it's no longer safe."" The courage and commitment to justice and human rights of our Congolese counterparts are an incredible inspiration. Their actions must inspire not only our admiration but our reciprocal commitment to respond with equal political courage and whatever other resources we can bring to bear. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susannah Sirkin.","Violence erupted in eastern Congo, creating a humanitarian crisis .

"(CNN) -- [Updated 3:45 p.m. Monday, October 29] An aluminum sculpture called ""Greetingman"" bows to people Wednesday in Montevideo, Uruguay. The naked blue man is nearly 20 feet tall and weighs three tons. It was donated by South Korean artist Yoo Young-ho, who has already built one ""Greetingman"" in his home country. Yoo's goal is to put up 1,000 of them across the globe as a way to link other cultures and people. ""The greeting is the first step in any relationship,"" Yoo said Wednesday in Montevideo. ""It's the principle of all communication."" Uruguay was chosen by Yoo because it is diametrically opposite of South Korea on the world map. He hopes the project will help Uruguayans get to know more about his country and the traditional Korean way of greeting. ""Greetingman"" is blue, Yoo says, because blue is a neutral color that couldn't be perceived as symbolizing a specific skin color. And it is naked to reflect all men -- clothing might have symbolized someone's social standing or status. Yoo raised money for the Uruguay sculpture by selling 800 much smaller ""Greetingman"" statues for $200 each, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. For more about the project and Yoo's future plans, check out the ""Greetingman"" website.

"New York (CNN) -- This week I was sent on a three-day work trip to New York because, for some unfathomable reason, these people trust me outside the confines of my cube. Generally speaking, I don't mind being there. I like my cube. It has Tiki torches. Nevertheless, they were sending me out on an assignment with real journalistic merit. (Mind you, this wasn't it. This will make you dumber.) So, on the morning of my flight I poked around several sites to see what was trending in the Big Apple. Surely there was something locally interesting going on that people were talking about all over the Web -- something culturally relevant and noteworthy that could give us a deeper glimpse into the psyche and spirit of New York. Conclusion: It seems they like a sports team known as the Yankees. Fortunately, when the rest of the Web gives you Yankees, there's always Reddit. And after a simple search for ""New York City,"" I found a newly uploaded photo that was becoming somewhat popular with users on that site. The image showed wall art from somewhere in the city depicting one of Nintendo's Mario Brothers throwing a vitamin and yelling, ""GET YO' FIX."" Locally interesting? Not really. Culturally relevant? Doubtful. Noteworthy? Hardly. But it was popular on Reddit, and that's good enough for me. I have fairly low standards. Which is to say, I have none. (Seriously. I like Olive Garden.) Later I learned the art was actually the character Dr. Mario, who I believe was an alter ego of Super Mario -- the Italian plumber who got freaky with a princess in the Mushroom Kingdom. I wasn't immediately aware of this because my fascist parents wouldn't let me have a Nintendo as a kid. I admit it was a bit of a first-world problem, but to this day I'm still bitter to be the only one from my generation who doesn't know the secret ""Thirty Lives"" cheat code to ""Contra."" Speaking of my parents ... this is the part of the column where my dad turns to my mom and asks, ""What the hell is he talking about?"" And then my mom says, ""Some sort of video game thing."" And then he says, ""This is stupid."" And he's right. This is pretty stupid. But finding Dr. Mario was a good excuse for an urban adventure in New York. And a short flight later I was there, walking through the terminal at LaGuardia, which is the city's way of immediately reminding visitors to use Purell. Often. As soon as I checked into my hotel I quickly logged onto Reddit and found that some of the commenters had already discussed the art's location. This was helpful. Dr. Mario was in Chinatown at the corner of Walker Street and Cortlandt Alley. Also on that corner? Nothing you ever need to see. So, after a short ride downtown on the Q train and wandering about with the help of maps on my iPhone, I finally spotted the art off in the distance. Iceberg! Right ahead! There it was. That thing I saw on the Internet! Sadly, it was a feeling similar to poking your head through the sun gate at Machu Picchu and seeing the ancient ruins for the first time after four days of hiking the Inca Trail. Only, Machu Picchu is one of the most amazing wonders on the face of the planet. And this was Dr. Mario throwing a vitamin. Anthropologists won't be knocking on my door. But I guess it says something about the spirit of discovery and the possibilities that stem from random curiosities found online. There's usually fun involved with a completely pointless adventure. Without Dr. Mario, I wouldn't have ventured off into this particular part of town. I wouldn't have enjoyed roasted pork and wonton soup at a little hole-in-the-wall called Wo Hop. And I wouldn't have met two really nice tourists from Charlotte on the subway. Granted, I might have otherwise napped and built a small fort out of my hotel bed sheets. So, that was kind of a lost opportunity. But, still ... totally worth it. The moral of the story is this: Somewhere in your city there's something completely unimportant and you should totally go see it. Remember, though. The world is a strange, dirty place. So use Purell.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Australian police say seven people have been arrested in Romania as part of a joint international criminal investigation into the largest credit card data theft in Australia's history. Among those detained by the Romanian investigative agency was Gheorghe ""the Carpathian Bear"" Ignat, a Greco-Roman heavyweight wrestling champion. Officials say the year-long investigation, dubbed ""Operation Lino,"" involved 14 countries and uncovered phony credit card transactions worth AUD30 million (US$31 million). The criminal syndicate had access to half a million Australian credit cards, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) stated in a press release. ""Initially we were approached by the banking industry, who had noticed irregular charges on credit cards... All of the information led back to Romania,"" an AFP official told CNN. ""We then built a brief of evidence to provide to the Romanian police, which allowed them to carry out an investigation in Romania."" The majority of victims were small businesses, service stations, petrol stations and corner stores, who often have less-secure payment gateways. The hackers profited by selling data to do ""Card Not Present'""(CNP) transactions -- the use of account information without the physical card being involved -- or to create counterfeit credit cards. They then carried out thousands of counterfeit transactions across the globe in Asia, Europe and the U.S., according to the AFP. ""There's very good consumer protection here in Australia. The AUD30 million was spread across banks, credit unions and the membership and no cardholder lost money,"" Heather Wellard of the Australian Bankers' Association told CNN. ""The important thing is banks' systems were not compromised."" Statistics from a self-regulatory body in Australia's payment industry show that of the one million cases of bank card fraud reported in Australia in 2011, 65% were perpetrated overseas. Latest industry figures also show that CNP fraud in Australia is on the rise, accounting for 71% of all fraud value on Australian-issued bank cards. ""Such crimes tend to come from overseas,"" the Australian police told CNN. ""This same group has targeted businesses in other countries as well."" Earlier this year, the Attorney-General of Australia, Nicola Rox acknowledged the increased danger of identity theft and fraud posed by cyber criminals on the internet. ""We're no longer just dealing with guards and gates, bombs and bullets when we talk about defending our nation and its secrets,"" Rox said. ""We're now fairly and squarely working in an online environment. And this has created a whole new dimension of both opportunity and threat."" In July, Australia's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security began an ongoing inquiry into potential reforms of national security legislation to battle cyber crimes.","""Operation Lino"" involved 14 countries and uncovered credit card transactions worth $31M .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- For six days, Israel has carried out a large-scale air offensive in Gaza, aiming to halt destructive and sometimes deadly rocket launches emanating from the Palestinian territory. Monday saw more carnage, more heated words and more damage on both sides. There was also more movement toward a possible intensification as Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said Israel had finished its planning for a ground invasion of Gaza. If Israeli troops do invade, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said it would ""not be a picnic."" ""We do not want escalation, nor do we call for a ground war,"" he said Monday. ""But we are not afraid of it, nor will we back down."" Online campaign seeks end to violence . All this violence and rhetoric has intensified international efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, starting with a cease-fire. ""This must stop,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said late Sunday. A steady stream of U.N. and European diplomats have and will be traversing the region trying to calm the situation. On Monday, Ban and an Israeli delegation went to Egypt, where that nation's top intelligence official presented Israel a letter outlining Hamas' proposal for a cease-fire, said a general in Egyptian intelligence who is optimistic about a deal being reached. The fighting has challenged Israel's relationship with Egypt, yet Israeli President Shimon Peres on Monday praised Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy for playing a ""constructive role."" Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor confirmed late Monday that ""negotiations are going on"" that may lead to a cease-fire, though he didn't offer any details. Meanwhile, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and 16 foreign ministers from the league's member states were to arrive in Gaza on Tuesday, to be joined by Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a spokesman for the organization said. U.S. warships move into region . Gaza itself has been under a crippling economic embargo since Hamas won control of the territory from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, after a landslide 2007 election that was followed by intra-Palestinian clashes. The United States, Israel and the European Union characterize the militant fundamentalist Islamic organization Hamas as a terrorist group. In the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will hold talks with the U.N. secretary-general, according to Saeb Erakat, a member of the PLO's executive committee and an Abbas ally. The West Bank has been relatively quiet, though a Palestinian protester did die Monday -- two days after he and others clashed with Israeli troops -- Ramallah Medical hospital director Ahmad Bitawi said. And Israeli troops shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian near Hebron, witnesses said. Diplomats hope to avoid a repeat of 2008, when at least 1,400 died as Israeli troops invaded Gaza after a similar spate of rocket attacks. Israel has signaled it is open to a cease-fire, but only if Gaza militants halt rocket attacks. Air raid sirens yet again resounded all day Monday around Israel, where rocket attacks have killed three and wounded 68 according to Israeli officials. The bloodshed might be worse if not for the ""Iron Dome,"" Israel's missile defense system that has intercepted about 30% of the rockets fired from Gaza since last week, including more than half the 67 fired on Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The missile defense system intercepted several more rockets fired Monday at Ashkelon, the IDF said. But several rockets hit Eshkol, also in southern Israel, with one striking a closed school. ""They have a choice. The minute they will stop (shooting), it will stop,"" Peres said. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said a short-term ""Band-Aid"" solution won't do. Israeli government hit with more 44 million cyberattacks . ""There's no doubt that Hamas would agree to an immediate cease-fire, but it wouldn't mean anything. We want to know when it's over, that it's really over,"" he said, adding Israel will use diplomacy or military force -- whatever is necessary -- to ensure that southern Israel doesn't continue to face the threat of rockets. Like Regev, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim al Thani said there can't be a repeat of 2008 -- though he has a different view as to why. Having gone to Gaza a few weeks ago and observed ""the miserable life"" of residents there, Sheikh al Thani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour it's not tenable for there to be more assassinations of Hamas leaders and Israeli forces surrounding Gaza, as was the case four years ago. ""(Hamas wants) a complete package for the cease-fire,"" he said. iReport: Running for shelter in Ashkelon . Palestinian health officials said 104 people, among them women and children, have been killed -- at least 24 on Monday. They also say 860 have been wounded in Gaza since Israel began its offensive in response to what Israel characterized as incessant rocket attacks by militants. Israeli authorities say they take great pains to avoid civilian casualties, though this is difficult to do when rockets are being launched from densely populated civilian areas, where suspected militant leaders are also based. While saying he feels an agreement can be reached, Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti says he blames Israel for the bloodshed thus far. ""The problem is that Israel is using the bombardment of civilians and the killing of children as a tool of negotiations,"" he said. Too young to understand but not to die . Smoke and fire poured from Gaza buildings that had been struck by Israeli warplanes or drone on Monday, when Israel's military said it carried out 80 strikes in addition to the 1,300 executed since last Wednesday. Aqsa TV, Hamas' television station, reported that Israeli tanks were firing into Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, with one of its reporters saying that the Islamic National Bank in Gaza City had been hit. A Gaza City stadium, where the IDF said Hamas militants launched rockets toward Israel three days ago, was among the sites hit on Monday. Israeli forces also hit a Gaza City office building used by some media outlets -- as they had Sunday -- killing two, including the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's military media office. That strike targeted four senior Islamic Jihad members who Israel's military said were hiding in the building, including the information chief, Israel's military said. The others were described as key figures in military training, attack planning, long-range rocket operations and arms manufacturing within the same organization. How the Arab Spring has changed the situation in Gaza . ""We targeted only the second floor, which is where the senior terrorists were,"" the IDF said on Twitter, adding that reporters had been used as human shields. ""The rest of the building was unharmed. Direct hit confirmed."" Calls for a truce came on the heels of the single deadliest attack -- an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City on Sunday that left a family of 10 dead within a building's broken concrete and mangled metal. Al Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military arm, called it a ""massacre committed by Israeli occupation"" on Twitter. The Israeli airstrike targeted Yehya Bayaa, ""a senior Hamas member,"" said Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, the Israel Defense Forces' chief spokeswoman. The IDF alleges Bayaa is one of the leaders of a Hamas rocket-launching unit. As it's happening: CNN reports on the ground . The building hit was a known hiding place for Bayaa -- though not his home, as was reported earlier -- Leibovich said. Initially, the IDF reported it killed Bayaa in the attack. But late Sunday, Leibovich said she did not know for sure whether Bayaa had been killed. Israeli military Capt. Eytan Muchman added Monday that, ""very regrettably,"" the Dallo family was inside the building. Regev later told CNN's Anderson Cooper, ""Obviously, it was a foul-up"" -- saying that while Israel doesn't know exactly what happened and believes Hamas is using civilians as human shields, it is ""a failure"" every time an innocent bystander is killed. That same day, hundreds gathered at the al-Isra mosque for a funeral of some family members killed, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported. The firing of rockets before and after the funeral didn't deter some mourners. ""Revenge, revenge,"" they chanted. Talking Monday night with CNN's Piers Morgan, Peres insisted Israel has nothing against people in Gaza or Muslims, in general. He said his country's aim -- and the only reason it launched its military offensive -- is to keep its own citizens safe. ""We don't hate them. We don't try to get any glories,"" the Israeli president said. ""We want to live in peace."" Security Clearance: Why Israel might hesitate to invade . CNN's Sara Sidner, Arwa Damon, Jonathan Wald, Greg Botelho, Chelsea Carter, Kareem Khadder, Ben Wedeman, Fred Pleitgen, Amir Ahmed, Jessica Yellin and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: An Israeli spokesman confirms negotiations are ongoing, doesn't give details .

"(CNN) -- The major concern of the United States in the current Israeli-Hamas conflict is a potential Israeli ground incursion into Gaza, U.S. officials said Friday. That would be a disastrous escalation that could trigger a larger conflict, a senior U.S. official told CNN. ""Escalation is what we are concerned about. We don't want it to escalate to the point where Israel feels it has to take additional action, specifically ground force action,"" the official said. Israel has some ground forces on the border and ready to act if they are called to do so, said Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, in a conference call with reporters Friday. Israel's Cabinet on Friday authorized the call-ups of up to 75,000 reservists, prime minister's spokesman Mark Regev said. Israel's military said earlier in the day that 30,000 troops are being mobilized for a possible move into Gaza. So far, Israeli tank units and troops have stayed outside Gaza. But the senior U.S. official indicated while the United States unequivocally supports Israel's right to self-defense, the U.S. message right now is for Israel not to enter Gaza on the ground. ""Ground forces would clearly be a major escalation,"" he said. Q&A: Gaza strikes could be beginning of ground attack . The official said the worry is Israeli ground troops could lead to drawing Egypt into the conflict. ""What action would Egypt take, would they move into Sinai?"" he said. He said the assessment is that a number of other Arab nations in the region would then, at least rhetorically, join with Egypt against Israel. The official emphasized this is a U.S. worry and the strong hope is Hamas will stop its rocket attacks on Israel, thereby ending Israeli strikes. ""The question also is how much Hamas wants to risk,"" the official said. A second official said the United States also is watching closely to see if Iran, which backs Hamas, attempts to infiltrate new fighters or weapons supplies into Gaza. Neither official would speak on the record because they were discussing sensitive national security matters. Opinion: New dangers in familiar Gaza violence . Daniel Ben Simon, an Israeli Knesset member not aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition, said Friday that he sensed ""almost an absence"" from Washington, adding, ""It's time for the Americans to step in."" ""We need the boss, and the boss is still the White House,"" Ben Simon said, calling U.S. officials ""the only ones that can control the situation and ... talk freely"" to all sides. ""It seems the White House is too silent."" U.S. President Barack Obama did talk Friday with Netanyahu, after the Israeli prime minister called him to voice ""deep appreciation ... for the United States' investment in the Iron Dome rocket and mortar defense system,"" the White House said. ""The president reiterated U.S. support for Israel's right to defend itself, and expressed regret over the loss of Israeli and Palestinian civilian lives,"" the statement said. ""The two leaders discussed options for de-escalating the situation."" iReport: Protests over Israel-Gaza conflict sparks in St. Louis . Obama called Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy, commending ""Egypt's efforts to de-escalate the situation and (expressing) his hope that these efforts would be successful,"" the White House said in another statement. The president also ""expressed regret for the loss of Israeli and Palestinian civilian lives."" The State Department says Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made a number of phone calls trying to muster international pressure to stop what it terms a ""very, very dangerous situation"" in Gaza. Clinton, traveling in Asia, called Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr for the second time in as many days, as well as Jordanian King Abdullah and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . ""In all cases her message has been the same: that we are urging a de-escalation of this conflict, we are urging those countries with influence on Hamas and other groups in Gaza to use that influence to get a de-escalation."" There will be other calls, Nuland said, to other countries to maximize pressure on Hamas. ""I think we are all in the same place. The Egyptians are, the Turkish government is,"" she said. Nuland added that the United States is encouraged that Egypt is involved in what she termed ""urgent diplomacy."" The Egyptian prime minister was in Gaza on Friday, and Nuland said the call was an opportunity to get an update on that visit and to get a sense from the Egyptians in the wake of the visit what further steps they can take to help de-escalate the situation. The U.S. Navy is continuing to keep to the standard deployment of three warships in the eastern Mediterranean that can shoot down ballistic missiles fired by Iran that would threaten Israel. Those ships are not equipped to deal with the short-range rockets being used by Hamas. The Navy also has quietly made the decision to keep three amphibious warships with several hundred Marines on board in the vicinity of the Mediterranean in the unlikely event they might be needed to assist Americans leaving Israel. Three U.S. military officials stressed strongly that the scenario is very unlikely. ""No one has even drawn an evacuation plan on the back of a cocktail napkin yet,"" one official said. But the three ships have been told to stay in place until there is more certainty about what is happening. The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv took precautionary measures Friday, reducing its staff and suspending routine consular services, according to an embassy security message. Additionally, embassy staff were instructed to keep their children home from school for the day and were prohibited from traveling to the south of Israel.

"(CNN) -- There's no denying it, the holiday crush is upon us. There's the shopping to do, the cards to mail, the decorations to put up, the cooking, the crowds, the in-laws. It can be a lot. For some people, that's reason enough to pack their bags and hit the road come December. Others simply enjoy experiencing the festivities in a far-flung locale. For those of you who would rather stuff a suitcase than another turkey this year, here are a handful of festive hotels that go all out for the season, ensuring that you not only don't miss being at home for the holidays but that you relish having someone else do all the work. Grove Park Inn . Asheville, North Carolina . The mountain setting and lodge-like design of this historic inn, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will have you in a holiday mood even before you learn about all of its myriad celebrations, from the caroling choirs to the time-honored yule log ceremony in the Great Hall. The event for which the hotel is best known is the National Gingerbread House Competition, which it has hosted for the past two decades. Competitors come from near and far to whip up confections you just have to see to believe. The Plaza . New York City . Who wouldn't love to spend Christmas in New York City at a quintessential Big Apple hotel? Little Kevin McCallister did just that in the popular holiday flick ""Home Alone 2,"" when he checked into this grande dame of New York stays, which is even more spectacular when it's decked out in all its seasonal finery. Of course, not all of us can simply put the bill on our father's credit card as Kevin did, but The Plaza is worth a visit even if you can't afford to stay, be it to check out the decorating of its historic halls or to enjoy a decadent holiday dessert in the Palm Court restaurant. Plus from here, it's mere steps to the elaborate window displays of the shops along Fifth Avenue or a horse-drawn carriage ride through Central Park. Madrona Manor . Healdsburg, California . The festivities at this 18-room Victorian manse in scenic Sonoma Valley wine country center around the holiday table. Every December for more than 20 years, its fine-dining restaurant has presented a series of Dickens Dinners (named for the author of the classic ""A Christmas Carol""), in which singers in period costume serenade diners as they enjoy a five-course meal consisting of nostalgic dishes such as roast goose, beef Wellington and Christmas pudding, all lovingly prepared by Michelin-starred chef Jesse Mallgren. Fairmont Scottsdale Princess . Scottsdale, Arizona . Christmas at the Princess, as this five-diamond desert property's annual festival is called, features everything from an ice skating rink (complete with exhibitions from national ice skating champs) to children's ornament- and dreidel-making classes to train rides to view the more than half a million holiday lights illuminating the vast grounds. There are also fireside chats with Santa, a nightly menorah lighting, marshmallow roasts and more. Big Cedar Lodge . Ridgedale, Missouri . This rustic retreat, 10 miles south of Branson in the wilds of the Ozark Mountains, is the perfect site for a homey holiday with all the trimmings, such as a wagon ride through the countryside ending with s'mores and hot chocolate served around a roaring bonfire. Better yet, you can arrange for Santa's elves to visit your room, deliver the kids a stocking full of goodies and read them a bedtime story. Santa himself can make a visit on Christmas morning. They even throw Ol' St. Nick a farewell party before he heads back to the North Pole, and you don't even have to get out of your pajamas to attend. Rooms from $149. Gaylord National Resort . National Harbor, Maryland . Fancy a trip to the nation's capital this yuletide? Then consider a stay at this D.C.-area megaresort. It's a favorite for meetings and conventions, so it's plenty big enough for you and all of your friends and family. Big, too, is its annual Christmas on the Potomac event, complete with multihued ice sculptures you can actually slide down, nightly indoor snowfalls, a 60-foot-high glass tree, brunches and photos with Santa, and some 2 million twinkling lights. The theme of this year's extravaganza is Shrek the Halls, with the popular DreamWorks characters being featured in everything from Shrek-shaped waffles to meet and greets with Puss in Boots. Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island . Amelia Island, Florida . The setting along the sandy shores of the Atlantic at this elegant lodging may not evoke a winter wonderland, but that doesn't mean you can't get into the Christmas spirit. Especially when the S.S. Amelia -- a pirate ship constructed out of gingerbread, 1,200 pounds of sugar and 3,000 eggs -- docks in the hotel lobby. Or at other observances, such as Santa's Storybook Tea, where Mr. and Mrs. Claus join you for a photo op, the reading of a classic holiday story, and afternoon tea with tasty finger sandwiches, pastries, candy and cakes. Auberge Residences at Pronghorn . Bend, Oregon . If you really want to get away from home for the holidays yet still have all the comforts of home, rent yourself one of Pronghorn's deluxe one- to three-bedroom units that start at 2,000 square feet and include use of the clubhouse, spa and concierge. They will set up your unit with a decked-out tree or supply one for you to decorate, and they will provide, upon request, the ingredients to make your own wreath, cranberries and popcorn to create strings of garland, a copy of "" 'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" a variety of holiday DVDs to watch and milk and cookies to leave out for Santa. They'll also store and wraps your gifts.","The Grove Park Inn in Asheville, North Carolina, hosts a gingerbread house competition .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Many of Hong Kong's foreign residents will have to think twice before buying a new home in this Asian financial hub. In a surprise move last month to curb skyrocketing property prices, the Hong Kong government announced the immediate implementation of a 15% property tax on all home purchases -- by foreigners. The fallout has been fast. ""I think it's a harsh measure,"" says Brock Little, an Australian who has called Hong Kong home the past six years. Little, a realtor with local agency Island Property, says the anti-foreigner tax has priced some of his western clients out of the market. ""Some of them who've been here for three to five years...now they basically see Hong Kong as not very welcoming, not really accommodating, to setting up permanently,"" he says. Little adds the tax fails to match Hong Kong's image as a world-class city and that some of his clients are now thinking about leaving. But the Hong Kong government sees the tax as a necessary policy to protect the city's economy from an inflating property bubble -- fueled not just by foreign investment but also by low interest rates linked to protracted quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and limited supply of new housing on the market. In just the first nine months of this year, average property prices in Hong Kong jumped 20%. Since the start of 2010, the price ballooned 50%. This has made Hong Kong's property sector a dream for established homeowners but a nightmare for potential buyers. ""Hong Kong is the most expensive of our cities in which to purchase property,"" wrote Savills, a global real estate services provider, in its Spring 2012 World Cities Review. The city is pricier than Singapore, London, Tokyo and Paris, Savills found. Savills added Hong Kong's property market ""is in a league of its own."" Mainland Chinese targeted . While Hong Kong's new tax affects a broad swath of Hong Kong's foreign population, property experts say the real bull's-eye is on the backs of a more specific group of buyers flush with new wealth from right across the border in China. ""I think it's mainly focusing on mainland buyers,"" says Buggle Lau, chief analyst for Midland Realty, one of Hong Kong's largest real estate companies. He says he does not totally agree with the new tax policy, but that it is something the government has to do. ""Over the past two years and three quarters, we roughly estimate about 9% of the buyers (of Hong Kong property) are from the mainland,"" says Lau. In absolute terms, it may not sound like much, but Lau asserts it is ""a pretty big chunk compared to the annual supply of residential units in Hong Kong."" He says just 8,000 to 10,000 new residential units come online every year -- a supply bottleneck that keeps the city's property prices climbing. With the tax in force, Lau forecasts a 2% to 3% drop in the number of mainland Chinese investors in Hong Kong property. This figure is expected to be 5% in the next six months. ""Unfair"" Jason Liang, 27, is one of the first mainland Chinese in Hong Kong to be hit by the new tax. Two years ago, he moved to the city as a student, then parlayed his diploma into a financial relations job after graduation. Liang and his wife planned to buy his first Hong Kong home in December and had already prepared a 20% down payment. The new tax dashed their dreams, literally overnight. ""It is unfair, emotionally it is unfair for me,"" he said. ""It's a surprising policy because I think Hong Kong is a very free market (and) they don't want to curb any investments."" Liang stressed that he is different from other mainlanders, many of whom are believed to be speculators driving the city's property bubble. ""Most of the speculators are from mainland China,"" he says. ""For me, I'm also from mainland China, but I'm [part of] the people who work here, have a stable salary, and I just want to buy affordable houses, instead of renting a place at a high price."" But he understands the new tax does not differentiate based on intent - only on immigrant status. Interest rates, property supply . Looking ahead, Lau, the real estate analyst, predicts Hong Kong's anti-foreigner property tax may stay in effect through 2015 when the city's interest rates may rebound and when new property is expected to become available, according to government estimates. But he cautions against any expectations of a price crash saying ""property prices will remain flat or soften a little bit"" over the next six months. In the meantime, many would-be buyers will wait out the life of the tax, sitting on their money until the policy ends. Liang says he plans to stay in Hong Kong for the long haul. ""Comparing with mainland China, it is still a better place,"" Liang says. ""It is still a free market for me. So I love it here, I still love it here."" Vivian Kam contributed to this report.","Foreigners are taxed additional 15% for purchasing new homes in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- Former FBI Director Louis Freeh's investigation into possible wrongdoing at Penn State University appears to be examining football coach Joe Paterno's apparent preference for handling scandalous issues internally, and what role that may have played in a potential cover-up involving former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse on June 22. Freeh's group has been poring over internal Penn State e-mails and has interviewed a past university official about the way Paterno influenced a variety of disciplinary matters, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Freeh is leading an internal review of Penn State's handling of the scandal that is unrelated to criminal investigations. The e-mails obtained by CNN from a source familiar with the investigation, and first reported by the Wall Street Journal, show Paterno wielded power that went well beyond the realm of football or even the athletic department. E-mails cast a pall on Penn State's Paterno . In a 2005 e-mail from Dr. Vicky Triponey, then vice president of student affairs in charge of disciplining students, to athletic director Tim Curley and others, she summarizes a meeting they had with Paterno in which he tells her that he wants to be the sole disciplinarian of his players. She criticizes Paterno for wanting to limit the Campus Code of Conduct to incidents that take place on campus and keeping disciplinary matters involving his players private. ""Coach Paterno would rather we NOT inform the public when a football player is found responsible for committing a serious violation of the law and/or our student code -- despite any moral or legal obligation to do so,"" according to her e-mail. In the same e-mail, Triponey, also refers to calls her office was receiving from coaches and others. ""I must insist that the efforts to put pressure on (Student Affairs) and try to influence our decisions...simply MUST STOP,"" she writes. Curley, in a subsequent e-mail, acknowledges that Triponey's take on the conversation with Paterno is accurate. Triponey replies to Curley, ""I know you are caught in the middle of a very difficult situation,"" an apparent reference to appeasing Paterno. In a subsequent e-mail to then-Penn State President Graham Spanier she is more blunt: ""I am very troubled by the manipulative, disrespectful, uncivil and abusive behavior of our football coach,"" she writes. Triponey has been interviewed by the Freeh group, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. In the same e-mail, she calls Paterno's behavior ""atrocious"" and said others are mimicking his behavior. ""It is quite shocking what this man -- who is idolized by people everywhere -- is teaching our students..."" she writes. Triponey's e-mails may be a sign Freeh is also examining the culture around the football team as his investigators work to determine the circumstances surrounding a 2001 sexual incident with a young boy and Sandusky in a Penn State shower room and reported by then graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary. In purported 2001 e-mails between Curley, Schultz, and Spanier, read exclusively to CNN, Curley appears to change his mind about reporting the locker room incident to outside authorities after speaking to Paterno, he wrote in one e-mail. Sandusky was convicted in June of four counts related to the 2001 shower incident, including unlawful contact with minors, a first-degree felony. Curley and former Penn State vice president Gary Schultz face perjury and failure to report child abuse charges in connection with the Sandusky case. They have pleaded not guilty. Disturbing e-mails could spell more trouble for Penn State officials . In 2007, after a widely reported incident where more than a dozen players crashed an off-campus party and started a violent brawl, Paterno appears to send an e-mail, through his assistant, to Spanier that says, ""I want to make sure everyone understands that the discipline of the players involved will be handled by me as soon as I am comfortable that I know all the facts."" Paterno's attorneys have said the coach didn't use e-mail. The exchange shows while he may not have had his own e-mail account, his assistant would still send e-mails for him. Paterno planned to punish the team by forcing them to perform 10 hours of community service and clean up the stadium after home games, according to a memo provided by a source familiar with the investigation. After Triponey tried to discipline football players in the same manner as other students, she was harassed both online and at her home, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. On her front lawn somebody put up a ""for sale"" sign. Police installed a surveillance camera. In the end, the source says Spanier suggested she think about her future at Penn State, and she resigned. After Triponey left Penn State, the university changed its discipline policy involving off-campus incidents. Its current code of conduct says it only applies to ""off campus conduct that affects a Substantial University interest."" The Freeh goup and the university declined comment on this story. Efforts Sunday night to obtain a comment from the Paterno family were unsuccessful. Paterno died of complications from lung cancer in January. The 2001, 2005, and 2007 e-mail exchanges are among many now under investigation by the Freeh group. The e-mails revealed so far suggest coach Paterno preferred to handle bad behavior internally, a preference that may have influenced a decision by university officials not to report Sandusky to authorities in 2001 and allowed him to continue to abuse young boys.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Nine North Korean defectors found near Japan's coast in September were transferred to Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, a Japanese government spokesmen said. The group of nine -- three men, three women and three children -- departed Japan for South Korea in line with their wishes for long-term residence, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Masaru Sato. The nine came under the custody of Japanese Coast Guard after they were discovered drifting in a small wooden boat off the coast of Noto Peninsula in northern Japan on September 13. The government kept the group, who claimed to have escaped from North Korea, in an immigration facility in Nagasaki in southern Japan, for three weeks for questioning. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the government got ""sufficient information"" about the current situation of the secretive country through lengthy interviews with the refugees. It is rare for North Korean defectors to sail to Japan's coast. According to coast guard records, there have been only two other cases. One was in 2006, when four North Koreans floated to northern Japan. The other was in 1987, when a family of 11 drifted to west Japan.","The nine say they are from North Korea .

"(CNN) -- ""Today... May 27... ...is AIMEE DAY!!!"" With those words, Andy Copeland celebrated -- and invited thousands who have followed his family's struggles thanks to his online posts to join him -- a major milestone for his daughter Aimee, as she gamely battles a potentially deadly flesh-eating bacteria. Two weeks ago, Andy Copeland wrote on his Facebook page that the family was anxiously looking forward to a special day he dubbed ""Aimee Day,"" when his 24-year-old daughter could not only breathe on her own but also talk for the first time in weeks. ""We're going to celebrate that day forever for the rest of your life,"" Andy Copeland said he'd told his daughter, as she lay heavily medicated in a bed at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. ""It's the day that my daughter was delivered from this horrible, horrible disease."" Father: 'I have never seen such a strong display of courage' In recent weeks, surgeons have amputated Aimee Copeland's hands, part of her abdomen, one of her legs, and her remaining foot in their effort to stay ahead of the disease. Amid all these operations, there has been reported progress. Last week, for instance, the Georgia woman ""finally stabilized to the point that she has not needed any ventilator assistance for over 24 hours,"" her father said. Yet while she had joked and mouthed words, it wasn't until Sunday that Aimee Copeland's voice was heard again -- meaning the new holiday can now be etched into her family's calendars for years to come. ""Today Aimee has finally spoken her first words,"" Andy Copeland wrote succinctly, promising more details later. His daughter was with friends on May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when the zip line that she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Advocate: Story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness . Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with over 72,500 ""likes"" on his Facebook blog devoted to Aimee's fight. And the psychology department at the University of West Georgia -- where Aimee has been pursuing her master's degree in psychology -- also posted regular updates online. A number of bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Since Copeland's struggle came to light, there have been reports of others fighting the same disease. They include Lana Kuykendall, a South Carolina woman also diagnosed earlier this month, a few days after giving birth to twins. She has had at least 11 ""debridement surgeries"" but thus far no amputations, with her brother Brian Swaffer noting late last week that the disease is confined to his sister's legs and she, too, is breathing on her own.","Aimee Copeland was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis earlier this month .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea called off an attempt to put a satellite in orbit on Thursday, the latest setback to a program that has suffered failures in the past. The launch of the Naro-1 rocket was suspended minutes before takeoff at a launch site on the country's southern coast Thursday afternoon local time. An inspection found problems with the electronic signal in part of the rocket's mechanism, said Cho Yul-rae, a vice minister for education, science and technology. Additional time is needed to find out the reason behind the problem, he said. Analysts say the planned launch could rile the country's hostile neighbor, North Korea, which carried out a botched launch in April for which it was widely criticized. North Korea's secretive, nuclear-armed regime said its rocket, which broke apart soon after takeoff, was also meant to put a satellite in orbit. But the United States and other countries called it a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. The U.N. Security Council condemned the launch. South Korean authorities say their latest launch efforts are a crucial step for the development of the country's civilian space program. The satellite carried by the launch vehicle is mainly intended for gathering climate data, they say. The South Korean launch plan is different from that of the North because it is more transparent, is clearly focused on civilian applications and doesn't contravene U.N. sanctions, according to Lee Chung-min, an international relations professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. Despite that, North Korea is likely to ""insist that a South Korean rocket launch should also be resisted by the international community,"" Lee said. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has not published any reports so far mentioning the planned South Korean launch. The development of the South Korean rocket program, using Russian technology for the first-stage launcher, began in 2002. Previous launch attempts in 2009 and 2010 failed. And this launch was originally scheduled to take place last month before being postponed at the last minute. Seoul is aiming to develop its own thruster by 2021 through a program estimated to cost 1.5 trillion won (about $1.4 billion). A successful launch would put South Korea among the small group of nations that have sent a rocket into space from their own soil. Others include the United States, Russia, China, Japan, France, India, Israel and Iran. Recent satellite imagery suggests North Korea hasn't given up on its own rocket ambitions. The image, released by the company DigitalGlobe, showed increased activity at the North's Sohae Satellite Launch Station on the country's west coast. The company's analysis of the image, which showed similar preparations to those observed ahead the failed satellite launch in April, raised the possibility of a new launch in the next few weeks. But while the U.S. government has observed activity at the North Korean site, it does not believe a launch is imminent, according to U.S. military sources.","NEW: The launch is postponed after an electronic signal problem .

"(CNN) -- South American soccer officials hope to take their showpiece tournament to the United States in 2016 for a centenary celebration that could have big benefits for all concerned, but this week's announcement appears to be somewhat premature. CONCACAF, which runs the game in North and Central America and the Caribbean, said talks regarding what would be a historic tournament are still ongoing, though it is open to the possibility of having the likes of superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar parading their skills in front of sellout crowds. World governing body FIFA has also yet to sanction the event -- which would involve 10 South American nations, the U.S. and Mexico plus four other countries from the CONCACAF region -- in the busy international calendar. The Copa America, which has featured guest nations from CONCACAF since 1993, was last staged in 2011 -- when it was won by Uruguay. The next edition is due to be held in Brazil in 2015, one year after it hosts the 2014 World Cup, while the CONMEBOL federation hopes to stage an additional Copa in the U.S. 12 months later to mark the ruling body's 100th year of existence. ""Even though playing the 2016 Copa America in the CONCACAF region with our teams and those from CONMEBOL would be a wonderful experience for all fans, we are still in the midst of talks and negotiations between all parties involved in this decision,"" CONCACAF general secretary Enrique Sanz said in a statement. ""This is an idea we are hoping to materialize but we are still evaluating and discussing before it becomes official but the intention is definitely there."" Cape Verde to open Africa Cup of Nations . CONCACAF's continental tournament is the biennial Gold Cup, which Mexico won in the U.S. last year. Mexico and Japan will be guest nations at the 2015 Copa. While the prospect of holding the tournament in the U.S. may have great appeal, Sports Illustrated's senior soccer writer Grant Wahl expressed concerns over whether FIFA would allow it. ""The U.S. television money for big soccer tournaments is now quite large -- the U.S. rights for 2018 and 2022 World Cups went for a combined $1.1 billion, which will probably be the highest rights fee for any nation in the world,"" Wahl told CNN. ""There are big questions in terms of will FIFA sanction an event like this and put it on the official calendar? Will FIFA require clubs to release their players for it? None of that has been made public in terms of any agreements."" Can Falcao help Atletico Madrid reign in Spain? The opportunity to compete against teams such as Brazil and Argentina, boasting the likes of Neymar and Messi, is one which Wahl feels could benefit a U.S. team currently playing minor nations such as Panama and Guadeloupe in the Gold Cup. ""The U.S. national team is still trying to improve and the best way to do that is to play meaningful games against good competition,"" he said. ""It is hard in the Gold Cup because other than Mexico, there are not many difficult opponents for the U.S. in CONCACAF. ""To be able to have an important competitive tournament between World Cups is really big for U.S. soccer. It puts U.S. soccer in the public eye in the United States more if you have something like that."" Wahl is confident the tournament would be a big hit with U.S. sports fans. ""This would sell out NFL stadiums,"" he said. ""Not just for the U.S. team, but for every team involved. Mexico plays more games in the United States than it does in Mexico right now because it can sell out NFL stadiums. ""It is an ongoing process. There isn't one big bang event which will suddenly make soccer as big in the U.S. as it is in Europe and South America. But this has been a pretty steady growth over the last two decades. ""I think it will happen in the end, but you want countries to send their best teams. That's not a guarantee at this point.""","Announcement that the 2016 Copa America will be in the U.S. yet to be confirmed .

"Bukulmez, Turkey (CNN) -- Syrian warplanes bombed a village within sight of the border with Turkey on Monday, sending hundreds of panicked civilians running for safety to a nearby barbed wire fence that separates the two countries. No casualties were reported after two bombs hit fields next to the village of Atimah. ""A MiG-21 tried to bomb places here, but they only bombed the fields,"" said an olive farmer in Atimah who asked to be called only Mohammed for security reasons. ""We thank God for this because there are no dead people."" Read more: 10 children killed as warplanes drop bombs in Syria, opposition group says . Atimah is a major logistical hub for anti-government rebels and is a haven for more than 10,000 displaced civilians. Rebel commanders, residents and refugees assumed the village was relatively safe because it is close to Turkey. Bassel Haj Fareed, a teacher who runs a makeshift school in the main refugee camp in Atimah, described utter chaos after the first airstrike Monday. In a phone call with CNN, he said children and parents were running and screaming in panic after the explosion, trying to find one another while bolting for the nearby border. The bombing took place a day before a NATO reconnaissance team was expected to survey the Turkish border with Syria, to prepare for the possible deployment of Patriot anti-aircraft missile batteries along the frontier. Read more: Over 37,000 have died in Syria's civil war, opposition group says . The fact that Syrian warplanes and helicopters have bombed targets within a few hundred meters of Turkey on at least three different occasions within the last month raises the question of whether the NATO military alliance could be sucked into the grinding Syrian conflict. Turkey and NATO insist the proposed Patriot missile deployment would be used only for defense. ""The deployment of the Air and Missile Defense System is a precaution for defensive purposes for possible air and missile threats from Syria, and is not for the establishment of a no-fly zone or for offensive maneuvers,"" the Turkish military said in a written statement Monday. ""The area of deployment for the Air and Missile Defense System, the quantity of the system, the number of foreign personnel that will come in to our country and the time of the deployment will be determined after the site survey."" Read more: 'Streets determining Middle East path' Tensions exploded between Syria and Turkey last summer, when Syrian anti-aircraft fire brought down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet, killing its two crew members. Turkey announced it was changing its rules of engagement with Syria. Last October, the Turkish government also won authorization in parliament for possible cross-border military incursions into Syria, after Syrian mortar fire killed five civilians in the Turkish border town of Akcakale. The Turkish military has scrambled warplanes to the border before, in response to Syrian aircraft approaching Turkish airspace. Turkish and Syrian military forces have also engaged in cross-border artillery duels since the Akcakale incident. On Monday, a resident of Atimah claimed to have heard what sounded like Turkish warplanes approaching Syria in response to the Syrian aerial bombardment. ""We heard it, all the people heard it, because the jet's sound came from the west,"" the olive farmer called Mohammed said. Turkish government officials have not confirmed or denied reports that Turkish warplanes may have been scrambled to the border. But on Monday afternoon, CNN's Arwa Damon witnessed jets roaring overhead in Syrian and Turkish airspace, from her vantage point in the Turkish village of Bukulmez, directly across the border from Atimah. She also saw what appeared to be smoke trails from rockets over the Bab al Hawa border crossing, which is just a few minutes drive from Atimah.","No casualties were reported after two bombs hit fields near the Syrian village of Atimah .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A British woman who was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking in Pakistan remains in jail with her child, despite concerns about the baby's welfare. Khadija Shah, 25, of Birmingham gave birth to her daughter, Malaika, a few weeks ago at a hospital in the city of Rawalpindi, an hour's drive from the capital, and was escorted back to jail with the infant only three days later, to the shock and dismay of her lawyer. ""The baby has had constant diarrhea, and Khadija complained that jail attendants are giving her strong medicine that is lethal for such a young child,"" Shahzad Akbar, legal counsel for Shah, told CNN. ""She would have been able to look after her child if she was granted bail,"" he said. CNN has attempted to reach the jail for comment about the claims, but officials have not yet responded to calls. However, jail officials have said in media reports that the baby is receiving proper care. Read more: $2.6 million in cocaine found in British woman's luggage, Indonesians say . Shah, who denies the charges against her, appeared in court Thursday with her infant daughter. Grasping the child, and barely able to speak through tears, she said she didn't want to give up her daughter, despite the conditions in the jail. ""No, I can't give her to anyone, I can't give her up,"" Shah told CNN before she was returned to her cell. ""It's not that bad,"" she said of the conditions there. Still, covering her face and hiding her tears, Shah conceded, ""I'm worried about her. ..."" In Pakistan's legal system, mothers can keep their children in jail with them while their cases are heard -- a process that can take years. Shah, arrested on drug charges in May, was allegedly found carrying more than $5 million worth of heroin before boarding a flight to England from Islamabad. Read more: Pakistani officials seize drugs shaped like onions . She was six months pregnant and traveling with her 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter when airport security detained her at Islamabad airport after a ""tipoff,"" according to her lawyer. ""Shah's (older) children were also incarcerated with her until recently, when they were turned over to their grandparents,"" Akbar said. Col. Tauqeer, the commander of the Anti Narcotics Force responsible for Shah's arrest, told CNN that Shah was apprehended after spot checking. ""It was routine checking when we found more than 63 kilos of heroin sewn into embroidered cloth in her bag,"" Tauqeer said. The Anti Narcotics Force ""followed procedure,"" according to Tauqeer, and Shah now faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted of the charges against her. According to the Anti Narcotics Force, 306 people, including foreign nationals, have been convicted in drug-related cases so far in 2012, and 37 tons of drugs have been seized across the country. ""There are no weaknesses in our case,"" according to Tauqeer, who said Shah had made two prior trips to Islamabad, during which she probably transported drugs to England. He said she told law enforcement officers that she had no relatives in Pakistan and that she was there on vacation. ""First she said she had no family, then her relatives arrived from Lahore to take the children; then she said she was married, and (it) turned out she was divorced. There are too many discrepancies in her statements,"" Tauqeer said. Shah said that she had no knowledge of carrying drugs and that she was given a bag by a friend to take home to England, her lawyer told CNN. He also denies Tauqeer's claims about prior trips and any discrepancies in Shah's story. Now, as Shah tends to her infant daughter in jail, her other children are in the UK; taken back, her lawyer says, by their grandmother. But there is little chance Shah will join them anytime soon.

"(CNN) -- A federal grand jury in New Hampshire has indicted a former hospital worker on fraud and product-tampering charges in connection with an outbreak of hepatitis C that sickened more than 30 people, prosecutors announced Thursday. Investigators say 33-year-old David Kwiatkowski injected himself with syringes of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller, that he stole from patients who were scheduled for surgery. He began working at New Hampshire's Exeter Hospital in April 2011, 10 months after being diagnosed with hepatitis C, a sometimes-fatal virus that attacks the liver. Hepatitis outbreak in New Hampshire strikes fear in 7 other states . ""Kwiatkowski used the stolen syringes to inject himself, causing them to become tainted with his infected blood, before filling them with saline and then replacing them for use in the medical procedure,"" the U.S. attorney's office in Concord, New Hampshire, said in a statement announcing the charges. ""Consequently, instead of receiving the prescribed dose of fentanyl, patients instead received saline tainted by Kwiatkowski's infected blood."" Kwiatkowski has been charged with seven counts of tampering with a consumer product and seven counts of obtaining controlled substances by fraud, prosecutors said. He was arrested in July and had previously worked as a traveling medical technician on a contract basis for hospitals in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, officials in those states confirmed. He was fired from an Arizona hospital in 2010 after a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's room with a syringe floating in the toilet, according to documents obtained by CNN. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Heart Hospital said Kwiatkowski was immediately fired, and he relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist. Group: We had no evidence to punish man now accused in hepatitis C case . The agency that placed him in the Arizona job, Springboard, Inc., reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency. But the association didn't punish Kwiatkowski, telling CNN in July that Kwiatkowski had passed a drug screen the following day, and there was no indication at that time that he had been infected with the hepatitis virus. The group said police had investigated the case but did not file any criminal charges, and a state agency that regulates radiological medicine said its investigation ended when Kwiatkowski left Arizona.","Investigators say David Kwiatkowski stole drugs, treated patients with used syringes .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- ""Transformers"" actress Megan Fox said ""yes"" to ex-fiance Brian Austin Green's marriage proposal, just four months after calling off a two-year engagement with Green, her publicist confirmed. Fox, 24, was so excited when Green, 36, popped the question on a Hawaii beach that she dropped the 2-carat diamond engagement ring into the sand, Us Weekly magazine reported. Despite a lengthy search by hotel staffers, the ring was never found, the magazine reported. Fox and Green began dating six years ago and became engaged for the first time in 2007. They broke it off last February. Marriage may be easier for Fox now that she's out of the ""Transformers"" franchise.

"(CNN) -- Black Caviar, the undisputed queen of the horse racing world, is set to make a return to action next year. The Australian thoroughbred had been expected to retire after suffering a strained muscle in her hindquarters during her victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Ascot last June. Aussies make Black Caviar pilgrimage to Ascot . The 'Wonder from Down Under' has become an international superstar after winning 22 races out of 22 and picking up over $6.6 million. Alongside the likes of Frankel and Camelot, Black Caviar has breathed new life into racing with her profile growing with every race. Her reputation has even secured her a place on the front page of December's Australian Vogue, kicking away the likes of Elle Macpherson and Delta Goodrem. The future had looked unsure for Black Caviar after she was diagnosed with a grade-four tear of the quadriceps muscle and grade-two tear of the sacroiliac. The mating game: Will Frankel and Black Caviar breed superhorses? The six-year-old mare was forced to undergo intense laser therapy on a daily basis for two weeks at Newmarket before flying back to Melbourne. A spell of walking in water, the equine version of water aerobics, has helped speed up her recovery with trainer Peter Moody keeping a keen eye on the progress. Black Caviar continues winning streak with dramatic win at Ascot . Moody will now hold discussions with Black Caviar's owners to plan her return to the racecourse, while she undergoes light training at his Caulfield stables. Black Caviar could return early next year in February's Lightning Stakes, a race which she has won for the past two years. If she does not make that particular race, the mare could star at the William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley in March. The TJ Smith on April 13 remains the big draw for Moody with Black Caviar hoping to break Kingston Town's record of 14 Group One wins.","Black Caviar set to make a return to action in 2013 .

"(Financial Times) -- A global shortage of helium, the lighter-than-air gas, has put a stop to the sale of inflatable Mickey Mouse heads at Disneyland in Tokyo, threatened parades during the US Thanksgiving holiday and disrupted university research. Global production of helium -- used in industrial and medical applications, as well as balloons -- has sharply fallen this year in the US and Algeria, the two biggest exporters. Companies in Japan, the world's leading helium importer, say they are looking to tap alternative, but more expensive, sources of supply in Qatar, Russia and Poland. However, because the supply disruptions come as demand in China and India is rising, the global market remains ""tight"", said Shi Quan, a trader in Shanghai. The squeeze represents the second big shortage for the $500m helium market in five years, after glitches in 2007 at a plant owned by ExxonMobil. Now, the focus is again the US, which provided almost four-fifths of the 180m cubic metres of helium consumed around the world last year. The shortfall has been triggered by maintenance of ageing US installations, including a pipeline system that connects a helium-rich natural gasfield in Amarillo, Texas, with processing plants. In Algeria, too, supplies of helium have dropped alongside shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe. Helium in Algeria is extracted during the liquefaction of natural gas, so when demand for LNG drops, as this year because of the economic crisis in Europe, helium production also drops. Helium prices have risen steadily over the past decade. In the US, benchmark helium prices have risen this year to $84 per million cubic feet, up nearly 70 per cent from the $49.50 per mcf in 2000, according to the US Bureau of Land Management. Industry executives believe that prices would need to increase significantly more to spur the development of more supplies, probably through expensive technologies for extraction of the gas. Japanese importers are struggling to adjust. Two weeks ago Saitama-based distributor Daito Gas said it could take no more orders for helium after shipments came to a halt. Taiyo Nippon Sanso, the country's biggest importer, says its helium volumes have dropped by 30 per cent since June, and that the outlook may not improve until the third quarter of next year, when a joint venture with a gas drilling firm in Wyoming is scheduled to begin production. Until then, said spokesman Masayuki Kuniya, the company would prioritise deliveries to MRI clinics -- which use liquid helium to cool superconducting magnets -- and factories making semiconductors and fibre optic cables. Meanwhile, the nation's children may have to go without. Last week Oriental Land, operator of the Disney resort east of Tokyo, suspended sales of helium-filled balloons for the first time. Kunio Komada, an executive at Dream Balloon, a Tokyo retailer, complains that his helium stock has dwindled to nothing, following big cuts in the spring and summer. ""If supplies don't come back soon, our business will be very tough,"" he said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When architect James Law looks in the mirror each morning his reflection is not all that greets him -- he can also see the weather report, e-mail messages and his heart rate. ""The biggest game changer of the past 25 years has been the Internet,"" said Law, whose Cybertecture Mirror is an offshoot of his Hong Kong architectural firm's focus on integrating technology in design. ""In buildings, the Internet has become ubiquitous but it hasn't caught up in the products that inhabit buildings -- chairs, doors, tables and mirrors."" Law's company -- and a raft of new government-funded projects in mainland China -- is looking to change that. Law's $5,000 mirror began as product his firm designed for a high-tech residential building in Dubai. ""The Internet of Things began to become more real for us as a project,"" Law said. ""We started to take these things out of our building designs to make them independent products, and try to impregnate them with as much technology as we can."" If there's a race to lead the Internet of Things (IoT), China aims to set the pace. Since Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao identified IoT as an ""emerging strategic industry"" in an interview on state media, Beijing has focused on developing technology by which devices can communicate via infrared sensor, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and other Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology. Beijing plans to invest 5 billion yuan ($800 million) in the IoT industry by 2015. The Ministry of Information and Technology estimates China's IoT market will hit 500 billion yuan ($80.3 billion) by 2015, then double to 1 trillion yuan ($166 billion) by 2020. The government has established state-owned enterprise zones such as the Chengdu Internet of Things Technology Institute in Sichuan province, which is developing a health care system in which rural villagers can step into a telephone booth-sized ""health capsule"" to get a diagnosis and prescription from a doctor in a distant hospital. ""With the capsules and clinics, people do low-cost checkups and choose an online doctor for further diagnosis, then print prescription and purchase medicine from the capsule,"" boasts the program's web site. The larger goal of China's focus in IoT, analysts say, is to win a fight Beijing has long been losing -- setting international standards for new technology. After leading losing fights to use Chinese standards in 3G technology and wireless mobile standards, China is trying to get out front early on IoT. ""In technology China has come from a position of follower, adopting foreign standards on which it has to pay royalties,"" said Mark Natkin, director of Marbridge, a technology consulting firm in Beijing. ""China is very interested in turning that model around, and create the standards by which other countries are paying it royalties,"" he said. ""It's a new area, and as such, a place where China can be at the starting line or ahead of the starting line."" Law sees three other factors at play in China's IoT thrust. ""China is in a position to invest more than other economies in the world at this period of time,"" Law said. ""And China still has a internalized, walled Internet because it's trying to monitor, control and censor -- so it's in its own interest to develop these kind of products. ""But I think the third thing is China has matured to a point where it is no longer a low cost center of labor ... in cutting edge businesses, it wants to really develop its own brand and its own next generation of technology, to walk into the fight with your own swords by investing in the next Google, the next Apple,"" Law said. ""From a state perspective, there is everything to gain in nurturing their own brands ... the country wants to define the market rather than play catch-up,"" Law added. Law's company has sold 500 of the Cybertecture Mirrors and is now developing a chair that recognizes the user and records individual health data. ""I really feel that the next paradigm for product design will be changed by the Internet and the new range of materials we now have,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be building things in the same way as the past.""","The Internet of Things market in China is expected to hit $80.3 billion in 2015 .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Myanmar security forces used tear gas and water cannons early Thursday to drive away hundreds of people protesting a copper mine project owned by the country's military and a Chinese company, witnesses said. Riot police cleared away all the camps set up by protesters near Monywa township in the northern region of Sagaing, said Khin San Hlaing, a member of parliament in the region for the National League for Democracy, the opposition party led by Nobel laureate and pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi. Read more: Terrorized, starving and homeless: Myanmar's Rohingya still forgotten . Dozens of protesters -- a mixture of local residents, students and monks -- were wounded in the police raids, Khin San Hlaing said, but some of them were hiding rather than seeking medial attention. So far, 29 people have been admitted to hospitals, she said, while others have been arrested. The demonstrations are an indication of the willingness of citizens of Myanmar, also known as Burma, to test the limits of the greater political freedom ushered in during the past year and a half under President Thein Sein after decades of authoritarian military rule. But the strong police reaction, coming less than two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama visited Myanmar and emphasized the need to improve human rights in the country, has fueled doubts about the government's commitment to lasting reform. ""The crackdown showed once again that the government, which claims to have turned over a new leaf and to listen to public opinion, is only really protecting its own interests and those of foreign investors,"" said an article by The Irrawaddy, a magazine run by exiles from Myanmar based in Thailand.

Without commenting directly on the early morning violence, she said she had met with representatives of the mine and also planned to talk to local residents and protesters to try to help negotiate a solution. About 500 people had been demonstrating against the mine project near Monywa since November 17, expressing concern about its environmental impact and unhappiness about the way local people's land had been claimed for it. Smaller protests had been taking place for months, and police in Yangon, the former capital, arrested eight activists demonstrating against the copper mine earlier this week. The mine project, in a mountainous area near Monywa, has been operated by the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holding and the Chinese company Wanbao Mining. Covering an area of 3,184 hectares (7,868 acres), it received government approval in 2010. Li Songgang, a spokesman for Wanbao Mining, said the company is ""willing to communicate with residents and protesters, so as to work out practical solutions."" ""We are very concerned about the protests,"" he said, noting the that company has had to suspend construction of the project, which is not yet operational. His tone appeared more conciliatory than that of the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, which said in a statement that issues related to the mine project such as relocation, compensation and environmental protection had been settled. ""We hope all levels of Myanmar society can create a favorable environment for the project's smooth operation based on respect for laws and regulations of Myanmar,"" the statement said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Astronaut Mark Kelly said Friday his wife's extraordinary medical progress since she was shot through the brain, coupled with support from family, friends and the public, were keys to his decision to command the upcoming flight of the space shuttle Endeavour. During a press conference with NASA officials -- who said they determined going with Kelly was the right decision --  the husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords described what he thought the realities would be after the January 8 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, and what he now expects. ""At that time, my thought was I'd very likely would be sitting in the ICU seat, two, four or six months later, by her bedside,"" said Kelly, sporting a blue wristband that reads ""Peace, Love, Gabby."" Now, he said, Giffords is making progress every day in speech, occupational and physical therapy. He expects her to witness Endeavour soaring into space on the current April 19 timetable. ""Absolutely. I have every intention for her to be at the launch,"" said Kelly. Command of the shuttle flight came under question after Giffords was shot. ""She would be very comfortable with the decision I made,"" Kelly said at a Friday afternoon press conference. Kelly spent the days after the shooting at his wife's hospital bedside, and NASA had named a backup shuttle commander for the mission. ""We are very, very thankful of the progress Gabrielle has made over the past few weeks,"" said Brent Jett, chief of Flight Crew Operations Directorate at NASA. ""I know there are millions of people praying for her and I think that helps,"" Kelly told reporters. NASA officials said they spent much of this week observing Kelly doing a simulated week of training in Houston. They said they are confident he will be able to complete the training and not be distracted by his wife's extensive rehab. The decision followed consultation with doctors and weighing the risks of putting Kelly back as commander. ""Space flight is a risky business,"" said Kelly. ""So is being a member of Congress."" Kelly repeatedly declined to detail his wife's progress, saying it leads to constant speculation on her prognosis, and he would not disclose how she was able to articulate her support for his resumption of training Monday. ""I know my wife very well,"" he said. ""I know what she would want."" On Thursday, Kelly spoke at a National Day of Prayer event in Washington, his first trip away from Houston. ""We thought it would be a good chance for him to see what it would be like to be away from Gabrielle,"" Jett said. Giffords is being treated at the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) at Memorial Hermann in Houston. The six hours of therapy each day is keeping the congresswoman busy, Kelly said, and he has asked her mother to be his medical liaison while on training in Florida and during the two-week flight. ""I am looking forward to rejoining my (fellow) crew members and finishing our training for the mission,"" Kelly said in an earlier statement. ""We have been preparing for more than 18 months. ... I appreciate the confidence that my NASA management has in me and the rest of my space shuttle crew."" Kelly said he will be able to communicate with Giffords during the mission by e-mail and telephone. He is hopeful she will be able to see him during a video conference during the trip. The astronaut added he is able to ""compartmentalize"" stress and will remain focused. In the end, the decision to put Kelly back on the team came down to what's best for the flight, Jett said. ""It's really as simple as that,"" he said. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I have every intention for (Giffords) to be at the launch,"" Kelly says .

"(CNN) --   Was President Abraham Lincoln dying of a rare genetic disease when an assassin killed him in 1865? This strip from Lincoln's deathbed pillow is housed at the Grand Army of the Republic Museum in Philadelphia. A California doctor believes so -- and he hoped to prove his theory by testing the 16th president's DNA. Dr. John Sotos asked a small Philadelphia museum for blood-stained threads from a scrap of the pillow that cradled Lincoln's head as he lay dying. On Monday night, the board of  the Grand Army of the Republic Museum and Library denied his request but left the door open for a possible DNA test that could shed light on Lincoln's last days. The museum plans to convene a forum of Lincoln scholars and forensic pathologists to decide how to proceed. ""We want complete control over this,"" said Eric Schmincke, the board's president. ""We don't want to take the chance of losing the artifact."" The museum did not rule out the possibility of arranging tests. Museum board members declined to speculate on what kinds of tests could be carried out if experts conclude that such testing would not damage the scrap of pillow that is stained with Lincoln's blood. Sotos is urging DNA tests in the belief that those examinations would prove that the president suffered from a condition known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, which spurs nerve cells and bones to excessive growth. Click here to learn more about MEN 2B . All patients with that condition develop thyroid cancer without treatment; half also will get adrenal gland tumors. Sotos argued that the tests could yield a new understanding of the final months of Lincoln's presidency. ""We know how Lincoln died. I am more interested in how he lived,"" said Sotos, a cardiologist and author who lives in Palo Alto, California. ""I would ask the historians how some knowledge of approaching death would influence the conduct of the presidency during a war,"" said Sotos, author of ""The Physical Lincoln"" and a consultant on the TV series ""House."" ""His attitude toward the South was incredibly forgiving in the few days he had."" The doctor's request stirred a debate about ethics and history. ""This is to the Civil War what the Shroud of Turin is to Jesus' burial,"" said Andy Waskie, a historian and museum board member. ""It's a sacred trust from the veterans themselves. They passed it on to us and trusted us to protect it."" The fragment that Sotos asked to test measures about three-eighths of an inch by 5 inches. A group of Union veterans gave the museum the relic, which was obtained from Lincoln's deathbed by someone who was there when he died. Board members such as Schmincke opposed the doctor's request, fearing that removing even a few strands of thread for DNA testing would damage the relic. Schmincke also discounted the prospects of any new historical insights based on the test results. ""Why should we question whether or not he had a disease?"" he asked. ""What's it going to prove? It's not going to make the outcome of the Civil War any different."" Schmincke said he is not concerned about Sotos' research but does worry that other Lincoln researchers could misinterpret or misuse information from a DNA test. That's one of the issues the board hopes the expert panel will help resolve. ""We want to respect the memory of Lincoln, not dig in the past and make up things that aren't there,"" Schmincke said. As evidence that the president had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, Sotos has cited his long limbs, bumps on his lips and problems with constipation, all classic symptoms of the rare genetic syndrome. But Sotos says the key piece of evidence lies in Lincoln's family. ""It is the Lincoln children who make me very confident,"" he said. Three of Lincoln's sons died young. Each had bumpy lips. His surviving son, Robert, lived to 82 and did not have bumpy lips. Sotos also cites evidence that Lincoln had developed signs of cancer. ""He did have symptoms,"" the cardiologist said. ""He had a profound change in appearance during the final year of his presidency. He lost a lot of weight during his presidency, and he complained of being tired all the time."" If Lincoln did have the rare genetic syndrome, Sotos said, in a man of his age ""cancer would inevitably exist."" Sotos added, ""He probably knew something was horribly wrong. If Lincoln was dying, certainly he recognized it because he was a smart and observant man ... but [because of the military implications] he would not have told a soul."" Sotos is convinced that Lincoln was dying even before the assassin struck. After the museum board's decision on Monday night, however, he'll have to wait to learn whether science will ever prove or refute his theory about the 16th president.","Doctor  had wanted a piece of Lincoln deathbed pillowcase to test DNA .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN)  -- Daniel Buruca had a bad experience the first time he took drugs. One young recovering addict said ""there would always be something"" in the medicine cabinet at a friend's house. ""I was shivering and I was seeing things, and my mom was playing a video game and it was just 10 times louder than it was. ""I could feel the monsters in the video game coming towards me... and I got so scared at one point that I threw up,"" the 17-year-old said from the Virginia drug treatment center where he lives. He had taken LSD at age 9, and his appetite for drugs had just begun. He and millions of youngsters in the United States have an easy time finding drugs, according to a survey The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse released Wednesday. Forty percent of teens -- about 10 million -- say they can get marijuana within a day while about 25 percent -- 5.7 million teens -- say they can find marijuana within an hour, the survey says. A lot more teens -- 37 percent more since 2007 -- also said that pot was easier to buy than cigarettes or beer. The survey also says that two-thirds of high school students say drugs are used, kept or sold at their school. ""Parents are the key to raising drug-free kids, and they have the power to do it if they send their children the clear message to choose not to use and demand that the schools their children attend be drug-free,"" the center's chairman and founder, Joseph A. Califano, said in a statement. The 14th annual report also says teens are more likely to get drunk and use marijuana if they see their parents drunk. For the first time, the survey asked teens about the ease of getting prescription drugs to use for getting high. The survey found that one in five teens could get the drugs within an hour and that their own homes and friends are the most common sources. The kind of drug use outlined in the survey can take a toll on people like Devon Kennedy, who says she started using drugs in the ninth grade. ""The first drug I did was speed,"" the 18-year-old said. ""As soon as I tried it, it was perfect to me so I just tried everything I could after that."" Kennedy says she moved on to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin. Jessi Danner, also 18, recalls looking for Pop Tarts at a friend's house and finding something else in the drawer. ""There's this little baggie and she's like, 'I have seen this in movies. You shove it up your nose' -- and so that's what we did. The bag was filled with cocaine. She was 10. Cocaine would rule Danner's life for the next five years. Buruca, Danner and Kennedy share a common bond -- all are recovering drug addicts hoping to get their young lives back on track. The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimated in 2007 that 19.9 million Americans age 12 or older -- around 8 percent of the population -- had used illegal drugs. Debbie Taylor sees the results of that drug use as president and CEO of Vanguard Services, a substance-abuse treatment center in Arlington. ""A child can get -- in any neighborhood, in any school -- almost any drug that they would want in a relatively short period of time. I don't think that was the case 20 years ago,"" she said. Buruca, a patient at Vanguard, has been drug-free for almost four months. But for the previous five years, LSD, a mood-changing drug that can cause delusions and visual hallucinations, was his drug of choice. ""It's like I felt everything was dull. It wasn't what it should be and there's this whole other world I can go into that's just so much better and wider. Why stay in this one?"" Buruca said, with his mother, Christina Tellez, sitting next to him. Tellez had no idea her 9-year-old son was taking drugs. ""He had such a great family support system around him. We were with him all the time,"" she said. By the time Buruca was in the eighth grade, he says, he was using drugs daily and often had hallucinations as he entered school. ""I walked in, the walls started collapsing, hallways started to shrink and I walked right back out,"" he said. Tellez just thought her son had severe behavioral issues . She says no one ever warned her that Buruca could be a drug addict. By the time Kennedy was in 10th grade, her life was spinning out of control. ""I was completely strung out,"" she said. She says she was expelled from high school for drug possession. Kennedy's experimentation with drugs became an addiction very quickly. ""As soon as I tried it, it was done -- like, I just knew,"" she said. Living in a quiet suburb of Washington made matters worse. ""You live in a neighborhood where nothing dangerous is going on. You start getting bored with this mediocre life, you want something special,"" she said. Kennedy knows this firsthand. ""Every time I went to someone's house, the first thing I said was I had to go to the bathroom and I went to the bathroom cabinets and there would always be something in there. Everywhere you went, somebody had a parent who had something,"" she said. Kennedy has completed her treatment at Vanguard and has been drug free for 19 months. She attends community college. Danner says she missed out on a lot of happy memories. ""Instead of hanging out with friends, I would be locked up in my room doing lines, and that's no way to live,"" she said. She is in the final phase of treatment, is attending community college and wants to be an actress one day. Buruca said he hopes he can leave treatment soon and start his senior year of high school. The music and football fanatic offers some advice for teens curious about drugs. ""It's so detrimental to your future for a few hours of being high. And a lot of times you will get to those hard drugs like meth and heroin that will get you addicted, physically addicted, and it will just ruin your life completely,"" he said. Taylor suggested parents have their pediatrician do a drug test during a normal annual physical so any problems can be caught early on. ""Children go so quickly into an adaptive and addictive phase that it's very difficult to reel them back at that point,"" Taylor said.","Recovering teen drug addicts share harrowing stories with CNN .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Benitez's reign as coach of Inter Milan has lasted only six months after the European champions terminated the Spaniard's contract on Thursday. The 50-year-old's position has been in doubt since last Saturday when he demanded that the Italian club's owner Massimo Moratti back him with support in the January transfer window. Following Inter's Club World Cup final success in Abu Dhabi, Benitez angered Moratti when he criticized the board for not investing in new players after he took over from treble winner Jose Mourinho in June. He leaves with Inter through to the second round of the Champions League, but languishing seventh in the Serie A table -- 13 points behind leaders and city rivals AC Milan. Rafa Benitez's old tricks backfire in Italy . ""F.C. Internazionale and Rafael Benitez wish to convey that, together and with mutual satisfaction, they have reached an agreement for the early cancellation of their working partnership,"" the Serie A side said in a statement on its website. ""F.C. Internazionale would like to thank Rafael Benitez for his work in charge of the team, which he guided to success in the Italian League Super Cup and in the FIFA Club World Cup."" Benitez received a reported $6 million payoff when he left English club Liverpool on June 3, and is now expected to receive more compensation for the rest of his two-year deal with Inter. His agent was in talks with Inter this week, as Moratti initially refused to comment on Benitez's future. The club statement said Benitez ""would like to thank F.C. Internazionale for the important professional experience and for the victories achieved together."" Benitez has been back in England this week during the Italian season's winter break, as he still owns a house in Liverpool. Italian football expert Gabriele Marcotti told CNN that rumors of former AC Milan coach Leonardo taking over from Benitez are true. ""I think the club's dream coach would be Luciano Spalletti, but he is at Zenit St Petersburg on a huge contract so that's not going to happen,"" said Marcotti. ""Right now, the front runner seems to be Leonardo, who managed AC Milan last year. He's a very intelligent guy, who found the influence from above a little too much at Milan. ""Inter are run differently from Milan and I would welcome his possible appointment. I think it would be a progressive choice.""","Rafael Benitez officially sacked by Italian champions Inter Milan on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Luiz Felipe Scolari is ""obliged"" to win the 2014 World Cup following his appointment as coach of the Brazil national football team for a second time on Thursday. Scolari led ""La Selecao"" to a record fifth World Cup triumph in Japan and South Korea 10 years ago and the former Portugal coach will be expected to win the trophy once again when Brazil hosts the tournament in two years time. ""We have the obligation to win the title; we are not favorites at the moment but we intend to become favorites during the competition,"" Scolari told a press conference after it was announced he would replace the sacked Mano Manezes. ""Third or fourth place is no good for a country that has won five World Cups."" Scolari, who had an eight-month spell in charge of English Premier League team Chelsea, is not the only World Cup winner returning to the fold. Carlos Alberto Parreira, the coach of Brazil's victorious USA 1994 squad, has been named the team's technical director. Scolari will be under pressure to deliver in 2014, with fans eager to avoid a repeat of the 1950 World Cup when Brazil lost out to Uruguay in the final match of the tournament. But Scolari was bullish, declaring: ""If you don't like pressure, it's better to go and work in the Bank of Brazil, or outside on the corner or sit in an office and do nothing. ""It would not be right if there was no pressure and the players thought the target was just to play at the World Cup. This would be one of our most important titles -- the sixth title, at home at our second opportunity."" Scolari's first spell as Brazil coach began in 2001. The team was struggling to reach the 2002 World Cup with just five matches of the qualification competition remaining. But Scolari turned it around and one year later, led by the attacking talents of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, Brazil lifted the trophy. ""It would have been the first time that Brazil would have missed a World Cup, that was when I felt under pressure,"" the 64-year-old said when asked about his last spell in charge. Scolari has been out of football since being sacked by Palmeiras in September, with the club relegated to Brazil's second tier following his departure. Prior to his two-year spell in Sao Paulo, Scolari spent a year coaching Bunyodkur in Uzbekistan following his dismissal from Chelsea in February 2009. Scolari's last international role was with Portugal, who he led to the final of Euro 2004 and the semifinals of the 2006 World Cup.","Luiz Felipe Scolari returns for a second spell as Brazil coach .

"(Rolling Stone) -- For Neil Young, the Sixties never ended. The music, memories and changes haunt his best songs and records like bittersweet perfume: vital, endlessly renewing inspirations that are also constant, enraging reminders of promises broken and ideals betrayed. In ""Twisted Road,"" one of eight new songs sprawled across this turbulent two-CD set, Young recalls, in a brilliantly mixed metaphor, the first time he heard Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"": ""Poetry rolling off his tongue/Like Hank Williams chewing bubble gum."" And Young tells you what he did with the impact. ""I felt that magic and took it home/Gave it a twist and made it mine,"" he sings over Crazy Horse's rough-country swagger, as if the marvel of that time and his dreams are still close enough to touch. So are the mess and his dismay. Psychedelic Pill is Young's second album of 2012 with the Horse, his perfectly unpolished garage band of 43 years, and it has the roiling honesty and brutal exuberance of their best records together. This one opens with a special perversity: the thumping 27-minute fuzz-box trance of ""Driftin' Back."" Young, on lead guitar, spits feedback and throttles his whammy bar for long, mad stretches over rhythm guitarist Frank Sampedro's trusty two-chord support and the rock-infantry march of bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina. Every six or so minutes, Young's cracked yelp cuts through the tumult, spiking the flashback in the dreamy chorus with a contemporary disgust for tech-giant greed and the lousy sound of MP3s, whose sh***y fidelity is ""blockin' out my anger/Blockin' out my thoughts."" There is, in fact, no mistaking Young's mood. For most of its near-90 minutes, Psychedelic Pill is an infuriated trip: long tracks of barbed-guitar jamming and often surrealistic ire (""Gonna get me a hip-hop haircut,"" he sneers, to no apparent sense, in ""Driftin' Back"") interrupted by short bursts of warming bliss. It is a weirdly compelling seesaw. ""Psychedelic Pill"" is a Day-Glo-angel twist on ""Cinnamon Girl"" coated, in the first of two versions here, with jet-engine-like phasing. But then comes ""Ramada Inn,"" 17 minutes of broiling guitars and stressed a ection in which Young examines a love that has somehow stayed alive long after the high times turned into routine and basic daily needs. Even the sweet stuff is spiked. In the cheerful country funk of ""Born in Ontario,"" Young admits he writes songs ""to make sense of my inner rage."" Yet he keeps finding hope in there. ""Me and some of my friends/We were going to save the world. . . . But then the weather changed . . . and it breaks my heart,"" Young confesses through black clouds of distortion in ""Walk Like a Giant,"" dogged by the mocking whistle of the Horse. A big closing chunk of the song's 16 minutes is Young's idea of a giant marching through ruin: thunderclap drums and hacking-cough chords. But the real end hints at rebirth: a cleansing coda of wordless acid-choir sunshine. Young may feel like the last hippie standing, but he still sounds like a guy who believes the dreaming is not done. See original story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- Unbeknownst to her parents, Sydney Kirk tried a little medical experiment on herself when she was in the eighth grade. For a day or two, every so often, she stopped taking her drugs for her attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Sydney Kirk, right, took a medication vacation from her ADHD drugs unbeknownst to her mom, Julie. ""I told my parents I just forgot to take them, but really I wasn't taking them on purpose,"" says Sydney, who's now 15 and about to start 10th grade at a private school in Olney, Maryland. ""I just didn't like how they made me feel. They made me shy and less talkative. I wasn't myself."" Sydney says she felt so much better off the medication that she confessed her medication vacation to her parents and asked if she could stop taking the drugs -- drugs she'd been on since third grade -- permanently. After consulting her doctor, her parents agreed, and while Sydney's concentration suffered a bit and her grades did slip a little, she and her parents are happy with the results. ""She's doing great,"" says Sydney's mother, Julie Kirk. ""We've had to work on her study skills, but there's no way she'd go back to taking the drugs."" While doctors don't endorse patients with ADHD taking themselves off drugs without consulting their physician, Kirk's experience brings up a question often on the minds of parents: Does my child really need drugs for ADHD, and if so, is there a point when he or she should stop taking them? According to 2006 statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 4.5 million children and teens have ADHD.  Watch more on questions to ask about ADHD medication » . Dr. James Waxmonsky, an assistant professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, says parents need to weigh in when doctors are making decisions about ADHD treatments. ""We're very collaborative with patients and their families,"" he says. Waxmonsky, a child psychiatrist, and other experts advise parents to ask these questions when considering whether drugs are the best approach for a child with ADHD. 1. What can we do instead of, or in addition to, drugs? Kirk says her daughter's doctor never brought up alternatives to drugs for Sydney's ADHD, which she describes as mild. ""We were never given the option of teaching her coping skills,"" Kirk says. ""It was immediately, 'Let's give her the drugs.' "" Once Sydney went off her ADHD drugs in eighth grade, her parents taught her study skills to help her concentrate better. ""Sometimes they take away my phone and my iPod to get rid of distractions,"" Sydney says. ""I didn't like it at first. I fought them. I said, 'Why don't you trust me?' But it really did help."" Waxmonsky says while some children clearly do better on ADHD drugs, others don't need them. ""Drugs are viewed as the frontline treatment even though there are behavioral treatments that long-term are equally as effective,"" he says. 2. Is this free drug sample really the best drug for my child? In a recent article, Consumer Reports warned parents against accepting free drug samples for ADHD. Because drug companies tend to give samples for only the most expensive drugs, once the samples run out, you'll end up paying more than if your child had been prescribed a generic drug. Consumer Reports also has ratings on ADHD drugs. ""This isn't like taking an antibiotic for 10 days,"" says Dr. John Santa, director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center. ""Kids take these drugs for years, maybe even for a lifetime."" According to Consumer Reports, you could save $3,000 a year or more by choosing a generic drug. Waxmonsky says both brand-name and generic drugs can work well against ADHD, and that different drugs work better for different patients. Pharmaceutical companies say free samples can be helpful to patients. ""Free samples have helped improve the quality of life for millions of Americans,"" says Ken Johnson, senior vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, adding that free samples can help a doctor determine whether a particular drug works for a patient. 3. What can we expect with this treatment? Waxmonsky advises patients to get doctors to be very clear about what results to expect on any ADHD treatment. ""Some parents think medication will take care of everything -- will help their child get better grades and be more popular,"" he says. ""But medication doesn't take care of everything. You should ask your doctor, 'What do you expect to get better and what do you expect not to get better?' "" If a parent or child ever feels like it is time for the child to stop taking medication, Waxmonsky and others recommend consulting the doctor to determine whether a medication vacation is a good idea. In this, timing is very important: ""You wouldn't want to go off these drugs during final exam week,"" says Waxmonsky. Do you want your daughter to get the HPV vaccine?

"(CNN) -- Rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo began withdrawing from the key eastern city of Goma on Saturday, witnesses said, more than a week after they seized it from government forces. Fighters from the M23 rebel group boarded trucks and other vehicles to head north to outside of the 20 kilometer (12 mile) buffer zone stipulated by regional leaders, a reporter on the ground who was not named for his safety said. Earlier they had begun leaving Sake, a town to the west of Goma. M23 rebels also left their posts at the border crossing with Rwanda, but remained in some parts of Goma as of early afternoon. Tensions mounted in the city as several disputes arose. The M23 wanted to take a large cache of ammunition left by fleeing Congolese soldiers, the reporter said, but MONUSCO, the U.N. peacekeeping force for DR Congo, prevented the rebels from doing so. MONUSCO forces also stopped the rebels from taking vehicles donated to the government by the European Union. The rebel group has been accused of widespread looting by the United Nations and Goma residents. Government forces also looted as they fled last week, witnesses said. The United Nations welcomed M23's move, but said the group must cease military activity and stay outside of Goma. ""We welcome this withdrawal, but emphasize that this is an early step and that stability in the region remains very fragile,"" said Kieran Dwyer, spokesperson for U.N. peacekeepers. Regional leaders and the African Union had called for the rebels' withdrawal from Goma, supposed to have been completed by Thursday, as a condition of starting negotiations. The regional leaders' plan foresees an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at Goma airport, Ugandan Gen. Aronda Nyakairima said earlier this week. It would include a 100-strong neutral force, which would be in command, 100 troops from the Congolese army, and 100 members of the M23, Nyakairima said. Two military observers would also be deployed from each of the neighboring regional powers, while MONUSCO would be responsible for securing the buffer zone outside Goma, he said. The regional leaders also called on the rebels to ""stop all war activities,"" and ""stop talk of overthrowing an elected government."" The latest violence has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region. And aid groups warn the conflict risks triggering a broader humanitarian crisis. Why Congo needs our help . The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions.

"(CNN) -- Parents of children with special needs are demanding an apology from conservative political pundit Ann Coulter for tweeting after Tuesday's foreign policy debate that she approved of ""Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard."" It appeared to be a response to critiques of Mitt Romney's debate performance, but it wasn't the first time Coulter used the ""the r-word"" during this election season. And, it's not the first time blogger Ellen Seidman has called her out on it. ""At this point, I'm thinking the woman must surely be aware that the word is offensive, and she chooses not to care. That's pretty vile and heartless,"" said Seidman, the mother of a special needs child who shares her world on the blog ""Love that Max."" ""You want to slam the president, go ahead. But you can't think of any other word to use? Come on."" Ending the r-word: Ban it or understand it? The word ""retard"" demeans Max and millions more with intellectual disabilities, Seidman tweeted at Coulter. Still, the comment was favorited 1,215 times and earned 2,993 retweets as of this writing, presumably by a number of people who didn't find it offensive. But sentiments from those who chose to respond to Coulter on Twitter ranged from disappointment to outrage. ""You disgust me. That man is the president of this country. (& I'm sure all of the disabled children in America appreciate you.),"" actor Sophia Bush tweeted. ""Politics aside, this tweet from @anncoulter was offensive & disgusting. ANY use of the ""R"" word is unacceptable,"" @amurphy217 said. The Special Olympics also condemned her use of the word, saying that it was ""sad to see @AnnCoulter continue her use of hateful language by using the #Rword in her discourse."" In an open letter directed at Coulter posted Tuesday on the Special Olympics blog, John Franklin Stephens, a 30-year-old Special Olympian with Down syndrome, described what the word meant to him: ""I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have. ""Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next. ... Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much."" Even people known for their sense of humor came out against it. Comedian and Twitter personality @UncleDynamite resurfaced a 2-year-old post from his tumblr in which he explained why he would no longer follow anyone he saw using ""the r-word."" He re-posted it after seeing people retweeting and favoriting the tweet, which he found disturbing coming from a a ""well-educated, self-described Christian with such a huge public presence."" He hopes she'll read it and maybe have a change of heart, but he's not necessarily counting on it. What do you think of Coulter's comment? Sound off with CNN iReport . ""Based upon Ann's tweets today, I'd say she's dug in and unrepentant,"" he said Tuesday in an e-mail. ""She must not know, love or respect anyone with an intellectual disability, then, and more's the pity. I'd like to see her after a great day of volunteering at a Special Olympics or Best Buddies event. I'd lay odds she'd never think or say the r-word word ever again, and she'd probably be quick to anger if someone she heard did so."" Others observing the controversy surmised that Coulter used the word solely to draw attention. ""Guys. Ann Coulter is trolling you. Always. Outrage gives her strength. The only thing that will kill her? Complete & utter indifference,"" @PaprbakPrincess tweeted. Congress banned the use of the words ""retard"" and ""retardation"" in 2010 in federal health, education and labor laws in favor of using the words ""intellectual disability."" The American Psychiatric Association also plans to replace the term ""mental retardation"" with ""intellectual development disorder"" in the fifth version of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, to be published by in 2013. Then why do people cling to the word, Seidman and people like her wonder. She has posed the question before in her blog, which is probably why she woke this morning to find a slew of tweets and e-mails asking her to call out Coulter again for repeatedly using ""the r-word"" to describe President Obama. The last time was just a few weeks ago in a blog post called ""Let's talk about people who cling to the word 'retard.' "" In the post, she recounted a series of recent examples of the word being used: in a New York Times article, in the comments of a YouTube video she made for the Special Olympics' annual campaign to end the use of the word, in the comments section of a CNN.com article. She also included Coulter's last tweet about a video the president made for the National Forum on Disability Issues: ""Been busy, but is Obama STILL talking about that video? I had no idea how crucial the retarded vote is in this election."" ""Many people think that using the word 'retard' to slam someone is fineâ€”as long as it's not actually directed at a person with disability. I've had plenty of people argue with me over that distinction. What people don't understand is that every time someone uses the word 'retard,' they perpetuate the idea that people with intellectual disability, like my son, Max, are stupid or losers,"" Seidman said in an e-mail Tuesday. ""As I've said before, my son shouldn't be defined by ghosts of stereotypes past. He has enough to contend with in this world. Use. Another. Word."" Do you use the ""r-word""? Do you object to its use? Please share your opinions respectfully in the comments section below.

"(CNN) -- Madonna scored her eighth number-one on the Billboard Top 200 album chart with her latest release, ""MDNA."" According to Nielsen SoundScan, the 53-year-old pop icon sold 359,000 units, giving her the biggest album debut of 2012. This also marks the Material Girl's fifth consecutive studio album to reach the top of the charts. Billboard's Keith Caulfied says the only female with more number-one albums is Barbra Streisand with nine. ""MDNA"" was released March 26 to reviews that seemed to range from lukewarm to enthusiastic, especially from dance music aficionados. A number of tracks seem to deal with her well-publicized divorce from director Guy Ritchie in 2008 after seven years of marriage. Although Madonna showcased her first single, ""Give Me All Your Luvin'"" in a slicky-produced halftime show at the Super Bowl in February, she's kept a low profile in the weeks leading up to the album's release. She made a brief surprise visit to Miami's Ultra Festival on March 24. The only interview she gave in support of ""MDNA"" was a live Facebook chat with Jimmy Fallon. But album sales did receive an additional boost by fans who bought tickets to her upcoming world tour, which kicks off May 29 with two shows in Tel Aviv, Israel. Ticket-buyers were given an option to purchase the album in a bundle with their concert tickets. These album sales were folded into the SoundScan tally. By contrast, veteran pop star Lionel Richie landed at number-two on this week's Billboard Top 200 with his new album, ""Tuskegee,"" which was heavily promoted on television and sold 199,000 units. That figure is certainly nothing to sneeze at -- it's Richie's highest-charting record since he released ""Dancing on the Ceiling"" in 1986. ""Tuskegee"" remakes 13 of his greatest hits with such country superstars as Shania Twain, Blake Shelton and Kenny Chesney.","""MDNA"" is Madonna's fifth consecutive studio album to top the charts .

"Kabil (CNN) -- Millions of Afghans were glued to their television sets on Tuesday night to watch the first ever professional boxing match staged in the war-torn country. They were treated to a title fight between Hamid Rahimi, who was born in Afghanistan and grew up in Germany, and Tanzania's Said Mbelwa, with the World Boxing Organization's Intercontinental middleweight belt up for grabs. While millions watched it live on two Afghan TV channels, including state-run RTA, hundreds of people, including senior government officials, lawmakers and diplomats packed into the Loya Jirga hall in Kabul amid tight security to watch the fight, with tickets changing hands for between US$50 and US$100. Rahimi claimed victory in the seventh round after Mbelwa's shoulder was injured. ""This belt is not mine, this belt is Afghanistan's belt. It's yours. I love you,"" an ecstatic Rahimi told the crowd from the ring. The event, billed as the ""Fight 4 Peace,"" was another milestone in the country's rehabilitation after life under the Taliban, when it would likely have been banned. The group, which ruled much of the country between 1996 and 2001, prevented the population from taking part in many activities seen as un-Islamic, with restrictions placed on many sports. Kabul's main sports arena, Ghazi Stadium, was infamously used as a venue for public executions and stonings during the 1990s. ""I am sure none of the two [fighters] would even dare to get into the country, if the Taliban were still ruling. I am so happy that now we are moving towards a future where the world is giving us a recognition,"" Sayed Ahmad Peerzada, a shopkeeper, told CNN. The excitement was also echoed on social media, with thousands taking to Twitter and Facebook to show their support for the match. Khalid Quraishi, an Afghan living abroad, wrote on his Facebook page: ""Hamid Rahimi opened a new chapter in the boxing history in Afghanistan! Thanks to his opponent for accepting to come to Kabul too!"" The result even resonated at the Presidential palace in Kabul, as President Hamid Karzai offered his congratulations to both boxers. ""The president, besides congratulating Rahimi, thanks his Tanzanian opponent who came to Afghanistan to take part in this fight,"" a statement from Karzai's office said. Rahimi was born in Afghanistan in 1983 and escaped to Germany with his family in 1992 after the country was embroiled in civil war. He has won 20 of his 21 matches so far.","Afghan-born fighter living in Germany takes part in Afghanistan's first pro fight .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional investigators issued a subpoena Wednesday for communications from several top Justice Department officials -- including Attorney General Eric Holder -- relating to the discredited ""Fast and Furious"" federal gunrunning operation. The subpoena, issued by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also covers communications from Holder's chief of staff, Gary Grindler, and from Lanny Breuer, head of the department's criminal division. Among other things, the subpoena includes a request for information regarding relevant Justice Department communications with the White House, as well as details about the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent last December, the source added. ""Top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Holder, know more about Operation Fast and Furious than they have publicly acknowledged,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""The documents this subpoena demands will provide answers to questions that Justice officials have tried to avoid since this investigation began eight months ago. It's time we know the whole truth."" Holder has promised to comply with any Capitol Hill subpoena, though a Justice Department spokeswoman appeared to dismiss the development as a political exercise. ""We've made clear from the beginning that the department intends to work with the committee to answer legitimate questions,"" Tracy Schmaler said. ""However, this subpoena shows that Chairman Issa is more interested in generating headlines than in real oversight important to the American people."" Operation Fast and Furious involved agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowing illegal sales of guns, believed to be destined for Mexican drug cartels, to ""walk"" from Phoenix gun stores into Mexico. The idea was to track the sellers and purchasers of guns to Mexican cartels. But the program became mired in controversy after weapons found at Mexican and American murder scenes were traced back to the program. Mexican officials and critics in the United States called the operation a failure, saying it exacerbated the longstanding problem of U.S. weapons getting into the hands of the violent Mexican cartels. A GOP-led congressional investigation into the matter has become politically contentious, with administration and Capitol Hill leaders accusing each other of acting irresponsibly. In a letter to Holder released Monday, Issa, a California congressman, accused the attorney general of actively obstructing Congress' oversight function and damaging his own credibility as a top national law enforcement officer. ""Numerous statements"" made by Holder about Operation Fast and Furious have ""been proven to be untrue,"" Issa said. ""The time for deflecting blame and obstructing our investigation is over,"" Issa wrote in the letter, which was dated Sunday. ""The time has come for you to come clean to the American public about what you knew about Fast and Furious, when you knew it, and who is going to be held accountable for failing to shut down a program that has already had deadly consequences, and will likely cause more casualties for years to come."" Issa blasted Holder for ""negligence and incompetence"" on the issue, and for offering a ""roving set of ever-changing explanations"" designed primarily to ""circle the wagons around (the Justice Department) and its political appointees."" The operation was the Justice Department's ""most significant gun trafficking case,"" Issa said. ""On your watch, it went spectacularly wrong. Whether you realize yet or not, you own Fast and Furious. It is your responsibility."" Holder testified before the Judiciary Committee in May that he had known about the Fast and Furious program for just a few weeks. Republicans insist that recently released Justice Department documents show the attorney general actually knew about the program much earlier. Holder and his aides continue to vehemently deny that charge. The attorney general responded angrily Friday to GOP critics of his handling of the operation, charging them with using ""irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric."" ""I simply cannot sit idly by as a (Republican) member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform suggests, as happened this week, that law enforcement and government employees who devote their lives to protecting our citizens be considered 'accessories to murder,'"" Holder said in a letter to members of Congress. Such rhetoric, Holder declared, ""must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms."" On Sunday, Issa said the Judiciary Committee has invited Holder to ""come and clear the record."" ""Clearly, he knew when he said he didn't know,"" Issa said. ""Now the question is, what did he know and how is he going to explain why he gave that answer?"" CNN's Alan Silverleib, Brian Todd, and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Congress issues a subpoena relating to Operation Fast and Furious .

"(CNN) -- Siri, Mars, Mac and Luna. I'm not talking Apple products or planetary terms. These are baby names. And not just any baby names but ones that have jumped in popularity in 2012, according to Baby Center.com's just released list. Baby Siri? Seriously, who would name their bundle of joy after a frustrating Apple product that hardly ever works? And speaking of Apple (see daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin,) that name moved up a whopping 585 places on the list of names for girls born in 2012. So there could conceivably be a family out there with a daughter named Apple and a son named Siri. (Hope that entitles the family to a discount on an iMac.) There was a time when bizarre baby naming was something only celebrities did to their kids (as if being the child of a celebrity wasn't challenging enough). There's Beyonce and Jay Z's Blue Ivy, Penn Jillette's son, Moxie Crimefighter, Bono's daughter Memphis Eve, actor Jason Lee's son Pilot Inspektor, and the list goes on and on. But now this ""condition"" is apparently spreading to the rest of us. In addition to the offbeat names above, 2011 saw babies sporting such names as: Moo, Draper, Graceland and Tequila. There are even media reports that this past weekend some parents allegedly named their newborn daughter, Hashtag. That one may turn out to be an Internet hoax, but after last year's story of a child in Egypt being named Facebook (in praise of the role Facebook played in the Egyptian revolution), we can't be too far from babies named Retweet and Spam Blocker anyway. It truly is only a matter of time until you meet a kid named DVR or Playstation 3. Apparently some parents believe that giving their child a jaw-dropping name will make him or her more distinctive. News flash: it's not the name that makes your child stand out, it's his or her achievements. While I don't want to rain on creativity, let's be honest -- these weird names are more about parents showing off their ""cleverness"" than about finding a name that fits the child. It's not like the parents got to know the child first for a few months and then said, ""You know this baby really is a little Siri."" And do these parents even consider that a baby's name can cause consequences for the child that the parents never imagined, and in many areas of the child's life? When I reflect upon my own name, I realize that my life could have been far different if my parents had followed their initial instincts when naming me. My Palestinian father wanted to name me Saladin after the famous Muslim leader, while my Sicilian mother wanted to name me Dino. Instead they compromised on Dean. Growing up in North Jersey, Dean was not a common name. But it actually made me feel different in a good way being the only Dean in my class. And even today in looking at the list of baby names for 2012, I was actually happy that Dean was not in the top 100. Still, the truth is, if I'd been named Dino, I would have certainly been viewed as more ethnic by teachers, potential employers and co-workers. I would have been required to continually overcome cultural stereotypes. And if I'd been named the very Arabic Saladin Obeidallah, you could just imagine all the ""fun"" I would have had in post-9/11 America. I would have likely volunteered for ""random"" security checks at the airport to make it easier for all involved or simply got used to taking the bus cross country. But there's a difference between a name that isn't overly common and naming your child after your favorite appliance. A name is a big part of a kid's identity. It can trigger impressions about a child even before we meet him or her -- a particular problem among the closed-minded of the world, but this is the world your child will have to navigate. For example, studies have found that children with names that linguistically sound like they come from a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to be recommended by school officials for gifted classes and actually more likely to be labeled as learning disabled. Other research has revealed that boys with feminine sounding names -- such as Shannon or Ashley -- have had more disciplinary problems in school because of their response to teasing. Still other studies have found a link between how much people like their own names and their level of self-esteem. So, parents, keep in mind that your choice of name will have a lasting impact on your child -- both for good and bad. And if you insist on picking a bizarre name for the baby, then I propose that your child be empowered to rename you with any name he or she chooses. At least then it's fair that a child named Hashtag has parents named Angry Birds and YouTube. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: A new list of popular 2012 baby names includes Siri, Mac, Luna .
He says it's not just celebrities with offbeat baby-naming now; it's spreading to the rest of us .

"New York (CNN) -- Every year Debra Keller would take her granddaughters to New York City to take in the holiday traditions -- going to a show, having lunch at their favorite restaurants, shopping and a visit to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. This year when they visit Rockefeller Center, it will be their own tree. The 74-foot tall Norway spruce that once provided a shade and a scenic sight on their lawn in Pennsylvania will become the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree for 2011. ""To be honest it won't be sad to see the tree go,"" said Keller, 56, in a statement. ""We just feel honored that the tree was chosen and will be enjoyed by so many people when it's sitting in the middle of Rockefeller Center."" The iconic Christmas tree is expected to arrive on a flatbed truck Friday morning and will grace Rockefeller Center in Manhattan when it's officially erected at the end of November. The Norway spruce weighing approximately 10 tons was cut down Wednesday morning in Mifflinville, Pennsylvania, and hoisted by a huge crane onto a 115-foot-long trailer where it will be driven to Manhattan. The 46-foot-wide tree will be raised at Rockefeller Center Friday morning. The tree, which is approximately 75 years old, was first spotted by the Rockefeller Center team during a routine drive down Interstate-80. Rockefeller Center's head gardener saw the tree out of the corner of his eye from the driver's seat. The tree made an immediate impression standing tall on the lawn of Debra Keller's 79 year-old mother Nancy's house where she has lived since 1969. When the tree is finally decorated for its tree lighting November 30th, it will hold 30,000 multi-colored lights on five miles of wire and will be topped with a Swarovski crystal star, adorned with 25,000 crystals and one million facets. The first tree was erected in 1931 by construction workers developing Rockefeller Center. The first formal Rockefeller Center tree lighting ceremony was held in 1933 and was decked with 700 lights in front of the then eight-month-old RCA building.","Tree is a 74-foot tall Norway spruce .

"Washington (CNN) -- An intense struggle among several senior Justice Department officials was revealed Friday as internal documents on the gun-running Operation Fast and Furious were released by the department. About 1,400 pages that had been demanded by Capitol Hill investigators were sent to three key congressional committees in advance of what is expected to be a contentious hearing next Thursday when Attorney General Eric Holder testifies on the subject. The documents lift the veil on conflicting views among Justice Department executives, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Arizona U.S. attorney's office over whether and how to respond to allegations made in letters from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. Grassley had demanded to know whether, as whistle-blowers claimed, the ATF was allowing firearms bought by suspected straw purchasers in Arizona to ""walk"" across the border into Mexico, and into the arms of drug cartels. Grassley had alleged the ATF's surveillance operation lost track of weapons and two of them ended up at the scene where Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was murdered last December. In early February 2011, as the issue was heating up, the documents show Justice officials struggled for days over how to respond to Grassley. Repeated drafts were required as the issue rose for discussion among the deputy attorney general's staff. At the last moment, Justice officials halted sending out letters to Grassley because of uncertainty over the facts of Fast and Furious, and over how forcefully to respond. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich was especially concerned about protecting the Justice Department position that details about ongoing investigations not be revealed. Other officials, notably in the deputy attorney general's office, said it was crucial in this unusual and important situation to be candid and forthright to a key U.S. senator. Dennis Burke, the U.S. attorney for Arizona, defended the operation, and appears to have become exasperated at the Justice Department's cautious response. ""Every version gets weaker. We will be apologizing to (Grassley) by tomorrow afternoon,"" he wrote. Burke and ATF headquarters officials insisted the charge that agents ""allowed the sale of weapons which were transported into Mexico is false."" He also insisted the ""ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally."" When those claims, included in a February 4 letter to Grassley, later proved to be wrong, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer and later Holder were forced to apologize to a Senate committee and to Grassley in particular. Burke resigned at the end of August, just days after testifying before a congressional committee. On Friday, Deputy Attorney General James Cole said the Justice Department ""now formally withdraws the February 4 letter."" He said facts have come to light that indicate that the letter contains ""inaccuracies."" Holder is expected to again express his ""regret"" for the misinformation before the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee. Breuer and Holder steadfastly maintain they did not know the assertions were wrong when the department sent Grassley the letter. Justice Department officials claim they were relying on information provided by ATF supervisors and their prosecutors in Phoenix. The document dump ""appears to raise (even) more questions"" for various officials involved in the program, said Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for Grassley. She made specific reference to ""disparaging e-mails"" from Burke about the Iowa senator. The former U.S. attorney ""personally apologized to Senator Grassley's staff for the tone and the content of the e-mails"" after learning they'd been released, according to Levine.","NEW: Grassley's spokeswoman says the new documents raise more questions .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of two American climbers were discovered Saturday afternoon in the mountains of Peru, ending a days-long search for the men, friends and family said. Shay Har-Noy, who heads the technology company Tomnod that uses satellite imagery, said his friends Ben Horne and Gil Weiss had been attempting to scale the south face of Palcaraju Oeste. That 6,110-meter (20,000-foot) tall mountain is located in a region popular with climbers in Huaraz province about 275 miles northeast of Lima. ""These are two of the finest climbers we have known ... embodying the spirit of the mountains with every thing they did,"" an announcement on Tomnod's site said. ""Many of us have had the honor of sharing in their love for the wilderness, and that lives on."" Weiss -- founder of Beyond Adventure, a company consisting of professional guides, logistical experts and photographers -- posted June 11 on his Facebook page that he was leaving Boulder, Colorado, for Peru ""for another season in the High Andes."" What is altitude sickness? On July 10, Horne posted pictures and a chronicle of their experiences on the climbing blog Pullharder.org. ""The Cordillera Blanca is world renowned for its high altitude mountaineering,"" he wrote. ""But almost as awesome as the mountains themselves is the motley crew of international climbers who come to try their hand at getting high, on big peaks, cheap and fast."" According to a blog post on Tomnod's site Saturday, Weiss and Horne were missing for the past five to 10 days. Kari Tenjford, a friend of theirs, wrote on his Facebook page that a search team found the two climbers' tent, as well as tracks up the glacier and ""tracks on the descent ridge."" Har-Noy said he enlisted the help of climbers and technology experts alike to find the pair using an application he built, with hundreds of people at one point poring through satellite images looking for signs of an avalanche. That information was then sent to search and rescue crews in Peru, said Har-Noy. Another friend, Asa Firestone, said the climbers' bodies were ultimately found ""after what looks to be a fall from the (southwest) ridge on their descent."" Overheard on CNN.com: Is Mount Everest like 'a morgue'? ""They were truly two of the most amazing guys I have ever had the pleasure to spend time with,"" Firestone wrote on Facebook. ""They shared a passion for adventure that they expressed so brilliantly in their blog ... and in all of their cutting edge ascents around the world."" Horne and Weiss were extremely fit and experienced climbers, both having practiced the sport from more than a decade, according to Har-Noy. Weiss had been to Peru several times before, though this was Horne's first such visit. ""Gil meant the world to me, our family and friends,"" Gil's sister Galit Weiss told CNN by e-mail.

"(CNN) -- Newcastle's 16-year stay in the English Premier League has come to an end as a Damien Duff own goal saw them lose 1-0 at Aston Villa. Newcastle players react after Damien Duff's own goal sees them relegated from the Premier League. Duff deflected a 38th-minute shot from Gareth Barry past his own keeper Steve Harper to seal Newcastle's fate. Newcastle's misery was   complete when defender David Edgar was sent off for a late challenge on England winger Ashley Young. The result meant Magpies legend Alan Shearer failed to work the miracle he was brought in to try and achieve with eight games remaining. Newcastle will be joined in the Championship by Middlesbrough, who were beaten 2-1 at West Ham and West Bromwich Albion, whose relegation was already confirmed prior to Sunday's final matches. Both Hull and Sunderland survived the drop, despite both also losing their final matches. Hull were beaten 1-0 at home by a second-string Manchester United side, while Sunderland lost 3-2 at home to Chelsea in Guus Hiddink's final game in charge of the London side. Despite escaping relegation, Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia -- who had only been in charge for five months after Roy Keane's relegation -- announced his decision to resign at the end of their match. Meanwhile,  Newcastle have paid the price for a season of instability ever since Kevin Keegan decided to quit as manager in early September and owner Mike Ashley decided to put the club up for sale. Joe Kinnear was brought in to try and rescue the situation until his heart problems terminated his involvement and led to former England and Newcastle striker Shearer getting the call. But it was always going to be an uphill task to reverse a season of under-achievement and turmoil in such a short space of time. Now Shearer has to decide whether he wants to take on the task of trying to help the Magpies regain their top flight status and is due to have talks with Ashley early next week. ""It's painful and it hurts. It's been a great experience for me and in a weird way I have enjoyed it,"" Shearer told Sky Sports.""But lets get something straight, we didn't go down because of today, but because we weren't good enough after 38 games. ""Big changes need to be made at this club, players need to go and others have to arrive because, collectively, we were not good enough to survive."" Newcastle's result ensured Hull stayed in the Premier League, despite their defeat against champions Manchester United. As expected, United manager Alex Ferguson put out a reserve side with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League final against Barcelona, but they still proved too strong for the home side and Darren Gibson's superb first half long-range strike proved enough for the visitors. Second-bottom Middlesbrough will join the Magpies and already-relegated West Brom in the Championship after their defeat at Upton Park. The hosts went ahead after 33 minutes when Carlton Cole sidefooted past goalkeeper Brad Jones and although Gary O'Neill hit an equalizer shortly after the break, the Hammers won the match eight minutes later through Junior Stanislas. Sunderland were the only other side in danger of getting relegated at the start of play and had other results to thank for their survival after they were beaten by Chelsea. Nicolas Anelka claimed the season's Golden Boot award in style with a wonder-strike, his 19th of the season,  two minutes into the second half. Kieran Richardson took advantage of Petr Cech's fumble to level but Salomon Kalou gave the visitors the lead again in the 74th minute and Ashley Cole wrapped up the win in the final 10 minutes. Kenwyne Jones scored a late consolation goal for Sunderland, who will now be looking for a new manager following Sbragia's announcement, although the Scotsman will remain on the coaching staff. Everton finish the table in fifth place after a 2-0 victory at Fulham, who have qualified for the Europa League in seventh place despite the defeat. Leon Osman hit both goals for the Toffees, but Roy Hodgson's team retained seventh as Tottenham were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool. The hosts took the lead in the first-half thanks to Fernando Torres' header and Alan Hutton's own goal made it two after the break. Robbie Keane pulled one back against his former club with a quarter of an hour to go, but Yossi Benayoun netted Liverpool's third nine minutes from time. Elsewhere, Arsenal were in a rampant mood at the Emirates Stadium, demolishing Stoke in the first half on the way to a 4-1 victory. The Gunners opened the scoring on 10 minutes when striker James Beattie slotted the ball into his own net from Cesc Fabregas' cross. The hosts then made it 2-0 on the quarter hour when Robin van Persie was brought down by Ryan Shawcross and then converted the resulting spot-kick. Frenchman Abou Diaby headed home a a third goal two minutes later before Stoke pulled one back through a Ricardo Fuller penalty. Van Persie completed the scoring with his second of the game, taking advantage of a mistake from Rory Delap.","Newcastle are relegated from the Premier League after 1-0 loss at Aston Villa .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's remarks Monday on Hurricane Sandy were in some ways the most significant of his presidency. They were, at their core, about the role of government -- all governments -- and the responsibility of citizens to take care of themselves and each other when times are tough. By embracing self-reliance and resiliency -- ""take care of yourselves"" and ""we will get through this"" were themes -- Obama did more to defend and explain the role of government than any presidential debate ever could. The message was political, but not in the partisan sense. It was more akin to the debates at America's founding on the role of government, and included an appropriate sense of tough love. It was a statement to the nation that reality is sometimes cruel and challenging. It was not filled with a ""We got this"" bravado. It would have been a lie for Obama to say so; as he noted, this is a massive storm, and -- by meteorologists' accounts -- of a different nature from what responders have seen before. He did not promise instantaneous response, explaining that first responders and utility company workers should not put themselves at risk until conditions are safer. Nor did he claim that all would be back to normal immediately. Politics: Looking presidential -- The optics of leadership during a disaster . That messaging was not an accident, nor was it partisan. In the statements from the White House to statehouses both Republican and Democratic, there's a hint that Sandy may help engender a new discussion about our resiliency. The measure of our success has as much to do with our initial response to a crisis as it does with restoring the mechanisms that support our commerce and transportation and all other aspects of our infrastructure. The value of a stronger infrastructure is not just that it doesn't fall apart when the winds howl, but that if operations are interrupted, it gets running again as soon as possible. It is not too early to think about Hurricane Sandy as a key point in policy discussions about our aging infrastructure and our lack of commitment to it. For the last several years, infrastructure enhancements have often been tied to the economic debate. The stimulus package had a dual purpose: Get roads fixed, bridges modernized, transportation systems upgraded, and all while putting people back to work. It was an important effort, but its public message referred primarily to jobs and the economy, not public safety. That we have to hunker down for the next few days is a basic -- and correct -- safety response to the wrath of such a storm. But Obama also noted an obvious fact: Our ability to bounce back -- to get the power lines restored, the transportation systems running -- is no small feat. When a storm puts 60 million people in danger, sends tens of thousands across the Eastern seaboard fleeing to the high ground to escape a surge made more threatening by a century of rising sea level; when it essentially shuts down New York City, bringing the transportation system to a halt and even shutting down the stock exchange -- it is not just a matter of safety in this storm. When we talk about upgrading and improving our infrastructure, we are talking about maintaining our resiliency as nature serves up ever more complicated, unpredictable weather in our new era of climate change. Politics: 5 things to watch in hurricane-wracked campaign . How to do this? There are plenty of solutions, many with bipartisan support. One involves creating an infrastructure bank, where the private sector directly invests in infrastructure projects, as is the case in many countries, with the promise that toll fees will bring in the financial gains. Architects embrace a concept of resilient design: For example, a new bridge across San Francisco Bay will sway with an earthquake rather than resist it. Public policy planners from New York City to New Orleans are grappling with how to make investments and drive activity, even as big weather puts much of the last century's infrastructure at risk, and sometimes under water. Electric companies that have fought government requirements to submerge power lines will face criticism about why so many lines are vulnerable. If storms like Sandy are likely in the future, we will begin to see a move toward a more resilient infrastructure, starting with projects that are already under way. Local and state governments are likely to require that primary power cables are underground and protected. Design competitions are just beginning to make resiliency a priority for public projects. Anticipate much more of this in the future; and, after the election, expect the infrastructure bank idea to gain momentum as legislators recognize that it might be better for the private sector to pay for projects that benefit their communities. Shutting down, as we all are doing this week, makes sense. But afterward, the real focus has to be on getting better at starting back up. No nation is immune to harm, but prepared nations are quicker at getting back to normal. Sandy has caused a lot of damage and suffering, but there are many emergency managers, architects, city planners and politicians who hope that it may also refocus a political effort to invest and upgrade. It is good for the economy, yes, but more important, it is good for our safety. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Juliette Kayyem.","Juliette Kayyem: Obama pointed out roles of self-reliance and government in crisis .

"(CNN) -- More than 20,000 confidential Boy Scout documents will be released Thursday identifying more than 1,000 leaders and volunteers banned from the group after being accused of sexual or inappropriate conduct with boys. The public release of the Scouts' 1,247 ""ineligible volunteer files"" from 1965 to 1985 will not contain the identities of the boy victims and witnesses. The national files are being distributed with the approval of the Oregon Supreme Court by a law firm that won an $18.5 million judgment in 2010 against the Boy Scouts in a case where a Scoutmaster sexually abused a boy. Wayne Perry, president of Boy Scouts of America, said the group is deeply committed to youth protection, but he acknowledged that in some cases, the organization's response to allegations of abuse by volunteers ""were plainly insufficient, inappropriate or wrong."" ""Where those involved in Scouting failed to protect, or worse, inflicted harm on children, we extend our deepest and sincere apologies to victims and their families,"" Perry said in a statement issued Wednesday evening. ""While it is difficult to understand or explain individuals' actions from many decades ago, today Scouting is a leader among youth-serving organizations in preventing child abuse."" Police: Couple hosted strip club, abused kids . The Boy Scouts opposed the release of the internal records and said their confidentiality has encouraged prompt reporting of questionable behavior and privacy for victimized boys and their families. ""While we respect the court, we are still concerned that the release of two decades' worth of confidential files into public view, even with the redactions indicated, may still negatively impact victims' privacy and have a chilling effect on the reporting of abuse,"" the organization said. The Scouts also released a September report from a University of Virginia psychiatry professor, Janet Warren, who concluded that the system ""has functioned well in keeping many unfit adults out of Scouting."" But the attorneys representing victims in several lawsuits against the Scouts say the group hid evidence from the public and police and that the so-called ""perversion files"" offer insight into what they deem a serious problem in the organization. The secrecy protected more than 1,000 suspected child molesters, said the attorneys, who will publicly release the documents during a news conference in a downtown Portland hotel. The attorneys are also seeking the release of post-1985 files from the Boy Scouts. Victim to Sandusky: 'Because of you, I trust no one' The files will show that the expelled Scout leaders and volunteers -- all men -- ""are sociopathic geniuses,"" said attorney Kelly Clark of Portland, who has reviewed the 20,000 pages and is among the attorneys releasing the papers Thursday. ""They fool everybody,"" he said. ""And then they are able to coerce, convince or threaten these kids to stay silent. And you see that play out over and over again in the files."" Clark said he represents more than 100 men who as children were in the Boy Scouts, and he estimates that more than 50% of his clients have drug or alcohol problems. At least three of them have committed suicide, he said. Tim Kosnoff, an attorney in Seattle, said the abuse allegedly inflicted on the men as boys ""has a corrosive effect"" in which trust, relationship and sexuality issues develop with adulthood. One former Boy Scout represented by Kosnoff, Keith Early, joined the group at 12, recruited by an assistant Scoutmaster who was a married firefighter with three children and led Scout meetings in a church in Washington state. Early, now 18, was sexually abused by the Scout leader while helping build a Boy Scout camp on his 42-acre ranch, he said in an interview with CNN. The assistant Scoutmaster was convicted of abusing Early and another boy and is now serving a prison sentence of 10 years to life. ""I felt like I was all alone,"" Early said. ""Just thinking about it makes me angry ... because how could you do that to somebody? How could you bring yourself to do that to somebody who is so innocent and has done nothing wrong?"" Ex-Peace Corps volunteer gets 15 years for abuse . The number of files started each year ranged from 25 to 75 at a time when about 5 million Scouts and volunteers were active, according to Warren's report. In most cases, ""police, courts and public were aware of the information in the files,"" and 58% ""included information known to the public."" There were ""a small number of files where an alleged offender was allowed back into Scouting after offending,"" often after psychiatric treatment, ""those cases were extraordinarily rare,"" wrote Warren, who was an expert witness for the Boy Scouts during the court case. Tim Hale, a Santa Barbara, California, attorney who's representing allegedly abused Scouts who are now adults, said the released documents could provide information about possible pedophiles. ""We're talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of unidentified men who should be registered sex offenders who are roaming free in society, free to volunteer with other youth organizations, to work at schools and that sort of thing,"" Hale said. The Boy Scouts disputes that characterization of their files. In a September 20 statement released by the Boy Scouts, Warren rebutted the characterization that the documents were ""secret files of hidden abuse"" by pedophiles. ""The files show a significant amount of public knowledge of the offenders and their unlawful acts. For example, over 60% of the files being made available to the public include some kind of public information. These public domain sources included newspaper articles, police reports, criminal justice records, and records of civil litigation. The majority of men in the files were arrested at some point in their lives for a sex crime,"" Warren wrote. Scouts study says kids safer with them than at home . The files are also ""very limited in their ability to answer important research questions about sexual abuse,"" she said. ""While some have attempted to categorize these files as a 'treasure trove' of information about pedophiles and their actions, that simply is not the case,"" Warren said. ""These files tell us precisely what researchers already knew, and have known for many years: some small number of men will use a position of trust and access to young people to pursue illegal sexual gratification. This is a sad reality that has been with us throughout human history."" The Boy Scouts say they have improved their youth protection policies the past decade and have initiated such practices as third-party, computerized background checks on all new adult volunteers. Also, at least two adults are present at all scouting activities, the group said. The Scouts, founded by congressional charter in 1910, instituted character reference checks for Scoutmasters in 1911 and, by the 1920s, began using an ineligible volunteers list deemed not having ""the moral, emotional or character values for membership,"" the group said. Opinion: What Scout abuse scandal teaches us . In June, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision to release the documents as requested by media outlets. ""The court had discretion to order, on good cause shown, the release of those documents subject to the redaction of names set out in the exhibits to protect victims of child sexual abuse and reporters of child sexual abuse from embarrassment, retaliation or other harm,"" the state Supreme Court said in its order. ""The court in this case properly exercised that authority."" The media companies seeking the release of the files were the Associated Press, The Oregonian newspaper in Portland, Oregon Public Broadcasting, KGW (a CNN affiliate), The New York Times and Courthouse News Service. Those media outlets intervened in a 2010 lawsuit in Oregon that resulted in the largest judgment against the Scouts in a molestation case. That year, an Oregon jury found the Boy Scouts liable for the sexual abuse of a 12-year-old boy more than 25 years earlier, returning a verdict of $18.5 million in punitive damages. Catholic bishop convicted of shielding abuser . The plaintiff, Kerry Lewis, then 38, allowed his name to be used publicly during the trial, according to his attorneys. He was among six men suing the Boy Scouts over allegations of sexual abuse. Lewis' attorney, Clark, produced documents during the six-week trial that he said were part of an archive of previously secret Boy Scout files chronicling decades of abuse of boys. Clark said that when his clients were boys during the 1980s, the Boy Scouts knew that at least one of them had been abused by a former assistant Scoutmaster. At the time of the 2010 trial, that former assistant Scoutmaster was a 53-year-old convicted sex offender released from prison in 2005 and paroled until 2013. Clark also alleged that though the Scout leader was removed, he was allowed to stay on as a volunteer and the abuse continued. In 1983, the assistant Scoutmaster told troop leaders he abused 17 Scouts, according to plaintiff's attorneys. In its verdict, the jury held the Boy Scouts of America 60% negligent; the Cascade Pacific Council, which oversees Scouting activities in the region, 15% negligent; and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 25% negligent. The church has sponsored a number of Boy Scout troops, including the one to which the plaintiff belonged. A lawyer representing the church said then that the verdict had no impact on the church, because it settled the case out of court more than a year earlier. Sandusky sentenced to 30 to 60 years .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and congressional leaders wrapped up their first ""fiscal cliff"" meeting since the election Friday with a confident tone that had both sides suggesting an agreement could be reached before January 1, when hefty federal spending cuts and tax raises are scheduled to take effect. ""My hope is that this will be the beginning of a fruitful process,"" said Obama, just prior to the meeting meant to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, which some economists warn could push the country into recession. ""Our challenge is to make sure that we can cooperate together,"" he said. Republican and Democrat leaders stood together after the White House talks, while House Speaker John Boehner said that Republicans recognize that neither side is going to get everything it wants. He added that a combination of revenue increases and spending cuts is needed. ""I believe that the framework that I've outlined in our meeting today is consistent with the president's call for a fair and balanced approach. To show our seriousness, we've put revenue on the table -- as long as it's accompanied by significant spending cuts,"" Boehner said. Long the sticking point between the president and congressional Republicans, increased revenue is sure to be at the center of any discussion. To the president, it means allowing Bush-era tax cuts on wealthy Americans to expire at the end of the year and returning to Clinton-era rates for high-income earners. But to Republicans, it has come to mean closing loopholes in the tax code and ending deductions without raising rates. For his part, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid simply promised progress. ""This isn't something we're going to wait until the last day of December to get it done. We have a plan. We're going to move forward on it,"" he said. Ahead of the meeting, members of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of centrists, sent a letter to Obama, Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""We cannot have a full debate that allows us to address the multitude of issues facing our country if either side takes a potential solution off the table,"" it said. With both parties suffering losses of moderate members in the election, this new coalition is signaling it could be a critical bloc of votes in getting a deal through the House. Boehner could potentially lose a chunk of votes from conservatives if final details on new revenue don't meet their approval. Major changes to entitlements could mean Pelosi would lose support from the progressives in the House who believe there shouldn't be any benefit cuts. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with Boehner, Pelosi, Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Roosevelt Room on Friday. ""We don't happen to think that the government needs more revenue. Government spends too much as it is,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday. But he added that if Democrats are willing to agree to reform entitlement programs, ""we'll be there."" Boehner on Wednesday acknowledged a ""spirit of cooperation"" between the two sides of the aisle in the House and the president, and he said he would remain optimistic. But as he's done every time he's publicly addressed the issue, the speaker restated his opposition to allowing any tax rates to go up. ""There are ways to put revenue on the table without increasing tax rates,"" he said. ""We've talked about this now for over a year."" The New Democrat group's letter was carefully crafted to avoid taking sides on any specific proposals on tax reform or structural changes to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. It pointed out that bipartisan commissions have already drawn up plans that reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts and new revenue, but the group didn't endorse any one formula. And when leaders of the group were pressed to answer whether Democrats would go along with significant changes to entitlement programs -- such as changing the eligibility age for Medicare -- they didn't answer directly and instead said they remain open to everything. ""At the very beginning, before we've even sat down at the table, how about we agree that everything stays on the table until we've had a chance to discuss it,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia. Earlier, Pelosi repeatedly said she wants to see a ""grand bargain"" -- the catch-all term for a major deficit reduction package that includes some combination of tax reform, spending cuts and entitlement reforms. But when asked what kind of entitlement changes she could accept, she said those programs should be dealt with separately from discussions about tax cuts. ""Those issues -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid -- they should be in their own realm. Whatever adjustments would be made in Social Security should be there to strengthen Social Security, not to subsidize a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America and say that's how we balance a budget. The same thing with Medicaid and Medicare,"" Pelosi said. Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pennsylvania, said the group ""isn't trying to go around their own leadership"" and wants to work with both parties. She said she was encouraged by what top Republicans were saying on being open to new revenue, but she seemed to echo Pelosi on entitlements, saying they are part of a longer-term solution. Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin, the incoming chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, insisted that no one should be drawing bright lines on any issue and compared fiscal cliff negotiations to those between Israel and Palestinian leaders. ""We all know what we need to do -- it's like the Middle East peace plan. Everyone knows where we need to end up; we just need to figure out the political process to get there,"" he said. The New Democrat Coalition grew after this month's election, from 42 members to as many as 52 or 53, depending on the results of the handful of unresolved House races. That equates to roughly one-quarter of the overall House Democratic caucus. Similar to the ""Blue Dog"" Democrats, another group of fiscal conservatives who played a major role in health care negotiations, this group emphasizes bipartisan solutions. The ranks of the Blue Dogs, who hail mainly from Southern states, were decimated in the 2010 election, and the group will have fewer members -- about 15 -- heading into the next Congress after the retirement of several members. A challenge facing moderate Democrats is they don't wield significant power in the leadership. Pelosi and the rest of the current leadership are expected to stay essentially the same in the next Congress. While No. 2 Democrat Steny Hoyer is viewed as more ideologically moderate, and often is the bridge to those members, the rest of the leaders have ties to the more liberal elements of the caucus. The New Democrats do have the potential of gaining a seat at the leadership table -- its current chairman, Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, is vying for the post of vice chairman of the caucus, against Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado and Rep. Barbara Lee of California. Several Democratic aides expect Crowley to win the spot when the elections are held after Thanksgiving.","NEW: Reid: ""This isn't something we're going to wait until the last day of December to get it done""

"(CNN) -- A Lionel Messi brace helped Barcelona to a 5-1 win over Athletic Bilbao and a new La Liga record on Saturday. With 13 wins and one draw so far, Tito Vilanova's side surpass the previous record for the best start to a season set by Real Madrid back in 1991-92. Gerard Pique put the home side ahead in the 22nd minute with Messi doubling the lead three minutes later. Adriano all but sealed the points with a goal at the end of the first half and Cesc Fabregas made doubly sure 12 minutes after the restart. Ibai Gomez goal in the 66th minute ensured Bilbao's trip wasn't completely wasted but it was Messi who once again had the final say putting away his second of the match moments later. The Argentine is now one goal away from equaling German Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year set in 1972. Read: Football remembers 'Christmas truce' Barcelona's nearest rivals in the title chase squared up to each other in the Madrid derby with Real overcoming Atletico 2-0 at the Bernabeu. A stunning 30-yard free kick from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 15th minute put Jose Mourinho's men ahead before Mesut Ozil securing all three points with a strike in the 65th minute. The result sees Real reduce their arrears with Atletico to five points with Barca still 11 points ahead. Earlier on Saturday, Mauricio Pellegrino was sacked as manager of Valencia following a 5-2 defeat at the hands of Real Sociedad. The result sees Philippe Montanier's side move up to seventh, one place behind Getafe who beat fourth-placed Malaga 1-0. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus extended their lead over Napoli -- who play Pescara on Sunday -- to five points with a 3-0 home win over Torino. The visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 40th minute when Polish defender Kamil Glik was shown a red card. Juventus took full toll of the numerical advantage in the second half with two goals from Claudio Marchisio and one from Sebastian Giovinco.","Barcelona surpass Real Madrid's record for best start to La Liga season with 5-1 over Bilbao .

"(CNN) -- Syria's two-day Internet blackout was ""a mental war"" inflicted by the government, an opposition activist said Sunday as service to the country was largely restored. ""So far, all areas that had Internet service before Thursday are connected,"" said Alexia Jade, a spokeswoman for the opposition Damascus Media Office. While Internet access is back, theories and concerns abound on what caused the outage. It also sparked fears that the government is stepping up efforts to quash the uprising by crushing the flow of information and isolating the country from the outside world. ""It appears to be back to normal, but it is impossible to tell if filtering or monitoring technology was installed during the outage,"" said Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, an Internet security company. Global monitors said the country lost contact with the Web on Thursday, plunging into an Internet black hole. Syria's information minister said ""terrorists"" cut the cable, knocking out Web communication with other countries. The government uses the word ""terrorists"" to refer to rebels in the ongoing civil war, and blamed them for a car bombing near a mosque in Homs that killed 15 people and wounded 24 others Sunday. Syria caused Internet blackout, security firm says . According to state-run media, a car bomb in Barzeh killed three people. Syrian TV also showed graphic pictures of bodies in a field and reported 21 rebels were killed as they tried to smuggle weapons into Talkalakh, a town near the border with Lebanon. The military also carried out operations in Aleppo, state-run media said. At least eight rebels died in Aleppo when they were bombed by warplanes as they attacked Syrian military positions, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group claimed the Syrian military also bombed targets in Damascus and Reef al-Raqqa. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least 173 people were found dead in Syria on Sunday. More than 42,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict since the uprising began in March 2011, according to opposition activists. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. During the Syrian rebellion, anti-government fighters have routinely used the Web to transmit bloody images, including what they say are military attacks on civilians. Rebel leaders accused the government of creating the blackout to hide its mass killings from the outside world. ""The regime knows that Internet is the main communication method for us,"" Jade said. ""Taking that down is almost like blinding the normal Internet users related to the revolution."" Opposition: Fierce fighting closes Damascus airport for second day . Internet and cell phone coverage were restored Saturday to most Syrian provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The same day, state media reported the Internet and communications lines were back in service in Damascus and its suburbs, blaming the outage on a malfunction in the main grid. A Web security expert said the outage was almost certainly the work of the Syrian government. Prince said his firm's investigations showed that all four Internet cables linking Syria to the outside world would have had to been cut simultaneously for a whole country outage to occur. As winter nears in Syria, people are being forced back to restive neighborhoods . Al-Sakhour is on the frontlines of the Syrian civil war and is the last place most civilians want to be. But the streets are getting cold, and people are low on cash. So going home was the only option for about one-third of the residents of this Aleppo community and others nearby. For the children, gunfire is so frequent it has become background noise. One 12-year-old girl tells CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon that she hardly notices anymore. Some children even collect the shell casings they find in the streets. The Syrian military wants to retake al-Sakhour because a road important to the insurgents runs through the neighborhood, which was one of the first to be controlled by rebels. It is now a bloody battle for the streets and one vital road to Aleppo airport. There are bodies on the roads. People try to retrieve them, only to be shot at by snipers. There are other dangers. One father shows his right arm, which he says was shot as he shielded one of his daughters at a checkpoint. A woman pulls Damon aside and grimly tells her ""I'd rather die than live like this.""

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi continued his incredible year by moving ever closer to Gerd Muller's record goal total by firing Barcelona into the next round of the Champions League. The Argentina star scored twice to take his 2012 tally to 80 as Barca recorded a 3-0 win at Spartak Moscow. Muller scored 85 goals in 60 matches for Bayern Munich and Germany back in 1972 but his record is under increasing threat. Barca has six matches left before the turn of the year with Messi requiring six goals to surpass Muller and break yet another record. ""My aim was just to get the ball, create chances and that we win the game, that is what is important,"" Messi told reporters. ""We knew we couldn't afford to make mistakes after what happened against Celtic and that we had to go out strongly even though it is difficult to play away in this competition."" Messi passes Pele's goal milestone . Tito Vilanova's men face Levante on Sunday before further games against Athletic Bilbao, Benfica, Real Betis, Atletico Madrid and Real Valladolid. After eclipsing the achievement of Brazil legend Pele, who scored 75 goals from 53 matches in 1958, Messi moved up a gear in the Russian capital. With Barcelona already leading through Dani Alves' 16th minute effort, the diminutive striker fired home following a mix-up in the Sparktak defense. On the synthetic playing surface, Barcelona's tiki-taka football proved too much for the home side to cope with. And with just six minutes of the first period remaining, Messi grabbed his second of the evening with a neat finish after eluding the Spartak defense. ""Everyone talks about Leo, the goals and the records but it is more his awareness and tactics,"" Vilanova told reporters. ""The way he defends and attacks and helps the team in all areas. ""The team showed how great they are as this was a difficult game in the cold on an artificial pitch although some of them have played on it before, and they played an excellent match. ""It was important for us not to have to qualify in the final game which will not be easy against Benfica."" Messi leads Ballon d'Or nominations . Led by Xavi, who made his 125th Champions League appearance, the Catalan giant could have had several more goals had it not been for wastefulness in front of goal. Pedro Rodriguez and Cesc Fabregas both had chances to extend Barca's lead as Spartak fell away. Meanwhile, Benfica kept alive its hopes of qualifying for the next stage with a 2-1 win over Celtic in Group G's other game. The Portuguese side took an early lead through Ola John only for Georgios Samaras to pull Celtic level. But Ezequiel Garay's fiercely struck volley secured victory for Benfica, who face a trip to the Camp Nou to play Barcelona in its final group game. Should Benfica suffer defeat , Celtic can secure a place in the last 16 with victory over Spartak Moscow. Barca's unbeaten run ended by Celtic . Chelsea could become the first defending champion to be knocked out in the Group Stage after it lost 3-0 to Juventus in Turin. The defeat is Chelsea's heaviest in the competition since they were beaten 5-1 by Barcelona 12 years ago. The Blues will go into the final round of Group E matches in third place after goals from Fabio Quagliarella, Arturo Vidal and Sebastian Giovinco sealed the win for Juventus. ""We showed much better spirit than the last games,"" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech told ITV. ""The first half it was very difficult, we did well and created chances, but if you create a chance you need to take it. ""That was the difference. They went ahead with a lucky deflection, the second goal was another deflection but they did very well and deserved to win. We didn't cope very well. ""We said before the game that we have our destiny in our hands, not any more. Now we need to do our bit , we need to win our last game and hope our fate is kind. ""Being realistic, Juventus played very well and they need a point and Shakhtar are already through. It is a very sad moment."" Chelsea must hope that the Italians slip up and it records victory over Nordsjaelland to sneak through. Shakhtar Donetsk's 4-2 triumph over Danish side Nordsjaelland means the Ukrainian champion is guaranteed a place in the last-16 of the competition. Controversy . A Luiz Adriano hat-trick and a Willian double gave Shakhtar all three points and means it tops the group from Juventus. But it wasn't all plain sailing for Shakhtar after it scored a hugely controversial goal to go to 1-1. With a drop ball signaled by the referee, Shakhtar kicked the ball back to the Nordsjaelland goalkeeper, only for Adriano to intercept and score. With the Danes fuming, the visitors were ready to allow a Nordsjaelland player to walk the ball into the net in a gesture of sportsmanship.

In Group F, Thomas Muller secured Bayern Munich's place in the next round following a 1-1 draw with ten-man Valencia. The Spaniards, who had Antonio Barragan sent off, had looked set to snatch victory when Sofiane Feghouli scored with 17 minutes remaining. But Muller hit back just five minutes later to claim a point and send both teams through to the next stage following BATE Borisov's defeat by Lille.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The war in Afghanistan may no longer be forgotten but the true victims always are. Having been denied healthcare and education under the Taliban, Afghan women are now training as midwives . Women and children in the landlocked Asian country have continuously paid the ultimate price throughout the decades of conflict and war. It is their lives that are considered not precious enough to save. A woman here dies every 29 minutes due to childbirth complications, according to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) -- one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. One in four children die before they reach the age of five because of the lack of health care and medical facilities in their cities and villages. But ignorance is also deadly. Misguided cultural pride prevents men from allowing their women to see a doctor, merely because the doctor could be male. And in many cases, it's not just women who die from childbirth-related issues. It is young girls forced into marriage before they even reach puberty. Their still-forming bodies cannot handle the complications of childbirth. But there are women in Afghanistan stepping up within the crowds of the forgotten and pushing past the barriers. They are training as midwives across the country to help bring change and save lives. ""A woman can help a woman more,"" midwifery student Fariha Ibrahimi told CNN. ""We have to introduce them with what to do, what foods to eat, how to take care of themselves. ""[We] tell their husbands how to treat them. There are some husbands who beat their wives to the point where they can no longer even get pregnant."" At the Ibni Sina Balkhi Midwifery Training Center in Kabul, dozens of future midwives study and practise in the hope of bringing a brighter future to their countrywomen. ""It's very heartbreaking,"" Ibrahimi said of the situation women face. ""Afghanistan has gone through so much war and most girls were not allowed to get an education, so I want to study and bring forth something new."" Sympathy for Afghan women is the strongest motivating force among students in this field: Many know personally what is like to live in a society where pregnant women are ignored and forgotten. ""We live in an area where we are far from any clinic or hospital and there are a lot of difficulties there for pregnant women,"" Nourzia, a student and mother, told CNN. ""It's very difficult for them to reach a hospital. This is why I was so keen in learning this profession and helping these women; so in the future they are in less danger."" All the women here are training with the permission and support of their families. They are leading the way to a brighter tomorrow for Afghan women -- one that may one day catch up with the rest of the world. ""The world is moving forward and he didn't want me to sit around jobless,"" said future midwife, Maurina whose husband is supportive of her new career. ""He wanted me to push ahead in this field, especially a field in which our people need help in."" There are still many obstacles left and these women are still in the minority. According to the World Health Organization there are only about 2,000 trained midwives servicing Afghanistan's population of just under 33 million. But that is a giant leap from just eight years ago when most women were denied an education, medical care and the basic necessities of survival under the Taliban regime. It will take many years to change mindsets instilled by decades of brutality. But these women prove that maybe, just maybe, the next generation can fix the mistakes of the last.","Afghanistan has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality in the world .

"(CNN) -- When I teach psychiatry to medical residents, the first thing I tell them is that patients' stories always make sense. No matter how bizarre a person's symptoms might be, our lives follow a human logic, and they follow a medical logic. When a story doesn't make sense, it means you don't know the real story. Medical stories that don't make sense are often big news makers, precisely because they don't make sense. Sometimes, they titillate our hunger for the unexplained. Sometimes, they capture our attention because the medical uncertainty frightens us. A current and highly publicized example of this phenomenon can be seen in the case of a group of teenagers attending a single school in Le Roy, New York, who have developed strange movement disorders in rapid succession. Out of the blue, previously normal young people have had their lives devastated by uncontrollable tics, gesticulations and embarrassing verbal outbursts. And no one can find a medical explanation for this horrible state of affairs. N.Y. town still baffled by teens' mysterious tics . If ever there were a story that doesn't make sense, this is it. So what should a psychiatrist -- or any other type of doctor for that matter -- do if a story doesn't make sense? Continue to gather information until the real story emerges. How do you know that the real story has finally emerged? Because it makes sense. Let's apply that logic to the situation of the afflicted young people of Le Roy. Their symptoms most closely resemble a neurological condition called Tourette 's syndrome. Patients suffering with Tourette's are bedeviled by a wide variety of nonsensical movements or speech acts that occur involuntarily, and that are called tics. Tics are involuntary but can usually be briefly controlled if a patient concentrates. If you ask a someone with Tourette's why he or she engages in such odd behavior, you will be told about an intense sense of internal discomfort that is only relieved by doing the tic, and then only briefly. At first glance, Tourette's syndrome is an attractive explanation for the Le Roy tic epidemic. It occurs in young people. It causes very similar symptoms. And despite its often catastrophic effect on people's lives, it is not associated with any easily identifiable abnormalities in the brain or body that provide an easy diagnostic test for doctors. It can be diagnosed only by its symptoms. But I can assure you that the young people of Le Roy do not have Tourette's for one simple reason: It is a rare condition and it is a solitary disorder. Genetic risks for the disorder exist, including a vulnerability to develop a subtle autoimmune condition of the brain following a streptococcal infection in childhood. But Tourette's is not contagious. It never occurs in an epidemic form such as the mystery illness in New York state. So if the young people of Le Roy don't have Tourette's what do they have? To answer this, we have to ask a follow-up question: What are the most frequent causes of illnesses that occur in groups of people, especially in groups of people in close physical contact? The answer is clear. Disease epidemics are usually caused by infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria. If all the people afflicted with an illness live in the same environment, the other possibility is that something in that environment is making them sick. So whenever a doctor hears about a group of people living close to each other in the same location who develop the same disease, his or her first thought should be that the illness has either an infectious or environmental cause. Could toxic chemical be source of tics in NY town? This fact explains a good deal of why people are so worried about the current tic outbreak. If it has an environmental cause, then other people in the area are at risk. If it has an infectious cause, then we could all be at risk. So why is it almost certainly impossible for the Tourette's-like outbreak among the young people of Le Roy to be the result of either an infection or the local environment? Let's consider the infectious possibility first. Even if you didn't know that all blood tests in the affected young people have been normal, you could effectively rule out infection for one very simple reason: All but one of the people who have developed tics are female, and all but one are teenagers. Have you ever heard of a virus, bacteria or parasite that, in essence, infects only teenage girls? (Or more exactly, that only causes illness in teenage girls.) Why is an environmental cause also not likely? The school district has conducted fairly rigorous tests of the school environment and found nothing abnormal. That doesn't overly impress me, however, because it is always possible to miss a poison that is currently not well understood. Moreover, as the environmental activist Erin Brockovich has made public knowledge, a toxic chemical spill occurred in the area surrounding the school many years ago. But the problem with an environmental explanation is similar to the problem with an infectious one. Why would a poison in the environment almost exclusively target female teenagers? And unless the poison was brand new in the environment, why would so many people get so terribly sick so quickly? Why would a toxic spill that occurred years ago only now cause illness, and do it so quickly in such a select population? When the mystery illness is examined in this way, it becomes apparent why doctors have ascribed it to a psychological condition called conversion disorder. But does this explanation hold up better than infectious or environmental ones? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. Although we don't understand what causes conversion disorders, the fact that they exist is indisputable. I've seen hundreds of them over the years. Taking the 'mystery' out of conversion disorder . The essence of a conversion disorder is the development of a neurological symptom -- such as the tics seen in the young people of Le Roy -- for which no neural abnormality can be found. Typically, a simple neurological exam will confirm that the symptom doesn't result from any type of brain or nerve damage. And yet patients with conversion disorder have no conscious sense that the symptom is a production of their brains. That is, they are not manufacturing the problem. They are truly afflicted, and it can be horrible. Only someone who has hypnotized people paralyzed for months and had them hop out of bed and run around the hospital room, or who has conducted ""truth serum"" interviews of people unable to speak, only to have them erupt into King's English, would believe that such bizarre conditions exist. But having conducted these interventions, and more, I can assure you that people can be completely incapacitated by symptoms with no obvious medical cause. There is another reason why conversion disorder is a plausible explanation for the tics of Le Roy. People can catch these conditions from each other. While uncommon, it has been documented many times in history. If this seems strange, consider the fact that we are affected by each other's thoughts and emotions all the time. Ever had your day ruined by the bad mood of your spouse or your child? The type of psychogenic contagion that most likely underlies the tic epidemic is far more extreme than these commonplace examples, but falls along the same spectrum. No one likes conversion disorder as an explanation for the tic epidemic. Patients feel insulted, stigmatized and dismissed. Their parents feel dismissed and terrified that something medical has been missed. Everyone involved feels that they are being blamed for the problem. And what doctor worth his or her salt would be truly satisfied with an explanation that tells us nothing about the cause of the disease or how to specifically treat it? I don't think anyone has good answers for these questions. Certainly, I don't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Raison.","Charles Raison: To untangle the mystery of teenagers' tics, try to make the symptoms make sense .
Tourette's syndrome can be ruled out, since it's a rare and solitary disorder, he says .
He says environmental poisons, infection aren't causes because tics affected well-defined group .
Raison: That leaves psychological cause as most reasonable explanation ."
"(CNN) -- Roots ripped out of the ground as a large oak tree fell toward Olga Raymond's front door. With it came a power line. Raymond had just left her one-story home in Mansfield, Connecticut.

They rushed to give it to their pastor, the Rev. Francis Dias. ""They picked it up and showed it to me and said 'This is our friend, Angela,' "" Dias said. ""It had floated from the house onto the road."" Angela was one of the first victims of Superstorm Sandy identified on Staten Island. The teen's body was found not too far from her home early Tuesday after a surge of water demolished her family's house on the edge of the borough's south shore, according to SILive.com. Neighbors told SILive.com that the family had evacuated from Irene last year and were robbed. This time, they decided to stay behind. George Dresch was reported missing shortly after the storm passed through. His body was discovered late Wednesday blocks from his house, according to SILive.com. His wife, Patricia, was found earlier in the week and transported to the hospital, where she is reportedly in stable condition. The Dreschs were dedicated parishioners at Our Lady Help of Christians Church, Dias said. Patricia Dresch is the secretary to the religious education program's coordinator. ""Patricia has served our community for over 20 years as a dutiful and faithful catechist,"" Dias said. ""The parishioners -- both parents and students -- love her and respect her very much."" George Dresch was always at the church helping out, Dias said, whether it was for the education program or the Christmas pageant. Support has been pouring in for his wife as she struggles to recover and deal with the loss of her husband and youngest child. Angela's friends have set up a memorial page for her on Facebook.

"(CNN) -- ""What day is Veterans Day?"" It was a simple question my colleague asked me a few weeks ago. I was startled, then a little horrified. I wondered how anyone could not know when America officially honors military Veterans. When I was growing up, and even now, every day is Veterans Day. My dad was a veteran of Korea and three combat tours in Vietnam. He never talked about his military service but it was the phantom of my childhood. He had an explosive temper and terrible nightmares. He drank too much and yelled even more. He never held a job for more than a year or two, if at all, and looking back now, I realize he must have suffered terribly. But he loved America, his kids and happy hours at the VFW. He hated hippies, foreign cars and people who belittled the armed forces. Red, white and blue were his favorite colors. He carried his service around in his heart, his mind and in the metal shrapnel scattered in his body until the day he died. For him, every day was Veterans Day, because he lived his time at war in some way every day. It's a family tradition. My father's father fought in the trenches of Europe in World War I, my uncles served in World War II. My brother Ole joined the Marines when he was 17 and now, 35 years later, he is still serving. Although he doesn't talk about his time in Iraq and Afghanistan, he, like my dad, carries his service in his heart and his mind. My brother always says his heroes are the Marines he lost in Iraq. To this day, he honors those men by staying in touch with their families and keeping their memories alive. Every day will always be Veterans Day for him. My niece Susie is a private in the Army. She joined straight out of high school. I dread the day when she, too, will come home from a far off land wounded on the inside or out, when Veterans Day is every day for her, too. I am like most Americans. I have never fought in a war, never smelled fear and ammunition in combat, never worried about being blown up by a roadside bomb. We need to remember those who fought for our country while we stayed safe, out of the crossfire. The Veterans Administration says there are 23 million living U.S. Veterans. They could be your co-workers, neighbors and friends. Even if you don't know anyone who has served in the armed forces, there are some small things you can do to let them know you appreciate their service. How you can help a Veteran any day . California-based  Operation Gratitude sponsors programs honoring veterans year-round with care packages that include handwritten letters. There are directions on their website. The group sends care packages to VA hospitals, veterans nursing homes, veterans groups and other support organizations. You can also create your own care package for a VA Hospital. Donations of magazines, coffee or cookies, new or gently used clothing and telephone cards are always welcome. Contact your local VA Hospital for more information on what's needed in your community. According to the VA, a little more than a fifth of the adult homeless population has served in the military. The VA has a National Call Center for Veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. The center provides free 24/7 access to trained counselors. Call 1-877-4AID VET (1-877-424-3838.) In Washington and other cities, some organizations are working to help Homeless Veterans. ""Veterans don't always ask for help. There's a lot of pride,"" says Christy Respress, executive director of Pathways to Housing DC. Pathways works with MIriam's Kitchen to identify veterans who need help and get them off the street. They do this by getting them into permanent housing and providing them with psychological help and other services. These are just a few ways to help make every day Veterans Day. There are so many more things you can do in your own community. Not just on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, but a daily Armistice in our hearts.","Veterans Day is Sunday, November 11 .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea has rewarded Roberto di Matteo for guiding the English club to its first European Champions League triumph by appointing him as manager on a permanent basis. The Italian, who also guided the London team to English FA Cup glory, has been handed a two-year contract. The former Chelsea midfielder took temporary charge of the team following the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas in March, having previously served as the Portuguese's assistant. ""Chelsea football club is delighted to announce that Roberto Di Matteo has been appointed manager and first-team coach on a permanent basis,"" the four-time English champion's website reported Wednesday. Di Matteo, who played for Chelsea between 1996 and 2002, oversaw the team's dramatic penalty shootout win in European club football's biggest match in May. ""I'm obviously delighted to have been appointed as manager and first-team coach,"" the former West Bromwich Albion and MK Dons manager said. ""We all achieved incredible success last season that made history for this great club. Our aim is to continue building on that and I'm already planning and looking forward to the squad's return for preseason."" Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said he was confident the former Italy international could continue his early success. ""Roberto's quality was clear for all to see when he galvanized the squad last season and helped the club make history, and the owner and board are very pleased he will be continuing his good work,"" said Gourlay. ""We will be working closely with Roberto in the weeks ahead, some exciting signings have already been made and Roberto has had input into those.

Meanwhile, the Premier League has sold its UK live television rights for 2013-16 for Â£3.018 billion ($4.7 billion) to current broadcaster Sky and newcomer BT. The deal is Â£1.254 billion ($1.95 billion) higher than the present one shared by Sky and ESPN, which took over the packages held by financially troubled Setanta Sports in 2009 but missed out completely this time.

"(CNN) -- The head of the nail -- Andrew Dominik's new movie hits it hard and square. Maybe too hard for those who appreciate a little ambiguity with their messaging, but ambiguity is not on the agenda in this tale of business ethics at the dark end of the street. Adapting and updating George V. Higgin's 1974 crime novel ""Cogan's Trade"" and resuming his collaboration with ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" producer/star Brad Pitt, Dominik has crafted a poison pen letter to late capitalism in general and the United States in particular. That sounds like a long reach for a thriller, but gangster films as different as ""The Godfather"" and ""Scarface"" have cast a baleful eye on the American pursuit of happiness before. But even then, ""The Dream"" never seemed so rotten to its core as in this caustic, corrosive piece of pulp nihilism. This is New Orleans, so wet it's as if the floods never left. October 2008. Wall Street and the dam have burst. The airwaves are clogged with economic meltdown. President George W. Bush is trying to sell the bailout. Barack Obama is trying to sell himself and a vision of community that's wildly at odds with the dog-eat-dog world we see on screen. (The two presidents feature so strongly in the elaborate sound design they're practically supporting characters.) Brad Pitt is Cogan, one of those guys you go to with a job you don't want to spell out. For $10,000, he'll resolve the problem. Who are his employers? It's never specifically stated, but his contact, played with squirmy embarrassment by Richard Jenkins, complains about the committee mentality, the squeamishness and the lack of leadership, so we know it's the corporate mafia. Gambling has been shut down in the city after a couple of lowlifes hit a big-money poker game knowing that the host, Markie (Ray Liotta), will pay the price (he's foolishly admitted to jacking his own game once before). Cogan knows that Markie wasn't involved this time -- no one is that dumb -- but recognizes that it makes no difference, he'll have to pay before things can settle back to business as usual. Meanwhile the real thieves -- pathetic scuzzballs looking to stake their own claim on the Dream (Ben Mendelsohn and Scoot McNairy) -- soon spill their secret, and Cogan calls in a colleague from out of state to dispatch the guy who put them up to it. He doesn't want to do this one himself, he knows the guy. ""Have you ever killed someone? It gets touchy-feely. They cry. They plead. They piss themselves. They cry for their mothers. It gets embarrassing. I like to kill them softly. From a distance."" The plotting is as remorseless as Cogan's logic, but the movie has an unusual and distinctive structure, one that comes straight from Higgins, the Boston lawyer best known for ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" (filmed with Robert Mitchum the year before ""Cogan's Trade"" was published). Higgins let his stories seep out from eavesdropped conversations, almost between the lines, putting the reader in the position of a juror trying to untangle a case from dozens of competing testimonies. In ""Killing Them Softly,"" action scenes are doled out almost as counterpoint, tense but self-contained exclamations of aestheticized blood-letting. The movie's real meat -- its heart and soul, if it has any -- lies in its coursing torrent of words; a filthy tirade of crude, funny, deeply cynical man talk (there's one female speaking part in the movie, and she's a hooker). The men speak at each other. They're all incontinent storytellers, bragging, justifying, hustling, cajoling, complaining, but only dimly comprehending. There's an echo of Quentin Tarantino here -- and Elmore Leonard before him -- but there are no pop culture references in Higgins. The speechifying isn't flip, cool or ironic, even if it does encourage displays of actorly machismo (closer to Martin Scorsese, in fact). In the movie's superb, sour centerpiece, there are two lengthy conversations -- monologues, almost -- featuring James Gandolfini as a bloated, alcoholic, bitter and defeated killer. He's an aging hit man gone to seed facing a third long spell in jail and no one there at home when he comes out again. Gandolfini is brutal in this role, all his tenderness turned vicious and repulsive through self-pity. But still, at least we discern the ashes of emotion in this wreck of a man. Discreetly, not unkindly, Cogan arranges for his removal and takes over the contract. Cogan is the consummate professional, the hero by default in a movie without heroics, a savagely cynical satire on a bankrupt system in terminal decline.","The film is based on George V.

"(CNN) -- People in poorer countries send text messages more often than those in wealthier countries. Men in Spain and Germany access the Internet on their phones twice as much as women do. And use of online social networks grew dramatically in Egypt and Russia over the past year, most likely as part of the recent political upheavals in those countries. These are among the results of a new report that measured the usage of digital communication in 21 countries. The survey by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project found that text messaging is now a widespread global phenomenon: In the countries polled, 75% of cell phone owners say they text. In almost all the countries surveyed, the use of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter didn't change much from 2010 to 2011. Two notable exceptions were Egypt, where 28% of respondents now use social networks -- up from 18% last year -- and Russia, where social-networking use rose from 33% to 43%. Facebook and other networking tools played a prominent role in the revolution that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February. Protesters organized so effectively on social networks that the Egyptian government shut down the Internet for five days in an unsuccessful attempt to quell the uprising. Observers say social networks also have helped mobilize protesters in Moscow, where tens of thousands have filled the streets to speak out against Russian parliamentary elections they say were rigged. The Pew survey found that only 6% of Internet users in Russia were not on social-networking sites. Researchers conducted the survey face-to-face and via telephone in the spring of this year. Sample sizes in each country ranged from 700 in Japan to more than 4,000 in India. Among the survey's other findings: . -- Of the countries surveyed, text messaging was most common in Indonesia and Kenya, where 96% and 89% of people said they regularly send texts. By contrast, 67% of people in the United States were frequent texters. -- In Spain, 29% of male cell phone owners use their devices to access the Internet, compared to 13% of female phone owners. This mobile-Web gender gap was also pronounced in Germany (26%/11%) and in Turkey (30%/14%). -- Social networking is generally more common in wealthier nations, largely driven by the fact that they have higher rates of Internet access. For example, 53% of respondents in Israel and 50% of respondents in the U.S. said they use social networks, compared with 5% in India and 2% in Pakistan.","Survey: Use of social networks grew dramatically amid recent upheavals in Egypt and Russia .

"(CNN) -- Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte really want us to believe that their shameful behavior toward United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice is all about getting to the truth about what happened in Libya, but the truth is that this is the first salvo in a GOP war against President Barack Obama over the next four years. Do they think Americans are dumb enough to believe that Rice, who had no responsibility over intelligence or approving security requests at the State Department, is the main person who should be answering their queries over what happened in Benghazi that led to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens? These three continue to assert that Rice should have known better than to read talking points on several Sunday morning shows provided to her by the intelligence community, as well as provide an assessment that went outside of what she was told. Is it fair that she be asked about those talking points? Of course. But to somehow try to pin the blame on her is downright offensive. It has been amazing to watch the degree to which U.S. senators don't want to criticize Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has jurisdiction over the department. Yes, Clinton, and not Rice, oversees U.S. ambassadors across the world, and it is her department that denied the security requests from Stevens. If there is anyone who should be answering questions about security of our consulate in Libya, it's Clinton. Instead, it's all Rice, all day. McCain, Graham and Ayotte also want to know why the intelligence was so botched, so what do they do? Try to pin that on Rice as well. Again, it has been stunning to see the degree in which members of Congress are afraid to even utter David Petraeus' name, as if vigorously questioning the assessment of the Central Intelligence Agency, which he ran before a sex scandal forced him to resign, is off limits. If GOP senators are demanding intelligence answers, then they should continue to haul leaders of various agencies down to Congress to testify under oath. Instead, they've made the calculation to turn Rice into their piÃ±ata, desperate to scuttle a potential secretary of state nomination. What finally took the cake was seeing Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins raise questions about Rice and the handling of the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa. Seriously? Now they are trying to pin those bombings on Rice? This has turned into a charade that is shameless, pathetic and embarrassing. Now it's Obama's turn to play hardball and make clear to the GOP that he won't get pushed around with his appointees in his second term. After January 1, he should make clear to the nation that he is going to appoint the eminently qualified Rice to be his secretary of state, and dare the U.S. Senate to deny him his pick. The president should send an unmistakable signal to the GOP that he won't be bullied by anyone. He forcefully defended Rice in a news conference a week ago and publicly thanked her at this week's Cabinet meeting, but the ultimate sign of confidence -- and strength -- would mean forgoing the easy pick of U.S. Sen. John Kerry and daring them to stop Rice. Obama shouldn't be afraid to engage in a public battle with the GOP. To heck with the naysayers who say Rice is damaged goods. What's damaged is the logic of McCain, Graham, Ayotte and Collins, who look foolish every day with their remarks about Rice. Obama won. Romney lost. And before him, McCain. Now it's time for the president to make clear he has no plans to be an idle bystander in another attack on a member of his Cabinet. Mr. President, it's clear the GOP is itching for a fight going into the new year. So give it to them. And show them who is boss.

"(EW.com) -- One Direction dropped their new Ed Sheeran-penned single, ""Little Things"" — a followup to their hit ""Live While We're Young"" and the second track released from the upcoming Take Me Home — Monday, and as expected, there's nothing ""little"" about its online reaction. Though the official lyric video has only been live for a few hours, it has already received over 127,000 likes and 55,000 comments on YouTube, and as young girls across the U.S. wake up and check their Tumblrs, those metrics are only going to soar higher. Because of that massive, adoring fanbase of occasionally irrational Directioners, I realize what I'm about to write might not be especially popular, but I've got to be honest: this song is kind of messed up. Yes, it's a pretty, strummy offering that gives each boy his own solo (for the first time, every individual's voice is clearly recognizable), and yes, the stripped-back melody is rather lovely and characteristically Ed Sheeran-y, but it's the lyrics that I find troubling. I mean, just look at 'em: . ""I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes,"" sings Liam Payne during the second stanza of the song. ""You've never loved your stomach or your thighs / the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine / but I love them endlessly."" Later in the song, during Harry Styles' verse, he sings, ""You still have to squeeze into your jeans / but you're perfect to me."" Perhaps I'd hear those lyrics differently if Ed Sheeran had released this song for his own fans, but this is officially a One Direction song now, and there's something icky about the endlessly coiffed and tailored (not to mention athletically-built) boys delivering those words. Last I checked, One Direction's fans aren't composed mainly of aging obesity victims — they're little girls who range in age from about 8-14. At the older end of that spectrum are girls currently enduring middle school, who may very well be feeling insecure about their bodies. In that case, it seems terribly misguided (or at least ruthlessly conniving) to tap into that insecurity with ""Little Things"" and ask girls to find their validation in One Direction's blanket affection. But I could maybe see how people would find the words sweet. More troubling to me are the younger fans who listen to this song. The carefree 9-year-olds who nibble on fruit roll-ups on the way to gymnastics class. The ones who watch Good Luck Charlie before bed, getting one last year out of their Sleeping Beauty nightgowns. ""Little Things"" presupposes insecurity in order to be effective lyrically, but for all those happily naive fans that (thankfully!) aren't dealing with body image issues, One Direction literally provides insecurities for listeners to feel. But that's just part of why the whole pseudo-chivalrous ""You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you"" vibe feels so disingenuous. One Direction doesn't — they simply can't — love each of their fans as much as they say they do. Not in the way an insecure person needs to be loved to escape that awful cycle of self-reflection. They're an international phenomenon touring the globe and clinking glasses with the rich and beautiful, not psychiatric counselors. Their therapy by way of crooning is simply undercooked.

"(CNN) -- Jerome Kerviel, the man behind France's biggest rogue-trading scandal, lost his appeal Wednesday against his prison sentence for betting â‚¬50 billion (about $65 billion) of a French bank's money without its knowledge. The Paris court upheld the five-year sentence with two years suspended that was handed down in October 2010, Kerviel's lawyer, David Koubbi, said. The ruling means Kerviel will serve three years in prison. The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld. ""We had set ourselves the objective of defending Mr. Kerviel against an injustice that is absolutely lamentable,"" Koubbi said outside the courthouse, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV. ""We will continue to support Mr Kerviel in his fight."" Koubbi said the legal team would consider the possibility of an appeal in France's court of final appeal, the Cour de Cassation. Jean Veil, a lawyer for Societe Generale, told BFM-TV that he had ""great satisfaction regarding the court's decision to name Jerome Kerviel as solely responsible for the fraud."" The bank was pleased with the original conviction because it placed responsibility for the rogue trades on Kerviel and not the bank. If Kerviel's conviction were overturned, it could once more raise questions about the bank's role in the scandal. The bank had previously indicated it might not require Kerviel to pay the damages, as it would be an impossible sum to shell out even in multiple lifetimes. The former Societe Generale employee went on trial in June 2010 on charges of forgery, breach of trust and unauthorized computer use. The banks says the unhedged bets cost it almost $6 billion. Kerviel had pleaded guilty to the charge of computer abuse, but his attorney at the time, Olivier Metzner, had asked jurors in his closing arguments to acquit his client of the charges of breach of trust and forgery. Metzner previously told CNN that Kerviel's behavior was strongly influenced by the environment at Societe Generale. ""The banks are the ones to blame for the banking system and the systematic economic crisis, not Jerome Kerviel,"" he said. Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year. Koubbi lamented that ""despite the new elements added to his defense,"" Kerviel's appeal had failed. Kerviel traded European index futures for the bank. He was the only person ever charged in the case, despite claiming he did everything with the knowledge of his superiors. ""I am convinced the criminal file is full of elements proving that my superiors knew and covered for me. At least I shouldn't be the only one in the dock,"" he told CNN after the release of his memoirs, ""Trapped in a Spiral: Memoirs of a Trader,"" in which he pleads his innocence. ""These managers earned colossal amounts of money out of bonuses based on the ever-growing results that I was making for the bank,"" he said. Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam, Sybile Penhirin and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: Societe Generale says it has ""great satisfaction"" regarding the court's decision .

"(CNN) -- Nickey Van Exel, the 20-year-old son of former NBA player and current Atlanta Hawks coaching staff member Nick Van Exel, has been charged with capital murder in the shooting of a close friend, his attorney said. Van Exel was released on $25,000 bond, said Executive Chief Deputy Jesse Flores of the Dallas County Sheriff's Department. Van Exel is charged in the shooting of Bradley Bassey Eyo, 23, in the Dallas suburb of Garland. Eyo's body was dumped near Lake Ray Hubbard, authorities said, and had an apparent gunshot wound to the upper body. Police found the remains on Sunday and arrested Van Exel on Wednesday, authorities said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WFAA, Eyo's father said police told him that Van Exel said the shooting was an accident. ""They were playing with a shotgun, and when it went off on Bradley, he didn't know what to do, took his body and dumped it on the street,"" the father told WFAA. Authorities told reporters that they reviewed the case closely before making it a capital offense. ""If a person is making the assertion this was an accident -- you place the body in a vehicle and moved it to a second location -- that in itself, coupled with the fact that property is missing, makes this a capital murder,"" said Deputy Chief Craig Miller. A cell phone and shoes were the missing property, said Dallas police spokesman Kevin Janse. Paul Johnson, Van Exel's attorney, told CNN the shooting was the result of ""horseplay."" ""The young men were involved in a bunch of horseplay. They didn't believe it was loaded and, unfortunately, it was,"" Johnson said. ""Unfortunately, there was a tragic result to the horseplay."" The two men had been friends for years and were neighbors who lived across the street from each other, Johnson said. Van Exel does not live with his father, Johnson said. ""Everybody considered them to be like brothers,"" the attorney said of the two young men. When asked why Van Exel allegedly moved the body, Johnson said Van Exel went ""into a state of shock and panic."" ""When it occurred, there was no question his friend was deceased,"" Johnson said. Van Exel tried to call his family, but he ""couldn't get a hold of anybody,"" Johnson said. ""You are talking about a 20-year-old boy."" Van Exel and Johnson went to police and cooperated, Johnson said. Van Exel consented to have his home and vehicle searched, Johnson said. Johnson described the families of the two young men as close. ""There has been communication between the families since the incident,"" Johnson said. The elder Van Exel became player development instructor for the Atlanta Hawks in September after serving as an assistant coach at Texas Southern University, according to the Hawks' website. Van Exel, 39, played 13 seasons in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Portland Trailblazers and San Antonio Spurs, the website said.","Nickey Van Exel is son of ex-NBA player, current Atlanta staff member Nick Van Exel .

"(CNN) -- This week the 19th International AIDS Conference is being held in Washington. It is the ""state of the AIDS epidemic"" forum -- where researchers, advocates, social service providers, and people with AIDS from all of the world learn about advances in AIDS treatment, care and prevention. Twenty-six years ago I gave birth to my third child, Tiffany. Tiffany's first three years of life were a constant struggle of countless surgeries, misdiagnosis, feeding tubes and painful medical tests. My husband, Lenny and I took her to medical experts around the country. They all asked the same questions, but they could not provide answers or a cure for her illnesses. I still remember the pain in her eyes. When Tiffany was 2 years old, my husband Lenny became ill. He was tired all of the time, he had flu-like symptoms and began to lose weight. The cycle began again -- misdiagnosis, hospitalizations, tests and more encounters with doctors who didn't understand what was happening to my family. Prior to Lenny and Tiffany becoming ill, we were living the so-called American dream. Lenny had escaped the whirlpool of chaos in a community in New York decimated by drugs. He had been clean from intravenous drug use for more than 10 years. We got married, worked hard, saved our money, bought a home in the suburbs and raised our children. At that time doctors did not know or understand the latency of HIV, the modes of transmission, or the differences in HIV manifestations in men, women and children. Interactive: 30 years of AIDS moments to remember . When Lenny was finally diagnosed with AIDS, I witnessed a dramatic change in the quality of health care he received. His tray of food was left outside of his room; the doctors and nurses were less attentive. There were no treatment options for him at the time. Within days, Tiffany was given the same diagnosis, and the change in the type of care she received was just as obvious and even more painful. I was also diagnosed with HIV, but there was very little time to deal with that because my husband lay dying in one hospital, my youngest child lay dying in another hospital and there were two children at home who needed my care. Lenny died a few months after being diagnosed with AIDS. Within 6 months, Tiffany died too. I was 29 years old. I spent the next months putting things in order to ensure that my two remaining children, Alana and Shawn would be taken care of. I began to lose weight. Every time I had a fever or a bout of diarrhea I thought that I was going to die. I had two frightened children and I could not break down in front of them. I would cry in the closet in my bedroom to keep them from hearing me. I was distraught because I would not see Shawn and Alana grow up, graduate from school, or get married. I missed Lenny and Tiffany. I couldn't understand why they died and I was still alive. The days became months and even years. I lived my life in fear and dread, waiting to die. For years I believed the media hype that women were not being infected with HIV/AIDS. I thought I was the only one. I was so lonely that I decided to reach out. I posted a flyer in a hospital seeking other women with HIV/AIDS to come to a support group at my home. To my surprise, within days the telephone began ringing off the hook. I would get phone calls late at night from young girls and women -- some were in their hospital beds, others isolated in their homes, too afraid to disclose their HIV status to anyone. Within weeks, the support group became so large, it outgrew my living room and we began to meet in the basement of a church. There were professional women, teachers, physicians, secretaries, bus drivers. I began to go with women to their doctor's appointments, advocating that they receive the appropriate care. Women needed so much, but our stories were not being told; we were not the face of AIDS. Women needed shelter from abusive husbands, they needed clothes and food for their children or they just needed someone to talk to. We shared our stories of frustration about not finding services and support for women living with HIV/AIDS. Gay, bisexual black men at high risk for HIV . Women talked about physicians who refused to treat them or who did not know how to treat the different manifestations of HIV/AIDS in women. Women talked about having their HIV status disclosed in public places. We talked about other things beyond HIV. We talked about love and we laughed a lot. Even as we lost our friends, we didn't talk about dying. We talked about learning to live with HIV. In less than two years, the support group became a nonprofit organization called The Women's Collective. In 1996, it provided services to 50 women in the District of Columbia, which has one of the of the highest incidence of HIV in the country. The core of our mission is peer-based, woman-focused and family-centered. Back then, I worked full-time and I was able to get enough funding to hire a part-time person. Today the Women's Collective has 20 full-time staff and a host of volunteers. We provide a wide range of services including case management services, helping women find health and other types of services. The goal is to keep woman in care. We provide AIDS-prevention education, counseling and testing services, and therapeutic counseling services. Women and their children can come in and use our computers for schoolwork or work on a resume. They can come in and get hot food. We have a food and clothes pantry so they can take stuff home. Our AIDS prevention education services reaches more than 3,000 women and young girls in schools, social service agencies, churches, and hospitals. We have shared our model of care with women from around the world, including Africa, Russia, India, Brazil, Caribbean and Eastern Europe. The staff and the women we serve also participate in policy advocacy at the local and national level. It is empowering because we are literally fighting for our lives. Women with HIV/AIDS and their families face so many challenges. The only way to address our needs is to take our concerns to the policy makers and service providers who are supposed to serve us. During the last four months, the Women's Collective has been preparing for the International AIDS Conference in Washington and I have been thinking about how much -- and how little -- things have changed over the last 26 years. Over the years, I have been able to access treatment because I have the resources. But unfortunately many people still don't have the resources necessary to access treatment and care. They are also struggling with homelessness, hunger, and lack of employment. What is often overlooked at these conferences is the impact of the stigma and social isolation associated with an HIV diagnosis, especially for women and children. Twenty-six years ago I was afraid that if people learned about my diagnosis, my children would be marginalized and we would be shunned by my community. Pastor fights HIV stigma in rural town . As recently as 2011, a school in Hershey, Pennsylvania, denied admittance to a 13-year-old honor student because he is HIV-positive. Twenty-six years ago, Lenny and Tiffany were misdiagnosed by several physicians at hospitals across the country. In 2012, women served by TWC continue to share the same stories of being misdiagnosed or not receiving the most appropriate standards of HIV care. Years ago, treatment options were limited. Today, there are more treatment options, but access to these treatments continue to be a huge problem due to budget cuts to the Ryan White Care Act and Medicaid. Twenty years ago there were waiting lists for life-saving AIDS drugs. Today people are yet again being placed on waiting lists. AIDS organizations, especially community-based organizations, face tremendous budget cuts. AIDS is no longer the ""hot"" topic and funding for AIDS programs across the country is being reduced. The sense of urgency has dissipated. Over the next few days of the conference, I am sure I will learn a lot that will give me hope. I have been blessed to see my children Shawn and Alana graduate from college and graduate school. I am now a grandmother with a brilliant 2-year-old grandson! Some days I struggle with a range of medical issues, but I am thankful to be alive. Every day I think about Lenny and Tiffany. I remember all of the wonderful, brilliant, friends lost throughout the years. I mourn the loss of Towanna and several women that we served at The Women's Collective, who lost their battle to AIDS last month. I look forward to the day when I don't have to add any more names to the list of lives lost. This week, several newspapers and magazines have declared that the AIDS epidemic is over.

"(Financial Times) -- A US appeals court has put on hold a New York judge's order for Argentina to pay $1.3bn into escrow for holders of its defaulted debt by December 15, quelling fears of an imminent default. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals granted the stay and set a hearing for February 27. There was no immediate reaction from the Argentine government. Last week, Judge Thomas Griesa of New York ordered Buenos Aires to make the escrow payment at the same time as it is due to pay more than $3bn to holders of restructured debt. The government had requested the stay in an emergency motion filed late on Monday and has since floated the idea of asking congress to lift a so-called lock law in order to reopen a debt swap to holdout creditors led by the US fund Elliott Associates, but with a tough writedown. The holdouts refused debt swaps in 2005 and 2010, which restructured about 93 per cent of the almost $100bn on which Argentina defaulted in 2001. The government is barred by law from making them any better offer. ""We are waiting for the appeals court decision. Until there is a decision on the matter, we have nothing to add to what we have said in recent days,"" Hernán Lorenzino, the economy minister, told reporters hours before that court ruled. The court said Argentina must now file papers by December 28. Amicus briefs and papers from other interested parties -- including holders of restructured debt led by Gramercy and including Brevan Howard, one of the world's biggest hedge funds -- are due by January 4. The Elliott-led parties then have until January 25 to make their case and Argentina has until February 1 to reply before the hearing. After December, Argentina's next payment on its restructured bonds is due in March. ""The Second Circuit's order signals its understanding of the serious constitutional and equitable issues at stake,"" said Sean O'Shea, a lawyer for the exchange bondholders. ""The stay issued late today ensures that the exchange bondholders will receive their rightful payments through December, and the court can carefully consider the significant issues and interests that are involved before rendering its final ruling."" President Cristina Fernández had earlier said Argentina would keep paying. ""When the swap was last opened, we reached 93 per cent acceptance. We have paid on time since 2005, without access to the [international] capital market, with our own resources. And we are going to continue to do so because we are going to honour our commitments as befits a country which has recovered its self-esteem,"" she told an industrialists´conference also attended by President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil. Argentina's suggestion that it could reopen the swap again was greeted enthusiastically by political and business leaders at home. Analysts say it is a belated concession to ""vulture funds"", to whom the government has until now vowed never to pay a dime. But it is not one that will necessarily sway the court, let alone the ""holdouts"" who spurned the two previous offers. Nor is it likely to resolve an intractable dispute that threatens to trigger a new default. Indeed, on Tuesday Fitch Ratings slashed Argentina's sovereign credit rating five steps to CC from B on ""increased probability"" of a default. Adam Lerrick, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) think-tank and former chief negotiator of the Argentine Bond Restructuring Agency, the nation's biggest creditor in the 2005 swap, said: ""Simply reopening the exchange is unlikely to satisfy the court's concerns. The holdouts will not accept a reopening. A reopening is simply a way to show that the holdouts have not been disenfranchised of their rights."" Argentina passed the lock law at the end of 2004 to twist bondholders' arms to accept a tough restructuring in 2005 that offered about 30 cents on the dollar. Holders of about three-quarters of the almost $100bn on which Argentina defaulted in 2001 took the ""haircut"". But with a chunk of debt still outstanding and increasing holdout litigation, Argentina suspended the lock law at the end of 2009 and reopened the exchange. After two good-faith offers, the government considered the holdouts history. Ms Fernández said a ruling that did not take account of the 93 per cent was ""absolutely inequitable"". She said Argentina had become a ""countermodel"" to the International Monetary Fund´s recommendations ""in a world in which financial capital and its derivatives have set themselves up as masters . . . and want to punish us¨. Miguel Kiguel, an economist, said talk of lifting the lock law was ""obviously coming a bit late. . . They only did it now because they´re on the ropes"". If Argentina does end up having to pay the holdouts more than the restructured creditors, it could trigger more litigation. But as Mr Lerrick noted: ""The 'most favoured lender provision' of the new bonds expires on December 31 2014. From January 1 2015, Argentina can settle with the holdouts without any obligation to pay additional amounts to the exchange bondholders."" © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","President Fernández has said Argentina would keep paying ""as befits a country which has recovered its self-esteem""

"Tyenna Valley, Tasmania (CNN) -- Like many I have been anxiously waiting the outcome of the Tasmanian ""forest peace talks."" But unlike most, I have done so 200 feet (60 meters) above the ground, perched at the top of an old growth tree whose fate depends upon them. A tree I climbed 10 months ago and vowed not to leave until the forests were protected. And then on Saturday the news hit -- the talks had collapsed. The two years of talks between environment groups, unions and industry representatives failed to find the resolution to bring the industry out of crisis and protect Tasmania's high conservation value forests. No deal means clear-felling of old growth forests is set to continue. The tree that has been my home since December 14 last year is a part of 572,000 hectares at the center of the debate. Verified by scientific experts to be of world heritage value, it should have have been on its way to formal protection. And I should have been on my way out of this tree and into a long hot bath! Unfortunately the forestry industry had other ideas, digging in its heels when it came to final crunch. Neither the science nor the economics seem to have won out. The Tasmanian forestry industry is in crisis and being propped up by tax payer funds. There are some who may want to put their heads in the sand, but we cannot go on ignoring today's market realities of a worldwide trend towards environmentally friendly products. From my tree top platform, I have Skyped my way around the globe, speaking to thousands of people. And the message is clear, people don't want to buy furniture and flooring made from the destruction of endangered species habitat, community water catchments or globally significant carbon sinks. The failure of the talks has created uncertainty for the future of the forests here. And with it, uncertainty for me. With no end in sight, who knows how long it will be before I set foot on the ground again? I have already become the Australian record holder for the longest time spent in a tree, after I reached 209 days back in July this year. I hope, for the sake of the forests, that I will not need to break the world record held by Julia Butterfly Hill, who sat for two years in a Californian Redwood. 'Himalayan Viagra' takes its toll on Nepal's environment . In the upper branches of this 400-year-old tree I have endured high wind, snow, hail and extreme conditions. It's been a tough winter, that's for sure. And the weather isn't the only challenge. Living on a three meter platform suspended in the tree tops adds difficulty to every daily task that I once took for granted. No turning on the tap for hot water or going to the shops if you run out of milk! I have to bathe in a small bucket. And I haul up everything I need on a long rope, relying on support from the community for donations of food and supplies. Luckily support has flooded in, from all walks of life, locally and internationally. The many people who visit the base of the tree to say thank you have been overwhelmingly inspirational. And it has helped me get through what is the hardest part of this experience -- the loneliness of being separated from my loved ones. Yet, no matter how challenging, there are constantly moments when I am awe-struck by the beauty of this forest. The coating of snow across the forest in winter, the star speckled skies of summer nights or watching endangered wedge-tailed eagles soar in the skies above. I have watched the seasons come and go. And with it, new life in the forest. Conservationists placed hidden cameras in the forest below, capturing footage of a mother Tasmanian Devil, the day before logging began. This iconic Australian species is listed as endangered in both federal and state legislation. Luckily, the media spotlight from my action had the loggers packing up and leaving after a week, giving these young devils a chance of survival. In February 2012, to our delight, footage was taken of the juvenile devils exploring the world. Sadly, with the collapse of the talks, logging of their habitat could begin again any day now. Autumn color around the world . Many people ask my why I am willing to sacrifice everything in my life, give up my chance to spend time with family and friends, and put my career as a high school teacher on hold, in order to sit in a tree. But when I look around me at this unique and irreplaceable ecosystem the answer is simple: I sit in this tree because from here I believe it is possible to save this forest once and for all. Of course, it takes more than one woman perched 60 meters above the ground; it takes an international community. And I have been able to share my story with the world, powered by solar panels and blogging about my tree top life. I hope my action will be a catalyst, inspiring others to say no to wood products that come from unsustainable forestry practices. And say yes to the protection of the world's globally significant forests. Despite the cloud of uncertainty that now looms over the future of these forests, I am one hundred percent committed to staying in this tree for as long as it takes to see this forest receive the protection it deserves.

"(CNN) -- A massive supply of gunpowder totaling 6 million pounds (2,700 metric tons) was found improperly stored in Louisiana's Camp Minden, not far from where an explosion occurred two months ago, authorities said. A weekend operation to remove the stockpile will likely extend until Tuesday, CNN affiliate KSLA reported. The town of Doyline, population 820, remains evacuated. Louisiana State Police said the M6 smokeless gunpowder was found during a follow-up inspection after an October 15 blast at Explo Systems, Inc. The explosive materials were found ""in the open and in other unapproved locations"" on property leased by Explo, police said. Authorities initially estimated a stockpile of 1 million pounds of gunpowder before police personnel and Explo employees began moving the supply. ""The Louisiana National Guard has been instrumental in making available additional magazine storage space for the propellant,"" Louisiana State Police said. According to Explo's website, the company has been demilitarizing and recovering explosives and propellant for more than 15 years. Camp Minden is home to a Louisiana National Guard training site.

"(CNN) -- The brief but bloody Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas marks a clear wake-up call to both sides, and their supporters, on the indispensable need to start serious talks beyond the new cease-fire. This development must be seized upon to convert the recent crisis into an opportunity after years of inaction. A desperate injection of diplomatic energy is required. The alternative is renouncing responsibility and initiative to continuous unpredictability, and becoming its hostage. In an increasingly volatile region experiencing historic transformation and shifting alliances, the potential for simultaneous conflict on multiple fronts remains real. Are you affected by the conflict? Share photos and video, but stay safe. Diminishing the threat, and its catastrophic consequences, through a credible process is critical to regional stability and international order. The cease-fire alone simply marks the end of another chapter in the decades-old vicious cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Ideally, a next phase of negotiations should focus on a permanent end of hostilities. Although its duration would be unknown, it is best to commence sooner rather than later. The regional status quo is simply unsustainable in the long-term. Time is of the essence. A continuing game of brinksmanship risks miscalculation and another descent into the abyss at any given moment. After all, there is no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conundrum. Tallying the results of the recent conflict leaves adequate room for each side to claim points and some form of victory. However, neither could benefit from further escalation. For Israel, its Iron Dome anti-missile defense system proved increasingly effective. Its surgical strikes in Gaza demonstrated greater accuracy. Although no match for Israel's superior firepower, Hamas's rockets reached alarmingly deeper into Israeli territory. This provided a psychological boost to morale despite relentless Israeli attacks and considerable physical damage. Post-conflict reconstruction is nothing new: Hamas will emerge politically strengthened at home and abroad and it will continue to overshadow Fatah, which controls the West Bank. The credibility of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is further undermined, even as he actively pursues non-member observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations. The presence of intermediaries in Cairo to negotiate the cease-fire reaffirms the centrality of Egypt's role to any peace process. Clearly, without Egypt, no solutions are possible. For now, the cease-fire also marks the most important foreign policy test and achievement yet for new Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. Since Hosni Mubarak's ouster and its departure from Syria, Hamas remains increasingly dependent upon Egypt ideologically, politically, diplomatically and economically. Throughout the week-long conflict, Morsy skilfully influenced Hamas. Furthermore, sending Egypt's prime minister to Gaza at the very start of the crisis proved symbolically important, although practically ineffective. Through the cease-fire, Morsy has raised his standing at home and abroad. A process of establishing himself as a reliable regional broker has begun. However, responsible continuity and critical follow up is required. Statements alone will not suffice. In concrete terms, he must prove able to restrain Hamas when necessary and guide it on a constructive path toward peace. Sustained diplomatic support from the Arab League and Turkey, and particularly financial assistance from Qatar, will further strengthen Morsy's hand. The increased leverage from positive crisis management must be used effectively by Morsy at home. While he is developing a pragmatic accommodation with the military, serious concerns still linger for political opponents and minorities of his broader agenda. Morsy must reach out beyond his political base and take a more inclusive approach. The crisis also underscored the need to strike a balance between public expectations, particularly in Islamist ranks, and what is realistically achievable in the diplomatic realm. While in opposition during the Mubarak era, Islamists scored easy points with public opinion when condemning government inaction during Israeli-Palestinian violence. Now the reality of power demands greater rhetorical responsibility and restraint from Islamists in government. The current cease-fire also offers President Morsy the opportunity for renewed, and closer, engagement with the U.S., particularly after President Barack Obama's election victory and Morsy's initial blunders following the killing of America's ambassador to Libya. With the U.S. election over, the burden is also on President Obama to assume a more proactive role in fostering a productive peace process, in collaboration with allies and regional powers. Obama's first attempt immediately following his 2009 inauguration ended in humiliation at the hands of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Although once bitten, Obama cannot be twice shy. American national interests and international order cannot afford it. With a drastically transforming Middle East and in search for a foreign policy legacy, Obama must seize the historic opportunity for a new start. There is no room for reluctance or excessive caution. Troubles with Iran and Syria cannot be obstacles to a Palestinian state. Furthermore, the growing perception of exclusive American interest in east Asia and neglect and indifference to the Middle East is very destabilizing. It creates an increasingly dangerous power vacuum and encourages nefarious forces to fill it. Obama's penchant for re-start buttons should not lose focus on the Middle East, and particularly Egypt. Approximately two months away from election, the cease-fire was the best possible outcome for Israel's Netanyahu. He emerges politically stronger and brandishes his leadership credentials as the guarantor of Israel's security. Averting a ground invasion was crucial. He exits the crisis with ample support in the West and avoided greater international isolation. However, the regional game has dramatically changed for all players. Netanyahu no longer enjoys Mubarak's passive acquiescence in Egypt or a reliably predictable enemy like President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. New realities require new approaches. Failure to adapt will have considerable consequences for Netanyahu and Israel. Ultimately, a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue is not a panacea to the ills plaguing the broader Middle East. However, it would provide indispensable momentum and unleash new dynamics in confronting other outstanding grievances around the region and beyond.

"London (CNN) -- The father of the Pakistani teen whose love of learning led the Taliban to shoot her expressed gratitude Friday for the help she has received. ""Last night when we met her, there were tears in our eyes and they were out of happiness, out of happiness,"" Ziauddin Yousufzai told reporters at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham the morning after reuniting with his 15-year-old daughter, Malala. Malala was flown to the British facility on October 15 -- six days after being shot in the head at point-blank range while on her way home from school. Yousufzai described his daughter's survival as a ""miracle for us"" and choked up as he recalled having started at one point to think about planning her funeral. ""She is not just my daughter, she is the daughter of everyone, she is the sister of everyone,"" Yousufzai said, speaking a day after he, his wife and two sons arrived in Birmingham, England, to see her. Yousufzai spoke of how Malala had become an education rights activist at an early age, and in so doing had become an international symbol of courage. He said he is ""thankful to the media of Pakistan ... because it is very difficult to stand by a girl who stands up against terrorism. ... They were warned by the terrorists but still they kept on supporting my daughter."" Malala: Symbol of global fight for education? He also expressed gratitude to the British and Pakistani governments, the latter of which is paying for her treatment. And he thanked medical teams in both countries for the care they have provided. ""She got the right treatment, at the right place, at the right time,"" he said. Yousufzai, who was accompanied at the news conference by Malala's 12-year-old brother, detailed the days since Malala was shot in her hometown of Swat. She was initially taken to an area hospital, then transferred to a hospital in Peshawar and on to Islamabad, undergoing surgery to remove part of her skull so that her injured brain could swell unimpeded. By the time Malala was flown to Britain, doctors had placed her in a medically induced coma. ""She was in a very bad condition,"" her father said. ""She is lucky to be alive,"" Dr. Dave Rosser, the medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham, told reporters. But he described Malala's prognosis as ""excellent."" She does not appear to have suffered significant brain damage, he said. ""There's no real areas of concern, at this stage,"" he added. He said she is tired, but ""managed a big smile"" when she saw her family. The teenager is able to breathe on her own, her father said. Rosser said Malala can walk ""with very little help, just a nurse's arm on her elbow for support, and she ""appears to have very good memories of both the last few days of her care and events prior to this incident,"" he said. But he said hospital staffers have not asked the girl about the shooting itself. ""Asking people to relive the memories increases the chance of post-traumatic stress,"" he said. On Friday, the girl was to undergo blood tests and tests on her hearing and vision, ""just to make sure that we're not missing anything,"" since the bullet entered her skull above her left eyebrow, he said. Pakistan college renamed in honor of Malala . Rosser said an infection that had troubled doctors last week has cleared. Once Malala has regained strength, doctors will reconstruct her skull either by replacing the fist-sized piece of bone that they removed in Pakistan, or with a titanium plate, Rosser said. In addition, doctors may operate on her jaw, he said. ""She shouldn't need to be in hospital for more than a few weeks, maybe a couple of months at the most,"" he said. Malala has been thinking about school during her recovery, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family Thursday. ""The mission she has taken forward and the education awareness that has spread across Pakistan is all Malala's doing,"" he said, according to PTV. ""Our entire nation should be proud of her love for the soil of her country."" When Malala returns to Pakistan, he said, ""we will provide her with complete security, despite anyone's refusal, to ensure that something like this never happens again. The attack on Malala was a mindset of people who don't want to see this country progress."" Rosser said he would not discuss any security precautions the hospital may be taking. Arrests made in Malala shooting . The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the shooting in the conservative Swat Valley but don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke. Thousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere have attended rallies and vigils honoring her courage and praying for her recovery. Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, writing a blog about her life as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan.

"(CNN) -- Two Iranian warships have docked in Sudan carrying ""a message of support and friendship,"" Sudanese state media said. The ships arrived in Port Sudan on Sunday and will stay until Wednesday, according to SUNA, the official Sudanese news agency. The presence ""clearly shows the solid support of political and diplomatic relationships between the Sudanese and Iranian navies,"" the agency quoted Sudanese army spokesman Savarmi Khaled Saad as saying Monday. The warships arrived less than a week after a weapons factory in Khartoum was bombed, killing two people, in what Sudanese officials said was an airstrike by Israel. Sudan blames Israel for weapons factory blast . Israel has declined to comment on the attack in the east African country. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing last Tuesday. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday condemning what it called ""a brutal assault carried out by the State of Israel"" on the Yarmouk Industrial Complex, SUNA said. It also dismissed suggestions that the weapons factory was manufacturing arms for Iran or its allies, denying ""any link between the Sudanese military manufacturing output and any external party,"" according to SUNA . The statement accused Israel of using ""misleading leaks"" to the media to allege that the factory had ties ""to the states of Iran and Syria and to the Islamic Resistance Movement in Palestine (Hamas), and to Hezbollah in Lebanon."" Iran has no need for weapons to be manufactured in Sudan, the Foreign Ministry statement insisted. That assertion was repeated Monday by IRNA, Iran's state-run news agency. Iran last week condemned what it also says was an Israeli airstrike on Khartoum, and it called the strike a clear violation of international laws, according to the news agency. An Iranian flotilla that left Iranian waters in September included a navy helicopter carrier and a destroyer, IRNA reported. It ""aimed to echo the message of peace and friendship to the neighboring states and guarantee security of the seafaring and shipping lines vis-a-vis sea piracy,"" the news agency said.

"London (CNN) -- John Terry, one of England's biggest soccer stars, was found not guilty Friday of racially abusing fellow soccer player Anton Ferdinand, ending a high-profile trial in London. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said of Terry: ""No one has been able to show that he is lying."" Reading his ruling, Riddle said it was a crucial fact that no one heard what Terry said. Terry, the Chelsea captain, sat impassively in the courtroom as the verdict was read out at Westminster Magistrates' Court. It was greeted by cheers from the public gallery. What's your reaction to the verdict? Have your say on iReport . Riddle said he accepted it was possible that Terry himself thought Ferdinand had accused him of using racial abuse. But he also said he considered it ""highly unlikely"" that Ferdinand had accused Terry of calling him a ""black c---."" Terry, who has received strong backing from Chelsea Football Club throughout the trial, left the court without addressing the public or media. A statement issued on behalf of Terry by his legal team said he had been acquitted of all charges. ""He did not racially abuse Mr. Ferdinand and the court has accepted this. John would like to thank his legal team for their hard work and his family, friends and Chelsea Football Club for their support,"" the statement said. Chelsea's chairman, Bruce Buck, welcomed the verdict, saying: ""We at Chelsea are pleased that John Terry can now put his mind back to football."" The football club also said it respects the magistrate's decision to clear Terry. ""We are pleased that John can now focus on football and his preseason preparations with the team,"" it said in a statement on the official Chelsea website. The English Football Association, which could still open its own disciplinary proceedings against Terry, said it noted the court's verdict and would ""now seek to conclude its own enquiries."" Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for London, defended the decision to bring the case to trial. ""The very serious allegation at the heart of this case was one of racial abuse. It was our view that this was not 'banter' on the football pitch and that the allegation should be judged by a court,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""The chief magistrate agreed that Mr. Terry had a case to answer, but having heard all of the evidence he acquitted Mr. Terry of a racially aggravated offense. That is justice being done and we respect the chief magistrate's decision."" The weeklong trial, during which the normally staid chambers got an earful of shockingly foul language, gripped the British press. Terry, who was captain of the England national team at the time of the incident, was accused of calling Ferdinand, who plays for Queens Park Rangers, a ""f------ black c---"" as the pair traded insults during a game last October. Terry did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as ""black,"" but he denied engaging in racist abuse. He told the court that he was repeating what he mistakenly thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of UK football's anti-racism campaign, Kick It Out, said it would wait to hear the conclusions of the Football Association with regard to the Terry case. ""It will be interesting to hear from other organizations this will impact on, from governing bodies to leagues and clubs, and how they deem matters like this to be dealt with in the future,"" he said in a statement. Terry was stripped of his England captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February.

"(CNN) -- In 2009 the first underground cable linking Africa to high speed internet access went live. The 17,000km long network took two years to complete and came with the promise of boosting the region's industry and commerce. Three years later millions of Africans now have access to the internet - primarily through 3G services on their mobile phones. Mobile data offers the most affordable access to the web, and figures from the International Telecommunications Union show 31 million Africans now have mobile broadband subscriptions. There's no denying the African internet economy has come a long way. But building a sustainable internet infrastructure across a continent of one billion people continues to present major challenges, especially when it comes to connecting rural towns and villages. In large urban areas there are lots of ways to get people online, via traditional terrestrial technologies. In remote regions, where communities are often cut off, it's much more difficult for mobile operators to backhaul 3G data affordably. So how do you overcome this connectivity challenge? It seems the answer lies, not with the cables below our feet, but with the skies above. ""For communities that are really isolated the only reasonable choice is satellite,"" said Terry Neumann the Corporate Marketing Manager for satellite communications firm iDirect. ""Mobile operators are looking to new and different technologies for ways to connect a larger population base -- the chance to connect the unconnected."" iDirect says a growing number of mobile operators are using advanced satellite technology to distribute 2G traffic, and are also discovering it's a viable option for working with more complex data like 3G. The service is already being gradually rolled out in countries including Nigeria and Kenya. But is it more cost effective than traditional methods? Until recently the majority of internet coverage had been provided from marco-cells - large electrical base stations, made up of tall lattice towers laden with transmitters and receivers. They provide coverage to anyone within a 35 mile radius, but they're expensive to run. Companies like iDirect are promoting an alternative - small-cell technology, which allows mobile operators to backhaul data from sites, no larger than the average satellite dish. It's the ideal solution for mobile operators to reach remote and rural areas, and has been welcomed by Peter Lyons, the Director of Policy for the Africa and Middle East branch of the GSMA, an organization which represents mobile operators worldwide. Lyons says broader internet coverage, will not only connect disengaged businesses and families, but will provide access to educational resources and basic amenities like banking. ""Ultimately, increased mobile connectivity translates into GDP growth and job creation in previously under-served areas. For example, broader mobile coverage provides an opportunity for the mobile industry and the financial sector to collaborate to deliver affordable financial services to millions of previously unbanked customers."" Of course the logistics of connecting millions of rural Africans is not the only problem that needs solving. Even if 3G internet is available in remote towns and villages, will locals be able to afford it? 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter . Peter Lyons says mobile companies should prioritize driving down prices in order to make 3G access accessible for as many Africans as possible. But he says governments are also accountable. ""They have a really important role to play,"" he added. ""Governments across Africa are now prioritizing the removal of all taxes on devices and import duties that artificially inflate prices. ""For example, the 2009 removal of a 16 per cent VAT on handsets in Kenya saw a 200 per cent increase in devices sales and an increase in mobile penetration from 50 per cent to 70 per cent by 2011."" Terry Neumann admits that initially the cost of 3G, and the handsets required to run it, will remain prohibitively high for average Africans. But as connectivity spreads, and client bases expand, costs will eventually drop. ""The type of services they get will tie into what they can afford. If you're talking about spending $2/3 a month to get access to services, probably not. ""But if you're talking about the $10/15 range then yes that could get you access as costs continue to go down. ""The costs today will be very different to the costs in five years.""","Figures show 31 million Africans now have mobile broadband subscriptions .

"(CNN) -- A Coast Guardsman died Sunday after a ""suspicious"" boat rammed his small vessel off the coast of Southern California, an official said. Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne was one of two Coast Guard members thrown off their cutter's small boat when the suspect's panga-style vessel ""suddenly increased speed and maneuvered directly"" at them, then struck the boat, said Capt. James Jenkins. Having a traumatic head injury, Horne was pronounced dead by emergency medical personnel upon his arrival on shore at Port Hueneme. ""Chief Petty Officer Horne was an outstanding Coast Guard member,"" Jenkins said. ""And he gave his life in service, enforcing the laws of this nation."" The crew of a Coast Guard patrol aircraft spotted the panga-style boat near Santa Cruz Island, suspecting ""it was engaged in illegal activity,"" said Jenkins, who did not elaborate on the type of activity. A panga is a work boat often used off the coast of Mexico or Central America that is engine-powered and typically 25 to 45 feet in length, the Coast Guard captain explained. The aircraft's crew alerted the captain of the Cutter Halibut, an 87-foot patrol boat, which headed to the scene and noticed the panga ""operating with no lights."" A small boat was dispatched from the Halibut and headed closer to the suspect vessel. Then, the panga accelerated and hit the small boat, forcing Horne and another Coast Guard member overboard. Two Coast Guard colleagues on the same small boat ""quickly"" recovered their shipmates, and all four boarded the Halibut as it headed to the nearest port. The other Coast Guardsman tossed overboard was treated and released later Sunday morning from a hospital after suffering ""relatively minor injuries,"" Jenkins said. The panga boat fled the scene but was later interdicted by a different Coast Guard boat and helicopter, he added. Two people were then detained, the Coast Guard said in a news release, without specifying any charges. ""The Coast Guard, along with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state and local level, are actively working to make sure all of the individuals who are involved with this illegal activity are brought to justice,"" Jenkins said.","Coast Guardsmen spot a suspicious panga boat near Santa Cruz Island, California .

"(CNN) -- Longtime men's college basketball coach Rick Majerus, who led Utah to the NCAA final in 1998, died Saturday from heart problems. He was 64. Majerus recently left Saint Louis University, where he had coached for the past five years, for health reasons. ""Nobody loved basketball and teaching kids more that Rick,"" Billikens interim head coach Jim Crews said in a statement. ""His passion for the game and the coaching profession was unparalleled. Rick was a true friend and was always there when needed. I, along with so many others, am going to miss him."" Majerus had ongoing health problems for years, dating back to his days as Utah's coach. Saint Louis director of athletics Chris May said the Billikens team was informed Saturday afternoon that Majerus' condition was deteriorating. The school announced November 19 that Majerus would not return to coach because of his heart condition. In 25 years, Majerus coached at four schools, taking 12 teams to the NCAA tournament. He had just one losing season. His record was 517-216, which included two 30-win seasons and 15 20-win seasons. Majerus got his start at Marquette as an assistant to Al McGuire. He was at Marquette from 1983 to 1986 and then at Ball State from 1987 to 1989. The apex of Majerus' career came at Utah, where he went 323-95 from 1989 to 2004. In 1998, he led the Utes to the NCAA championship game, losing to Kentucky. Three of Majerus' players at Utah were NBA draft picks -- including Keith Van Horn as the No. 2 overall pick in 1997. ""Rick left a lasting legacy at the University of Utah, not only for his incredible success and the national prominence he brought to our basketball program, but also for the tremendous impact he made on the young men who were fortunate enough to play on his teams,"" Utah Director of Athletics Chris Hill said in a statement. ""His standard of excellence extended beyond the basketball court and into the academic and personal success of his players. He will be deeply missed and we grieve for his family and all of his friends."" During Majerus' final stop, at Saint Louis, the Billikens went 95-69 under his tenure. Last season, Majerus led Saint Louis to the round of 32 in the NCAA tournament. It was the program's first NCAA tournament win since 1998. ""Coach Majerus put his heart and soul into the Billiken program, and for that we will be eternally grateful,"" May said in a statement. ""What I will remember most about Rick's tenure at SLU was his enduring passion to see his players excel both on and off the court. Wins and losses meant a lot to him, but no more than to see our student-athletes succeed in the classroom. He truly embraced the term 'student-athlete,' and I think that will be his lasting legacy.""","""Nobody loved basketball and teaching kids more that Rick,"" Saint Louis coach says .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Nine bodies -- eight of them burned -- have been pulled from vehicles crushed in a tunnel collapse about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Tokyo, highway police said Monday. The disaster has prompted Japanese authorities to order emergency checks on dozens of other tunnels across the country that have a similar design, as questions were raised about whether aging parts may have contributed to the collapse. Five of the bodies were recovered in one charred station wagon, and three others were in another burned vehicle, according to a police spokesperson. The other fatality was in a truck. The Sasago tunnel on the Chuo Expressway remained closed Monday morning, one day after the cave-in occurred on the highway's Tokyo-bound lanes, police from the nearby city of Otsuki said. Japanese highway police said Monday that the section of concrete that fell was 110 meters (360 feet) long, Earlier, officials from the East Yamanashi Fire Department said it was about 50 to 60 meters (160 to 200 feet) long and about 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick. ""Cars in front of us were crushed. It was terrifying,"" a man who witnessed the collapse told CNN affiliate TV Asahi. ""I don't think I could ever drive through the tunnel again,"" he said. Soon after the collapse, Japanese public broadcaster NHK aired images showing smoke rising, a blue car with its side smashed in, and emergency vehicles on the scene. Crews worked through the night as snow fell outside, trying to get to victims. All the while they were wary that the tunnel might collapse further. The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism said it had ordered emergency inspections of about 49 tunnels nationwide that have a ceiling structure similar to that of the Sasago tunnel. The privately held Central Nippon Expressway Company operates the 4.7-kilometer-long Sasago tunnel, among others, as well as expressways and toll roads around Japan. Some of the bolts on the on the fallen concrete slabs had dropped off, a company executive, Ryoichi Yoshizawa, said at a news conference Monday in Nagoya. ""The aging of the bolts or the concrete slabs could be a potential cause,"" Yoshizawa said, according to company spokesman Takayuki Ohmasa, who relayed the comments. Yoshizawa told reporters that company maintenance teams had carried out regular visual checks on the ceiling that collapsed but had not done physical checks, like knocking on the bolts and slabs. The Chuo Expressway is a particularly busy stretch of highway that runs between Tokyo and, among other places, Mount Fuji. While it is a distance from the Japanese capital, the partial tunnel collapse and its subsequent closure are expected to cause major traffic disruptions, especially for those who rely on the expressway for business. Authorities have not given any indication of when they expect the tunnel to reopen. Are you there? Share you stories, videos and images. Journalist Toshi Maeda in Tokyo contributed to this report.","Aging parts in the tunnel's structure could be a cause, a company official says .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt ambled into the semifinals of the 100m Saturday as the capacity crowd at the London Olympic Stadium had their first glimpse of the Jamaican superstar. Bolt, who is defending his 100 and 200m titles, made a slow start but eased ahead of his heat rivals to win in 10.09 seconds. The 25-year-old world record holder has been receiving treatment for hamstring and back problems but there was no sign he was hampered by injury. ""I am feeling good, my legs are feeling good so I am happy. I am training well so I feel like I'm back. My start was good, I am only focused on the semifinals tomorrow,"" he told BBC Sport after his win. Bolt's Jamaican rival and training partner Yohan Blake won his head in 10 seconds dead. The 2011 world champion beat Bolt in both the 100 and 200 at their national trials and is considered a real threat to his hopes of repeating his 2008 Beijing triumphs. The third Jamaican hope, Asafa Powell, won his heat ahead of young British star Adam Gemili, while American Tyson Gay came through with a comfortable 10.08 seconds clocking. Gay's United States teammates Ryan Bailey and Justin Gatlin were the quickest qualifiers from earlier heats. Bailey clocked a blistering 9.88 seconds, while 2004 Olympic champion Gatlin sprinted to victory in 9.97 seconds, returning to the Games after serving a four-year doping ban. But another likely finalist, Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis, the 2003 world champion, failed to turn up for his heat. He later tweeted that he had been dropped by his country after going to see his wife at a hotel. ""This can't be right. Olympic number 5 and no Kim Collins. I hope there is an officials race."" The early times indicated that the track was suitable for fast times and Bolt's world record of 9.58 seconds could come under threat in Sunday's semifinals and final. Saturday's qualifying races also saw 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius finish second in his 400m heat to qualify for the semifinals. The South African, who runs with carbon fiber prosthetic 'blades', is the first amputee to compete in the Olympics. He is also due to compete in the 4x400m relay. But American defending champion LeShawn Merritt hobbled out of his heat, clearly troubled by the injury that hit him in the build up to the Games. Grenada's world champion Kirani James and Belgium's Jonathan Borlee, who set a national record of 44.43 seconds, impressed in their heats. o .","Usain Bolt wins 100m first round heat in his first race at 2012 Games .

"New York (CNN) -- The crowd of festival goers at a holiday market in New York City's Columbus Circle Friday seemed to support the message city tourism officials have been spreading far and wide: The Big Apple is open for business and welcoming its usual influx of holiday visitors. Superstorm Sandy's wrath a month ago will cost New York state $41 billion, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, but tourists have largely been unfazed by the storm, which caused very little damage to Midtown Manhattan, the hub of the city's magical holiday attractions. That's no doubt a relief to those who wondered if tourists would be skeptical about visiting the Big Apple after the storm brought the city to a standstill at the end of October. ""Absolutely not,"" said Michigan visitor Kelly Coll, 48, who has traveled to New York this season for the last 14 years with friend Tiffany Moen, 46. ""The storm did not affect our plans at all,"" Coll told CNN on Friday afternoon. In fact, New York City is on track for a record number of tourists this year, according to George Fertitta, CEO of NYC & Co., the city's marketing and tourism association. The tourism association estimates there will be around 52 million tourists this year, up from last year's 50.9 million. ""Ninety-five percent of all of our hotels, attractions, restaurants and transportation are completely back to normal,"" Fertitta said. ""For all intents and purposes, visitors should not feel deterred from coming to New York. NYC is open for business."" Some tourists say media coverage of recovery efforts in the city encouraged them to make and keep plans to visit. ""I was not skeptical at all because of everything I had seen on television,"" said Roger Archut, 30, a first-time visitor from Germany. Storm damage in New York City was portrayed as ""under control."" John Murphy, 54, visiting from Ireland with his wife, shared a similar story. Coverage of the storm indicated to him that the area most crucial for holiday attractions, Midtown, home to Fifth Avenue and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, was ""well maintained."" New York City hotels are running and fully prepared for the holiday rush of tourists, officials say. ""Hotel occupancy is strong and there have been no cancellations due to apprehension from Hurricane Sandy,"" said Lisa Linden, spokesperson for the Hotel Association of New York City, representing just under 300 hotels in the area. Yet just because tourism is expected to reach an all-time high this year doesn't mean some businesses aren't hurting in the aftermath of the storm. At the southern tip of Manhattan in the hard-hit Financial District, Harry's CafÃ© & Steak, a popular eatery with visitors during the holiday season, still struggles. ""There has definitely been a decrease in business,"" owner Peter Poulakakos told CNN on Friday. Many restaurants rely heavily on the holiday season for a huge portion of their yearly income. ""Get the word out that we are here and ready to serve!"" Poulakakos said. Despite declines, many remain hopeful that business will pick up in the coming weeks. ""The one to two weeks before Sandy were very hard because many tourists didn't want to be here during the storm,"" said Diancoumba Mamadou, who works for Pedicab NYC, a business almost completely reliant on tourism. ""But thankfully, now it is beginning to get back to normal and hopefully will continue on that path."" If the record-breaking estimates from NYC & Co are any indication, that path will certainly continue.","NYC tourism officials say the city is on track for a record number of visitors .

"(CNN) -- As a tech reporter, it's my job to catch trends as they're developing — to be ahead of the curve. I like to think I do a pretty good job, but I will forever have one hilarious black mark on my resume. My first tweet. ""I am already kind of over Twitter,"" I wrote on April 5, 2007. Twitter was a new service back then, and I had signed up early enough to get a pretty cool username. Frankly, I didn't think much of it since it seemed like a mild update to the IM status messages I'd already been using to communicate with my friends for years. Boy, was I ever wrong. Twitter has grown from being an insider back channel for tech nerds into being the insider back channel for the entire world. It is everywhere at once and everything to everyone: a public broadcast platform, a private messaging service, a way to share photos, a late-night therapy session, a journalist's best friend. We expect people to be their most honest on Twitter — and that honesty can spark firestorms of controversy. Opinion: Twitterers -- take responsibility for your reckless claims . Television executives say that Twitter has brought live TV back to life after years of wilting in the face of the DVR — we're ""social watching"" now, which means we all want to tweet about shows as they're happening. Celebrities use Twitter to talk to their fans without media and publicists in the way — and their platforms can be so valuable that they can earn thousands of dollars per tweet. Every journalist I know says Twitter has redefined the way news is gathered and shared — stories break on Twitter now, not on TV or in the newspaper. I have a friend whose cell phone is set up to get a text whenever Britney Spears tweets. I worry about her, but not as much as she worries about Britney. Since Twitter is where the people are, that's where the politicians and world leaders have gone. The pope just signed up for a personal account, and his first tweet is coming on December 12. Senators and representatives of both parties have long made use of Twitter to talk to their constituents on an unfiltered platform — sometimes with disastrous results, as Anthony Weiner found out when he accidentally posted a private message publicly. President Obama took to Twitter during the campaign season and again on Monday to rally support for his fiscal policies. Obama's use of social media during the campaign highlighted his significant tech advantage over Mitt Romney. But the president seemed to mostly use Twitter to acknowledge that he knows Twitter exists; he said very little of substance in his eight tweets during Monday's ""town hall."" We'll know Twitter has truly come of age as a political medium when our presidents use it to disseminate substance, not just show off that they're in the know. Interesting dramas regularly unfold on Twitter. Last year the terrorist group Al-Shabaab gained notoriety for setting up a Twitter account. More recently, the Twitter accounts of Israel Defense Forces and Hamas began a war of words as the two sides began fighting each other on the ground. Human tragedy turned into theater on the Internet. The episode drew scrutiny from Congress, with seven Republican members of the House calling on the FBI to shut down Hamas' Twitter account. ""Allowing foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas to operate on Twitter is enabling the enemy,"" said Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. He continued, ""The FBI and Twitter must recognize sooner rather than later that social media is a tool for the terrorists."" Actually, Congress can't tell Twitter what to do under the First Amendment, but the company will face increasing scrutiny as its user base grows — and for the level of control it can exert over free speech in a private platform. Twitter faces numerous other challenges as well in the years ahead. The company might be a central part of Internet conversation, but it still has to figure out how to make money. Those struggles have led Twitter to exercise more and more control over its service as it tries to slowly transition from being just a platform to being a media company — control that's angered a developer and user community that literally made Twitter what it is today. The @-reply, the hashtag, even the now-ubiquitous pull-to-refresh gesture: All these came from members of the Twitter community, and Twitter risks missing out on similar innovations as it imposes its own vision of the Twitter experience. Tech: Will Twitter war become the new norm? And make no mistake, the backlash against Twitter is real. Spurned developers and early Twitter adopters angry at Twitter's new policies have turned to the alternative service App.net, which promises to hold true to Twitter's own early ideals. The catch? In order to make money, App.net charges a subscription fee, a guarantee that it will never be as vibrant and free-wheeling as Twitter. That sense of anarchy and openness and chaos is what makes Twitter important — what makes it the town square and a freshman dorm room and an international conference call all at once. The challenge for all of us is figuring out how to best turn such a tool into more than just noise — and the challenge for Twitter is figuring out how to make money without chilling the vibrant expression that makes it so vital. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nilay Patel.","Nilay Patel: Twitter used to be for tech nerds, now it's for the entire world .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans offered their own proposal Monday in the heated battle to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, but it was quickly rebuffed by President Barack Obama's administration for not demanding more from the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. The GOP plan promises $2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade, including $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. House Speaker John Boehner called it a ""credible plan that deserves serious consideration by the White House."" The move follows spitting back and forth in recent weeks, with each side claiming the other isn't sincere about striking a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January, a scenario many economists say would hurt the U.S. economy. Senior Obama administration officials slammed the Republican plan, calling it a step backward in negotiations and not worthy of its own counteroffer because it isn't serious enough. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers . White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized it for not meeting ""the test of balance."" Another Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, earlier said the president ""will not sign a bill that extends those tax rates for the top 2%,"" as the GOP proposal would do. ""Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won't be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit,"" Pfeiffer said. Republicans make budget counter-offer . Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote -- which Boehner has so far prevented -- on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010. In line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign, Obama's deficit-reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant cut of a $4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal. In addition to adding a $50 billion stimulus package, his proposal closes loopholes, limits deductions, raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love . Yet Republicans, led by Boehner, have objected to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. They have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health-care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Their plan offered Monday proposed $800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes. The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010. ""This is by no means an adequate long-term solution, as resolving our long-term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform,"" the letter said. ""Indeed, the Bowles plan is exactly the kind of imperfect, but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs."" GOP, break Grover Norquist's grip on you . In his response, Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal ""includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve."" ""Independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires,"" he said. And Bowles denied any direct connection to the GOP proposal, saying it reflected his view of a middle-ground approach a year ago but ""circumstances have changed since then."" ""It is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today,"" Bowles said. Recent posturing on both sides -- such as Boehner saying this weekend he was ""flabbergasted"" by Obama's plan -- reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left Congress with a reputation for dysfunction. 5 ways you would stop the fiscal cliff . In 2011, Republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling, a fight that contributed to a U.S. credit rating downgrade. The end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis, which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of $1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement. Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released last week, 56% of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower-income people, while 36% said taxes should be kept low to create jobs. Listen: WWJD...about taxes? Another survey, by ABC News and the Washington Post, showed two thirds of respondents support Obama's call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest Americans. So what happens next? Senior Obama administration officials said Monday the GOP's plan was a nonstarter, primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2% income bracket and was too short on specifics. But even with no more offers officially in the works, both sides will keep talking, the officials said. That may happen as soon as Monday night, when all members of Congress are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to, among others, the president himself. Defense companies see cuts coming even with a budget deal . CNN's Ashley Killough, Adam Levy, Deirdre Walsh and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","House GOP leaders call for some revenue increases, more spending cuts .

"Washington (CNN) -- Fire-protection systems on freight aircraft are inadequate, top U.S. aviation investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended improvements and rule changes Wednesday based on investigations of three catastrophic cargo plane fires. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require better early detection of fires inside cargo containers, development of fire-resistant containers and requiring active fire-suppression systems on all freight airlines. An NTSB report focused on three cargo fire accidents since 2006. Two of those fires killed the flight crews and destroyed the aircraft, in incidents in Dubai and North Korea. In the third incident in Philadelphia, the crew escaped with minor smoke-inhalation difficulties, and the plane was significantly damaged. ""These fires quickly grew out of control, leaving the crew with little time to get the aircraft on the ground,"" Hersman said in a statement released with the report. ""Detection, suppression and containment systems can give crews more time and more options. The current approach is not safe enough."" FAA budget cuts would affect fliers . In all three cases, the fires started within the cargo containers aboard the planes, but by the time the plane's fire warning system alerted pilots to the dangers, there was little time for them to react. Federal regulations require cargo airline fire detection systems to alert pilots within one minute of a fire starting, but the NTSB's investigation found current systems detected fire and smoke anywhere from two and half minutes to more than 18 minutes after the fire started. The NTSB concluded cargo containers made of flammable materials significantly increase the intensity of the on-board fires because there's been little focus by manufacturers or regulators to develop fire-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, the NTSB's report recommended improved fire suppression systems on cargo planes, a recommendation it originally made to the FAA in 2007. After the 2007 recommendation, the FAA did a cost-benefit analysis of upgrading fire suppression systems and found it to be too expensive, a fact the NTSB highlighted in its report. ""The two catastrophic cargo airplane fires that occurred in less than a year occurred after the FAA's cost-benefit analysis concluded that the installation of fire suppression systems was not cost-effective,"" the board said. UPS briefed Hersman earlier this week on the shipping company's efforts to develop improved fire safety standards. Also, FedEx is in the process of installing a fire suppression system on its long-haul fleet, the NTSB said. In an e-mail statement to CNN, FAA officials said the agency ""has long supported improved fire protection on all cargo airplanes through research on new, non-Halon fire extinguishing agents, fire suppression systems directed at individual cargo containers or specific cargo compartment zones, and advanced cargo containers incorporating smoke detection, fire containment, and/or fire suppression systems."" FAA officials said they would carefully evaluate the NTSB's recommendations.

"(CNN) -- A young boy in Kansas was among millions in America who watched the horrifying news this past weekend about the Chinook that went down in Afghanistan's Wardak province. That boy in Kansas soon found out that his father, a U.S. Army pilot, was aboard the doomed helicopter. In the midst of his world shattering, he could not understand why the Navy SEALs drew so much attention. There were 30 Americans on board that Chinook. Why wasn't anyone mentioning his father, a chief warrant officer with Bravo Company, 7th Battalion, 155th Aviation Regiment? So he sent in a photograph to CNN's iReport of his dad, Bryan Nichols, sitting with four of his Army buddies in front of a military aircraft. ""My father was one of the 30 US Soldiers killed in Afghanistan yesterday with the Seals rescue mission,"" he wrote. ""My father was the pilot of the chinook. I have seen other pictures of victims from this deadly mission and wish you would include a picture of my father. He is the farthest to the left."" He signed his name, Braydon Nichols, said he was from Kansas City and that he was 10 years old. In one day, the post was viewed almost 20,000 times. Bryan Nichols' aunt Sue Keller of Palco, Kansas, said Monday that Braydon, Nichols' only son, was stung by the way the news of the deadly Afghan incident played out on the airwaves. ""They always say Navy SEALs. They never say my dad,"" Braydon told his family. The iReport post was the only consolation, perhaps, for a boy who was counting the days before his father came home. There were just nine left before Bryan Nichols, 31, was to fly home to Kansas City for a two-week leave. Nine days and he would have been back on a motorcycle. Nine days and Braydon might have watched a baseball game again with his dad. Or shared his excitement about starting fifth grade. Bryan Nichols and Braydon's mother were divorced but father and son were close, Keller said. When Nichols remarried, he had a little Army uniform made for Braydon to wear at the wedding. Like father, like son. The two had stayed in touch via Skype since April, when Nichols was deployed. Brayden missed his dad terribly, Keller said. A reunion will never take place after the deadliest day for Americans in the nearly decade-long Afghan war. Keller said Nichols parents and his wife were at Dover Air Force Base to collect the remains Tuesday. After the funerals, this weekend's tragedy will begin to fade from American consciousness. But not for a little boy in Kansas who will grow to manhood without his dad.","Braydon Nichols, 10, sent in a photo of his father to CNN's iReport .

"(CNN) -- Contraband alcohol is believed to have sickened at least seven Arizona inmates, who are receiving antitoxins for suspected botulism poisoning, officials said Tuesday. Pinal County communications director Heather Murphy said inmates began showing symptoms at the Arizona State Prison Complex Eyman in Florence. Four inmates become seriously ill Saturday. By Monday, seven inmates were in intensive care, all suffering from some form of paralysis, officials said. ""It is suspected that the inmates came in contact with the toxin from homemade prison 'hooch,' made from fermented fruit,"" said Murphy. An eighth inmate was transported for observation, but Murphy said ""his condition has not reached a threshold that the medical team and CDC believe antitoxin should be administered."" The affected pod houses about 15 inmates. Pinal County and state corrections officials were working to isolate and eliminate the source of the suspected botulism. Samples of the suspected contraband alcohol, often called ""pruno,"" have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control of Prevention for testing. Results may take about a week. According to the CDC, botulism is ""a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin"" and can be fatal. Symptoms can include ""double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness"" in patients. Bill Lamoreaux, a spokesman for the state corrections department, said preventative measures will include educating prisoners about the dangers of contraband alcohol and searches to ensure it can't be manufactured or consumed. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","Inmates become ill at Arizona state prison .

"(CNN) -- After divesting from luxury brands purchased in Europe, the Ford Motor Co. is revamping its Lincoln car line to try to recapture the prestige -- and market share -- of the past. ""We had purchased Aston Martin and Jaguar and Landover and Volvo, and we had decreased our investment in Lincoln,"" Ford CEO Alan Mulally told CNN's Richard Quest. ""With our One Ford Plan in 2006, we decided to have a laser focus not only on the Ford brand but Lincoln. We continued to invest in the toughest times and the MKZ is our first proof point of a new line of luxury Lincoln vehicles."" Ford announced Monday it is renaming its Lincoln division as the Lincoln Motor Co. Lincoln is not being spun off into an altogether separate carmaker, notes CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena, but Ford wants to give it greater separation from the more mass market Ford ""blue oval"" brand. Lincoln have has its own product development team, designers and salespeople. The all-new MKZ is due to hit the market soon. ""As you know the Lincoln has been part of the Ford Motor Co. for nearly 90 years and its always been known for elegant styling and design, inside and out, and also very useful and exciting technology and innovation,"" Mulally told Quest. Ford was able to avoid the bailouts required to keep U.S. competitors General Motors and Chrysler afloat after an aggressive restructuring that began in 2006, before the financial crisis struck. But the carmaker has been hit of late by the slowdown in the eurozone. The company announced in October the closure of two plants in England and one in Belgium in the next two years, which together employed 5,700 workers. ""We are moving very decisively on our better plan to serve the European customers both with a more complete family of best in class vehicles that we describe, but also taking the actions on the productivity and the utilization of our facilities,"" Mulally said. ""It's going to take us a couple years to do that, we know how to do it, everybody watched us do it in the United States.""

""I might also add that we are very encouraged by the ongoing dialogue in Europe on the same subject, because clearly we're in a recession in Europe and pulling together around a compelling vision to facilitate economic growth is what's most important for all of us.""","The Ford Motor Co. is revamping its Lincoln car line to try to recapture past prestige .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- How much would you pay to get your child into an Ivy League university? For Gerard and Lily Chow, it seems the sky was the limit. In 2007, the Hong Kong couple enlisted Harvard-lecturer-turned-admissions-consultant Mark Zimny to steer their two sons through elite U.S. boarding schools into a top-ranked university-- preferably Harvard. For a monthly $4000 fee per child, their ""total education management"" package included extensive admissions counseling, arranging homestays, private tutoring, and extra-curricular activities, whereby Zimny and his team functioned as ""parents away from parents"" for their sons. The Chows later switched to a retainer of $1 million per child. But in 2010, before their sons applied to university, the Chows sued Zimny to recover their $2 million retainer, alleging fraud, breach of conduct, and unjust enrichment, according to court documents. Zimny denied any wrongdoing to CNN, alleging the Chows sought to end their relationship after ""poaching"" one of his contract staff as a cheaper replacement. Admissions consultants say the Chow case is an anomaly, both in terms of the amount the couple paid and the assurances Zimny allegedly made. But it highlights the strong appetite among the wealthiest in Hong Kong for elite U.S. education and the nebulous role that a burgeoning flock of consultants play in the process. Hong Kong is the 16th leading place of origin for international enrollment at U.S. colleges and universities, according to the International Institute of Education, with its students increasing 1.3% to 8,136 in the 2010-11 academic year. ""When people are looking at the U.S. education system, it's seen as one of the best in the world,"" said Susan Joan Mauriello, an American who moved to Hong Kong in 2005 and quickly identified admissions consulting as a business opportunity. ""Everybody was talking about top U.S. colleges-- it was clearly something that was very important to a lot of people, something that was very well-respected,"" she added. ""Especially when you send your children to the U.S., you want them to develop critical and creative thinking skills,"" she explained, adding that an American degree is seen by Hong Kongers as providing ""increased opportunities for their children throughout the rest of their lives."" Since setting up her firm, Mauriello said a wealth of new or expanded consultancies have cropped up, particularly ones offering comprehensive packages that not only encompass preparation for the standardized admission exam (SAT), but also services like tutoring and debate training. Some consultancies, such as Capstone, begin grooming students as early as in eighth grade (around ages 13-14), giving them ""a well-built resume that doesn't spike in their final year (before entering university),"" said Capstone's founder, Ronald Po. ""Before as an admissions consultant (in Hong Kong), you could work part-time and do it out of Starbucks. Now most companies have a full-time staff, they have their own offices, and it's all-year-round support,"" Po said, citing his annual client base as growing from four to up to 40 students. Affluent Asian families view elite U.S. education as a form of conspicuous consumption and are willing to ""throw money at it,"" Zimny said, describing his clients as ""the 1% of the 1%."" Case in point: Gerard Chow is a member of the family that owns the Chow Sang Sang jewelry empire in Hong Kong. Most parents who seek Capstone's services are investment bank partners, lawyers, or entrepreneurs, Po said, quoting fees of $6,450-$19,350 for a one-year package. Mauriello said her clients have varying income backgrounds, but they all prioritize their children's education. She quoted her average yearly fee as $3,225-$7,750. While international students may genuinely need help navigating the unfamiliar terrain of the U.S. application process, the Chow case raises the specter of the unscrupulous consultant-- in an unregulated profession. The U.S.-based Independent Education Consultants Association (IECA) denounced Zimny as a ""con artist,"" describing the monthly $8,000 fees for the two Chow sons as approximating ""what should be a single fee, over a multi-year period, to work comprehensively with a student."" It pointed out that Zimny's communications with the Chows ""were all about 'getting in,'"" saying that success should be measured by a student's university experience, not admission. ""The thing I worry about consultants is they can do a lot of work in terms of writing essays and it's unethical,"" said Rachel Rubin, a lecturer at Emmanuel College in Boston who specializes in higher education admissions policy. ""But it's good if they're helping students find a good fit and what they want in a college, rather than how can we game the system to get into the school we want?"" Harvard was even less enthusiastic. ""While it is certainly possible that in individual cases an admissions consultant can be helpful to an applicant, we have encountered no evidence to indicate that is the case generally,"" said spokesperson Kevin Galvin. Mauriello said competition for places at top schools had become fierce. ""Students, who ten years ago would have gotten into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, might not be able to now,"" she said. To gain an edge, some wealthy applicants offer donations to boarding schools and universities, consultants said. In their lawsuit, the Chows claim Zimny convinced them that elite schools unofficially expected donations from foreign applicants. Through their lawyer, the Chows declined to comment on the pending case. While donations are ""not an absolute requirement,"" Zimny told CNN, they are a ""common practice"" that can pivotally influence boarding school and university admissions. E-mails submitted to the court reveal extensive discussions between Zimny and Loomis Chaffee boarding school officials over the 2007-08 academic year, regarding the wealth and likelihood of donations from the Chows. Boarding schools conduct ""intensive screening of applicants so they can assess who has the potential to donate money once the child is admitted, and then the development directors work feverishly to court the constituencies,"" Zimny said. Loomis Chaffee denied conducting ""financial screenings of any applicants except for those applying for financial aid, although on occasion we become aware of a prospective family's history of or capacity for philanthropic support,"" according to its director of development, Tim Struthers, who exchanged numerous e-mails with Zimny. Zimny said he also personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to Loomis Chaffee to ""advance the prospects"" of the Chow sons -- as well as his future clients. He added that these donations were factored into his $250,000 ""extraordinary admission fee"" charged in successful cases that required extensive lobbying. While Struthers confirmed that Zimny made several gifts to the school, he said they were unrelated to the Chow sons, adding that ""no donation or promise of donation was made to Loomis Chaffee by the Chows or Mr. Zimny on their behalf, as part of the admission process."" He said donations were neither common nor pivotally influential in admissions decisions. In March 2008, the Chow sons were admitted to Loomis Chaffee -- a decision Struthers said was merited, given their ""academic records, extracurricular involvement, and leadership potential."" Zimny attributed their admission to his donations, saying that the sons' secondary school admission test scores (SSAT) were weak. He said he had stopped working with the Chow sons before they applied to university. Zimny said his services can also include brokering introduction meetings between potential donors from Asia and development officials at U.S. universities, adding that schools welcomed these introductions as a way of fielding multitudes of donation requests. In his view, ""Money is money, whether it's coming from a random family in Hong Kong or a fifth-generation Whitney applying to Yale."" He added that donations have to be presented ""in a way that doesn't look like quid pro quo."" Consultant Susan Joan Mauriello disagreed, saying she has heard of donations making a significant difference in admissions decisions only in ""development cases,"" which involve families with multiple generations of alumni that have made significant donations over the years. Harvard declined to comment on whether donations influence admissions decisions. The IECA said ""no educational consultant will act as a middleman for donations to a school,"" adding that consultants ""will put the family directly in touch with a university's development office and donations would be made directly."" But the appetite among Hong Kong's elite for getting their offspring into top universities is unlikely to fade. ""The way to differentiate yourself is ""that one line on your resume that says what university you came from,"" Capstone's Po said. ""That's one of the few elements that sticks with you for the rest of your life professionally.""","Hong Kong couple suing admissions consultant to recover US$2M retainer .

"(CNN) -- Private-aircraft manufacturers are increasingly targeting Africa's growing economies as the resource-rich continent is quietly emerging as an important hub in global business aviation. In a continent where commercial routes are often limited, a growing number of smaller, privately owned planes are now taking to the skies, creating new connections in and out of Africa. Driven mainly by entrepreneurs and wealthy individuals involved in the natural resources, banking and telecoms sectors, the continent's burgeoning market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. ""Africa is an emerging market where we see a positive future,"" says Robert Habjanic, sales director at plane manufacturer Bombardier Business Aircraft. ""Over the next 20 years, we do forecast 810 business jets to be sold into Africa."" The sector was given a big lift in May with the creation of the African Business Aviation Association (AfBAA), the continent's first initiative bringing together aircraft operators and other industry players to support their interests and promote the benefits of business aviation. AfBAA founder and chairman Tarek Ragheb says that Africa requires a well-developed business aviation industry to support the continent's flourishing economies and realize its business potential. He describes Africa as ""China in our backyard,"" a continent with tremendous amounts of resources that is, however, being hampered by steep infrastructure challenges. ""If you have a requirement for an NGO or an entrepreneur or a government agency to be able to conduct its business, the options of using rail or a good highway are simply not there,"" says Ragheb. ""So for the growth of the continent there must be an ultra-efficient means of travel and that is where business aviation could come in."" Read related: Low-cost airline in Africa by easyJet founder . For Ragheb, improving intra-African connections is key to the development of the continent. ""Flying out of Africa is not difficult,"" he explains. ""You can go from Lagos to London, you can go from Kinshasa to Belgium, that's not a problem -- the challenge is intra-Africa flights. And you find that for African growth you're going to need intra-Africa flights and this is where the focus [of AfBAA] is going to be."" Business aviation expert Alan Peaford says that only 20% of flights in the continent are with African airlines, the remaining 80% being with international carriers. ""What this means is that if you have a cement factory in three or four countries, you may have to travel from country A to country B via Paris, London or Dubai rather than direct,"" says Peaford, editor-in-chief of Arabian Aerospace magazine and online news service. ""Hence, as greater investment from China, Saudi etc. leads to more industrial development, owners, investors and managers need to be agile and not waste days on what should be a three-hour flight,"" he adds. ""So business jet usage is growing."" Read related: Bringing the Dreamliner to Africa . Although exact figures about corporate aircraft in Africa are notoriously difficult to find, the AfBAA puts the number of business jets in the continent between 400 and 600. These planes are typically owned by high net-worth individuals, wealthy investors, as well as governments and corporations. And not surprisingly, the biggest growth is recorded in countries where there is an abundance of natural resources. ""Africa's rich in gas, minerals, oil, gold, platinum, you name it,"" says Ettore Poggi, managing director of South Africa for ExecuJet Aviation Group, which offers services including corporate aircraft charter, mangement and maintenance. ""We're finding a lot of interest from overseas companies, focusing their attentions on the resources of Africa. Clearly, that bodes well for us because it means we have to take those people to these places in Africa."" While South Africa remains the traditional dominant player in the market, other countries have also started to make significant strides. In Nigeria, the continent's biggest oil producer, the business aviation market is growing at a rapid pace, industry insiders say. ""In the last 18 months we've grown by over 200% in terms of travel,"" says Segun Demuren, chief executive and founder of Evergreen Apple Nigeria, a fixed-based operator offering various services for private-aircraft users. Demuren says that Evergreen, which began operations in July 2011, is doing ""75 to 80 movements [flights] a week"" and is targeting a 50% growth for next year. ""I'm very sure we'll meet that instantly,"" he says. Read related: Africa's daily commuting grind . Although the conditions for the market's expansion are certainly there, there are still infrastructure, policy and logistical challenges that the industry needs to navigate if it is to meet its full potential. In many cases, entrance, exit and over-fly legislation varies from country to country, leading to significant delays. Other issues include landing permits and airport fees as well as maintenance support and pilot training and licensing. Ragheb says that a common set of standards needs to be adopted throughout the continent ""so that you have the ability to fly into Africa with a sense of security, that you know that safety and the procedures are all in place."" But first of all, he says, needs to come a true ""understanding and acceptance"" that business aviation can be a valuable asset for Africa's growth. ""It's a real business tool,"" he says. ""When you bring business aviation and you let it flourish in your country, you're going to attract those investors that are going to equal money and development and projects."" Analysts say that a thriving business aviation industry can only be good news for commercial air travel as well. The arrival of the industry in a country is a good indicator of its growth potential, Peaford says, acting as a strong incentive for commercial airlines to step in and establish new routes. ""Watch where the business aviation is going,"" he says. ""You can see the countries where business aircraft are going to and often you're going to see the commercial airlines going there, about a year, 18 months later. ""It's always 'watch the business jets' first, that's where you follow the money.""","Africa's business aviation market is expected to grow significantly .

"London (CNN) -- For a few days, Lockitron looked like the little app that would, and should, but then couldn't. Lockitron, which enables doors to be unlocked through a smart phone, was rejected by Kickstarter in October. It was turned away for being a home improvement product, which the funding platform does not support. But then Lockitron went ""DIY"" on its own crowd-funding. In one day, orders hit $500,000. They are now sitting at $2.2 million, the equivalent of more than 15,000 units. Read more: 'Father of the internet': the case for online freedom . Lockitron creators Cameron Robertson and Paul Gerhardt were both University of Colorado students -- studying history, economics and finance, and computer science respectively -- when they started playing with inventions. When they came up with Lockitron, the response was enthusiastic. ""People gravitated toward the doorlock [idea]. People lose their keys, keys are copied, you don't know if a number of keys are out there ...they are a lot of inconvenience,"" Robertson told CNN. The two, both 25, had worked on a ""shoestring budget"" -- around $10,000 to $15,000 -- and a year's worth of time to fund their creation, which first released in May 2011. Looking back at that time, Robertson says they discovered that ""oatmeal for breakfast is wonderfully filling, and wonderfully cheap."" The two ""kept living like college students, frugal college students."" Feedback was ""incredibly positive"" and when they showed the product off at a party full of Silicon Valley investors, the warm reaction provided market validation, he added. Read more: Why aren't robots doing my dishes yet? They turned to Kickstarter as the ""perfect venue"" to fund the project. ""We sent our application in, thinking that in short order we'd be approved but that's, of course, not how it turned out."" After being rejected ""we went through the stages of grief and sadness pretty quickly because we didn't have time to deal with it,"" Robertson says. Ten days later, the pair's own crowd-funding system was up. ""We had no idea what to expect in terms of traffic,"" Robertson recalls. ""[We thought] if we shot for $150,000 in 30 days we might be able do it ...and we had no other option."" He credits Kickstarter for ensuring Lockitron had a well produced video, needed as part of the application process, which became a YouTube hit. ""It had just the right mix of excitement, and explanation of the product,"" Robertson says. ""It captured people's imaginations in just the right way."" Angel investors injected a ""few hundred thousand"" into the project last year, allowing Lockitron to launch its second, more streamlined version. The first version required the app, which needs to be signed into, to be tapped to open the door. The upgraded Lockitron senses the person's proximity to the door and unlocks it once you are in range. It also allows people to unlock their doors from afar, ensuring guests are able to get in. It works with wifi and bluetooth, sending a signal to a physical block attached to the Lockitron owner's door. If the phone is lost, the owner needs to sign out of the app for security beyond the phone's log-in code. It works on a conventional U.S. deadbolt, which make up 60% to 65% of the market, and sells for $179. Robertson said the company hopes to eventually expand Lockitron into UK locks and beyond. ""The timing was right for this sort of product because people have become so used to their smartphones and using apps, that it was a natural extension they should have an app for the key as well,"" Robertson says. ""A lot of people see the hardware and think that's what we've done but [Lockitron] is the combination of hardware and app and software,"" Robertson added.","Lockitron is an app that enables doors to be unlocked through a smart phone .

"(Mental Floss) -- The men's NCAA Division I hoops championship game is tonight, and we can't tell you whether UConn or Butler is going to win. We can predict two things, though. The winning team will cut down the nets. And CBS will show a highlight montage set to the song ""One Shining Moment."" Let's take a look at the origins of these traditions. Who's responsible for college teams cutting down the nets after big wins? North Carolina State coach Everett Case didn't realize he was starting a trend in 1947. He just wanted a souvenir. USAToday's Michael Gluskin wrote a terrific piece on the origins of college hoops' net-cutting tradition in 2005. According to Gluskin, Coach Case was so delighted with the Wolfpack's Southern Conference title win that he decided to cut down the nets as souvenirs. Of course, being a pioneer can be tough. Since Case was the first coach to cut down the nets, arena workers didn't have a ladder at the ready for his big moment. Instead, his players had to hoist their coach onto their shoulders as he did his snipping. Case might not have been the true inventor of the net-cutting tradition, though. While he deservedly gets credit for being the college coach who popularized the net-cutting ritual, some sources -- including Tim Peeler's ""Legends of N.C. State Basketball"" -- claim Case actually brought the tradition with him from Indiana, where he'd been a hugely successful high school coach before coming to Raleigh to coach the Wolfpack. Either way, cutting down the nets may have remained an obscure Hoosier State tradition had Case not brought the practice to the national stage. Mental Floss: Who invented the Gatorade shower? What about the other big postgame tradition, the tourney highlight montage set to ""One Shining Moment""? Glad you asked. Any hoops fan can tell you that the song is pretty cheesy and more than a little over-the-top. It's also one of the best parts of CBS' annual coverage of the Final Four. Where the heck did ""One Shining Moment"" come from, and why do we only hear it once a year? To be fair, there are really only so many opportunities to play a slightly sappy song about basketball. Peter Hyman of The New York Times wrote a profile on David Barrett, the composer of the tune, in 2007. The song is actually the product of an ill-fated attempt to woo a woman. In 1986, Barrett was an unknown 31-year-old folk singer when he went to a bar in East Lansing, Michigan, to watch a Boston Celtics game. When a beautiful waitress sat down next to him after her shift, Barrett decided to spark conversation by chatting about Larry Bird's hoops abilities. Believe it or not, the singer's ploy didn't work. Barrett told Hyman that he resolved to write a tune that could show the waitress who snubbed him just how beautiful basketball could be. The next morning he wrote the song on a napkin in 20 minutes. Mental Floss: College bowl game economics . The song might have faded into oblivion as one of the odder ""I'll show them all!"" pipedreams a folk singer has ever had. Barrett had a well-placed buddy, though. Journalist Armen Keteyian had been a high school classmate of Barrett's, and he passed a demo tape of the song around to network producers. CBS liked the song and bought it for use in a highlight package it planned to air after Super Bowl XXI. (Yes, the iconic hoops song was very nearly a football song.) The package didn't make the final cut when the broadcast ran long, but the network revived it following the 1987 Final Four. The package with ""One Shining Moment"" was a huge hit, and CBS has kept it around ever since. Barrett provided the vocals for the original version of the song, but some big names have belted out the tune since. Teddy Pendergrass took over vocal duties for a few years in the 90s before Luther Vandross recorded his own version. Jennifer Hudson sang the song for last year's championship package, but fans roundly criticized her version. (It's worth noting, though, that fans were mostly irked that producers had inserted so many shots of Hudson in the highlight montage; nobody's debating that Hudson's a tremendous singer.)

"(CNN) -- It's been nine months since pop music superstar Whitney Houston passed away, but her legacy continues to live on via television musical tributes, a recently released Greatest Hits compilation, the DVD release of her final film work, ""Sparkle,"" and a critically panned reality show starring her family members. ""These projects are just some of the things that are a continuation of her legacy,"" said her sister-in-law/manager, Pat Houston. ""They're showing Whitney in a very beautiful light. For the past 10 years or more, it has been very turbulent with the media and her personal life."" In the time leading up to her death, negative media attention plagued Houston, who was one of the best-selling artists of all time. A new book of photographs aims to shine a more positive light on her legacy. Released last week, it's called, ""Whitney: A Tribute to An Icon."" Curated by acclaimed photographer Randee St. Nicolas, the oversized book features over 130 images of Houston captured by 22 world-class shutterbugs: Patrick Demarchelier, David LaChapelle, Sante D'Orazio, Bill Jones, Dana Lixenberg and Steven Meisel are just a few who shot her over the past 30 years. Whitney Houston's storied career: A regal rise, a tragic fall . With a 30-plus year career in the music business, the Los Angeles based photographer -- who first met the pop superstar at the Bel Air Hotel while she was filming ""The Bodyguard"" -- was entrusted by Houston's estate to handle the daunting task. ""To know her is to love her through and through and when I was looking through the thousands of photographs that was sent for the book, they were all amazing,"" St. Nicholas told CNN.com. With just six weeks to complete ""Tribute to An Icon"" -- the book publisher wanted to make sure it was in stores during the holiday season -- St. Nicholas and her team combed through archives from various sources to obtain the perfect images for the project. The book showcases the ""Saving All My Love For You"" chanteuse in work mode: at photo shoots, in concert, at video shoots, movie stills, etc. And according to St. Nicholas, that was the intention. ""In this book, I did not think we should have any pictures of anyone but Whitney. It's a tribute to her and it's of her professional side, her career, her 30 years of being an iconic artist."" But two of the pics do involve other people. One features an unseen Clive Davis, Houston's longtime mentor and one features child Bobbi Kristina -- the last page of the book. ""That day I remember really well,"" Nicholas recalled. ""It was shot at the Four Seasons Hotel and I was shooting all of them. I shot amazing pictures of Whitney and (Bobby Brown) too. It was a very good time in their relationship. And they were both in great spirits. But it was the way that Whitney looked at her in that picture and the way Bobbi Kristina was focused on her, I feel that it captured the connection, obviously some kind of karmic connection of not between just a mother and a child but between two souls. And I thought it was s such a poignant moment and it was so full of joy and they seem so content and so complete and I thought it was a nice way to end the book. That was her heart right there."" Photos: Never-seen photos of a young Whitney Houston . According to Pat Houston, who also oversees Houston's estate, Nicholas was one of Whitney Houston's most beloved photographers, one she called on regularly. And after seeing her work on the Prince coffee-table book, ""21 Nights,"" she knew she was the right person for the job. ""It was a no-brainer,"" Houston said. ""She did a phenomenal job."" St. Nicholas, who has worked with countless music stars and directs music videos, was reluctant to do another musician book. ""When you've done a book with Prince you've already done it,"" she said. ""But because I love Whitney so much, I thought why don't I do something with a broader scope. It shouldn't just be about my 20-something year relationship with Whitney, it should be about Whitney over the last 30 years of her career and it's much broader than me because she worked with many photographers. Even though she and I had a total love-fest, there are other opportunities for other people who've shot her."" According to Pat Houston, all of the photographers -- who contributed the work at no cost -- graciously worked closely with St. Nicholas in the tight time frame. Aside from writing the poignant Foreword to the book, Davis, who reigned supreme as the Chief Executive Hit-maker at Arista Records for 30 years, even had some input. Nicholas called on the legendary music executive for advice and to make sure ""she got it right"" once it was in the finishing stages. ""It was a really an emotional journey for him,"" she said. ""He said it was like looking at his life, 'This is my whole life right here.' He said to me, 'I really want to make sure that we capture those really important, poignant moments in her life.' The one thing he added was pictures from 'The Bodyguard.' Other than that, we'd gotten it all."" Pat Houston couldn't be more proud of ""Tribute to An Icon."" ""We've been talking abut a book for quite some time and this is a continuation of one of the projects that we wanted to do and it's for the fans, an enclosure,"" she said. ""She was such a beautiful, beautiful person physically and had such a gift, a God given gift. We wanted the pages, the photography to remind them of who she really was."" ""I hope they can really enjoy it for years and pass it on for generation after generation.""

"(CNN) -- Edith ""Edie"" Windsor lost her spouse in 2009, her grief compounded by an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay. Because her decades-long partner was also a woman, the federal government in legal terms did not recognize the same-sex marriage, even though their home state of New York did. ""I was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life, and I was also very sick, then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes,"" Windsor, 83, told CNN. ""And it was deeply upsetting."" That fundamental unfairness as Windsor and her supporters see it, is at the center of legal fight now awaiting action at the U.S. Supreme Court. Victory for lesbian, years after her longtime partner's death . The justices will meet privately Friday for a closed-door conference to decide if they will accept any of 10 pending appeals, essentially over whether a fundamental constitutional right for gays and lesbians to marry exists. If they agree to hear the issue, oral arguments would be likely be held in March with a ruling by late June. The political, social, and legal stakes of this long-simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention, a contentious encore to their summer ruling upholding the massive health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Earlier this month, voters in Maryland, Washington, and Maine approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already have done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment. Is there a national consensus? As more states legalize same-sex marriage, one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an ""equal protection"" right of marriage to homosexuals. Three separate issues confront the justices, who are likely to only accept only one for review in coming months. These include federal benefits, state benefits and state referendums. The Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, is a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples, such as Windsor and her late partner Thea Spyer. Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act . This appeal from Arizona asks whether a state that prohibits same-sex marriage may also deny same-sex couples marital benefits if one of the partners is a state employee, when other state workers in opposite-sex marriages enjoy government benefits. On referendums, the California high court had earlier concluded same-sex marriage was legal, but the 2008 voter-approved Proposition 8 abolished it. If the high court accepts this appeal, it would likely not decide whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, but only whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized. ""The justices are almost certainly going to take up the question of the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a top Washington attorney. ""The real question is whether they'll step into California's Prop 8 and the ruling there that California discriminated unconstitutionally when it granted a right to same sex-marriage and then took it away. It's a tossup on whether they'll hear that case."" Who will represent U.S. in any court case . Complicating matters is just who will defend the DOMA law before the justices. Traditionally that role would fall to the Justice Department's Solicitor General office. But Obama, in an election-year stunner, said in May he supports same-sex marriages. The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend the federal law in court. That left House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to step in after the Justice Department refused to participate. They have hired top Washington attorney Paul Clement-- himself a former solicitor general-- to make the arguments to keep the law in place, at least until lawmakers decide otherwise. Clement said a congressionally mandated, uniform standard to define marriage for federal purposes is both proper and practical, since different states have different laws defining the limits of marriage. ""DOMA does not bar or invalidate any marriages but leaves states free to decide whether they will recognize same-sex marriage,"" Clement told the court in a legal brief. ""Rather, DOMA merely reaffirmed and codified the traditional definition of marriage: what Congress itself has always meant and what courts and the executive branch have always understood it to mean -- in using those words: A traditional male-female couple."" The law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans, and other benefits. Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law. But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California's Prop 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. In February, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled the measure unconstitutional. Timeline: Same-sex marriage . Court could offer final word . By patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same-sex marriage over the past decade, the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on the tricky constitutional questions. The split 5-4 conservative-liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly-- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years, building political momentum and public confidence in the process. Edie Windsor is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs involved in the current DOMA appeals before the high court. She and Spyer, a psychologist, had been a devoted couple in New York's Greenwich Village for more than 40 years, before marrying in Canada in 2007. New York did not allow same-sex marriages to be performed in the state when Windsor and Spyer wed, but did recognize the out-of-state license. New York's legislature last year approved same-sex marriage. Windsor, a retired computer systems programmer, wants the $363,053 in added estate taxes she was forced to pay the IRS. She said the federal government considers her relationship with Spyer as little more than ""girlfriends,"" something she called an ""incredible indignation."" ""I would like to receive my money back. New York State accepted my marriage as a marriage,"" she told CNN. ""And I believe, and the Justice Department and the president agree with me, that the DOMA law is unconstitutional. DOMA is cruel. It discriminates against us for absolutely no value to the country. And we'd like to see that defeated altogether. I'd like other people not to go through what I went through.""","Edith ""Edie"" Windsor lost her spouse in 2009 and got a tax bill that triggered legal fight .

"(CNN) -- For five years, Michael Emerson was the villain who stole just about every scene on ""Lost."" (And he has the Emmy to prove it.) He was such an important part of that landmark series that it only seemed to make sense that he ended up on the side of good, keeping watch on the island when it was all over. Now Emerson is on the island of Manhattan, filming ""Person of Interest,"" one of the top dramas on television. On the CBS sci-fi procedural, Emerson plays Finch, a mysterious genius whose creation, the Machine, can predict crimes before they happen. This time, his character's motives are more pure. Emerson spoke to CNN about settling into this new role, an accidental visit to the set of ""Gossip Girl"" and his old friend from ""Lost,"" Terry O'Quinn. CNN: Now that you have a year under your belt, is Finch still a mystery to you? Emerson: He's still a bit mysterious to me. I play it every day and I hope I play it well. I don't have a very elaborate mental biography for him, I must say. I think he must evidently be a lot like me, because whatever my instincts are about the scenes tend to be the things that get used. CNN: Would you describe him as a good guy at this point? Emerson: I don't think his altruism is in doubt. If anything he has misgivings about the purity of his suicide mission for justice. CNN: With so many productions going on in New York, I heard you had a run in with one of them. Emerson: One day we were shooting downtown in the financial district. We just finished a scene and the company was breaking up to go to lunch. I don't know if I stood and gabbed with somebody on the curb. Next thing, I looked up and couldn't find anybody from our company, and I guess I zoned out when they drove me there in the van because I couldn't remember which direction I came from. I started walking and I got to another camp and it looked like ours. But it was another show. [Laughs] I'm sure they would have fed me. I think it was [""Gossip Girl""]. What if it were more surreal or absurd, where characters from ""Person of Interest"" walked into ""Big Bang Theory"" or something like that? That's a fun idea that has been completely unexplored. CNN: Do you run into your old friend from ""Lost,"" Terry O'Quinn, who is shooting (the now-canceled-but-still-in-production) ""666 Park Avenue?"" Emerson: It's fun to have an old pal from the other island here on this island. He lives less than 20 blocks away from me. We get together every week or 10 days. It is a bit [like old times]. It's just the setting is more urban and we're much better dressed. We both have really nice clothes in the shows we're doing now. CNN: What did you two have in common on ""Lost?"" Emerson: To start with, we had age. We were both the oldest guys on that show. We had many more things in common: small town Midwestern backgrounds, and we both moved to big cities to pursue the unlikely dream of being an actor. We both ended up accidentally on a big series. We had some of the same work habits. We had so many things in common. We had a bunch of the best scenes on the series. It was good, intense, dark work and yet we had good laughs doing it. CNN: So you were a villain and now you're a hero. Emerson: I'll stick with that. Villains generally are more fun, but they're hard to maintain. I guess anything is hard to maintain in TV land. I'm happy that my character on ""Person of Interest"" has enough ambiguity that it's still compelling in that villain way, except he's not. He does operate on the wrong side of the law so at least we have that. CNN: Do you ever talk about projects you can do with your wife, Carrie Preston (""True Blood"")? Emerson: We sometimes talk about plays we'd like to do together. That shows how our minds work. I shot a few scenes with her on ""Person of Interest,"" which was a great pleasure. We'd never done TV work together. CNN: What about a guest spot on ""True Blood""? Emerson: I'd be happy to do it, but I don't think it's ever going to happen. I can't go on there and play anything sinister because I've kind of done that. I guess I could play an innocent. I've said I'd be happy to play a humble human who gets torn apart by supernatural beings. The characters I like on that show are the most ancient ones. I like Godric. I like thinking about how he looks like he's 19 but he's 2000 years old. CNN: And what was it like voicing the Joker in the ""Dark Knight Returns"" DVD movie? Emerson: If I knew how significant it was to play that role in that franchise, I think I would have been terrified when I took it. I must have been busy or distracted, because I went in there carefree. I had not seen these recent big screen ""Batmans."" That's probably a blessing. Later when I saw Heath Ledger, I thought ""Oh, God. If I'd have seen this, I might not have done it."" As it was, my only role model was Cesar Romero, and I thought, surely I can do as well as Cesar Romero. CNN: Did you get to laugh? Emerson: I did. It was a chance not to be repressed or contained. All the shows I do, it's all about keeping a lid on it or staying small. When you play the Joker, the sky's the limit. You can turn that thing up to 11. I know it's a franchise where people have very high expectations and loyalties to whomever has played before, so I hope they'll accept me.","Following 'Lost,' Michael Emerson has settled into hit series 'Person of Interest'

"(CNN) -- While some Chinese travelers storm the tarmac when flights get delayed, others might wish their flights never take off -- assuming they're flying from the northeast China city of Dalian. To entertain waiting passengers, Dalian International Airport recently recruited a squad of cheerleaders to perform kicks, jumps and splits in the airport's main hall. During massive fog-related delays in Dalian last week, the cheerleaders' pom-pom routines ""soothed emotion and alleviated fatigue"" for more than 5,000 stranded fliers, according to the Dalian Evening News. The cheerleading show is part of the airport's effort to ""bring more convenience to passengers in the summer-autumn air season,"" said Zhen Qun, an airport official. It's also a way for the Dalian airport to ""demonstrate spirit and shoulder social responsibility,"" according to an airport press release. More on CNNGo: Traditional Thai cheerleading explained . The airport has launched a series of other innovative services, including free physical checkups and instant weather and flight updates by text message. Zhen did not discuss the daily schedule of cheerleader shows, but the airport has staged at least one performance every day in the past week, each lasting two to three hours, with breaks. ""The cheerleaders are enrolled in different colleges in Dalian. We hire them on a work-for-study program,"" added Zhen. ""The performance is free of charge for passengers."" That's good, because we're not sure we'd pay to see them, anyway. More on CNNGo: 10 of the world's most loved airports . Dalian International Airport is the biggest airport in northeastern China and the fourth busiest in China (by international passengers). The hub handled more than 12 million passengers in 2011. Amid a current boom in aviation in China, flight delays are becoming a major sticking point for travelers in the country. Poor weather, restricted military airspace and logistical issues regularly play havoc with airline schedules. Statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China had almost one in four flights suffering delays last year. However, that only measures the time a plane's doors are closed, not when the aircraft actually took off. © 2011 Cable News Network Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

"(CNN) -- Pushpa Basnet, a Nepalese woman who supports children so they don't have to live behind bars with their incarcerated parents, was named the 2012 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night. Nepal is one of the poorest countries, and space is very limited in the few group homes affiliated with the government. So when a parent is incarcerated and no other guardian can be found, children have little choice but to live in prison as well. Basnet, 29, is determined to give these children another option. She started a home in Kathmandu where children can receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life. She also runs a day care program for children who are too young to be separated from their parent. ""These children have done nothing wrong. They are simply caught in something they do not understand,"" Basnet said during ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and honored her and the other top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. ""We want to work with the government to bring them all out from of prison. And they deserve a better future."" Since 2005, Basnet has helped more than 140 children through her nonprofit, the Early Childhood Development Center. Basnet was chosen as Hero of the Year through a nine-week public vote held on CNN.com. For being named CNN Hero of the Year, she receives $250,000 to continue her work.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Though Ke$ha's first album, Animal, was a glitter-coated gutter dance party, with the brash singer getting sleazy and leading throngs of revelers into the night, no guitars were invited. On her new full-length album, Warrior, rock music scores a place on the guest list: the LP's first single, ""Die Young,"" has a strummed guitar front-and-center. The resulting album splits the difference between Ke$ha's signature brand of hooky rap-pop (""Come On,"" ""Crazy Kids"") and razor-sharp rockers (""Only Wanna Dance With You,"" a collaboration with the Strokes' Julian Casablancas and Fabrizio Moretti), with a few strikingly intimate moments (the piano-tinged ""Wonderland,"" which features the Black Keys' Patrick Carney). Rolling Stone spoke with Ke$ha while she was promoting Warrior in the U.K., and she opened up about bringing imperfections into pop music, working with Iggy Pop and who on her tour has been playing the essential role of ""Mr. Penis."" RS Playlist: Ke$ha's Favorite Party Starters . Rolling Stone: How did you decide to evolve from Animal to Cannibal to Warrior? Ke$ha: On this record I wanted to maintain what I believe is who I am -- wild, filthy-mouthed, very honest -- but at the same time, address the changes in my life, and bring the music I listen to offstage together with the music I make. For me, that meant working with awesome collaborators. There was a strict no-guitar rule on Animal. I just had this vision of making everyone on the planet dance. I wanted to be the Dance Commander. On this record, I wanted to bring the music I listened to offstage -- [Iggy Pop's] The Idiot, The Slider, Electric Warrior [both by T. Rex] -- into my music, which is pop music. Now, to some people, pop is a dirty word, or only a ""guilty pleasure."" But I f**king love pop music. I always have, and I will 'til the day I die, and I want to make pop records. But I love bringing [rock's] balls and irreverence to my music as much as I can. I once said that I wanted to make ""c**k pop."" And there are moments of that on the record, but there are also the quintessential Ke$ha moments like ""Come On"" -- rap-talking, s**t-talking -- and there are also moments that are unexpected, stripped-down and just me. As far as the people I collaborated with, I just wanted to take all my idols and make a record with them. Massive Beats, Wild Nights and Crazy Tattoos: Ke$ha Rocks Out on New Album . RS: How did you hook up with Iggy? What was it like to work with him? Ke$ha: Being in the studio with him was one of the most incredible days of my life -- definitely one of those ""holy s**t!"" moments. I've been obsessed with him forever. I remember when my brother brought home his record on vinyl. And then I started reading about him, and I was like, ""I f***ing love him."" I just started asking everyone I know, pretty much, if any of them knew Iggy Pop, and this time it paid off. Ke$ha Memoir to Explore 'My Crazy Beautiful Life' RS: This has been a year when rock songs by the likes of fun. have crossed over to the pop charts. Do you see pop music embracing guitars more in 2013? Ke$ha: For me, bringing in rock was about making the perfect imperfect. When you're making songs electronically, it's easy to make them perfect -- you can change things to the microsecond, move the drums down, Auto-Tune everything. I wanted to keep the electronic elements while making things a little bit imperfect, which makes it feel more organic. I wanted to capture real moments in time. Photos: Ke$ha's Rock & Roll Party . RS: That reminds me of your collaboration with the Flaming Lips, which was so chaotic and balls-to-the-wall. On the EP that comes with Warrior, you cover the country track ""Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You,"" and I kind of see you as a pop outlaw. There's an idea that pop is glossy and perfect, and you're like, ""F**k it, I'm gonna do what I want."" And as a result you have this really strong connection with your fans. Ke$ha: I love my fans. And I love that you called me a pop outlaw. ""Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You"" was written by my mom [Pebe Sebert], and made famous by Dolly Parton. Johnny Cash also sang that, and Merle Haggard, and they've both been famous for being the outlaw, or the misfit. RS: Are you going to be touring anytime soon, and if you are, are you bringing back the penis suit? Ke$ha: The penis suit is one of my favorite moments onstage. You don't understand the people who have been in that suit. Very famous people have worn it. My mother has been in that suit, friends, ex-boyfriends, lovers -- you name it, they've been in that suit. I can't imagine it going anywhere. See original story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Ke$ha has a new album titled ""Warrior""

"(CNN) -- While Egypt's leaders try to broker peace in the Israel-Hamas conflict, one of its sports teams has completed a remarkable triumph on a day of nationwide mourning. Egypt's leading soccer club Al Ahly won the African Champions League title for a record-extending seventh time on Saturday, despite its domestic league having been suspended for nine months following the death of 74 fans in the Port Said stadium tragedy. However, before Saturday's match took place in Tunisia, 51 Egyptian children died when their school bus was hit by a train. ""Happy that Egypt got one good news today #ahly but can't help crying over those kids. Celebrate but consider those mourning,"" one man wrote on Twitter. Another wrote: ""When we have our revenge for my 74 brothers who died for #Ahly only then I'd celebrate the great victory, till then I'll keep it in my heart."" Ahly star Abdallah El-Saied dedicated the win to the victims of the February 1 riot, which happened during his team's match at Al Masry. ""We wanted this trophy so much to offer it to the families and the souls of the Port Said martyrs,"" El-Saied said in quotes reported by the Ahram Online website after Ahly beat defending champions Esperance 2-1 in Tunis for a 3-2 aggregate victory. The first leg two weeks ago was played at a military facility near Alexandria rather than at Ahly's home ground in Cairo due to security fears. The club's militant fans, known as ""ultras,"" have threatened to cause problems unless action is taken against the perpetrators of the Port Said violence. A government investigation is ongoing. ""Mass celebrations across downtown #Cairo, complete with horizontal fireworks,"" tweeted Cairo-based journalist Bel Tew. Another Twitter user wrote: ""To all of you celebrating #Ahly 's win. What the hell is wrong with you ppl? Timing? Priorities? Grief? Mourning?"" Another added: ""Today is a really awful day for #Egypt, yes #Ahly made it better but it's still awful.""

"(CNN) -- What does it mean when a white sorority wins a competition that African-American fraternities and sororities not only created but also consider an essential part of their cultural expression? It means an uncomfortable discussion about race, history, culture and inclusivity that is not black and white. On February 20, the University of Arkansas chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha, a predominantly white sorority, won the inaugural Sprite Step Off stepping competition, beating two predominantly black sororities. Stepping, which began in the 1960s, is a intricate rhythmic dance that features synchronized foot stomps, handclaps, choreographed movements and chants. The competition was fierce, and all of the competitors fought hard for the $100,000 first-place scholarship. But the results immediately sparked a firestorm within the African-American fraternal community, with many calling foul. How could a white sorority beat black sororities at our own art form? Why were they even competing in the first place? Some alleged that judges cheated, while others posited that the novelty of white women performing swayed the judges. To understand why this is a big deal, you have to understand that African-American fraternities and sororities are as close to the Animal House stereotype attached to white fraternities as Pat Boone is to hip-hop. Black fraternities and sororities, known as the Divine Nine, form the fiber of African-American leadership in this country and continue to produce the leaders of tomorrow. The nine predominantly African-American fraternities and sororities -- Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority and Iota Phi Theta Fraternity -- were founded between 1906 and 1963 to support African-American college students in their quest not only to succeed on campus but to develop into college-educated leaders. The roster of Divine Nine members is a Who's Who in African America: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Jesse Jackson, Michael Jordan, Maya Angelou, Dorothy Height and over a million others count themselves as members. The civil rights movement is populated with Divine Nine members who developed leadership skills on college campuses. And the connection doesn't end after graduation. African-American fraternal members spend thousand of hours doing service in alumni chapters, raising money for scholarships and mentoring at-risk people. Pride in one's organization is paramount to Divine Nine members, and one way to express that is through stepping. Divine Nine fraternities and sororities take great pride in being original and innovative in their dances: highly coordinated, with elaborate costumes, and sometimes performed before thousands. It's a point of pride to perform, but to win for the glory of your fraternity or sorority is the ultimate. So when Zeta Tau Alpha members won the Sprite Step Off, it was not just that they'd beaten African-American sororities, it was seen as the first assault on yet another African-American cultural tradition that, if not guarded, would be appropriated from blacks like jazz and hip-hop. For many Americans, the notion of African-Americans having a separate culture, uninfluenced by other Americans, makes them uncomfortable. Isn't the point of civil rights to erase the color lines that separate and divide us? And if we acknowledge that blacks have cultural traditions that have been nurtured within their own community, does that make blacks separate from whites? This is where the nuances of race and culture come into play. Blacks are keenly aware of their otherness in this country. We're proud to be Americans yet also proud that we've built strong traditions that have sustained us through turbulent times. So we zealously protect those traditions from interlopers who may want to exploit or denigrate what we cherish. But this is the very reason why any African-American who dismissed the Zeta Tau Alpha win, or even the sorority's right to participate in the competition on the basis of being white, was 100 percent wrong. We as African-Americans can't protect cultural expression by creating fences that exclude. Those fences never work. But we can demand that anyone who seeks inclusion, and wants to participate in our culture, does so with the same respect and honor that we as African-Americans demand of ourselves. By all accounts, the women of Zeta Tau Alpha did just that. And even later, when Sprite announced that Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the African-American sorority that had come in second, would also be awarded a first-place prize because of scoring irregularities, no one could dispute that in a subjective contest, Zeta Tau Alpha met the criteria for winning, regardless of skin color. And that's something we as Divine Nine members should remember as we continue to strive to eliminate racism and bias. We can't fall victim to the same rationale that still is used to deny us first-class citizenship. As the leaders of college campuses and in the community, we must always fight for equality and demand that we're judged based on our skill. And if we don't do that, we lose much more than a stepping contest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence C. Ross Jr.","Lawrence Ross: White sorority won ""step"" contest, dance form of black frats and sororities .
Ross: Black fraternities, sororities are all about creating leaders; step is proud tradition .

"(CNN) -- It has been a bittersweet month for British sport. Andy Murray's bid to become the nation's first Wimbledon men's singles champion since 1936 was derailed, while the England football team suffered penalty-shootout heartache at the recent Euro 2012 tournament. But across the channel there is one Briton at the forefront of his sport who, through a series of peerless performances, is in line to become the UK's first Tour de France winner. Bradley Wiggins, with his mutton-chop sideburns and slim physique, does not instantly come across as an elite athlete. But the Sky Procycling rider is dominating the 2012 Tour de France, picking up the first stage win of his career between Arc et Senans and Besancon with an astonishing display of power to open up a lead of one minute, 53 seconds over second-placed defending champion Cadel Evans. French Tour de France rider arrested . ""It is Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France to lose,"" according to former British cyclist and now commentator Paul Sherwen, who made his debut in the race in 1978. ""He could have been on the podium last year and he crashed out on stage seven. This year he got the yellow jersey on stage seven."" Wiggins finished the 2009 race in fourth position, equaling the best finish by a British rider -- first achieved by Scotland's Robert Millar in 1984. His preparation for the 99th edition of the Tour has been both impressive and meticulous, and has left nothing to chance. The globalization of the Tour de France . Earlier this year, the Belgium-born rider became the first man to win the Paris-Nice, Tour de Romandie and Criterium du Dauphine stage races in the same season, while also embarking on a number of high-altitude training camps to prepare his body stands for the rigors of the French cols in the Alps and the Pyrenees. ""There's a long way to go,"" Sherwen told CNN ahead of Thursday's 10th stage. ""We've seen 20 riders leave the Tour through injury, I have never seen that before. ""Hopefully all the bad luck and bad crashes are behind the Tour, and hopefully Bradley won't have any."" Judge tosses Armstrong suit against anti-doping agency . If Wiggins wanted an example of just how quickly a challenge in the prestigious race can unravel, he need look no further than the first Briton to wear the ""maillot jaune,"" Tommy Simpson. The charismatic Simpson, who raced for Peugeot and could on occasion be seen carrying a cane umbrella when he wasn't on a bike, was sixth after the first week of the 1967 race but a stomach bug hindered his challenge. Simpson, the victim of heat exhaustion and amphetamines taken to enhance performance, died on the slopes of Mount Ventoux in southern France, during the 12th stage of the 1967 race. Half a century later British cycling is in a very different place, with its riders no longer having to go abroad in search of a professional racing career. And the team that Wiggins cycles for -- The Sky Procycling team -- is now the dominant force at the Tour, having been established in the wake of Team GB's success at the 2008 Olympics. Sky's lineup includes the sport's top sprinter Mark Cavendish as well as Wiggins' heir apparent Chris Froome, who is third on the Tour. Gold medals from Wiggins in the 4km individual pursuit and the team pursuit on the track in Beijing propelled Britain to the top of the cycling medal table four years ago. British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford formed the country's first professional team in 2009 and Sky Procycling made its Tour de France debut in 2010. ""Up until recently, we had to expatriate ourselves to race professionally,"" explained Sherwen. ""Live on our own, survive on our own and ride as part of a French, Italian or Belgian team. ""Nowadays, the Americans have professional teams, we've now a got a British team on the international circuit and the Australians have got their own professional team. ""It gives youngsters something more to aim at. I'm not saying it's easier, but, in English soccer, you've got Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool and you can dream of playing for one of those teams as a kid. ""Now kids riding their bikes in England can dream of getting into a professional team and getting into the Tour de France. It's an attainable dream."" Brailsford's plan was to produce a British Tour winner within five years, though. Wiggins could be set to deliver ahead of schedule. ""The perception of Team Sky is very good,"" said Sherwen. ""They are already comparing it to Lance Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service Team (with which he won five of his seven Tour de France wins between 1999 and 2004.) ""Sky made mistakes originally, but they have learned from those mistakes and corrected them."" After the culmination of the Tour on Paris' Champs Elysees on July 22, Wiggins will turn his attention to a home Olympic Games in London where he will compete in the time trial event. A historic win in France could provide Wiggins, British cycling and the nation's sports fans with a timely boost ahead of London's third Olympic Games. ""If Bradley could win the Tour de France this year it would be absolutely huge,"" said Sherwen. ""If he could win the Tour in an Olympic year, with the Games being in London, it would double or even treble cycling's exposure.""","The Tour de France is an annual cycling race which was first held in 1903 .
The 99th edition of the race began on June 30 and will finish on July 22 .

Health considerations include access to medical care and pollution levels. Transport, housing and recreation are also taken into account. City scores help multinational companies calculate compensation packages for the employees they dispatch overseas. A lower score often correlates into a better compensation package that includes hardship allowances, according to Mercer. Countries with unstable governments or undergoing civil strife tend usually have lower scores. Eight African cities dominate the bottom ten in this year's survey. ""The ongoing turmoil in many countries across North Africa and the Middle East has led to serous security issues for locals and expatriates,"" says Mercer's Parakatil. ""Companies need to be able to proactively implement mitigation plans, such as emergency repatriation, or adjust expatriate compensation packages accordingly.""

"(CNN) -- The show went on. One day after police say Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend and then himself, the team faced off against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, as scheduled. Immediately after the apparent murder-suicide, there had been some question as to whether the game would happen. It did, though a moment of silence was held before play got under way, and the mood at Arrowhead Stadium was somber. ""I think they made the right decision to play the game because you got to continue on. Life goes on. It's a tough decision, but I think they made the right decision,"" said Mark Mendenhall, a long-time Chiefs fan. Mike Beisner, another fan, said he felt there wasn't really a right or wrong choice. ""I think either way, the fans would have supported the decision. I think the league would have supported it,"" he said. The Chiefs beat the Panthers 27-21, a welcome boost to the struggling team's record, now 2-10. After the game, Chiefs Coach Romeo Crennel spoke to his players in the locker room, congratulating them on their win and for sticking together. ""Really good, you overcame a lot. You stuck together as a team like we talked about -- helped each other,"" he said. ""Family and friends, you relied on those people. You relied on your faith to help get you through this, and we got through it."" ""The win was a really good win,"" Crennel said. So far, police have said little about what happened Saturday. What is known, they say, is that linebacker Belcher, 25, killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, 22, before turning the gun on himself just outside the front door of the Chiefs' practice facility. He and Perkins left behind a 3-month-old daughter. Before Saturday, Belcher's name had never come up with police, nor had officers ever been called to the residence where the first shooting occurred. But later, they learned the football player and his late girlfriend ""had been arguing,"" including ""before the shooting occurred,"" said police spokesman Darin Snapp. Belcher, a 6-foot-2, 228-pound left-inside linebacker, spent all four of his NFL seasons with the Chiefs, who signed him as a free agent out of college. In all, he played in 59 games, including 44 starts. Belcher was from West Babylon, New York. He played for the University of Maine Black Bears, where he started in all 45 games of his four-year career. Asked about the apparent murder-suicide, Jo Brown, another Chiefs fan, described the situation simply as sad. ""It's sad for that little baby,"" she said. In a separate weekend incident, an employee of the Cleveland Browns organization killed himself, authorities in Cleveland said. Eric Eucker was a member of the groundskeeping staff, ""a good friend and colleague, and an outstanding employee,"" said team spokesman Neal Gulkis.

"(EW.com) -- Francis Ford Coppola is ready for a big picture comeback. The Oscar-winning filmmaker, now 73, has made some of the most iconic movies of all time, from 1972 mob classic The Godfather to 1979 war epic Apocalypse Now. But as an equally humble student and lover of film, he's recently made smaller movies with tiny budgets such as 2009's Tetro, starring Vincent Gallo, and murder mystery Twixt, with Val Kilmer and Elle Fanning. Coppola spoke to EW about five of his films -- Apocalypse Now, the extended version Apocalypse Now Redux, Tetro, 1974's The Conversation, and 1982's One From the Heart â€” all being released as a Blu-ray box set through Lionsgate on Tuesday. With new offices next year in Los Angeles on the Paramount Pictures lot, he also revealed his plans, and mentioned a first draft script, for a new ""ambitious"" big budget movie set in New York, as well as what he expects of his ""kid brother"" director George Lucas following the Disney- Lucasfilm acquisition. With the 2007 documentary Fog City Mavericks capturing the creative, independent spark of Bay Area filmmakers such as Coppola and Lucas, a new era for both has begun. Entertainment Weekly: How did you decide on releasing together as a box set these five particular movies, including One From the Heart, starring Teri Garr, which has never been on Blu-ray? Apocalypse Now, previously released, looks amazing. Francis Ford Coppola: Apocalypse is used for people to try out their sound system, their home theater. The standard theater, the Dolby 5.0 system, that all derived from Apocalypse, because Dolby was in San Francisco when we did the film. So many things are impacted by legal matters. Those are five movies that I own. Films such as The Godfather, or [1969's] The Rain People, the first that I wrote a screenplay for, Warner owns that one. I own the rights to Apocalypse Now and the others. Studios tend to not want to sell a movie because if they sell it and it becomes successful [on DVD, Blu-ray], it's an embarrassment. Lionsgate thought of doing the collection. The Rain People isn't even out wide on DVD. EW Daily Poll: Which has stronger talent this season? EW: Could a war movie such as Apocalypse Now ever be made today? I consider it one of the best war movies of all time, and it's steeped in the period, the Vietnam War, plus Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as source material. What you, Martin Sheen and the cast went through making it, the mayhem, the drugs, health issues, filming in the Philippines, the weather, being pulled into that dark, depression-filled space. Now everything is Tweeted, Facebooked, paparazzi-ed, revealed early on. Coppola: Back in those days, I was pretty young. I made The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part II so young. Nobody wanted to make a film about the Vietnam War. Even the actors I befriended didn't want to go with me to the jungle. I was pretty frustrated as a young person. I made it myself. I hawked everything, the wineries. When the movie came out, there was a ragged reaction. They used to call it Apocalypse When, and portrayed me as Kurtz gone crazy, a megalomaniac. I finally showed it at the Cannes Film Festival unfinished, because so much had been badly written about it. I knew I was out on a limb, because of the style of the film. I sold it to the various foreign territories as if it was a World War II film like [1977's] A Bridge Too Far. But it was so different. I was also financially on the hook. EW: And since then Apocalypse Now has long been considered one of the best movies of all time. Coppola: It's a kind of a Cassandra Complex. Even if you did it once, and people sort of damned it, it became part of the culture. If you want to do it again, it doesn't matter. You go through it again [making a movie]. Even in my personal life. My company and people think I'm wacky when I have an idea. ... I know if I have an idea, no one will want to go through it. But if I persist, people will go through it. EW: What is going on with the Bay Area filmmaking scene documented in Fog City Mavericks, especially with you doing smaller movies, and now getting offices at Paramount in L.A. next year. Plus, George Lucas' Lucasfilm being acquired by Burbank-based Disney? Coppola: George is like a kid brother to me. He's someone I'm enormously proud of, fond of. You can expect from George three more personal films [post the Lucasfilm deal]. ""Like Francis, I'll make films no one wants to see,"" he would say. Why I went and did three little teeny movies. I wanted to be a film student again, as a man in my 60s. To go someplace alone and see what you can cook up, with non-existent budgets. I didn't want to be surrounded by comforts and colleagues, which you have when when you're a big time director. I wanted to write personal works. ... You couldn't go to a financier and say ""I want to make a movie that wants to ask a question, then answers it with the movie."" EW: So what are you working on now, given your new offices next year at Paramount? Coppola: I have a secret investor that has infinite money. I learned what I learned from my three smaller films, and wanted to write a bigger film. I've been writing it. It's so ambitious so I decided to go to L.A. and make a film out of a studio that has all the costume rentals, and where all the actors are. My story is set in New York. I have a first draft. I'm really ready for a casting phase. Movies are big in proportion to the period. It starts in the middle of the '20s, and there are sections in the '30s and the late '40s, and it goes until the late '60s. EW: Lastly, would you ever do a sequel to any of your other movies, following in the footsteps of franchises like Star Wars, such as another sequel to The Godfather? Coppola: No. I think a sequel is a waste of money and time. I think movies should illuminate new stories. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Colorado have filed charges against the parents in last month's notorious ""balloon boy"" case, and the pair's lawyers say the two are expected to plead guilty on Friday. The Larimer County district attorney's office Thursday said Richard Heene has been charged with one count of attempting to influence a public servant, a felony, and Mayumi Heene has been charged with one count of false reporting to authorities, a misdemeanor. Richard Heene turned himself in Thursday afternoon and was released on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond, the Latimer County Sheriff's Office said. Mayumi Heene did not appear with him. The Heenes will appear Friday in Larimer County Court, where they are expected to plead guilty, their attorneys said. The penalty range for the felony is two to six years in prison with a fine of $2,000 to $500,000. The range for the misdemeanor would be six months in jail with a fine of $50 to $750, the district attorney's office statement said. The Heenes' attorneys said prosecutors have agreed to a sentence of probation with the possibility of up to 90 days in jail for Richard Heene and up to 60 days in jail for his wife. The threat of deportation for Mayumi Heene was a factor in the plea deal negotiation, the attorney's statement said. ""Mayumi Heene is a citizen of Japan. As such, any felony conviction or certain misdemeanors would result in her deportation, even though her husband and children are Americans,"" the statement said. ""It is supremely ironic that law enforcement has expressed such grave concern over the welfare of the children, but it was ultimately the threat of taking the children's mother from the family and deporting her to Japan which fueled this deal."" Prosecutors in the case could not be immediately reached for comment. On October 15, a large silver balloon came loose from moorings in the Heenes' yard and floated over Colorado. Mayumi Heene called 911 and said the couple's 6-year-old son Falcon was inside the craft. Millions of people across the country watched the saga on television for nearly two hours as military aircraft tracked the balloon in the air and rescuers chased it on the ground. Mayumi Heene later admitted the whole thing was a hoax and that Falcon was safe in their home the whole time, authorities said. Watch the moment the hoax was revealed . Court documents released last month said the couple hatched the plan about two weeks before the incident and ""instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax."" Their motive? To ""make the Heene family more marketable for future media interests,"" the documents said.","NEW: Richard Heene surrenders to face charges in in 'balloon boy' hoax .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan man was arraigned Saturday as part of an investigation into the deaths of women linked to a website that hosts ads for escort services. James Brown, 24, mumbled his name with his head down while appearing via video during Saturday's session at Michigan's 36th District Court in Detroit. He is charged with disinterring dead bodies and arson in relation to the deaths of Demesha Hunt, Renisha Landers, Natasha Curtis and Vernithea McCrary. He is a suspect in the killings of each of the four women, who were found dead on Detroit's east side last December, a prosecutor said in court. But he has not yet been charged with murder. Detroit police Chief Ralph Godbee later explained that one reason murder charges haven't been filed is that, while all the bodies were found in his city, the women weren't necessarily killed there. Legally, a charge is filed in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. ""We have reason to believe that the deaths did not occur within the city of Detroit proper,"" Godbee told reporters Saturday. ""Anybody (who) thinks Detroit is their dumping ground, they're sadly mistaken."" Hunt, 25, and Landers, 24, were found December 19 in the trunk of Landers' Chrysler 300. Days later on Christmas Day, the bodies of Curtis and McCrary were located in the trunk of a car that had been set ablaze. At least three of the women placed advertisements dealing with ""prearranged adult dating services"" on Backpage.com, Godbee told reporters last December. The police chief called the ads -- where postings on the escort section cost $1 -- as ""borderline prostitution."" A lawyer for Backpage.com, Steve Suskin, said then that the company's website didn't necessarily have anything to do with the women or their deaths. He insisted that investigators had seen ""at least 30 different (pertinent) ads or other postings on at least 15 different websites, separate and distinct from ours."" Around 6 a.m. Tuesday, authorities arrested Brown and ""another black male, age 32"" about 20 miles north of Detroit in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Detroit police said in a statement Saturday. The other man was later released, police said, but the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office decided to press charges against Brown. He is being held on $1 million bond, according to police. Even without murder charges being filed, some of the victims' family members expressed satisfaction Saturday that the case appears to be moving forward. ""We've been waiting for four months, and we're just grateful,"" Chikita Madison told CNN Detroit affiliate WXYZ, describing her daughter Landers and niece Hunt as ""good girls."" ""We want justice, we want closure."" Landers' uncle, Leon Mims, said that he and other relatives hope that Brown's arrest will spur the investigation, including determining key details and whether others might have been involved. ""Hopefully, the house of cards will start falling now,"" Mims told WXYZ. ""Hopefully, we'll get to the bottom of it, we'll get to the murder part of this.""","James Brown, 24, is charged and held on $1 million bond in Michigan, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Flight attendants who have OSHA protections on the ground -- but lose them the minute they board a plane -- may soon retain those protections in the sky. In a move that may also benefit airline passengers, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced Friday they plan to share responsibility for the flight attendants' safety on aircraft. Flight attendants would, for the first time, be able to report workplace injuries and illnesses to OSHA, ending a 37-year era in which the FAA claimed sole jurisdiction for cabin safety. Flight attendants applauded the proposal, saying it would not negatively affect passenger service, but instead would benefit passengers because they share the same environment. OSHA said areas of concern include exposure to noise and blood-borne pathogens and access to information on hazardous chemicals. The change would open the doors for OSHA to investigate complaints about air quality in aircraft, a condition sometimes referred to as ""sick airplane syndrome."" ""This is a validation that the aircraft cabin is our workplace,"" said Veda Shook, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. ""Any enhancement for flight attendants would also be an enhancement for passengers."" As an example, Shook said, some airlines provide both training and equipment to deal with bleeding passengers, while others do not. Flight attendants who are not provided equipment or training could enlist OSHA's help to change airline practices and policies, she said. A spokesman for Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said that while workplace safety is a top priority for airlines, the current FAA oversight is effective. ""A4A believes that expanding the regulatory process across multiple agencies is unnecessary, creates conflicting regulatory authority and a host of logistical problems throughout the industry,"" Victoria Day said. The FAA and OSHA said the unusual nature of flight attendant's workspace necessitates a system of cooperative oversight. When addressing OSHA noise concerns, for instance, several solutions might require the addition of thicker noise panels, which would affect aircraft design and safety. Under federal law, flight attendants are not currently covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The act also excludes employees regulated by another federal agency -- for example, the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the Coast Guard -- as well as family farms and the self-employed. ""The policy announced today with the FAA will not only enhance the health and safety of flight attendants by connecting them directly with OSHA, but will by extension improve the flying experience of millions of airline passengers,"" U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis said in a prepared statement. Friday's announcement opens up a 30-day public comment period on the proposed policy.","Currently flight attendants are not covered by OSHA regulations on planes .

"(EW.com) -- You may now exclaim, ""Holy crap! Woo hoo!"": Seth MacFarlane has recorded a guest spot on The Simpsons. ""The Family Guy"" creator and voice actor (not to mention one of EW's Entertainers of the Year and the host of the upcoming Oscars) will try to romance Marge in an episode that's slated to air next fall as the season 25 premiere, EW has learned. The two popular animated shows, of course, share a network, a night, an overweight patriarch that falls well shy of role model, and a rivalry as they've playfully jabbed each other on screen over the years. ""We wanted to come together in a bipartisan way to make Fox Sunday night rock,"" sums up Simpsons executive producer Al Jean of the MacFarlane casting. ""This was all very fun."" In the episode, titled ""Dangers on a Train,"" Marge mistakes an Ashley Madison-type website for a Dolly Madison-type cupcake site, not realizing that it's a destination for married people to arrange affairs. While on the site, she encounters the charming Ben (MacFarlane), who pursues her as they bond over their mutual love of a ""Downton Abbey""-ish series, Upton Rectory. ""A lot of him trying to go after her is over the phone, so it's a perfect part for someone with his voice,"" says Jean, who adds that the smooth-voiced MacFarlane croons ""The Way You Look Tonight"" in the episode. (By the way, Ben's wife is voiced by comedian Lisa Lampanelli, ""which explains what's wrong with his marriage,"" quips Jean.) MacFarlane â€” who lent his voice to Matt Groening's other animated series, ""Futurama,"" in 2009 â€” welcomed the offer to visit Springfield. ""We thought we had a great part that he'd be perfect for, and it would be great to have him on our show, so it worked out just right,"" says Jean, noting: ""There's been a little rivalry. We're both humor shows and we make jokes, but it's always been friendly."" EW Daily Poll: Do you like 'midseason finales'? In fact, ""Dangers on a Train"" contains a joke that tweaks both ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpsons."" During one of Marge and Ben's conversations, says Jean, ""they talk about this Downton Abbey show and they say, 'There's so much great stuff on Sunday nights... except on Fox.'"" Will ""Family Guy"" flip the script and feature some Simpsons talent on an upcoming episode? MacFarlane was unavailable for comment, but Jean says, ""I'm hopeful that there will be something of us on their show but that's up to them. We'd certainly welcome it."" In any case, he adds, ""for Seth, it completes the Saturday Night Live/Oscar host/Simpsons triple crown that exists only in my head."" (UPDATE: Some of you have astutely noted that Dan Castellaneta had a one-line cameo in an October episode of ""Family Guy.""

"(CNN) -- Inside the Kansas City home that Jovan Belcher fled, his baby daughter wailed, his mother was in hysterics and his girlfriend was quiet. Barely breathing. This is what the NFL linebacker left behind on Saturday in a rush of violence that left many wondering why. Few answers came from 911 tapes released this week by police. But the tapes provide a heartbreaking soundtrack of the fleeting moments the morning that police say Belcher killed his girlfriend Kassandra Perkins and then later turned the gun on himself just outside the front door of the Chiefs' practice facility. Opinion: Manhood, football and suicide . ""Oh my God. Oh my God. Kasi,"" Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd, bawled. ""The baby is crying ... Please get the ambulance here!""

""She is still breathing but barely. Please hurry. I don't know how many times he shot her. They had been arguing ..."" the mother said. ""OK, she's been shot?"" the dispatcher asked. KCTV: NFL will provide benefits to Belcher's daughter . Then moments later the mother seemed to direct her shouts to the wounded woman in the home. ""You hear me? Kassandra! Hey!. Stay with me!""

""Oh, God,"" the mother moaned. ""Is she bleeding?"" The dispatcher asked. ""Yes, she is ...."" But the rest of what's said was obscured by the screams of the young child. A police officer gets on the phone and tries to get information about Belcher from the distraught mother. The mother did not answer questions about the whereabouts of her 6-foot-2, 228-pound son, a standout 25-year-old starting linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs. Instead, in a voice rising as the moments passed, the mother begged for an ambulance. ""Ma'am, the ambulance is on the way. What's your son's name? What kind of car did your son leave in? Or was he on foot?"" the officer said. There was no response. ""Sounds like she disconnected,"" the dispatcher said. ""I wanted to give her some bleeding advice also ... Ma'am, are you there?""

"(CNN) -- Gold mining might have become a booming industry in resource-rich Ghana, raking in billions of dollars every year, but that wealth has failed to trickle down to many of the country's rural poor who live on the land where the gold is mined from. ""Mining goes with a lot of myths, like it creates jobs, it brings development, it makes people's lives better,"" says Ghanaian activist and founder of the Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining (WACAM), Daniel Owusu-Koranteng. ""That is the first deception: that you are sitting on gold and somebody is going to mine it. You cannot imagine for once the person can take the gold away and leave you in a bad state,"" he adds. Owusu-Koranteng has dedicated his life to championing the rights of Ghana's poor and helping communities that are adversely affected by large scale mining activity. He launched WACAM in 1998 and since then has been traveling to rural areas across the country to help the residents negotiate with the large multinationals who mine the land on which they live. Can Africa break its 'resource curse'? The mining advocacy NGO works to help farmers obtain better compensation packages and raise awareness about the dangers to the environment. At the same time, it wants multinational companies to contribute to the sustainable development of the communities affected. ""It's a bad case because they are farmers and they're dependent on the farm lands for survival, so many of them are without regular source of income now,"" says Owusu-Koranteng. The West African country is the continent's second largest producer of gold after South Africa. Its gold exports totaled $2.25 billion in 2008, up from $1.3 billion in the previous year, according to U.N. stats. Former Ghana president: Fight poverty with wealth creation, not charity . The majority of the world's big gold mining companies are already operating in Ghana, with the precious commodity being the country's main foreign exchange earner, along with cocoa. All this growth creates opportunities for both exploration and investment but also brings change to the largely rural, agrarian population. ""We also have a situation where our lands are taken over by mining,"" says Owusu-Koranteng. ""They (the farmers) lost their jobs, their lands were gone, the river is polluted and the skills they had could not fit into the skills of the mining."" A tireless activist, Owusu Koranteng spends a lot of time on the road, joined by his wife Hannah who is also committed to the cause. Together, they visit mining communities on a regular basis, offering education, training and legal support to the people at risk. ""When I go to the communities and they say they are hungry, I know what it is,"" says Owusu-Koranteng. ""When people have land and it's been taken away and they're not going to have anything to eat, I understand it,"" he adds. Through his organization, Owusu-Koranteng is trying to educate and energize communities and their leaders to understand that they are all responsible for what they leave behind. ""We are a small group of thoughtful, committed people who want to change the world, who want to make a change, who want to make a difference. We think that once we have the truth with us, one day, this country will learn that we need to manage our resources well for generations yet to come and that we shouldn't become a selfish generation,"" he says. ""The gold and the earth does not belong to this generation -- it belongs to the generations yet to come. That is what we should understand and we cannot mess it up,"" he adds.

"(CNN) -- Readers reacted strongly to a Monday op-ed on CNN.com about Jovan Belcher, the Kansas City Chiefs football player who murdered his girlfriend and then committed suicide. The piece was written by Kevin Powell, an activist, public speaker, and writer, and discussed how the tragedy related to depression and what Powell called ""very warped definitions of manhood."" It stirred a lot of conversation, including over 1,500 comments and numerous tweets. Here, Powell addresses some of the readers' reactions that he has already received. As men, we must begin to think about manhood in a very different kind of way. I've gotten two distinct responses to my article so far. The first batch is from men who agree that we've got to go in a different direction -- it's unhealthy to squash our true feelings about issues and to never talk. Some men actually admitted to me in very personal and private e-mails that they are hurting right this very minute. Then there were the angry messages from very angry men, accusing me of being anti-men, of male-bashing, of being on the side of women, of not being willing to let a man be a man. Well, my personal definition of manhood is that it should be rooted in self-love and respect for all people, including women. We should view women and girls as the equals of men and boys. And the foundation of manhood needs to be about peace and nonviolence and communication, not anger, hatred, violence and ugliness. chippy1 comments: If he was just a blue collar worker with access to a gun, killed his girlfriend then himself, this story would be back with the comics. Since he was a ""great"" football player the whole planet goes into a tailspin, just making his victim a footnote. This demonstrates the American attitude towards its ""idols,"" and the American persona, the more violent and bloody and scandal prone, the better. Kasandra Perkins is the victim's name. Let us always say the names of women who are the victims of violence. I would also add it does not matter whether the man is famous, a professional athlete, or someone nobody has ever heard of. Violence against women is unacceptable. However, when it involves a high-profile individual like Belcher, perhaps the tragedy can be a teachable moment so that more people will pay attention to domestic violence. Otherwise Kasandra Perkins' death will truly be in vain. Mattias Von Bismark comments: I thank you for this comment. It's a hard thing to say. It subjects you to this slander that you are, somehow, supporting the murder of that poor woman. It takes true courage and strength of character to stand up and say, ""Yes, what this man did was awful, but there was something at the root of this tragedy which was unaddressed. If this man had received help, his life and the life of the poor woman would have been saved."" Those who have never dealt with mental illness need to keep silent on this subject. As we have seen above, they have nothing helpful to add, and denigrate the serious discussion we should all be having. Mattias, I agree with you. Sadly, many of us do not want to deal with contexts for behaviors or situations. We are quick to name-call and judge and write someone off. The fact is that violence is normal in our country. One-fourth of American women have experienced some form of violence at the hands of men. I always challenge men to talk with their mothers, grandmothers, sisters, aunties, female cousins, or their wives or girlfriends, and they would be surprised to find out how many women have been assaulted in some way at some point in their lives. Just read your local papers, the crime reports, and note the number of attacks on women. Dissing Jovan Belcher may make you feel good in the short term. But it does nothing to stop this kind of violence. Dana, I understand completely your feelings. Do I condemn violence? Absolutely. But am I in position to determine who is going to heaven or hell? No. I am Christian. I just think we've got to be careful of passing judgment on anyone at any given time. Kyle Jarvis Chan Wu comments: I get the idea that you are actually sticking up for someone who murdered his wife. He shot her. That is a fact. I don't need to stand in the shoes of someone who would act violently against a woman. There is a difference between someone who takes their own life to depression and someone who goes on a killing spree ending with their own life. One person needs help, the other person doesn't deserve a marker on their grave. Kyle, that is absolutely untrue. I do not condone violence, and I hope for peace and love toward all. But as someone who has overcome personal challenges in grappling with violence and anger, I know that there are some serious issues around manhood and mental illness that we are not fully addressing as a nation. We need to start talking about how to help those in need. Desiree, that is why we must not forget Kasandra Perkins, Jovan Belcher's girlfriend. I'm not a woman but I can certainly empathize with what women and girls deal with every single day of their lives. I can only imagine. Sexism is alive and well, and the fact that Ms. Parker's name is barely mentioned in most media outlets means that there's a lot of work we need to do to change this situation. AB comments: the entire story is horribly sad, BUT why was there a moment of silence for him? he murdered his child's mother, and then, killed himself, leaving a baby with no mother or father. ... He murdered someone and you are giving him a moment of silence? If that was my daughter, it would make me more than angry if you gave her murderer this.. everyone is saying he was a great guy, well this great guy, did a horrendous crime. That is incorrect. There was actually a moment of silence by the Kansas City Chiefs for victims of domestic violence, as it should have been. My hope is that the National Football League, as well as other sports leagues, will take the same kind of very visible stance on domestic violence as it has on breast cancer.

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach has admitted Juan Manuel Marquez deserves a fourth fight against the Filipino after the pair's latest bout ended in another disputed points decision. Pacquiao emerged victorious on Saturday night during their WBO welterweight clash in Las Vegas despite Marquez claiming he should have been crowned the winner. The contest went down to the Nevada judges' scorecards with Dave Moretti scoring it 115-113, Robert Hoyle 114-114 and Glenn Trowbridge 116-112. Pacquiao beats Marquez by majority decision . Their first bout in 2004 was scored a draw, while Pacquiao won a controversial split decision in the rematch four years later. Marquez is convinced he won both encounters. Roach admitted the veteran proved a far more difficult opponent for Pacquiao than he expected and has conceded the 38-year-old is entitled to a fourth showdown, meaning Pacquiao's much-touted clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr. may have to wait. ""[Marquez] has given us problems three times now,"" Roach told reporters in Las Vegas. ""I do think he deserves a rematch first. ""I thought Manny edged it. Manny hit him with some good shots, but nothing great. It was the kind of fight I don't want to do again but I think we have to. ""We just need to deal with these counter-punchers and I have to do my job better, I guess."" Roach had predicted the fight would be decided within six rounds but at the end of 12 rounds Marquez raised his arms, convinced he had done enough. He left the ring as soon as the verdict was revealed. ""Everybody knows what happened. I think I won this fight again. I repeat, what do I need to do for the judges to give me the fight?"" Marquez told reporters. Pacquiao insisted it was ""very clear I won the fight"" but said he would be willing to consider a fourth bout with Marquez: ""Any time, any time. I am a fighter and my job is to fight in the ring."" But he also talked up the possibility of facing Mayweather -- the fight that boxing fans have long been clamoring for: ""Well, let's get it on. Make the fight happen and let's give people a good fight,"" he said. Roach also underlined his desire to see Pacquiao and Mayweather get into the ring, even though Marquez predicted the Filipino would struggle with the American's style. ""I hope that fight does happen,"" said Roach. ""I think it would be the best fight in the world and I would love to see it.""","Manny Pacquiao's trainer says Juan Manuel Marquez deserves a rematch .

"(EW.com) -- The first season of NBC's ""Smash"" was full of much-discussed moments, including a truly loony Bollywood fantasy dance number and a musical number set in a bowling alley. Well, ""Smash fans"", don't expect these flourishes when season two of the Broadway drama premieres on February 5 at 9 p.m. ""There's no bowling alley sing-alongs,"" executive producer Joshua Safran tells EW in his first interview since replacing creator Theresa Rebeck as showrunner of the series last spring. ""There are fantasy sequences, but so far not on the level of the Bollywood cover."" Also gone this year are Debra Messing's fortune-teller wardrobe of chunky scarves and sweater coats, the target of much online chatter. ""Coming into a show second season where there was so much discussion about positives and negatives about the first season gives you that rare chance to step back and go, 'What can I change?' So we were able to [revisit] things like the scarves. We address it head on."" But Safran wants fans to know that the changes he's making are not that severe and this will feel like the same show. Says the producer, ""As a viewer, I really loved the show. It's literally just reaching in and moving the tiny pieces that weren't connecting, the gears that weren't fully aligned. But it's small shifts. If you loved Smash last year, you are not seeing a radically different show. And that was important to me because I loved Smash last year.""

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A white bus drives through Nairobi at midnight. It looks like the type tourists hire to drive out on safari but this one is stuffed with a gang dressed in black hoodies. They target Kenya's political elite with a single message-- they are graffiti artists whose work likens their nation's political leaders to vultures. ""We tried many other animals like the hyena but the closest animal that describes a Kenyan politician is the vulture. They prey on the weak,"" says Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan photographer and the group's leader. Mwangi marshals his artists at a blank white wall next to a bank. A graffiti artist named Uhuru focuses a tiny projector onto the murky wall as Bankslave and Smokey spray the first black outlines. They put up traffic cones to make it all look a bit more official. Poverty tours: A learning experience or simply gawking? But only a handful of glue-sniffing homeless wander over to look. Mwangi is an award winning photo-journalist who has shelved his journalism career, putting his successful commercial photography business at risk. He says the vulture art is making waves. ""We have been able to change the language of the country, now politicians are being referred to as vultures by the mainstream media. And that's what we wanted that people can define the leaders for what they are."" A single moment he captured with his camera changed his life. ""There is one memorable photo,"" he says. ""I saw a girl who had been shot and she looked like my sister. That broke my heart."" It was early 2008 and post-election unrest engulfed Kenya. Mwangi witnessed the unraveling of his country through a lens: In one image a couple stands over a dead man left on the side of the road in the rain; in another, a moment just before the impact of a machete, and then a severed hand still grasping a makeshift weapon. His images were beamed across the globe and picked up by major newspapers. But after the awards ceremonies, the nightmares came. ""When I look back at my images, I can smell the fear and I can hear the screams. It happened in my country. Where I took the pictures, they are places that I normally go. So the images are a daily reality to my life,"" he says. He adds the pain turned to anger then activism. ""I was forced by circumstance. There was too much silence. The problems are there and I face them everyday. I see them everyday. But there is no one doing anything about it."" Mwangi organized photographic road shows to remind people of the horror that the political violence caused. He says: ""I believe in the power of visual art and so photography was my tool but it can only do so much. But in graffiti there is enough space to play around with images and words and pictures that don't exist."" He met up talented graffiti taggers working in Nairobi. At the time they were spraying images of Michael Jackson and Tupac. That has definitely changed. Replacing Kenya's 'flying toilets' On the white wall the image is coming together. It's an acerbic take on Michelangelo's ""Creation of Adam."" Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Arap Moi, past Kenyan presidents, reach out to touch a gaggle of Kenya's political brass. But instead of Michelangelo's angels, they are portrayed as vultures. ""Axis of Evil"" is sprayed in stark red writing above the group. Despite decades of corruption scandals implicating leaders and politically motivated flare ups, Transparency International, an NGO that works to expose corruption in government and business, says that not one senior politician has been brought to justice in Kenya. So the artists believe they are just drawing what Kenyans are already thinking. ""It is not like nobody knows what is happening,"" says Uhuru, ""but I think the style we are using speaks a thousand words. We just don't want to have the same violence last time."" The group has been harassed by police. And at least one senior politician has tried to buy them off, says Mwangi. They don't favor any political group; everyone is fair game, Mwamngi says. He wants to spark a ballot revolution. ""The power is in the vote. Four years ago we tried violence, It didn't work. So the power is in the vote. We want change. It can only come through the vote. And that is why we are doing the graffiti. ""Our whole idea is when you are going to work or when you are going home you see this big mural and you can have that conversation with yourself and you can ask yourself: 'are we that stupid, why do we still vote for these people?'"" The film school in Kenya's biggest slum .","Artists use graffiti paintings to slam Kenya's political leaders .

They say they want to spark ballot box revolution by making people think about their vote ."
