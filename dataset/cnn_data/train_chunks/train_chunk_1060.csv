Mellen's youngest children were seven and nine when she was arrested. 'When they handed me my grandson … it was so overwhelming and exciting just to hold him and just to know I was totally free,' she told Yahoo's Katie Couric. She spoke of her delight that Aidan did not cry when she held him and said she is now looking after him for her eldest daughter Julie. Jessica has been engaged for eight years but has waited for her mother's release until she began planning the wedding and the pair now plan to go wedding dress shopping .

'I was in the shower the first night, I'm not going to lie and there was a door and I was making weird noises like a little kid ""Oh my God, I am really in the shower and I am all by myself and there is a door and nobody is going to walk in and nobody is going to talk to me.'' Mellen was arrested in 1997 just as she was buying her youngest daughter, Jessica Besch, a Happy Meal. 'Me and her were at McDonald's when I got arrested and we didn't have a Happy Meal that day,' she said. '... It's a happy ending right now...We're going to have a new beginning.' At the weekend the pair revisited the fast food outlet in a step forward to forget about the past. 'I got my Happy Meal yesterday so I was really stoked about that,' said Jessica. Jessica said she and her fiancé of eight years were waiting to get married until her mother could be at the wedding. 'We're going to go dress shopping together,' she said. Mellen also spoke of her amusement at the new technology in the world. 'Watching people walking down the streets with phones was like, wow, don't people put those phones away?' she said. She called her life in in prison 'frightening' and said she doubted she would make it out alive at some point as she was 'threatened and hit.' Mellen also spoke about Daly and said he 'did not deserve that' and the news of his death was 'devastating.' On Friday the courtroom burst into applause after Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold overturned the conviction. Mellen had entered the courtroom in tears, and her children also wept. Based solely on witness testimony, Mellen (left in 1997)was convicted of orchestrating the 1998 death of Richard Daly, (right),  a homeless man she once dated and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole . Mellen during an interggoraiton in 1997. Deidre O'Connor, head of a project known as Innocence Matters said that Mellen was convicted in 1998 based solely on the testimony of a notorious liar . Mellen's youngest children were seven and nine when she was arrested . The judge said Mellen had inadequate representation by her attorney at trial. 'I believe that not only is Ms. Mellen not guilty, based on what I have read I believe she is innocent,' he said. 'For that reason I believe in this case the justice system failed.' June Patti, a known drug addict , had a long history of giving false tips to law enforcement . Mellen's case was investigated by Deidre O'Connor, head of a project known as Innocence Matters that seeks to free people who are wrongly convicted. O'Connor said in an earlier interview that she found that Mellen was convicted in 1998 of the 1997 killing based solely on the testimony of a notorious liar. Mellen was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. The witness who claimed she heard Mellen confess was June Patti, a known drug addict who had a long history of giving false tips to law enforcement, according to documents in the case. Even Patti's sister, a police officer, described her as a pathological liar. Patti died in 2006. Three gang members subsequently were linked to the crime, and one was convicted of the killing. Another took a polygraph test and said he was present at the bludgeon killing of Richard Daly, and Mellen was not there. Daly, Mellen's ex-boyfriend, was bludgeoned to death and set on fire in an alley.. In a habeas corpus petition, O'Connor said the police detective who arrested Mellen was also responsible for a case in 1994 that resulted in the convictions of two men ultimately exonerated by innocence projects. Mellen with her grandson Aiden on the court steps on Friday following her release . It said the primary evidence against Reggie Cole and Obie Anthony was the false testimony of an informant who avoided prosecution for other charges in exchange for his help. 'Although each member of this family suffered tremendously, they remain a close family unit,' O'Connor said. One of the daughters was honored by Innocence Matters for bravery in obtaining a confession that helped to prove her mother's innocence, O'Connor said. 'The 'kids' are overjoyed by the news of their mother's anticipated exoneration and are anxious to make up for lost time,' O'Connor said. Since she was found guilty, three other gang members have been linked to the murder and one passed a polygraph . Mellen's youngest child was just seven years old when she was arrested. There was no hiding the emotion of finally being cleared with that young child now a grown adult who, like all three of her children, has stayed close . Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold overturned the conviction saying Mellen had inadequate representation by her attorney at trial .","Susan Mellen was convicted in 1998 of murdering Richard Daly .

"Wasim Husain started to eat his fake Pakistani passport after being challenged by officials . A fraudster used a fake passport to take a British citizenship test  then started to eat it when he was challenged, a court heard. Ambulance service call operator Wasim Husain was jailed for eight months after he admitted he was paid £300 to sit the exam on another man's behalf. The 26-year-old began devouring the document after being confronted by staff who had examined the Pakistani passport he was using under an ultra-violet light. Sarah Slater, prosecuting, told Derby Crown Court: 'The member of staff told the defendant she believed the passport was false and that he would not be sitting the citizenship test. 'He became very angry and grabbed the passport from the desk then tried to leave but the door was locked and he began to kick it. 'He then began ripping at the passport, pulling off the front page and started to eat the passport.' The police were called to the Local Learning Centre in Derby  and Husain, who worked for West Midlands Ambulance Service, was arrested. Miss Slater said that, in interview, he told immigration officers he had been approached by a customer at the mobile phone shop where he works at weekends in Birmingham. Husain said the man, who he claimed to be called Zafar Mahmood, had told him he would be paid £300 to sit the citizenship test on his behalf. Husain of Dudley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to possession of false identification with improper intention. Recorder Martin Jackson QC, sentencing, told him: 'The possession of a bona fide British passport gives people the right to certain privileges and those who falsely try to obtain one are undermining the whole system of immigration control. 'You willingly accepted £300 to sit a citizenship test for another person who the prosecution tell me has never been traced. Given the need for there to be deterrents for those who try to use of false documents to try and circumvent immigration controls, there can only be one outcome - and that is custody.' Wasim Husain, 26, was jailed for eight months after pleading guilty to possession of false identification . Mohammed Sarwar, defending, said Husain's wife was pregnant with twins and that he was the 'sole carer' for both parents. Mr Sarwar also showed the court references from Dudley Central Mosque saying Husain was a 'valued volunteer' there, and produced a letter from the ambulance service confirming it would sack Husain if he was jailed. He said: 'This offence took place at a time when he was struggling financially.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said he could 'confirm disciplinary action has started' after Husain was jailed.","Wasim Husain was paid £300 to take the citizenship test by another man .

"Several parents unwittingly agreed to give up their eldest child in return for the use of free Wi-Fi, a study has revealed. Thankfully, the deal was not binding but an experiment designed to highlight the dangers of using the public Wi-Fi internet. Londoners were asked to agree to terms and conditions as they logged on to use free Wi-Fi in a cafe located in a busy financial district and at a site close to the Houses of Parliament. Scroll down for video . Several Britons have unwittingly agreed to give up their eldest child in return for the use of free Wi-Fi (illustrated with a stock image). Londoners were asked to agree to terms and conditions as they logged on to use free Wi-Fi in a cafe located in a busy financial district and at a site close to the houses of parliament . The terms of access included a ‘Herod clause’, under which the Wi-Fi was provided only if ‘the recipient agreed to assign their first born child to us for the duration of eternity’. In the short period the terms and conditions were live, six people signed up. ‘As this is an experiment, we will be returning the children to their parents,’ joked F-Secure, the technology security firm that ran the experiment. The experiment aimed to highlight ‘the total disregard for computer security by people when they are mobile,’ according to the firm's report. The Wi-Fi hotspot used in the test was small enough to be stashed in a handbag and was built by German ethical hacking company, SySS for €200 (£157 or $254). The terms of access included a ‘Herod clause’, under which the Wi-Fi was provided only if ‘the recipient agreed to assign their first born child to us for the duration of eternity’. A stock image is pictured . Last month Google unveiled an elite squad of hackers tasked with scouring the internet for security holes and defending the public against cyberattacks. 'Project Zero'  will hunt for bugs in the world's most popular software, such as Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. 'You should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications,' Google security researcher Chris Evans said in a blog post. Yet he said sophisticated attacks continue to target, for instance, human rights activists and businesses. 'This needs to stop. We think more can be done to tackle this problem. 'We're hiring the best practically-minded security researchers and contributing 100 per cent of their time toward improving security across the internet.' In just 30 minutes, 250 devices connected to the hotspot - some of them doing so automatically due to their settings. The company was able to collect the text of emails they sent, the email addresses of the sender and recipient as well as the password of the sender. The head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre told the experts that criminals are already starting to offer free Wi-Fi hotspots in order to steal personal data. Sean Sullivan, an F-Secure Security Adviser said: ‘At best, your device is only leaking information about you and at worst, your passwords are being spilled into a publicly accessible space...anybody on the network can see your information.’ The report said: ‘Our results illustrate the very real problem of the modern world which is that while massively dependent on the technology the population is unaware of its capabilities for surveillance and intrusion into their lives. ‘The problem is that people implicitly trust their technology and are not aware of the implications of that trust. ‘There is an insatiable pursuit of bandwidth, driven mainly by the desire to have video, data-rich apps and super-fast website performance on the move. ‘This appetite for bandwidth ... has blinded consumers to the risks that they are taking. In pursuit of free bandwidth, people are prepared to do anything as our experiment showed with its draconian terms and conditions.’","Several parents agreed to the 'Herod clause' in a contract because they didn't read terms and conditions of accessing free Wi-Fi in London .

"Eastern Europeans who created a 'shanty town' beneath a church left a scene of destruction littered with discarded mattresses, electrical equipment and piles of rubbish after they were forced out by a High Court ruling. Four van loads of rubbish and broken furniture had to be removed from the site, next to Hounslow police station, after the rough sleepers were ordered to leave. Around 15 Eastern European migrants are believed to have made the area beneath Holy Trinity Church in Hounslow High Street their home, turning it into a type of 'shanty town.' They were ordered to leave after the private landowner went to the High Court to get an injunction, forcing them to move on. Eastern European migrants left a 'trail of devastation' after they were forced out of the shanty town they had created beneath a church . Once they left the area officials were confronted with piles of rubbish, glass bottles and discarded clothes across the floor. Towels and sheets were found hanging, separating areas that appeared to have been converted into bedrooms and were littered with clothes and shoes. In other areas pieces of cardboard littered the floor along with plastic bottles and pieces of wood. Dozens of items of furniture were also left behind, with living quarters seemingly set up around large fans and double beds. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told the Evening Standard: 'The commune presented health and fire risks, and locals were intimidated by the presence of the occupants, who were often intoxicated. Towels and sheets were strung beneath the church in Hounslow, where the 15 migrants appeared to have created their own commune . The rough sleepers were forced to leave the site by a High Court ruling, and left dozens of items of discarded furniture behind . Old and broken furniture, bottles and cans litter the floor beneath Holy Trinity Church in Hounslow following the migrants' eviction . Police and Hounslow Council had to use four vans to remove discarded rubbish and furniture from next to Hounslow Police Station . The group of 15 migrants had set up a commune or shanty town beneath the church in Hounslow, on land which is privately owned . 'Some occupants accounted for much of the anti-social behaviour and low-level crime in the Hounslow area. 'Police liaised with the council and High Court enforcement officers to carry out the eviction.' Officers said it had taken a while for the group to be removed because the owner of the land was private and had to obtain an order through the High Court to have the migrants removed. However once this was granted they moved in quickly to remove the group. Steve Curran, leader of Hounslow Council said the council was pleased that had been able to improve the quality of lives of residents by dealing with the situation 'humanely.' He said: 'The amount of rubbish council officers cleared away takes your breath away. It's a cost to the council taxpayers which could have been spent more usefully.' he scene will remind some London dwellers of subway in the exclusive Park Lane area of London.

"A 29-year-old Hawaii man sparked terror on a Japan Airlines flight after  sexually assaulting a female passenger in the plane's bathroom, the FBI have said. Michael Tanouye, who was travelling with his mother, allegedly forced his way into the restroom an hour and 45 minutes after the flight to Kansai, Japan, took off from Honolulu International Airport . He then tried to take the Japanese passenger's clothes off, before exposing himself, it is said. While struggling with Tanouye, the unnamed woman managed to push an emergency button. However, she remained trapped with him for a few minutes as the flight crew, other passengers and her panicked mother tried to open the bathroom door, which the suspect was allegedly blocking. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Michael Tanouye (pictured), 29, sexually assaulted a female passenger in the bathroom of a Japan Airlines plane, the FBI have said. Tanouye's actions forced the plane, from Hawaii to Japan, to turn around . The group finally managed to unscrew the door's hinges, rescue the woman and subdue Tanouye, who lives in Hilo, according to Hawaii News Now. Following the incident last Saturday, the captain was forced to abandon the plane's journey to Kansai International Airport, and instead returned to Honolulu. The condition of the woman, who was returning home  after a four-day vacation with her mother, remains unknown. However, a male passenger was reportedly injured trying to subdue Tanouye. Upon arrival in Honolulu, Tanouye was arrested by FBI agents and charged with interfering with a flight crew and aggravated sexual assault on board an aircraft. The sexual assault charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before the alleged attack, Tanouye was heard shouting words that were incomprehensible, FBI Special Agent Necosie Wilson wrote in an affidavit. Incident: Tanouye allegedly forced his way into the restroom an hour and 45 minutes after the Japan Airlines flight took off. He then 'tried to take the passenger's clothes off, before exposing himself' (file picture) Return: The captain of the plane reportedly made the decision to return to Honolulu International Airport (pictured) two hours into the flight after hearing that it took three passengers to keep Tanouye calm . His mother reportedly told a flight attendant he suffered from depression and was on medication, while Tanouye stood up and walked around the plane 'calmly'. Flight attendants agreed not to serve him alcohol because he was on medication. After the incident, Tanouye's mother gave him a dose of his medicine and he fell asleep, the affidavit said. The captain of the plane reportedly made the decision to turn around two hours into the flight after hearing that it took three passengers to keep Tanouye calm following the alleged assault. Tanouye, who is being held without bail at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center, appeared in federal court for a brief hearing yesterday, seemingly sporting an injury on the left side of his face. Destination: The plane was travelling to Kansai International Airport (pictured) when the assault occured . He replied 'yes' when the judge asked if he understood the charges. He did not  enter a plea. Defense attorney Richard Sing declined to comment after the hearing, while Tanouye's parents and sister attended the hearing and left the courthouse without commenting. Assistant U.S. Attorney Larry Butrick told U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Chang there are additional charges and 'mental health issues at play'. Outside the courtroom, Butrick declined to elaborate on the pending charges, mental health issues or the suspect's facial injury.","Michael Tanouye, 29, allegedly forced his way into bathroom on plane .

"Two young daughters of a Pakistani Christian woman on death row for 'blasphemy' today told how they were tortured by a mob of religious fanatics because of their mother's alleged comments. Asia Bibi has been sentenced to hang in Pakistan after she was accused of making disparaging remarks about the prophet Mohammed during an argument. While working as a berry picker in 2009, the 46-year-old got into a dispute with a group of Muslim women who objected to her drinking their water because, as a Christian, she was considered 'unclean'. As a result of the initial allegations, the family were savagely beaten by angry villagers at their house and forced to go into hiding after receiving death threats. Now, as the family launches a second court appeal against Ms Bibi's death sentence, her husband and two daughters have spoken exclusively to MailOnline about their horrendous ordeal and their lingering hope that she will be released in time for Christmas. Scroll down for video . Persecuted: Esham Masih and her sister Esha were tortured by a gang of religious fanatics after mother Asia Bibi was accused and later sentenced to death for making 'blasphemous' remarks about Islam . Her oldest daughter, Esham Masih, who was nine years old when the family came under attack, told how she came back from school one day to find her mother being abused by a gang of men. 'My friends told me that people were torturing my mother at the fields where she used to work,' she said. 'I rushed to the spot and found that she was being abused and tortured by men. They had even torn her clothes.' Esham, now 14, ran back home to get her mother a new dress, but when she came back the gang had returned. 'I still dream of the day she was tortured and arrested. I could not sleep properly. 'The angry men came back and started torturing us both and tore down her clothes again. Asham said the gang called her offensive Punjabi terms that translate roughly 'mother f*****' and 'sister f*****'. Shocking: Christian woman Asia Bibi, pictured, has seen her appeal against the death sentence denied . When she asked one of her attackers for water, they instead smashed the glass against the wall to torment her. 'They dragged her to the centre of the village. We both were crying but there was nobody to listen to us. 'After half an hour or so, the police came and my mother asked me to go and find my father, who was hiding at my uncle's house. 'But he was too terrified to leave. I ran back and by that time police had taken my mother away.' Ms Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, said his other daughter, 15-year-old Esha who has special needs, had also been abused. 'All those people who abused and tortured my wife knew me very well, but they did not respect anything,' he told MailOnline at his house in a Christian district of Lahore. 'They became so cruel. They even didn't spare my daughters and tortured them. Bowing his head in shame, Mr Masih said: 'I was so afraid that day. 'I do not think it could have helped her or our family if I had tried to save her that day. 'I might also have ended up in jail as a blasphemy-accused and there would be no one to help my daughters.' Mr Masih, who used to work at brick kiln as a labourer in his village, said their lives have been destroyed. 'I was born in that village. I spent almost 45 years of my life in that village. I had so many friends in that village but I do not want to go back there.' 'I have restricted my movement. I am afraid of being recognised as Asia's husband in public. 'I have almost stopped communicating with Muslims. I am afraid they could recognise me. Just imagine how tough it will be for my wife to live in prison.' In November 2010 Ms Bibi was sentenced to death by a lower court, becoming the first woman in Pakistan's history to be given the death penalty for blasphemy. Over the past four years Ms Bibi has languished in the high-security District Jail Seikhupura, 22 miles north-west of Lahore, before being moved to a more remote prison. Terrified: Ms Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, said the family has been forced into hiding over fears for their lives . Despair: The family has launched a second court appeal against Ms Bibi's death sentence . The shocking case hit global headlines after two prominent politicians who tried to help Ms Bibi were assassinated, one by his own bodyguard. Lawyers showered the killer with rose petals when he appeared in court and the judge who convicted him of murder had to flee the country. Ms Bibi's lawyer, Naeem Shakir, said her accusers have contradicted themselves many times since first raising their complaint. Two witnesses allegedly involved in the incident did not appear in court, he said. A Muslim prayer leader did appear, saying he did not witness the original altercation, but that Ms Bibi had confessed to the supposed crime in front of him. Last week, despite international outrage and hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition for her release, Ms Bibi lost an appeal to have her sentence overturned, meaning she now faces death by hanging. The family have forced to move five times in the last five years because of the abuse they have suffered . The decision of the Lahore High Court has thrust the family back into public spotlight, placing their safety in jeopardy once again. 'This is too dangerous for all of us', said Mr Masih. 'We have changed five residences during the last five years. The blasphemy accusation on my wife has ruined our family. 'I could not sleep properly after the decision of The Lahore High Court. We could be attacked or framed in similar kind of case.' Human rights groups say Pakistan's blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores. The law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence. There are also no penalties for false accusations. Those accused are sometimes lynched on the spot. If they are arrested, police and the courts often allow trials to drag on for years, as in the case of Ms Bibi. The delays tend to be caused because officials are afraid of being physically attacked if they release anyone they feel had been wrongly accused of blasphemy. Only one person has been executed since Pakistan imposed a de facto moratorium on executions in 2008. This year has seen a record number of blasphemy cases as well as increasing violence against the accused. Support: Ashiq Maseeh, husband of Asia Bibi, along with his daughters Sidra, second left, and Esham, left, speak to Pakistani Minister of Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti, right. He was later murdered . Anger: Protesters hold up placards while demanding the release of Mrs Bibi at a rally in Lahore in 2010 . The crime of blasphemy was sealed into Pakistani law under British rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who died in a plane crash in 1988. In recent years, however, the country - which is 96 per cent Muslim - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting Islam, says Islamabad-based think-tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies. But many analysts see the claims as score-settling or a front for property grabs, and in fact have nothing to do with Islam. If found guilty, defendants can expect the death penalty. The charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement. It can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime. Blasphemy carries the death penalty in Pakistan but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them. Judges have previously been attacked in Pakistan for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead. Ms Bibi - a farm worker from rural Punjab - released a memoir called 'Blasphemy' last year, in which she described her torment at not knowing how long she has left to live. Talking about how she ended up being accused of blasphemy, she says: 'I drank water from a well belonging to Muslim women, using 'their' cup, in the burning heat of the midday sun. Mr Masih believes his wife has been falsely accused simply because of her religion. 'My wife was framed in the charge of blasphemy only because of her faith. 'The day our house was attacked by an angry mob at our village, she was offered to convert to Islam to get out of trouble but she denied as she has not committed any crime. 'There is no pressure on her in jail to convert to Islam. Authorities, in fact, are somewhat helpful,' he said that he was hopeful to get justice from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. He has called on the Pope and President Barack Obama to help secure the release of his wife. 'We need help from all quarters. Barack Obama should play a positive role and convince Pakistani government to ensure justice in Asia's case.' The family have struggled to look after Esha, who has difficulties with her speech and walking, after her mother's arrest. Speaking in broken words, Esha said: 'I miss my mother too much.' Both sisters go to a private school being run by Joseph Nadeem, executive director Renaissance Education Foundation, a Christian educationist who has been helping the family since December 2010. 'Esham is a brilliant student, but she goes through spells of depression regularly,' said Mr Nadeem. Esham, who visits her mother once a month in prison, said: 'It is tough living without her. I hope she would soon be released and would celebrate  Christmas with us. 'I love my mother and miss her a lot. I request everybody to pray for her.'","Asia Bibi was accused of making disparaging remarks about Mohammed .

"The country has enough fissile material for a dozen nuclear bombs. It sells missile technology to rogue regimes such as Iran and Syria. And the three generations of the Kim dynasty who have run it since 1945 have all been ruthless, brutal — and terrifyingly erratic. At 9.49 local time on Wednesday, North Korea’s isolated regime defied warnings from across the world to launch an Unha-3 ballistic rocket from a remote village near the Yalu River border with China. The launch site is 45 miles from North Korea’s main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, where scientists are working towards the production of long-range missiles which can carry nuclear warheads. Scroll down for video . Threat: Kim Jong-Un defied warnings from across the world to launch an Unha-3 ballistic rocket on Wednesday. He is known as The Shining Son and it is said his face has been surgically altered to resemble his grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, the first ruler of North Korea . North Korean state media reported the launch as the successful positioning of a weather satellite in space. TV showed images of happy people dancing in the streets. Customers in a coffee shop in the capital Pyongyang burst into applause. It was a case of fourth-time lucky for the country, since three previous launch attempts had ended in failure. The most recent flop occurred eight months ago and was particularly embarrassing because it had been timed to coincide with the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-Sung, the first ruler of North Korea, a man so revered he is called the Eternal President even though he died in 1994. His embalmed body can be reached on travelators that take respectful visitors through the vast Kumsusan Memorial Palace to bow before it and weep. In that year power passed to his son Kim Jong-il, still called the Supreme Leader, who was succeeded in 2011 amid weeks of hysterical compulsory mourning by Kim Jong-un, at 29 the world’s youngest leader. Lift off: The Unha-3 ballistic rocket was launched at 9.49 local time on Wednesday at North Korea's general launch command centre. State media reported the launch as the successful positioning of a weather satellite in space . Blast off: A screen shows the Unha-3 (Milky Way 3) rocket being launched from a launch pad at the North Korea's West Sea Satellite Launch Site . Celebrate success: Female members of a North Korean military band perform at the launch celebration and TV showed images of happy people dancing in the streets and others bursting into applause .

But while his people were shown on state . media celebrating, North Korea’s neighbours were deeply alarmed by the . so-called satellite launch, for it was nothing less than a test for . ballistic missiles intended to be equipped with nuclear warheads. Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague summoned the North Korean ambassador for an explanation following 'clear violation' of UN Security Council resolutions . It represents yet another step in the country’s determination to be able to launch a nuclear strike on cities on America’s Pacific coast — and it demonstrates Kim Jong-un’s megalomanic contempt for international relations. As the rocket flew south across the Yellow and East China Seas, its discarded booster sections fell near the Philippines and the Japanese island of Okinawa, violating both countries’ sovereign territory. South Korean satellites monitored the rocket’s ascent, as did three of its Aegis warships from the sea. Japan put its armed forces on alert and held a news conference within 30 minutes of the launch to calm a panicky population. Even China, North Korea’s closest ally, said it regretted Pyongyang’s violation of UN bans on ballistic missile technology to launch a satellite. In London, Foreign Secretary William . Hague summoned the North Korean ambassador to the Foreign Office for an . explanation following ‘clear violation’ of UN Security Council . resolutions. Predictably, . Kim Jong-un remains unrepentant. His accession last year led in the West . to naive optimism — of the sort Tony Blair once invested in Syria’s . murderous Bashar al-Assad, who had taken over from his despotic father — . that the young prince would be a reformer. Nothing could be further . from reality. True, Kim Jong-un appears not to have . his father’s depraved sexual appetite. Kim Jong-il was attended by a . retinue of 2,000 young women known as Gippeujemo in Korean, meaning . Pleasure Brigade, who had been rounded up at the age of 15 by officials . to service the Supreme Leader’s sexual whims. All had to be virgins, and none could be more than 5ft 2in — the height of King Jong-il himself. In . contrast, Kim Jong-un is said to be a romantic and deeply attached to . his pretty wife, Ri Sol Ju, who likes Dior handbags and high hemlines in . a country where individual self-expression is all but forbidden. Pubic announcement: An anchorwoman announcing the country's successful rocket launch in a TV program in Pyongyang, North Korea . Rejoice: North Koreans dance to celebrate their country's rocket launch . Neighbours alarmed: A protest mock up of North Korea's missile is extinguished by police in South Korea after the launch which was nothing less than a test for ballistic missiles intended to be equipped with nuclear warheads . Kim also appears more Westernised . than his father. A photo that appeared soon after his succession caught . him cavorting on a rollercoaster with the British ambassador to his . country. He likes basketball and Johnny Walker whisky, and he attended . school in Switzerland for a couple of years in the 1990s. But . he also spent three years at a training school for elite Korean Workers . Party cadres in Pyongyang, and the fact is that the podgy young . dictator has moved quickly to consolidate his grip on power. Any . challenge to his might would most likely come from the armed forces, so . as soon as he was leader he immediately promoted himself from general . to marshal and liquidated any potential dissenters. A deputy defence . minister and other senior officers were assassinated with pinpoint . mortar fire after Kim insisted nothing should remain of them, ‘down to . their hair’. The military are part of North Korea’s privileged elite, who belong to the ruling single party. They . are known as the ‘core class’, and number a quarter of the population. The most privileged of all are the Kims themselves, with gilded luxury . residences, replete with bowling alleys, cinemas and heated swimming . pools. Remains unrepentant: Kim Jong-un's accession last year led in the West to naive optimism that the young prince would be a reformer. Nothing could be further from the truth . Romantic: Kim Jong-un is said to be deeply attached to his pretty wife, Ri Sol Ju, who likes Dior handbags and high hemlines in a country where individual self-expression is all but forbidden . More than half the . population of 23 million are not so fortunate as they are classed as . ‘waverers’, ordinary people outside the charmed party circle. While . still at school they have to complete detailed biographical sketches of . their families, which are then used by the state to determine everything . from food rations and housing to careers. The final class of people are . categorised as ‘hostile’. These are the children of the intelligentsia . such as doctors, Christian ministers, merchants or lawyers. They are . taken from their families and forced to live in barren regions of the . country near China where it is cold, windy and mountainous. The hostiles . constitute 20 per cent of the population in what must be the most . class-stratified society on earth. North . Korea is a totalitarian dictatorship where loudspeakers pump out . propaganda on the streets and in factories and mines. It practises total . surveillance, with the spies being spied on by other spies. Anyone . who falls foul of the regime — and sins range from listening to South . Korean radio stations and failing to praise the leader sufficiently, to . attempting flight to China in order to avoid starvation — is put in one . of the country’s six vast prison camps that house 200,000 people. And . it’s not just the offender who suffers. The regime practices . inter-generational punishment. This means that his or her parents and . offspring are incarcerated too, often for their entire lives. Power passed to son: North Korean soldiers mourn Kim Jong-il, known as the Supreme Leader, among weeks of hysterical compulsory mourning last year . These camps are huge complexes, sometimes as large as Los Angeles in extent, except that they are surrounded by electric fences and watchtowers. Inmates toil in mines from before dawn to dusk, and then have to sit through indoctrination sessions where they are often beaten for real or imaginary infractions of rules that are only known to the guards.  A place in college is awarded to any guard who shoots dead anyone trying to escape. Executions and torture are rife. Rare accounts from defectors have mentioned specially-trained dogs being set on prisoners to maul them to death. There even have been horrifying accounts of female prisoners being routinely raped by guards and the foetuses that result being cut from their wombs. Numbers in the prisons are also kept down through natural attrition — the heavy manual work often proves fatal on a diet so inadequate that those who manage to supplement it with insects or rat meat are considered highly fortunate. Unsurprisingly, North Korea’s economy is moribund and its agriculture disastrous. During the Nineties, the country was a million tons short of rice and cereal grains annually, and anywhere between a million and three million people starved to death. Deadly game of extortion: Kim Jong-un manages to fund the fourth largest army in the world with one million troops on the South Korean border alone . Yet Kim Jong-un manages to fund the fourth largest army in the world, with one million troops on the South Korean border alone, and 13,000 artillery pieces that could rain chemical shells as well as high explosives on Seoul to the South. His regime regularly sinks ships that sail too close to islands in disputed waters. Sometimes it shells these islands too, killing South Korean soldiers and civilians. By indulging in his military escapades, Kim Jong-un is practising a deadly game of extortion — and one which until now has proved successful. Invariably either South Korea or the U.S. have responded by trying to appease the regime with the shipments of supplies it needs to feed its starving population. But as Kim Jong-un moves ever closer to being able to brandish nuclear weapons, the stakes are raised higher and higher. And one day this monstrous rogue, isolated from reality by his cowering people and fawning court of generals, may provoke a military response from his neighbours the consequences of which do not bear thinking about.

"Britain was dragged deeper into the Iraq crisis last night as it emerged another 150 special forces troops are being deployed. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the mission had escalated beyond a humanitarian one and could last for months. British forces are now helping Iraq to ‘combat’ the rise of Islamic State and its extreme form of terrorism, he said. And in his most uncompromising intervention to date, Prime Minister David Cameron warned that the situation may now require ‘military action to go after the terrorists’. Scroll down for videos . Change of tack: Michael Fallon, pictured meeting British forces at the RAF base in Akrotiri, Cyprus this weekend, said the mission had escalated beyond a humanitarian one and could last for months . He said the Islamist fanatics of IS had to be stopped before they became strong enough to launch attacks on British soil. Mr Cameron spoke amid a series of dramatic developments on the ground that will fuel concerns about mission creep and prompt fresh demands for the recall of Parliament: . Mission: A RAF Tornado lands at RAF Akrotiri. British military planes are flying deeper into Iraq to capture surveillance footage of jihadist fighters . Purpose: Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and transporting supplies to Kurdish forces . The new deployment of 150 special forces troops is likely to begin later this week. It will include signals specialists and electronics experts with equipment capable of intercepting voice transmissions at a distance of more than 150 miles. There will also be men from a new SBS unit which will be used to monitor sensitive areas of the Jordanian border. Earlier, Mr Cameron said Britain should use its military prowess to stop Islamists creating ‘a terrorist state on the shores of the Mediterranean’. He said the UK was ‘in  the middle of a generational  struggle against a poisonous and  extremist ideology’. The Prime Minister added: ‘If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain.’ Until now, Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and transporting supplies to Kurdish forces. But Mr Cameron, writing in a Sunday newspaper, said: ‘True security will only be achieved if we use all our resources – aid, diplomacy, our military prowess – to help bring about a more stable world.’ He added: ‘We need a firm security . response, whether that is military action to go after the terrorists, . international co-operation on intelligence and counter-terrorism or . uncompromising action against terrorists at home.’ While . saying he did not back full-scale military involvement and ‘sending . armies to fight or occupy’, Mr Cameron left open the possibility of . Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish . troops on the ground. Speaking . on a visit to the RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, Mr Fallon said: ‘This is . not simply a humanitarian mission. We and other countries in Europe are . determined to do what we can to help the government of Iraq combat this . new and very extreme form of terrorism.’ Mr . Fallon revealed that troops from 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment . flew in as part of preparations for a helicopter mission to save . stranded members of the Yazidi group on a mountainside. They were on the . ground for 24 hours before flying back to Cyprus after the operation . was called off. Addressing airmen and soldiers at the . base, Mr Fallon said: ‘This mission isn’t over. The humanitarian needs . are there…There may well now be in the next few weeks and months other . ways that we may need to help save life, protect people. We are going to . need all of you again and the surveillance you are able to give us.’ Advance: A Kurdish peshmerga fighter close to the strategically important Mosul Dam, which Kurdish and US forces are poised to take back . In recent weeks IS fighters have . seized vast swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, advancing towards Baghdad . and prompting US air strikes. Yesterday, . US warplanes helped by Kurdish forces were on the brink of recapturing . the Mosul Dam, which supplies water and electricity to northern Iraq, . amid ‘fierce resistance’ from Islamists. It was reported yesterday that . another 300 Yazidi men from the Sinjar mountain area are among their . victims, with some beheaded in front of their own families. British . military planes are filming surveillance footage on jihadist fighters . which is passed to the US and used to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces. The UK has more than 100 members of the SAS, SBS, Reconnaissance . Regiment and signals specialists in Baghdad and  around Irbil. Plight: Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community settle at the Qandil mountains near the Turkish border outside Zakho, 300 miles northwest of Baghdad . Support: Displaced Yazidis find shelter under a bridge.

"Hikers risk death or serious injury when they climb the world's most dangerous trail, Mount Hua near the city of Huayin in China. The picturesque views are extraordinary but every hiker has to endure stomach-churning drops and dangerously narrow paths along the way. A one-foot wide plank is the only security measure for brave climbers who brave the  2,154-meter tall mountain. Drop: Hikers have to endure stomach-churning drops on Mount Hua near the city of Huayin in China . Hiker Eric Tesch uploaded the terrifying point-of view footage of his climb on YouTube. Under the video he comments that 'harnesses act as a safety barrier and keep you attached to the mountain face at all times'. The American  sticks his leg over the edge on a number of occasions and as he stands on the steep steps which were carved into the rock with chains for support. Mr Tesch then says, 'Here are some good steps here.' During the video Mr Tesch appears to be very calm despite the incredible height and the impending danger posed by the dangerous trail. 'I don't know why but this is not scary at all,' Mr Tesch says, 'I think it's because we're connected.' As Mr Tesch looks down at the harrowing drop he says, 'This is kinda weird. Yeah this is, this is incredible.' Fear: Eric Tesch who appears in the video seems to be calm and relaxed despite the obvious danger . Joker: Mr Tesch even jokes around as he walks along the narrow meandering trail . The walkways up Mount Hua consist of steep meandering staircases, unforgiving ascents and a notorious wooden plank trail which is fastened onto the mountainside. In recent years some of the paths and routes up along the mountain have been improved as visitor numbers to the popular Chinese tourist attraction have increased. However, the hike is still widely regarded as one of the most dangerous hiking trails in the world. There are no official statistics on deaths on Mount Hua but it has been estimated that the mountain claims the lives of about 100 lives every year. The most dangerous section of the Mount Hua trail is the Changong Zhandao, a narrow plank path . Colorfully described as the 'plankwalk in the sky' the visitors to Mount Hua are primarily regarded as young adrenaline-fuelled daredevils. The most dangerous section of the Mount Hua trail is the Changong Zhandao, which is a perilously narrow (13 by one foot long) plank path which meanders around a vertical cliff. The safety measures at Changong Zhandao are at best described as precarious. Climbers are encouraged to bring their own harness equipment as there is no safety rail or chain for hikers to securely attach themselves. During the second century Mount Hua was a notable religious centre as the renowned Daoist temple was being constructed and despite the risk, climbers continue to visit the site in large numbers.","Mount Hua in China is known as 'most precipitous mountain under heaven'

"The Bank of England's chief economist has said interest rates are likely to remain ‘lower for longer’ as the ‘jobs-rich and pay-poor’ recovery from the Great Recession slows. Andy Haldane said he was concerned about the outlook for the economy because of weaker global growth, low pay rises and political and financial risks. But his comments were in contrast to the Bank of England's self-confessed rebel Martin Weale who has voted against the majority to increase increase rates. Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said: 'Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier' Mr Haldane told business leaders during a speech in Kenilworth, Warwickshire: ‘Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier. ‘Interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.’ Then, Mr Haldane had said the Bank should ‘play off the front foot’ and raise rates sooner rather than later. ‘The statistics now appear to favour the back foot,’ he said yesterday. ‘That was three months ago, the weather was warm…the weather’s got cooler.’ He suggested rates will stay static until after the General Election in May. ‘Who knows precisely when the lift-off date will come,’ he added. He said the economy is ‘writhing in both agony and ecstasy’ as increases in output and employment are offset by weak wage growth and productivity. ‘This has been a jobs-rich but pay-poor recovery,’ he said. Rates have not risen since July 2007 and have been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, in a boost to millions of borrowers who have enjoyed record low mortgage costs. However, the prolonged period of ultra-low rates has hammered savers who have been forced to accept paltry returns. Trade-off: The low rates have benefited those with mortgages - but those with savings have taken the hit . The stronger-than-expected recovery over the last 18 months and sharp falls in unemployment, which at 6 per cent is now at its lowest level for nearly six years, sparked speculation that rates could rise before the end of this year or early next year. But the deepening crisis in the Eurozone and worries about the global economy are now seen as a threat to the UK – prompting analysts and investors to push their expectations of when rates will rise back to after the election. Official figures this week showed inflation fell to 1.2 per cent in September – its lowest level for five years and well below the 2 per cent target – giving the Bank leeway to leave rates low for longer. Two members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee that sets rates have already started calling for an increase but they have been outvoted by the other seven. Self-confessed rebel Martin Weale, the Bank of England policymaker, has voted for the past two months to raise interest rates and believes now is the time to tighten monetary policy . Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Martin Weale argues that it is not the current rate we should be concerned about, but what's in store for prices in two to three years' time. He pointed out that two of the big factors behind the recent decline - falling oil prices and the strong pound - are driven by forces beyond the Bank's control. Mr Weale said the MPC needs to do more work on assessing the impact of the strong pound in the first half of the year, which is estimated to have pushed down the headline inflation rate by 0.5 percentage points. He says divergent monetary policies in the UK, US and eurozone will also play a role. He maintains that waiting too long to raise rates increases the risk that they will have to go up more sharply to keep a lid on inflation. He told the Telegraph: 'As far as I can see, if I were to wait until all the downside risks went away, then I think I could be confident that I'd waited for too long.' Dr Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ‘We have put back our expectation of the first interest rate hike from February to mid-2015. ‘With earnings growth currently still weak, inflation down and likely to go lower still in the near term, and with global growth concerns particularly the weakness in the eurozone posing an increased downside risk to the UK growth outlook, we suspect that the majority of MPC members will prefer to err on the side of caution in raising interest rates.’ He said he expects rates to rise to 1 per cent by the end of 2015, to 2 per cent by the end of 2016 and to 3 per cent by the end of 2017.","Chief economist Andy Haldane changed tack from comments in summer .

"Workers in Britain face a ‘lost decade’ of falling pay as wages rise slower than prices, according to a report. Average earnings will be more than £1,000, or five per cent lower in 2017 than they were in 2008 once inflation has been taken into account. The figures, put together by economic forecasters the Ernst & Young Item Club, highlight the so-called ‘cost-of-living crisis’ gripping families across the country in the aftermath of the financial crash. Scroll down for video . Average earnings will be more than £1,000, or five per cent lower in 2017 than they were in 2008 once inflation has been taken into account, according to the Ernst & Young Item Club . The Item Club analysis shows that take-home pay for the average worker was £18,852 in 2008. After inflation has been taken into account, it fell to £17,713 last year and is expected to drop to £17,611 this year before edging up to £17,827 in 2017. But that is still £1,025, or 5.4 per cent lower, than in 2008, leaving British families worse off than they were before the crisis struck. The report comes at a particularly sensitive time during the final party conference season before the General Election in May, with living standards set to be a major issue between now and polling day. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: ‘Households are facing a lost decade of real wage growth which will mean consumer spending growth will be low by historic standards . ‘Total household incomes have strengthened because more people are in work but individuals do not have extra money in their pockets. The figures highlight the so-called ‘cost-of-living crisis’ gripping families across the country in the aftermath of the financial crash . ‘We expect this trend to continue for several years to come and it will be mirrored with a slowdown in consumer spending growth.’ Workers across a wide range of incomes are feeling the pain, according to the report. Those in the bottom 10 per cent will have seen take-home pay fall from £7,361 in 2008 to £7,077 in 2017, while those in the top 10 per cent will have seen earnings drop from £37,735 to £35,632. Mr Beck added: ‘The squeezed middle is also going to continue to struggle, as limited growth in disposable incomes, reflecting weak pay rises and the threat of jobs being automated, leaves them no choice but to remain frugal with spending.’ A separate report by the Centre for Policy Studies shows the cost-of-living crisis started under the last Labour government in 2007. Economist Tim Morgan, who wrote the report, said: ‘It would be disingenuous to blame this cost of living crisis on the Coalition, since the decline in real living standards clearly began earlier.’ And Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘The deterioration in living standards is a clear consequence of Labour’s mismanagement of the economy. ‘But if Ronald Reagan’s famous question – “Are you better off than you were four years ago” – were to be asked today, the answer for most people in Britain would be “No”. Coupled with the fragility of economic recovery, the Coalition must resist the temptation to be complacent. Much more needs to be done.’","Average earnings will be five per cent lower in 2017 than 2008 after inflation .

"For decades, the Kennedys kept quiet about Rosemary, JFK's younger sister, who was born with mental disabilities and whose botched lobotomy saw her sent away to an institution for life. But now, Rosemary's nephew Timothy Shriver has opened up about the family's secret - and his memories of his aunt being able to speak just a handful of words before her death in 2005. In a new book about his work with disabled athletes, 'Fully Alive', he has detailed the family's relationship with his aunt Rosemary, who was the family's driving force behind helping others. He reveals how her father, Joe, went ahead with the lobotomy behind his family's back, and how, 'shattered by the results of his decision', he refused to visit her for the rest of his life. Scroll down for video . Distinguished family: Rosemary Kennedy, sitting second from right, was born with mental disabilities and underwent a lobotomy aged 23 before vanishing into obscurity. She is pictured in the 1930s with her family, L-R, Joseph Jr, Robert, Edward, John, Joseph Sr, Rose, Eunice, Jean, Patricia, Rosemary and Kathleen . Stepping out: Rosemary, then 19, is pictured right with her mother Rose and sister Kathleen in May 1938, when they were presented at Court. She underwent the botched lobotomy three years later . Rosemary's family speculated that her disabilities were due to oxygen deprivation when she was born and they tried their hardest to keep them a secret - sending her to the same school as her siblings and including her in their hobbies, according to excerpts of the book in People magazine. 'They tried to hide Rosemary's condition from their friends, and even from Rosemary herself,' Shriver, 55, wrote. 'But the code of silence led Rosemary to become confused and frustrated when she could not keep up.' After moving to England with her father's job as ambassador to Great Britain, and initially enjoying the praise that followed her society debut, Rosemary quickly became angry and violent. In 1941, her father spoke to the doctors about his daughter's temper. 'My grandfather scheduled a lobotomy for Rosemary - without telling my grandmother or any of his other children,' Shriver wrote. Secret: After Rosemary (center in 1940) underwent a lobotomy in 1941 and went to live at a Catholic Institution, her parents did not say where she was and her siblings (including Jean and John, pictured) did not ask . He described the 'chilling' procedure, which involved surgeons cutting into the brain while the patient was still conscious and only stopping when the patient could no longer communicate. 'The outcome, in Rosemary's case, was devastating,' Shriver wrote. She could no longer speak, her mobility was damaged and 'she lost her independence for the rest of her life,' he wrote. She was sent to a Catholic institution in Wisconsin. Afterwards, Joseph Kennedy refused to visit her and her siblings did not even know where she was. 'The code of secrecy kicked in and Rosemary disappeared,' Shriver wrote. But much later, she visited the Shrivers' home and Timothy Shriver remembers that she could speak just a few words, including 'Teddy', 'something to eat', 'baby' and 'Eunice' - his mother's name. New details: Her nephew, Timothy Shriver (pictured left with his sister Mariam) shared anecdotes about Rosemary in his new book, Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most . He also recalled her demanding that she wanted 'no diet food', he said. While the family struggled to come to terms with the loss of Rosemary, Shriver,  the chairman of the Special Olympics, believes she installed in them a desire to care unconditionally for others. 'With Rosemary, they needed only to give love in order to receive it back,' he wrote. She passed away from natural causes on January 7, 2005, aged 86, at a Wisconsin hospital, with her sisters Jean, Eunice, and Patricia, and brother Ted, by her side. Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most is released on November 11.","Timothy Shriver, 55, has written a new book about his work with disabled athletes and has dedicated a chapter to stories about his aunt Rosemary .

"A former high class escort - rated among the top one per cent in her field by The Erotic Review, 'the Yelp of the commercial sex world' - has detailed her carefully calculated strategies. Svetlana Z, as she refers to herself, moved to New York from Chelyabinsk, Russia, when she was 19 years old and had $300 to her name. Lured by the promise of quick money, she entered the escort industry and soon made a small fortune by catering to investment bankers, 90per cent of them married. 'Mostly, I offered understanding,' she wrote for Medium. 'The truth is, even for guys who hire me for three or four hours, the sex usually only takes about 15 minutes.' Not bad for $1,000 an hour. Scroll down for video . Winning: A former high class escort - rated among the top one per cent in her field - has detailed her carefully calculated seduction strategies (stock image) Svetlana - who describes herself as 5ft 7in, 119lbs, with long legs, hazel eyes, full lips and a slender figure -  remarks that when it did come to sex, however short-lived, massaging her client's ego was key. Around 98per cent of men wanted to perform oral sex on her, and 80per cent of them would ask if she'd had an orgasm, or insist she had multiple orgasms before they did. This wasn't about her pleasure, of course, it was their need to 'prove themselves.' Svetlana faked orgasms with relative ease and presumably on nearly every occasion. Her mind, she says, was always in business mode. She refers to one instance in which a client asked to pour honey all over her before they had sex. She agreed - but only after he agreed to pay triple her hourly rate - and she spent the whole rampant session mulling over cleaning the sheets and re-doing her hair and make-up. With regards to her beauty regime, Svetlana cut no corners. She admits she 'didn't each much,' employed a personal trainer and had manicures and pedicures - always red, 'any other color is taking a risk' - at least twice a week. Her mascara cost her $130, her eye shadow, foundation and lipstick cost $50 a pop, regular hair appointments cost $200, lingerie sets cost $600, not to mention the clothes and shoes. One of Svetlana's biggest overheads were the ads she placed on Eros.com; the 'best' site for high-class escorts and '$2,000-an-hour porn stars,' who pay a base fee of $400 a month to be listed. Svetlana, evidently a shrewd businesswoman, found that by representing herself, she didn't have to pay an agent the standard 30-40per cent of her fee. Instead, she spent almost $4,000 a month buying up the most prominent spaces on Eros.com, and flooding the 'featured' and 'what's new' spotlights with her profile. Self-promotion: Svetlana, evidently a shrewd businesswoman,  spent almost $4,000 a month buying up the most prominent spaces on Eros.com (pictured) to source clients . She spent 'at least $3,000' on monthly rent for a Manhattan-based apartment in which to entertain clients, as the sorts of clients she was pulling in were hardly going to travel to cheaper areas like Brooklyn or Queens. Initially, Svetlana didn't give much thought to how she presented herself in her ads, beyond commissioning expensive photo shoots so she looked her best. She quickly learned to up her game, however. 'What I know now is that guys want to know the women they’re f*****g. It surprised me, but a lot of them - most of them - really need to feel a sort of connection,' she writes. 'I always wondered why Playboy ran those little interviews with the girls alongside the photos. 'Now I know. The guys who are j*****g off want to feel like they know the girl.' When it came to her ethnicity, Svetlana was seemingly born lucky. 'White girls' charge the most in the business, followed by 'Spanish girls,' then 'Asians' and then 'black girls.' 'Men here - especially American men - have certain ideas about certain nationalities,' she writes. 'If you’re a South American girl, then you’re wild, you’re fun, and you love to f**k. 'If you’re Asian, you’re bad! You’re freaky, and you’ll do anything, and you’ll want to do more!... Russians are hot, but also icy and mean... American girls... sometimes have cute ponytails and big smiles, but guys think they’re sort of selfish and bitchy, too.' Svetlana built herself two personas to advertise to men; Anna - was more 'shy' and 'passionate,' and Angelina was 'fun and playful.' Lucrative: High-class escorts like Loredana Jolie (left) who allegedly served Tiger Woods, and Zahia Dehar (right) command thousands of dollars per night . Svetlana made herself available 12 hours a day, from noon until midnight, 'rarely' drank, 'never' took drugs, 'always' used condoms and demanded payment in advance - although, she says, it's best to pretend the envelope 'doesn't exist.' She made it a rule never to ask men about their families, but remarks that it's surprising how often they 'brag' about their kids. Most importantly of all, amid the hours and hours of chatter, she never opened up about her own problems. 'A billionaire doesn't understand what s****y problems I have,' she writes. 'It’s bad business.  A guy will complain to you over and over, but he doesn't want to hear your complaints. I promise you that.' Svetlana was highly tactful when it came to demanding the best. Rather than appear spoiled in her requests to fly first class while travelling with clients, she would weave silky allusions into the conversation. For example, she would claim that her 'really long legs' would get cramped in coach, which would hinder her 'flexibility' and thus affect her 'd***y-style' performance. In addition to clients that - quite literally - came and went, Svetlana had a fair few long-term arrangements too. One 62-year-old client, divorced and with cancer, would pay her a $20,000-a-month retainer for two full days and nights every week. Eventually, he proposed marriage, and promised a hefty inheritance from his will, but Svetlana declined. Artistic license: Former escort Dr Brooke Magnanti (left) wrote a book about her experiences called Belle de Jour: Diary of an Unlikely Call Girl, which was made into a TV show starring Billie Piper (right) Svetlana has never been raped, drugged or done porn. She claims she doesn't 'hate men,' has never had a pimp and doesn't suffer from 'daddy issues' or a difficult childhood. And perhaps in part to her dogged attention to detail and her carefully considered approach, she managed to avoid any dangerous or traumatic experiences. When she once caught a client attempting to videotape them having sex on the sly, she simply grabbed his phone, erased the footage, and told him to 'get the hell out' of her apartment. Another threatened to call the cops on her if she didn't give him free sex, so she threatened to post his phone number to a gay escort listing. Young guys are 'bad,' virgins are 'awful,' and 'young virgins' were a 'nightmare' - but not because they were scary or dangerous, just woefully off-beat, Svetlana says. Then there was the client who had sex with her for a full hour straight, all the while making 'woo woo woo' train noises. Aside from these mentions, life as a high-class escort appears to have suited Svetlana. Couples were her favorite sorts of clients, and she got to charge double the fee for the same amount - often less - of work. 'That's the cool thing about capitalism,' she points out. Eventually, Svetlana gave up her career and said goodbye to Anna and Angelina. She has saved up $200,000 over the past five years, and is currently studying film-making and psychology. She has had one boyfriend since she quit her former job, a banker ironically, but it didn't work out. And she has traded Eros.com in for sites like OkCupid and Match.com, in the hopes of one day marrying and having children. Svetlana has no regrets about her life as an escort, and even misses certain aspects of it. But from now, she's freshly minted and carving herself out a new - and very different - sort of American dream.","Svetlana Z, as she identifies herself, spent well over $7,000 a month on rent,  clothes, beauty products and a personal trainer .

"Israeli Defense Forces killed a 14-year-old Palestinian-American in a West Bank village Friday. Orwah Hammad, who grew up in New Orleans and traveled to the West Bank when he was six, was shot in the head, as violence flares in Jerusalem and the West Bank. On Wednesday, a Palestinian drove a car through a train station in Jerusalem, killing a three-month-old infant — also an American citizen — and injuring eight in what police called a terrorist attack. Killed: Orwah Hammad, 14, became the second teenager killed in the West Bank by Israeli Defense Forces when he was shot in the head on Friday . Conflicting reports have surfaced regarding the circumstances of Hammad's shooting. Soldiers 'managed to prevent an attack when they encountered a Palestinian man hurling a molotov cocktail at them on the main road next to Silwad,' an anonymous spokesperson for the Israeli army told Reuters. Hammad's cousin Moath claims that he was with a group of Palestinian boys throwing rocks at soldiers. 'I don't call that a clash — little kids throwing rocks or pebbles against live ammunition,' said an uncle, Hakeem Khalek, said an uncle from New Orleans. 'This all happens overseas, where kids throw rocks at military jeeps. And of course the Israeli army returned fire (and) we're not talking rubber bullets.' US State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki expressed hope for a 'speedy and transparent investigation' into the shooting. Youth: Hammad was born in the West Bank, living for a short period in New Orleans before returning to Palestine when we was six . Protests: Palestinian youth were in the streets protesting on Saturday after Hammad was killed as US State Department calls for a 'speedy and transparent investigation' Psaki expressed condolences to the boy's family, and said that US officials will be 'closely engaged with the local authorities, who have the lead on this investigation.' Another US State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that Hammad was a US citizen. Hammad was born in the West Bank territory and spent a year in the US before returning to Palestine with his mother and five siblings. His father is an American citizen with roots in Palestine. 'He wanted Orwah to learn the culture,' said Khalek. 'He really wanted the kids to be brought up in the culture our generation was brought up in.' Khalek said the father was heading to the West Bank after leaving New Orleans Friday evening. Relations have improved little in the West Bank since the August ceasefire between Israel and various Palestinian armed groups. Hammad's death follows the shooting of a 13-year-old eight days ago and 12 other Palestinians were wounded in street clashes with Israeli soldiers on Friday.","Orwah Hammad, 14, was killed in a West Bank village on Friday .

"A mysterious balloon floating 800 feet over Manhattan today sparked an NYPD investigation. The large white-and-blue object was spotted flying above the lower part of the borough this morning. It appeared to be equipped with a drone-style camera,  suspended beneath the balloon by a rope. Mystery: This white-and-blue balloon floating 800 feet over Manhattan today sparked an NYPD investigation . Flight: The large object is pictured flying past One World Trade Center in the lower part of the borough today . The NYPD launched an investigation into the balloon after members of the public noticed it flying past One World Trade Center, Brookfield Place and other skyscrapers. Officers quickly discovered it was tethered to a truck parked near the South Street Seaport. However, they later deemed the balloon to not be a threat. It remains unclear what its purpose was. It is not the first time a mysterious object has been pictured floating over Manhattan. Bizarrre: The NYPD launched an investigation into the balloon after members of the public spotted it soaring past skyscrapers and other buildings, including Brookfield Place Above, a police helicopter at the scene . Camera: The balloon appeared to be equipped with a drone-style camera, suspended beneath it by a rope . In 2010, a series of unidentified shiny objects were spotted flying around 5,000 feet above the borough's West Side. Police and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were flooded with calls from members of the public, with speculation that a UFO was soaring over the city. Law enforcement sources said they believed the object was likely some sort of balloon, but could not confirm exactly what it is. The NYPD (file picture) later deemed the balloon to not be a threat. It remains unclear what its purpose was . According to FAA guidelines, amateurs can fly unmanned aviation systems - the agency's term for drones and other remote-controlled devices - over certain areas of New York. However, the aircraft must remain under 400 feet,away from airports, in sight at all times and within designated flight areas, which do not include Manhattan.","Balloon seen flying over lower part of Manhattan, New York, this morning .

"A former college football star who stopped playing after suffering four concussions has been found dead at an off-campus apartment. University of Richmond student Kurt Schmitz, 22, was found unresponsive at the Eagle Mill Apartments in Richmond, Virginia on Sunday morning and was declared dead by emergency responders. Authorities have said they do not suspect foul play or suicide but are still awaiting a cause of death from the medical examiner's office. The university said he passed away sometime overnight. Schmitz had been staying at the apartments, where Virginia Commonwealth University students live, for the night, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Tragic: University of Richmond student Kurt Schmitz has been found dead at an off-campus apartment building. A cause of death is not yet known but authorities said they do not suspect foul play or suicide . The student, who was from Haskell, New Jersey, had been an offensive lineman for the football team in his freshman year but was forced to quit after four concussions. He managed to hide three of them from coaches but realized the potential danger when he woke up from the fourth concussion in hospital, he told campus paper The Collegian in an interview. 'Guys on the team aren't Superman,' Schmitz said. 'You may want to play through days where you can't see straight, but from what I've experienced, it will catch you.' The political science major said that his father convinced him not to return to the field and he was ultimately medically disqualified from playing. Scene: He was found unresponsive at this apartment block on Sunday morning and later declared dead . But after he was sidelined, he stayed on the team to monitor players' safety and often warned students to make sure their helmets were fitted properly. He urged the players to stop if they felt any pain or showed symptoms of concussions. Teammates and coaches remembered Schmitz as a hard-working player and former high school wrestler. 'He was a tough guy and he was smart as well,' Aaron Corp, Richmond's former quarterback, told the Times-Dispatch. 'The offensive line is not the easiest position to play, especially as a freshman. He picked up things really fast.' 'He was a totally dedicated, tough kid that worked hard for everything,' his high school coach Greg Toal added to NJ Advance Media. 'He wrestled to make himself tough for football.' Loss: The 22-year-old had stopped playing football after suffering concussions in his freshman year but he remained on the team to push for safety measures and educate players on concussions . 'He was one of the nicest guys on the team,' said former high school classmate Mike Yankovich, who now plays for William & Mary. 'One of the things that sticks in my mind about him is that anytime something positive happened, I made a good run or something like that, he'd be the first kid to come over and say something positive.' At Schmitz's high school, Don Bosco High, football players now wear helmets with sensors that alert coaches to players who have sustained hard hits to the head. President Edward L. Ayers said in a statement that the university's thoughts and prayers are with Schmitz's family and friends.","Kurt Schmitz, a student at the University of Richmond, was found unresponsive at an off-campus apartment on Sunday morning .

"An angry dwarf was given an ASBO for a string of nuisance calls to emergency services and a campaign of public abuse just weeks after he mounted a dirty protest in a council office. Ian Salter-Bromley, 54,  called Humberside Fire Brigade four times claiming he had either lost his keys or was locked out of his council flat and needed crews to let him in. His first call - on August 15 - was just two weeks after he exposed himself and spread excrement and urine in Hull City Council's Wilson Centre, which deals with customer services. Ian Salter-Bromley, 54, made a string of nuisance phone calls to emergency service crews just weeks before he staged a dirty protest - spreading urine and excrement - at council offices in Hull . He had gone to complain about his kitchen worktops being too high and that his disability needs were not being met when he staged the dirty protest in the main reception and toilets. Salter-Bromley, who is 4ft tall, failed to attend his ASBO hearing at Hull County Court as Kingston upon Hull City Council advocate Paul Thompson set out the authority's application. Mr Thompson said an existing court injunction was in place to protect council staff from his repeated abuse, but after publicity about his protest a string of other complaints were made to the council. He added the first of the wasted emergency calls was made on August 15 but was followed with similar calls on August, 21, 23 and 26. He said on each occasion  Salter-Bromley would dial 999 saying he was locked out and needed assistance to get in. Fire crews attended his home in Hull, which meant they were not available for potential emergency work, said Mr Thompson. The council-owned Wilson Centre in Hull where Salter-Bromley exposed himself and staged a dirty protest . This was in addition to his behaviour where he described the  help centre staff as 'useless f*****s' before removing his trousers and fouling the floor twice on July 29 leaving it for staff to clean. Salter-Bromley had claimed the council had not taken action to protect him from his neighbours and left adaptations in his council flat 8inches too high for him to reach. Mr Thompson said the judge had the power to grant an antisocial behviour order if he accepted that Salter-Bromley was likely to behave in a manner likely to cause harm or distress to other members of the public. Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, said he accepted Salter-Bromley had been informed of the hearing and he was known to him from the breach of his injunction in July. 'There have been a variety of orders to prevent him from behaving in an uncivilized way,' said Judge Richardson. 'It appears in August and September he has behaved in a thoroughly uncivilised manner. When he is locked out of his home, all he does is call 999 and summon the fire brigade. It is a complete misuse of the emergency system. 'He has made a nuisance of himself in the main railway station and St Stephen's Shopping Centre insulting and threatening staff. He has made a hoax telephone call to the emergency services. 'I am entirely satisfied that Mr Salter-Bromley has behaved in an anti-social manner and it is necessary to protect the public.' The judge made an interim Anti Social Behaviour Order for three weeks allowing  Salter-Bromley time to appeal because he failed to attended court. Judge Richardson said: 'From my recollection of previous court appearances, I believe if he does attend, that will be a troublesome hearing.' The ASBO will mean Salter-Bromley is banned from the Hull Paragon Interchange, St Stephen's Shopping Centre and is prohibited from calling the emergency services unless it is a lawful emergency. He still has a 21-day suspended prison sentence hanging over him imposed at Hull Crown Court in September  for his breach of the council injunction where he exposed himself to council staff. He failed to attend his hearing at Hull County Court and a judge handed him an antisocial behaviour order in his absence. The interim ASBO  allows him time to appeal because he failed to attend court .","Ian Salter-Bromley called 999 four times claiming he was locked out of his flat .

"Ukip wants Ed Miliband in power because voters are more likely to opt to stay in the EU if a referendum takes place under David Cameron, senior party figures admit. Two Ukip sources have conceded privately that they would prefer Labour to win the next election, since they believe that would maximise the chances of Britain exiting the European Union. The prospect of people voting out would be increased under an unpopular, pro-EU Labour prime minister who has shown little interest in reform of Britain’s relationship with Brussels, one said. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage turned up at the Houses of Parliament this week to see his newly elected UKIP MP Douglas Carswell take his seat in the Commons . Another Ukip source, asked if the party would prefer a referendum to take place under Mr Miliband, said: ‘Of course we would.’ Ukip has made strenuous efforts in recent months to claim that it now poses an equal threat to Labour and Conservative prospects at next year’s general election. Pollsters agree, however, that a Ukip surge is likely to hand Labour victory over the Conservatives in a string of marginal seats and increase the chances of Mr Miliband entering Downing Street. Mr Cameron has promised to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s place in the EU, but made it clear he aims to renegotiate a looser relationship with Brussels and wants the UK to stay in if reform can be achieved. Eurosceptics fear a repeat of the Scottish independence referendum, in which an offer of a transfer of powers to Edinburgh, a campaign by the three main Westminster parties and warnings from business leaders about the dangers of breaking away combined to deliver a vote for the status quo. Mr Miliband has effectively ruled out holding an EU referendum, but Ukip believes he will either be forced to concede one if he becomes prime minister or face a popular uprising that would see its support increase further. One Conservative Cabinet minister said: ‘Those people in Ukip who want to get Britain out of the EU above all else pretend they want a referendum, but actually they will do anything it can to stop one happening after renegotiation under David Cameron.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested over the weekend that if his party gains enough MPs to hold the balance of power in next May’s general election, it would demand a vote on EU membership by the end of July – before any renegotiation of powers could take place. He said his price to prop up a government led by another party would be ‘a full free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union’. ‘I don't see any reason why that referendum could not take place before the August break,’ he said. Many in Ukip want Ed Miliband to be Prime Minister - because people would be more likely to leave the EU . Yesterday it emerged that the second byelection triggered by a Tory MP defecting to Ukip will be held on November 20. Following the defection of Mark Reckless, the Conservatives are to select one of two shortlisted women candidates in a postal ballot open to all residents in Rochester and Strood, Kent. They are Kelly Tolhurst, a marine surveyor and daughter of a boat builder; and Anna Firth, a former barrister. Both women are local councillors. The Tories appear to be hoping to capitalise on Ukip’s significant ‘women problem’ by opting for a female candidate. Polls in Heywood and Middleton, the Manchester seat where Ukip ran Labour close in a byelection last week, suggested that the Eurosceptic party had a narrow lead among male voters but nearly 40 points behind among women. Mr Cameron, who is expected to campaign in the seat later this week, said yesterday the postal ballot would put residents in the constituency ‘in the driver’s seat’. ‘Nigel Farage and Mark Reckless want to turn this election into a national media circus – we want it to be about you and what you want for the future of this area,’ he said in a letter to local voters. ‘The decision is in your hands. There’s no stunts or backroom deals, just a strong local candidate you can trust.’ Earlier, Mr Cameron admitted that Ukip is ‘seductive’ to voters who have seen living standards squeezed. ‘We've had a very tough time in Britain. People haven't seen pay rises or living standard rises, often for year after year, you've got Europe looking like the source of our problems rather than the source of opportunity, immigration has been too high, there's been a coalition which not everyone has liked,’ he told ITV’s The Agenda. (PLS KEEP) The Prime Minister said the ‘simple answers’ being offered by Mr Farage had ‘become quite seductive’, but warned voting for the party in the general election would mean Mr Miliband gaining power. Last night, Mr Cameron told a private meeting of Conservative MPs they had been ‘lied to’ repeatedly by Mr Reckless, who denied he was planning to defect to Ukip. He ordered an extraordinary effort to try to hold onto the seat in the byelection next month – telling Cabinet ministers they would be expected to campaign there at least five times before polling day, with backbench MPs told to go at least three times. Mr Cameron also repeated his commitment to demanding reforms of EU freedom of movement rules as part of his planned renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels.","Ukip have conceded privately they would prefer Labour to win next election .

"Monica Lewinsky's claims that she was mistreated by FBI agents and lawyers as they tried to make her testify against then-President Bill Clinton have been backed by a never-before-seen government report. Lewinsky, who attained global notoriety for her affair with Clinton while working as a White House intern in 1998, had long claimed  agents tried to bully her into wearing a wire against Clinton after news of her romance with the world's most powerful man blew up. Her voice cracked as she relived the encounter before a large crowd of millennials at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia on Monday morning during her first public speaking engagement in more than 12 years. Scroll down for video . In her own words: Monica Lewinsky, 41, delivered a speech about bullying in the digital age at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in which she also relived the interrogation . She told how the 12-hour interrogation began in the food court of Pentagon City shopping mall, in Washington DC, before moving on to the adjoining Ritz-Carlton Hotel after she was tricked into going there by Linda Tripp - the colleague who had been secretly recording conversations with the young intern. Lewinsky, now 41, maintained that the agents and lawyers, working for Kenneth W. Starr's Office of Independent Counsel, mistreated her, even threatening her and her mother with criminal prosecution if she did not bend to their will. 'It was just like you see in the movies,' she said. 'Imagine, one minute I was waiting to meet a friend in the food court and the next I realized she had set me up, as two FBI agents flashed their badges at me.' 'Immediately following, in a nearby hotel room, I was threatened with up to 27 years in jail for denying the affair in an affidavit and other alleged crimes. Twenty-seven years. When you're only 24 yourself, that's a long time. Chillingly, told that my mother, too, might face prosecution if I didn't cooperate and wear a wire. And, in case you didn't know, I did not wear the wire.' Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president  was leaked to the press in 1998 . Rare appearance: This is one of Monica Lewinsky's few public speeches, she last  spoke publicly 13 years ago . Not ashamed: Lewinsky told a crowd of more than 1,000 she fell in love with President Clinton as a 24-year-old woman straight out of college . Now, the hitherto classified 100-page 'Report of the Special Counsel Concerning Allegations of Professional Misconduct By the Office of Independent Counsel in Connection with the Encounter With Monica Lewinsky' provides a highly detailed account of Lewinsky's first encounter with Starr's lawyers, based on documents and interviews with those involved. According to the report, written in 2000 but unveiled by The Washington Post after it was declassified, a prosecutor who confronted Lewinsky 'exercised poor judgment and made mistakes in his analysis, planning and execution of the approach.' Written by two lawyers charged with investigating the affair by Robert W. Ray, Starr's successor as independent counsel, concluded that the 'matter could have been handled better.' It also asserted that the interrogation quickly went into a tailspin as Lewinsky - barred from calling her lawyer or parents - grew increasingly hysterical. It said that when the agents first approached her in the food hall and asked for her cooperation she told them to 'go f*** yourself'. But after they persisted she finally agreed to talk to them. Ken Gormley, dean of Duquesne University's law school and author of 'The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr,' said that the report is one of the few key documents from the Lewinsky episode that had not been made public. Sequel: For her second tweet, Lewinsky shared her excitement about taking part in Forbes Magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia . He said it is 'an important piece of history' that 'finally vindicates that [Lewinsky's] version of events checks out.' 'One person people seem to forget a lot about during this crisis for our country was Monica Lewinsky,' Gormley told the Post, 'She was just this foil in the clash between Clinton and Starr. Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment. After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.' 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor's minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black. She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence. 'I have observed that as more information has gotten into the public domain, that people grow more sympathetic with her position, which was unwinnable.' The report concluded: 'We find that OIC conduct was influenced, and indeed largely driven, by the poor judgment Michael Emmick (the lead prosecutor on the scene) exhibited in his formulation and execution of the approach to achieve Lewinsky's cooperation. 'The Department requires far greater respect for an individual's choice of attorney, for attorney-client relationships, and for the role of defense attorneys in the process than that exemplified in this case.' It comes as Lewinsky used her first foray into the public sphere in more than a decade to announce her plan to launch a 'cultural revolution' against cyber-bullying as she described her vilification following the Clinton scandal. She joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the 'scourge of harassment in the digital age.' 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,' Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop. Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography. 'Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,' Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion. 'I lost my public self, or had it stolen,' she said of her ruthless treatment at the hands of journalists and late-night comics. 'In a way, it was a form of identity theft. 'In 1998, 'public Monica, that Monica, that woman' was born. I was publicly identified and someone I did not recognize.' Looking back on her experiences, Lewinsky explained to the 20- and 30-somethings in the audience that while there was no social media back in the 90s, there were 'gossip, news and entertainment websites' that latched onto the Clinton scandal, relishing each detail with gusto. 'Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went,' she recalled, according to Forbes. 'A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly 'social media.''","Lewinsky, 41, has long claimed she was mistreated in wake of Clinton affair .

"Road deaths and serious injuries are on the rise after years of falling, damning new Government figures revealed today. It throws into reverse the Government’s road safety strategy and bucks the longer term trend of falling casualties. It was also described as ‘alarming’ and ‘a scandal’ by road safety campaigners – with cyclists, motorcyclists and children bearing the brunt. Wake up call: There was a 9 per cent increase in the number of children killed or seriously injured and a 12 per cent increase in total child casualties in spring of this year compared to the same period last year . Officials blamed 'warmer weather' for bringing out more ‘vulnerable’ road users such as cyclists onto the nation’s highways, as well as increasing levels of traffic. But RAC external affairs head Pete Williams said: ""The increase in road casualties is alarming, especially the statistics that show a rise in the number of child casualties.’ The new figures show that total casualties – comprising deaths, serious injuries and slight injuries - rose by 9 per cent to 48,020 from April to June this year compared to the same quarter last year. The number of people killed and seriously injured – known as ‘KSI’ and used by safety officials as the benchmark for measuring performance - rose by 7 per cent to 6,280 for spring 2014. This was despite the quarterly figure of 440 deaths being practically unchanged from the 439 for the same period last year. Slight injuries in Spring 2014 rose 9per cent to 41,740. The provisional figures from the Department for Transport  also show that total casualties across Britain for the 12 months ending in June were 4per cent higher than the previous year at 193,290. Those killed or seriously injured were also up by 4 per cent to 24,580. And the number of fatalities alone rose 3per cent from 1,713 to 1,760.Slight injuries rose 4per cent to 168,710. Long-term decline:Transport Minister Robert Goodwill, pictured, said that Britain's roads are among the safest in the world . In spring 2014 there was a 9per cent increase in the number of children killed or seriously injured and a 12per cent increase in total child casualties. Child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by 1per cent and total child pedestrian casualties were up 3per cent. There was also a big increase in the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured - up 18 per cent compared to a 9 per cent rise in motorcyclists for the quarter. The Department for Transport said warmer weather in spring 2014 compared with spring 2013 may have increased the number of vulnerable road users, particularly motorcyclists and pedal cyclists, on the roads. It added that traffic levels in spring 2014 were 0.8per cent higher than in spring 2013 which could also partly explain the casualty increases. Car users killed or seriously injured were up 8per cent. But the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in spring 2014 was down by 1per cent - the only road-user group to show such a decrease. Cycling groups were concerned that in the 12 months to June the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured rose 10 per cent. British Cycling's policy adviser and former Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman said: ‘A 10 per cent increase is a stat that should act as a wake-up call to the Department for Transport instead of simply being explained about by the milder weather we've seen in the last year.’ Mr Boardman said: ‘It's great that more people are choosing cycling as a means of transport but the reality of Britain's roads will be putting millions more off.’ AA president Edmund King said: ‘Although the good weather and increase in traffic may have had an impact, that will be scant consolation for those who have lost a loved one or been injured on our roads.’ Claire Francis, policy head at transport charity Sustrans, said cycling casualty figures showed ‘our roads aren't safe enough’. She added: ‘We are failing to enable our children to get to school safely. It's no wonder that more and more are being ferried to school by car. It's a scandal that this is allowed to continue .’ Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘Any death on the road is a tragedy and improving safety is an absolute priority for this government. While there remains a significant long-term decline in casualties and Britain's roads are among the safest in the world, there is absolutely no room for complacency.’","Number of casualties in spring rose 9% compared to same period last year .

"Home at last: Artem, who is now nearly ten, lives in a suburb of Moscow with his foster parents and other children who are having difficulties finding adoptive parents . An American woman who sent the Russian boy she adopted back to Moscow alone on a one-way flight  has told a judge she no . longer wants to pay $150,000 in child support ordered by the court. Torry Hansen claimed the money would not go to benefit the boy, who she named Justin but is called Artem Saveliev. Hansen said the funds would get lost . in the Russian bureaucratic system. In 2010 while living in Tennessee, . Hansen sent her then seven-year-old adopted son back to Russia with a letter . saying he was violent and she didn't want him anymore. She was sued by . her adoption agency for child support to care for the child, who is now . living in a group home in a Moscow suburb. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for July 13. On May 17 a judge in Bedford County, Tennessee ruled that she must begin . making the child support payments in June and continue to pay until the . boy, who is now 10 years old, turns 18. Torry Hansen was told to pay a . lump sum of $150,000 to the child she named Justin but later abandoned, . as well as $1,000 per month until he is an adult. Circuit . Court Judge Lee Russell said the $150,000 Hansen must pay includes . damages for breach of contract, legal fees and support for the boy. Hansen . sent Artem Saveliev back to Russia in April 2010 with a letter saying . the child was disturbed and violent and she did not want him anymore. Hand-picked: Tennessee nurse Torry Hansen took a trip to Russia in 2009 and met Artem, who she renamed Justin, in an orphanage. Their meeting is pictured here . The case created an international uproar and prompted Russia to temporarily halt its adoption program with the U.S. The World Association for Children and Parents, which helped Hansen adopt the child, then filed a lawsuit seeking child support. Hansen has since moved to Redding, California and has failed to show up at any of the hearings, said Larry Crain, an attorney for the adoption agency. She has hired a series of three Tennessee lawyers to represent her but the most recent one, he said, has been granted permission to leave the case. She did, however, hire a court reporter to attend the hearing. Hansen filed a lawsuit last month in California against representatives of a Russian orphanage saying the Russian Federation Supreme Court annulled the adoption. 'In doing so, it denied defendants the ability to recover a sum of money in the form of child support from plaintiff,' the suit says. Happier times: Artem now calls Vera Egorova, right, Mama. Pavel Astakhov, left, has a special interest in Artem's case and makes periodic visits to the SOS Village in Tomilino where Artem is living . Hansen wants the California court to recognize the Russian decision. Adoption advocates hailed the Tennessee court order as a measure of justice for the boy, and said the judge's decision would show there are consequences to abandoning adopted children. Hansen apparently never told social workers that she was having problems with the boy. The agency sued Hansen to deter others from doing anything similar and to show the Russians that 'you cannot do this in America and get away with it,' Mr Crain said. 'It has certainly caused concern on the part of Russian officials that unless there are consequences when a parent abandons a child placed in their home, there's a need for safeguards to make sure this never occurs,' he added. The judge said in his order that when Hansen adopted the boy she signed a contract acknowledging that it was possible the child could have physical, emotional or behavior problems that were unreported and even unknown to the adoption agency. Lee said $58,000 of the $150,000 will pay for the past two years' worth of support and medical fees for the boy in Russia. Court documents say the boy was hospitalized for three weeks after he returned to Moscow, but they do not say what he was treated for. He was later moved to an orphanage and then sent to another institution.","Torry Hansen adopted Artem in 2009 but sent him back to Russia in 2010 .

"Can you tell me how many stars are in the sky tonight? Can you call Windsor Castle and find out if the Queen is in? Can you store my lobster in your freezer? These are just some of the peculiar requests Travelodge staff have been asked by customers over the last year. The UK hotel chain has revealed the most bizarre requests that some of its 17 million customers have asked whilst staying in one of the Company's 513 hotels in the last 12 months. A guest at Edinburgh Central Travelodge asked a staff member if he could borrow his suit for a job interview . Between them, Travelodge hotel teams receive more than 200,000 strange requests every year. This year, they ranged from the innocuous but fairly odd: 'I have lost my friend, can you send someone to go and find him?' to the helpful: 'Do you have any rooms that I can clean, as I love cleaning?' One guest struggled with the basics while staying in a Travelodge hotel, asking: 'Can you give me instructions on how to use the taps in the bathroom?' While another seemed confused about simple dietary matters, asking: 'Do the chips contain potato? I am watching my carbs.' One guest asked if they could store a lobster in the freezer, while another asked if chips contained potato . There was a rise in requests from business customers seeking help to prepare for their important meetings and presentations. But even the astutest of businessmen asked some puzzling questions during their stay. One such customer who was staying at Docklands Travelodge asked the hotel team if he could practice his board presentation in Mandarin to the hotel team prior to a meeting. Another, staying at Edinburgh Central Travelodge, asked the hotel manager if he could borrow his suit for the morning as he had a job interview and he forgot his suit at home. Meanwhile, the hotel receptionist at Luton Travelodge received a call from a PA to see if her boss could be dropped off by helicopter in the hotel car-park. Can you tell me how many stars are in the sky tonight?  - Newcastle Central . Can I walk across the runway to get to the airport? - Birmingham Airport .

Can I practice my board presentation in Mandarin to the hotel team? - Docklands Travelodge . Can my boss be dropped by helicopter in the hotel car-park? -  Luton . Can you please take minutes during a conference call I have with my US team at midnight? - Liverpool Exchange St . And the hotel manager at Liverpool Exchange Street Travelodge was asked by one customer if she could take minutes during a conference call he was having with his team in the US at midnight. Other strange requests have included the hotel team at Stafford Travelodge being asked by a customer 'Does my pet jaguar count as a cat in your pet policy?' The receptionist at Lutterworth Travelodge was asked by one customer 'What time does the 24 hour reception close?' At Gatwick Airport Travelodge, a customer asked the hotel manager 'Does the plane pull up outside of the hotel or do you drive us to the plane in the morning for my flight to the Caribbean?' Shakila Ahmed, Travelodge Spokeswoman said: 'Our annual bizarre requests audit of 513 hotels reveals over 200,000 unusual requests by our business and leisure customers, with some more bizarre than others. 'Our hotel teams will always try their best to accommodate customer requests but there are just some requests that we just can't help with, such as changing the weather or counting the stars in the sky.'","UK hotel chain reveal the most bizarre requests they have received .

"It has been almost 10 years in the making. But today Richard Branson's long-awaited SpaceShipTwo, destined to fly passengers to space for a cool $250,000 (£150,000), crashed during a test flight. The catastrophic explosion is the latest disaster in a slew of delays and set-backs that have plagued the seemingly perpetual project. Branson announced his ambition to reach space in 2005, and immediately received  requests from celebrities - including Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry - wanting to nab a seat on the craft. The unprecedented venture was dubbed 'classic Branson', tying neatly with the Virgin boss's notorious penchant for taking risks and pushing limits, in everything from boats to hot air balloons. Scroll down for video . Risk-taker: The unprecedented venture was dubbed 'classic Branson', tying neatly with the Virgin boss's notorious penchant for taking risks. But it has been marred by delays and set-backs since 2005 . Catastrophic crash: Two pilots were on board, and authorities confirmed one was dead, with the second being taken to hospital in Lancaster with serious injuries aboard a helicopter (pictured) Record breaker: The adventurous Virgin boss started out with record speeds in boats and hot air balloons . In July 2008, Branson sparked a flurry of excitement as he predicted that the maiden space voyage would take place within 18 months. When the fateful month came around, October 2009, Virgin Galactic issued a statement to say initial flights for the Branson family would take place from Spaceport America 'within two years'. The declaration was followed by another on December 7, 2009: SpaceShipTwo was unveiled and Branson told his many ticket holders to prepare to fly in 2011. Come April 2011, Branson says that  flights will not begin for another 18 months due to 'delays'. Two years later, on April 29, 2013, SpaceShipTwo had its first test flight. However, it only achieved a speed of 920 mph - less than half the speed Branson predicted. Back to the drawing board, the notoriously bravado Virgin boss announces the first flight will take place just eight months later on Christmas Day 2013. The flight did not take place. In September 2014, Branson said the first flight was slated for February or March in 2015. Today, on October 31, 2014, the craft air tested a new kind of fuel: hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, a form of rubber, to a polyamide-based plastic. It crashed, killing one of the two pilots. Ambitious: Branson unveiled the mothership WhiteKnightTwo in 2008 (pictured) by uncorking champagne . 'Dream big': He said he was determined to make the impossible possible by flying into space with his family . In a tweet, Branson offered his condolences: 'Thoughts with all @virgingalactic & Scaled, thanks for all your messages of support. I'm flying to Mojave immediately to be with the team.' The set-back is a blow to his risk-taking reputation. Just yesterday he announced that Virgin Atlantic will become the first airline in Europe to put newly qualified pilots into the cockpit of a long-haul aircraft. The trainee pilots will be 'part of the Virgin family from day one', he explained. Applicants are simply required to have a minimum of five GCSEs or equivalent including maths, science and English. The move would have been shocking if it came from any other airline. But Branson started his career in the aviation industry on a whim - snapping up a second-hand 747 without even having flown a plane - insisting that one has to 'dream big by setting yourself seemingly impossible challenges... then  catch up with them'. He has made several world record-breaking attempts. He attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing in 1985 aboard the Blue Riband. The boat capsized in British waters, forcing an RAF rescue. A year later, he beat the record by two hours. The next year, his hot air balloon Virgin Atlantic Flyer also crossed the pond to the U.S. before attempting to cross the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada in the 2,600,000 cubic feet. Hitting a speed of 245 miles an hour, they broke the record. Another record-breaking balloon flight came in 1998: from Morocco to Hawaii. But the team's plan to circumnavigate the world at record speed was scuppered by another group in 1999. He has been known to spout aphorisms such as: 'In the end, you have to say ""screw it, just do it""' and 'big ideas also mean big risks'. Regarding his space mission, he said: 'If you set seemingly impossible challenges, you make what people believed impossible possible,' laughing that he couldn't believe he was taken seriously when he suggested that we colonize Mars. With Virgin Galactic, however, he has been keen to insist safety is a priority. The only way he will persuade enough people to become space tourists with Virgin Galactic, he told the Mail in 2010, is by shedding his image as a reckless adventurer. In an interview in February 2014 Branson said that his private space flight venture could not 'afford to lose anyone'. In an interview with Guardian Weekend Magazine, he said: 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space programme and understands the risks that go with that. Pioneering: Branson, pictured with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1986 when he broke the record for sailing across the Atlantic. His first attempt a year earlier saw the boat capsized and rescued by the RAF . Taking the plunge: Branson piloted his amphibious car across the English channel to France in June 2004 . 'The biggest worry I had was re-entry. NASA has lost about three per cent of everyone who's gone into space, and re-entry has been their biggest problem. 'For a government-owned company, you can just about get away with losing three per cent of your clients. For a private company you can't really lose anybody.' Branson's big project has attracted a slew of big name passengers happy to pay for this once in a lifetime experience, including newlyweds Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie; Justin Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun; Lady Gaga, who plans to try and sing in space; former pop star Lance Bass, who has long been vocal about his desire to head to space; and Ashton Kutcher, who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket. Russell Brand also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife Katy Perry when the two were married. Perry bought a ticket as well so Brand would not have to go alone. Submarine: In 2011, he announced plans to conquer the sea in a submarine while his space plan was on hold . Branson has recently also rolled out a new challenger boat. He has been known to spout aphorisms such as: 'In the end, you have to say ""screw it, just do it""' and 'big ideas also mean big risks' Stephen Hawking and Kate Winslet are also set to fly, but got their seats for free. Winslet because she is married to Branson's nephew, Ned RocknRoll, and Hawking because Branson wanted to offer the legendary astrophysicist a chance to go into space. Tom Hanks and Britain's Princess Beatrice will also be on board. However, Sir Richard is facing a 'backlash' from some of the nearly 700 passengers who have already paid for a ticket on the craft. Some stumped up the fee as long ago as 2005, but still have no idea when they will eventually reach space. The 600-plus takers for the flights are already benefiting from their ticket purchase, which by extension enters them into an exclusive club that has seen them visit Necker Island and the Mojave Desert with Branson along with undertaking G-force training.","SpaceShipTwo, Richard Branson's unprecedented project, was flying under rocket power then tweeted that it 'experienced an in-flight anomaly'

"Berkeley, California, one of the most liberal cities in the nation, have overwhelmingly approved the nation's first 'sugar tax,' which will raise the cost of sodas and energy drinks by one penny per ounce. A similar tax in neighboring San Francisco, which would have levied two cents per ounce, failed to pass - gaining 55percent of the vote, short of the two-thirds majority needed. The Berkeley tax would raise the cost of a can of Pepsi from $1 to $1.12, but bigger fountain drinks would get hit harder. A large Coke from McDonald's would go from $2.29 to $2.61. A two liter of soda would go from $3.99 to closer to $4.75. Victory: Berkeley voters passed a tax on soda Tuesday night, with 75percent voting yes. The liberal city is the first in the nation to levy a 'sugar tax' A similar measure in San Francisco (pictured) failed to pass - garnering 55percent of the vote, short of the two-thirds majority needed . The new penny per ounce tax will raise the cost of soda in Berkeley, California, when it takes effect next year. At 7-11, a 40-oz Super Big Gulp would go from $1.89 to $2.29. The tax does not apply to diet sodas and will take effect on January 1, 2015. Lobbyists from soda companies, restaurants and convenience stores have fought the two proposed taxes with massive campaign cash. The American Beverage Association spent more than $10million to defeat the initiatives in both San Francisco and Berkeley, according to Bloomberg. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose proposed ban on any soda over 16 ounces in the nation's largest city was struck down in the courts, gave $650,000 to support to 'yes' campaign. Industry lobbyists cautioned against drawing national conclusions from the victory in Berkeley - long a liberal enclave. 'Berkeley doesn’t look like mainstream America. If politicians want to stake their political reputation on this, they do so at their own risk,' Chris Gindlesperger, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, which represents soda makers like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, told Politico. Berkeley, population 112,000, is home to the University of California-Berkeley and has been the center of progressive causes since the 1950s. Advocates, however, crowed about the  75percent margin of victory, which came despite the beverage industry spending an estimated $30 per vote in the city on mailers, flyers and campaign ads. 'We think it's going to be a historic moment for our kids' health. It shows that a community can organize for its own interests in spite of the outrageous amount of money spent against its interests,' Martin Bourque, a spokesman for the 'yes' campaign told the San Jose Mercury News. 'The tides have turned on Big Soda.' City officials hope the tax will add $1million to $2million every year to Berkeley's general fund. The penny-per-ounce tax will raise the cost of supersize sodas like the Super Big Gulp and Double Big Gulp from 7-11 by 40 to 50 cents .","A large Coke at McDonald's would go from $2.29 to $2.61 under the plan .

"Thomas Menino, Boston's longest-serving and most beloved mayor, was remembered at his funeral Monday as 'the doer of small things': a city leader less interested in the national political stage than the day-to-day minutiae of running the city. Menino, who served as mayor from 1993 to 2014, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after leaving office. Among those paying their respects at a procession through the city today were former president Bill Clinton, Vice President Joseph Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, ex-Celtics great Bill Russell, Red Sox slugger David Ortiz and retired pitcher Pedro Martinez. Menino's City Hall successor, Mayor Marty Walsh, opened the private ceremony at Most Precious Blood Parish in Hyde Park, where Menino was baptized and served as an altar boy, by hailing him as a 'relentless, big-hearted, people-loving urban mechanic.' 'He's has gone to fix potholes in heaven,' Walsh said to laughter. Scroll down for video . 'He has gone to fix potholes in heaven': Boston police poll bearers carry the casket of former Boston Mayor Tom Menino out of Faneuil Hall in Boston on Monday en route to funeral services in Boston's Hyde Park . Paying respects: Former president Bill Clinton embraced Menino's widow Angela Menino before the procession . Close: Clinton and Menino were close friends. Menino was City Council President and was appointed Acting Mayor when President Bill Clinton named his predecessor to an ambassadorship . Emotional: Clinton watches as Menino's daughter Susan Menino Fenton, left, comforts his widow, Angela Menino, as they prepare to drive through the teeming crowds of mourners and supporters holding signs . Walsh said Menino, who died on Thursday at the age of 71, 'believed in underdogs' because the former insurance salesman who rose to become mayor knew what it meant to be underestimated. 'He didn't believe in old Boston and new Boston. He believed in one Boston,' he said. In a lengthy eulogy Governor Deval Patrick recounted how Menino did not throw his powerful political weight behind Patrick's first successful run for governor in 2006 but still spent the time to get to know the political neophyte when he sought the city leader's support. 'He seemed to make time for everyone, even a political nobody like me,' Patrick said. The governor touched on many of the former mayor's endearing traits, including his famous tendency to mangle words and names in a thick Boston accent. 'Thank you Mayor Menino': Mourners line the street outside City Hall in Boston with signs for the beloved mayor . Tears: Bostonians had hands on their hearts as they wept for the politician who shunned the national stage . Close: John Kerry arrived in Massachusetts on Sunday for the open casket service and today's burial . Carried out: A team of armed ushers carried the coffin out of the hearse into Hyde Park as hundreds watched . He may have mumbled, Patrick said, but 'you always knew what he meant, and that he meant what he said.' Hundreds of dignitaries, athletes and prominent Bostonians were on hand for the service. Menino's casket was carried out of historic Faneuil Hall on Monday morning to the sound of bagpipes. Thousands had come out in the cold rain as he lay in state on Sunday. He was later buried at Fairview Cemetery in Hyde Park. The funeral procession took him on a final tour of the city he loved, passing Boston landmarks like City Hall, the State House, Boston University and Fenway Park, as well as neighborhood locations like shopping plazas, schools and libraries that he played a role in building. 'Thank you': Governor Deval Patrick said Menino seemed to make time for everyone no matter who they were . Family: Angela Menino is accompanied by her son, Thomas Jr, and numerous prominent Bostonians . The service: Family and friends clustered into the church for the funeral service with lengthy eulogies . Tearful: US Secretary of State John Kerry and his wife Teresa Heinz Kerry after taking communion . Sports stars in abundance: Former Boston Celtic great Bill Russell was one of a number of sports stars there . Hundreds of residents and supporters lined the route. Some cheered while others openly wept. Many held green signs reading 'Thank You, Mayor Menino.' Schools along the route took children out of classes to briefly pay their respects. 'He was the education mayor. 'This is a big part of his legacy,' said Traci Griffith, principal at Eliot School in the North End, gesturing to about 80 schoolchildren standing with her on City Hall's steps. MaryAnne Fitzgerald, 69, who was born in South Boston and grew up in Dorchester, said it was a sad day for Boston. 'He was a good man,' she said, standing among the crowd in front of the State House. 'He loved the city and he loved the people.' A liberal Democrat in a liberal Democratic city, Menino helped found Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has stepped up its gun control campaign in the wake of the school massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Prayer: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Vice President Joe Biden looked on next to the coffin . Open casket: Angela Menino weeps during a service on Sunday feet away from her husband in his coffin . Beloved: Menino will be remembered as a man who shunned everything to help the city of Boston . Loved his city: Menino, pictured left in 1996 and right in 2014, spent years building and developing Boston . However, he also worked to appeal to conservative voters in East Boston and won each re-election by landslide margins of at least 15 points. He was City Counsel President in 1993 when President Bill Clinton named Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn as US Ambassador the Vatican. Menino was named acting mayor by default. The Boston Globe reports that a community newspaper at the time declared him 'Action Mayor Tom Menino' and Mineno liked the the misspelling so much that he vowed to live up to it. He won the 1993 election by a landslide, becoming the city's first Italian-American to run City Hall. In his tenure as mayor, he oversaw a remarkable transformation in Boston. He used the city's wealth of elite universities to help recruit high-tech and financial firms that brought high-paying jobs. He oversaw the construction of gleaming skyscrapers that transformed the skyline of Boston's Back Bay. When the developers proposed a 36-story tower next to the Prudential Tower, he vetoed the initial design and told them: 'Guys, flat roofs don’t make it.' He then personally approved the illuminated crown design that makes 111 Huntington one of the most recognizable towers in the city.","Politicians Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and John Kerry attended the funeral procession of former Boston Mayor Tom Menino through the city today .

"Jeff Gordon has attacked NASCAR's new bad boy in a pit lane brawl at Texas Motor Speedway after a little contact on the race track led to a whole lot of contact when the drivers got out of their cars. Gordon, NASCAR's 'wonder boy,' was furious at Brad Keselowski for causing a crash at the end of Sunday's AAA Texas 500 that left Gordon finishing in 29th place.

"A 29-year-old terminal cancer sufferer who plans to take her life on November 1 revealed she hopes her husband remarries after she is gone. In a video released on Wednesday, Brittany Maynard said she understands everyone has to grieve but she doesn't want Dan to spend the rest of his life 'just missing his wife'. 'My husband is such a lovely man,' she said. 'I want him to be happy, I want him to have a family. Scroll down for video . 'I want him to have a family': Brittany Maynard released a video on Wednesday in which she said she hopes her husband Dan  remarries and becomes a father after she takes her life, which she planned to do today . The couple on their wedding day a year ago. Dan spoke of how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married . Time cut short: She is pictured with her husband, Dan. He said he is devastated he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, but understands she wants quality of life over quantity . 'I know that might sound weird but there's no part of me that wants him to live out the rest of his life just missing his wife. 'So I hope he moves on and becomes a father.' Maynard has stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer and in April doctors gave her just six months to live. She was planning to end her life today but may delay the move because she still has 'enough joy'. The newlywed recently managed to tick visiting the Grand Canyon off her bucket list after previously announcing that it was one place she hoped to visit before she died. On Friday, she had revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my ""bucket list"" dream come true'. In her latest statement, a video produced by end-of-life choice advocacy group Compassion & Choices, she acknowledges that some people have been skeptical about her story. 'When people criticize me for not waiting longer, or, you know, whatever they've decided is best for me, it hurts,' she said, 'because really, I risk it every day, every day that I wake up.' Maynard also revealed that her health has been deteriorating and described a recent 'terrifying' day when she had two seizures and found herself unable to say her husband's name. 'I think sometimes people look at me and they think. ""Well you don't look as sick as you say you are,"" which hurts to hear, because when I'm having a seizure and I can't speak afterwards, I certainly feel as sick as I am,' she said. Maynard had previously said that she planned to take the medication she'd been prescribed on November 1 because she wanted to celebrate her husband's birthday on October 30. Now she says she's waiting to see how her symptoms progress, but her greatest fear is taking too long to make the choice. Dream trip: Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old cancer sufferer who will end her life on November 1, is pictured with her husband Dan at the Grand Canyon - a trip she had hoped to take before her death . Happy memories: Maynard, second right, and her husband were joined by her mother and stepfather . 'The worst thing that could happen to me is that I wait too long because I'm trying to seize each day,' she said, 'but I somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease because of the nature of my cancer.' She added, however, that she may delay taking her life. ‘I still feel good enough and I still have enough joy and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now,’ she said. ‘But it will come, because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week.’ She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend when she does it. After her recent visit to the Grand Canyon, Maynard had written on her website in glowing terms about the experience. 'The Canyon was breathtakingly beautiful, and I was able to enjoy my time with the two things I love most: my family and nature,' she wrote. Images taken at the Canyon show her kissing her husband, Dan, and embracing her mother and stepfather, grins across their faces. Final days together: Maynard, who is an only child, is pictured with her mother, Deborah Ziegler, on the trip . But just a day after the experience, she suffered her 'worst seizure thus far', which left her temporarily paralyzed and tired for the rest of the day. 'The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course,' she wrote. She finished the post by saying she found meaning in her battle for other states to implement right-to-die laws, as Oregon and four other state already have. 'My dream is that every terminally ill American has access to the choice to die on their own terms with dignity,' she wrote. 'Please take an active role to make this a reality.' Maynard gained nationwide attention after she shared a heart-wrenching video that explained  why she was choosing to end her life at age 29 - while campaigning to expand right-to-die laws. Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months . Brittany Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. Washington, Oregon, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico  allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough. ‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said. Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death. Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. She explained that, after suffering intense headaches, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in January and was initially given 10 years to live, which she said was devastating. But in a scan a few months later, doctors told her the cancer had progressed to Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor. Sufferers have a life expectancy of around 14 months. When she learned that she would die painfully and slowly, she decided to move from her home in California to Oregon, which has a 'Death with Dignity Act'. After releasing her video, critics lambasted her as selfish, but in an interview with CBS she said she was suffered immense pain - and wished she didn't have to be making the decision. Maynard said her biggest regret is that she will never get to have a family. 'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. 'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently - through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.' 'I don't want to die,' Maynard explained. 'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. In the same interview, Debbie, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision. 'Early on, I told her, ""It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,""' she said. 'And that was important for me, for her to know.' Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also spoke about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married little over a year ago. 'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.' She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend .","Brittany Maynard, 29, said she hopes husband Dan becomes a father .

"Senator Cory Bernadi has sparked outrage after suggesting at a domestic violence inquiry that it was sometimes okay to put women in headlocks. The Liberal senator made the controversial claims at a Senate inquiry into domestic violence in Queensland on Thursday when he was talking about protection orders, the Courier Mail reports. He told representatives of Queensland's oldest women's refuge, Women's House Shelta, they were not 'experts' and that there were times it was appropriate for someone to headlock their partner. Senator Cory Bernadi made the controversial claims at a Senate inquiry into domestic violence in Queensland on Thursday when he was talking about protection orders . It was sparked when a support worker from Shelta, Barbara Crossing, told the hearing a man had been able to successfully take out a protection order against his partner because there was evidence she had bitten him under the arm. She claimed the bite could only have occurred if she had been placed in a headlock. Mr Bernadi responded by saying Ms Crossing was second guessing police who considered headlocks to be an 'appropriate means of deterring an aggressor'. His comments angered Greens senator Larissa Waters who argued a headlock was domestic violence. Mr Bernadi since denied endorsing headlocks on women after backlash online over the comments. He accused a support worker at Queensland's oldest women's refuge, Women's House Shelta (pictured), of second-guessing police issuing protection orders . 'I never suggested violence in any form was acceptable; I merely pointed out the fact, when asked whether it is ever right to restrain someone, that law enforcement officers use appropriate restraint techniques to deter aggressors in the course of their duties,' he said in a statement. He said 'it was inappropriate for witnesses at the inquiry to second-guess the decisions of police in granting a protection order after they had completed an appropriate investigation based on evidence'. The Senate inquiry had earlier heard that a Queensland domestic violence hotline was overwhelmed by 300 calls a day and only had the resources to answer 120 of them. As the calls are increasing, so too is the type of violence, according to DV Connect CEO Di Mangan. 'Most of them are serious to the point now where you think if someone doesn't have fractures or serious injuries we're actually starting to see them as not so serious,' Ms Mangan said.","Cory Bernadi made the claims at a Senate inquiry into domestic violence in Queensland on Thursday .

"The 76-year-old British pensioner and convicted paedophile arrested with possible links to the Madeleine McCann case molested two Australian girls aged just eight or nine years old, but remained free for two decades because he was repeatedly granted bail. Roderick William Robinson, 76, was extradited from Portugal in 2010 to face the Sydney child molestation charges, just three years after Madelaine, aged three, was abducted from Portugal's Algarve region. Robinson, also known as Roderick McDonald, is being held in Malta pending extradition to the UK on sex offences. Child molester: Roderick William Robinson (pictured after his arrest in Thailand in 2011) molested two Australian girls aged under ten in the late 1980s, but did not face justice until he was extradited from Portugal in 2010 to Sydney, where he was sentenced to a maximum of six months and released seven days later because of time served . On the run: Serial paedophile Roderick William Robinson molested two Australian girls aged under ten years old in the late 1980s, and has reportedly been on the run for almost 20 years before Madeleine McCann (pictured) was abducted in Portugal in 2007 . Fake: Robinson who also is known as McDonald used this fake passport to flee Australia before he was deported following his conviction of child sex charges. After  25 years abroad, Robinson will finally be extradited back to the UK where he faces questioning over links to the McCann case . Scotland Yard wants to interview Robinson about paedophile gangs which operated in the Algarve region in 2007 - when three-year-old Madeleine vanished. Robinson, who is suspected of molesting little girls in several countries including Thailand and New Zealand going back more than two decades, was extradited from Portugal to Sydney in 2010 after allegedly assaulting a nine-year-old girl. On March 30, 2010, police arrested Robinson in Portgual. He arrived under guard in Sydney on June 6, 2010, when he appeared in Parramatta Bail Court charged with two counts of indecent assault with a person under the age of 10. Key witness: While Kate and Gerry McCann (above, right) suffered for seven years following the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine (left), a convicted paedophile who molested young girls in Australia and was living in Portugal had skipped bail and evaded authorities . Robinson allegedly committed the offences in Sydney between October 14, 1998 and August 21, 1999. He was remanded in custody. On September 22 that year in Liverpool Local Court, he pleaded guilty to the two underage indecent assault charges. A further charge of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years was withdrawn and dismissed. The magistrate sentenced Robinson to two concurrent prison terms, but because they commenced on the date of his arrest in Portugal, by the time of his sentence, one had already expired and he had only seven days remaining on a six month term. Brazen: Roderick William Robinson, now 76, was thrown out of Thailand in 2011 after a special police operation uncovered his infamous past, but the child molester served only a brief sentence in Australia for abusing primary schoolgirls and a charge of his having had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of ten was withdrawn . On October 19, 2010, Robinson was listed in Central Local Court in Sydney for extradition, but the matter appears to have been dismissed, perhaps because he had already left the country. Four months later, Robinson was arrested in Thailand where it was said he fled to on a forged passport from Australia. Thai police arrested Robinson at a terrace house in Pattaya, a known paedophile haunt 120km east of the capital, Bangkok, as part of an ongoing operation by Thailand's Serious Organised Crime Agency. The Thai government deported Robinson back to the UK to face for further charges. Police Colonel Shusak Phanatamphorn said when Robinson was originally charged in Australia over the offences in the late 1980s, he was  released on bail and fled to New Zealand, where he was also accused of abusing young girls.

"A drug already approved to treat cancer could now help battle the ravages of dementia . A cancer drug could help ­protect brain cells from the effects of ­Alzheimer's disease, new research has found. The breakthrough came as scientists discovered the toxic protein that was believed to cause dementia is not actually responsible. It is actually a different protein that triggers the destruction of important connections in the brain, called neurons. Researchers, from the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington found it is the tau protein that kills neurons in the brain when it malfunctions. The study's findings mean dementia can now be treated with nilotinib - a cancer drug already used by patients battling leukaemia. The drug can help the brain's neurons clear the excessive 'garbage' that builds up. The research, which has been published in journal Molecular ­Neurodegeneration, found neurons are killed when the tau ­protein stops functioning. Dr Charbel Moussa, who led the research, said: 'When tau does not function, the cell cannot remove the garbage, which at that point includes Abeta as well as tangles of non-functioning tau, and the cell dies. 'The Abeta released from the dead neuron then sticks to the plaque that had been forming.' Dr Moussa has long sought a way to force neurons to clean up their 'garbage'. In this study, he shows that nilotinib can aid in that process. Dementia is caused when neurons in the brain die as a result of malfunctioning tau protein, which is supposed to clear the brain's build-up of 'garbage'. This can happen due to ageing or faulty genes . But he added that while nilotinib helps the neuron clear garbage, but requires some functional tau. He said: 'This drug can work if there is a higher percentage of good to bad tau in the cell. 'There are many diseases of dementia that have malfunctioning tau and no plaque accumulation, such as frontal temporal dementia linked to Parkinsonism . 'The common culprit is tau, so a drug that helps tau do its job may help protect against progression of these diseases.' Tau can malfunction due to faulty genes or because of ageing. As ­people grow older, some tau can malfunction with enough normal tau remaining to help clear the garbage, therefore neurons are not killed.","Scientists found toxic protein thought to cause dementia is not responsible .
Different protein, called tau, leads to destruction of vital brain connections .

President Obama has asserted executive privilege in keeping many of the documents out of public view. Holder has not yet been formally held in contempt of Congress. The full House would still need to approve the resolution in order for that to happen. Attorney General Eric Holder is charged with contempt of congress after prohibiting the release of documents concerning a failed gun-running investigation . Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., suggested the vote can be avoided if the attorney general turns over more emails and memos about the Fast and Furious sting. Holder has testified he only found out about Fast and Furious after Terry's death, and he condemned the tactics. But GOP lawmakers have suggested top officials at the Justice Department knew more about the operation than they have said. President Obama's decision to assert executive privilege over Operation Fast and Furious documents not only failed to delay contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder - it raised a whole new line of constitutional questions and challenges about the power of the presidency.","The operation let illicit guns 'walk' in the hope of tracking them to bigger traffickers .

"Embattled former IRS official Lois Lerner is on two different hot seats this week, as a pair of Republican-led congressional committees aim to prosecute her for her role in a scheme to target conservative groups in the middle of an election campaign season. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will convene a hearing on Thursday to consider a motion holding Lerner in contempt of Congress, the first step toward a possible criminal prosecution. A contempt resolution, if the House should approve it, could also help persuade a federal court to compel Lerner to testify about her role in what has become known as the tea party targeting scandal. Lerner has pleaded the Fifth Amendment twice in House Oversight hearings, refusing to answer questions. But committee Republicans led a party-line effort to declare that she had waived that right in a 2013 hearing by offering a self-serving opening statement and claiming that she had done nothing wrong. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE DRAFT CONTEMPT CITATION . Between a rock and a hard place: House Speaker John Boehner recalled in an Fox news interview on Monday that he never cared about Lois Lerner's firing, but wants to know 'Who's going to jail?' Cat, meet canary: House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa aims to hold Lerner in contempt, a necessary step before the Justice Department can prosecute her or a federal judge can force her to testify in an open hearing . Lerner (R) was sworn in twice before the Oversight committee but refused to answer questions despite offering a lengthy opening statement insisting she did nothing wrong . House Speaker John Boehner told a Fox News audience on Monday night that the full Congress 'will take up that contempt . resolution.' 'If she's not going to tell us the truth, we are going to hold her in contempt.' On Wednesday the House Ways and Means committee will consider its own response to Lerner's silence. Members will 'mark up' a letter directing Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecute her 'for violations of one or more criminal statutes based on evidence the Committee has uncovered in the course of the investigation of IRS abuses.' Since the letter contains confidential tax information about the conservative groups the IRS targeted, the meeting will take place away from public view. The Internal Revenue Code prohibits the disclosure of that information. Getting Holder to prosecute Lerner could be a tough sell, since hse has already met in secret with Justice Department investigators. House Republicans claim that in those meetings she addressed details of her work that she refused to talk about in open hearings. Until her resignation in disgrace last year, Lerner headed the IRS's Exempt Organizations division, an office tasked with vetting and monitoring nonprofit groups whose purpose entitles them to an exemption from paying federal income taxes. For more than three years, evidence shows, that office played political favorites by quickly approving politically liberal groups while it slow-walked applications form tea party groups and other conservative-minded organizations. House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp is retiring next year but wants to end his career by seeing Lerner prosecuted; his committee will hash out a letter on Wednesday demanding Attorney General Eric Holder bring charges . Loyal opposition: Liberal firebrand Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democratic congressman, has defended Lerner by saying she has a right to keep the House of Representatives in the dark . Oversight committee Democrats, led by Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummmings, claim that some progressive groups' approvals for special tax status were also delayed. But California Rep. Darrell Issa, a Californian who chairs the committee, issued a scathing report this week disputing that claim. Hundreds of right-wing groups were targeted, often with lengthy intrusive questionnaires that liberal organizations never saw. The IRS's demands included lists of donors and program participants, including minors; information about prayers offered at meetings; exhaustive lists of comments left on Facebook posts; and names of volunteers. Boehner recalled Monday night that when the scandal first broke, he told reporters that 'I don't care who's going to be fired' over the IRS fiasco. 'I want to know who's going to jail.' 'Somebody at the IRS violated the law.' 'We know that Ms. Lerner gave up her right to plead the Fifth,' he said. 'She refused to testify – and she testified and spoke with the prosecutors of the Justice Department. I don't know why she wouldn’t talk to the Congress and to the American people.' Boehner also hinted that officials other than Lerner could face legal jeopardy. 4-10-14 CONTEMPT REPORT.pdfvar docstoc_docid=""168397004"";var docstoc_title=""4-10-14 CONTEMPT REPORT.pdf"";var docstoc_urltitle=""4-10-14 CONTEMPT REPORT.pdf""; .","House Oversight Committee will vote soon on a resolution holder Lerner in contempt of Congress, paving the way for criminal charges .

"A victim of child sex abuse in Rotherham has revealed she is still waiting for counselling years after she was repeatedly raped by a paedophile. File photo . A victim of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal - who fell pregnant twice and even tried to end her life - claims she is still on a waiting list for counselling. Abuse victim 'Jessica' - whose named has been changed to protect her identity - was raped and abused for two years and tried to take her life when no-one would help her. She has now issued a plea for better support for victims like herself in a letter to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Her letter reveals how she was abused by a man for two years, starting when she was 14, before falling pregnant twice and attempting suicide as a result of the horrific abuse. Now aged 29, Jessica tells how despite her ordeal she is still awaiting counselling to support her. The mother-of-two said: 'I was diagnosed with depression about a year and a half ago - it took me a while to realise I needed help. 'I first went to the clinic about a year ago and was put on medication. But it just made me feel like a black cloud floating around - I came off it and have since been seeking counselling. 'I was given dates in September to see someone, but I never heard any confirmation. I need better help than medication but I still haven't seen anyone.' She added: 'These clinics do all they can but there just isn't the funding there to support everyone. It's frustrating. Sex abuse victims exist all over the country, not just in Rotherham. Scroll down for video . 'I need someone to help me deal head on with my issues - I've been brushing what happened to me under the carpet for so many years.' The victim's plea follows the publication of the Jay Report which revealed at least 1,400 children were victims of sexual exploitation in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. More than 1,400 children were abused in Rotherham (pictured) over a 15 year period, a report revealed . A petition organised by Jessica reads: 'In the wake of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, detailed in Professor Alexis Jay's report, we call for more funding to be made available for counselling services for abuse victims. 'I want to raise awareness for victims and survivors like myself to help prevent this happening to anyone else. 'I believe if I'd had the correct support and counselling when I was a child it would have helped me and my son have a more stable and structured life. The woman has now written to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) to call for better support for victims of sex crimes . 'I had a bad time and I tried to kill myself. I felt really dirty. I just felt I was below everybody and not worthy of anything.' The victim said she wanted to speak face to face with the Justice Secretary, saying: 'I would ask him, ""Imagine if it were your daughter? Imagine if she had gone through what I was put through? Doesn't she deserve to know there are people who are on her side?"" 'The only reason I've kept myself together is because I've got people backing me, including my family. Without them I would have fallen to pieces a long time ago. 'But there are other people out there going through this alone and they're not getting the help they're owed.' Jessica's main abuser met her shortly after her 14th birthday and - despite being known to the police and social services - raped and attacked her until she was 16, by which time she'd 'lost count' of how many times she was abused. Despite her parents informing police within days of the abuse starting, officers said they could do nothing and have never made any arrests. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said they were working to increase funding for victims' services, hoping to 'double' the £50m it currently spends. He said: 'This Government agrees that victims of heinous crimes like rape and sexual abuse should receive the specialist support they need to help them cope and recover. 'That's why we delivered on the pledge to put rape support centres on a more secure financial footing as well as help establish 15 new ones. 'We are also working to double the £50m we have historically provided to a wide range of victims' services. 'This year more money than ever before is being spent to support victims, much of which is now allocated to Police and Crime Commissioners so they can ensure local services meet local need.' South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright (pictured, left) eventually resigned after weeks of pressure following the report by Professor Alexis Jay (right) revealed the scale of the scandal . The victim's pleas came as a leading police officer said there could be 'many more' cases of child sex abuse like that uncovered in Rotherham. Norfolk Police Chief Constable Simon Bailey told the Guardian the issue of child sex exploitation had 'for too long been a hidden crime'. He added: 'We don't know for sure but I think it's tens of thousands of victims [a year] of an appalling crime.' Mr Bailey, the national lead officer for the child protection and abuse investigation, admitted that continued investigations into police forces across the UK could see 'many more Rotherhams to come'. He also warned that other figures in authority including teachers and health workers have a responsibility to look out for and report signs of possible child abuse.","Victim of child abuse tells how she was raped by man from the age of 14 .

"Teenage thug Shawn Tyson was jailed for life for the shocking murder of James Cooper and James Kouzaris. The pair were gunned down during a botched robbery in the popular tourist town of Sarasota three years ago after stumbling into a rundown housing estate. Tyson, who was aged just 16 at the time, received a life sentence without the possibility of parole after being convicted of first degree murder. Killer: Shawn Tyson was sentenced to life in prison for murdering James Cooper and James Kouzaris . In June he launches an appeal against the sentence - and plans to play the race card in a bid to get his conviction quashed. Tyson is black and 11 of the jury who sat during the week long trial in March 2012 were white. The jurors in the town which is predominantly white were drawn from a pool of 80 people. Lawyers for the killer also plan to claim witnesses were offered immunity from prosecution if they gave evidence in the trial. The prospect of Tyson walking free - or even winning a re-trial - has stunned family and friends of Cooper,24, and 25 year old Kouzaris. 'We thought we had seen the last of this nasty piece of work and it just feels us with horror that he could get the conviction overturned,' said a friend of the Cooper family. Devastated: 'We thought we had seen the last of this nasty piece of work and it just fills us with horror that he could get the conviction overturned,' said a friend of the Cooper family . 'It is inconceivable that he will win the appeal. I do not think the family of either men will be able to stand it.' Cooper, from Warwicks, and Kouzaris, from Northampton, had been drinking at a downtown bar in Sarasota when they decided to walk to their holiday home in the early hours of the morning. Police believe they were drunk and ended up walking through a crime plagued area called Newtown where they were confronted by Tyson whose face was hidden by a bandana. The teenager had been released from jail hours just earlier for a shooting incident when he ordered the pair to hand over their wallets. He made them drop their trousers before shooting them dead. Tyson later boasted to friends that he had ""done"" the pair and hid the bullet casings and .22 handgun used in the murder. Best buddies: James Cooper (right) and James Kouzaris (left) became friends after meeting at university . Police in Sarastoa launched massive hunt for the killer as they feared the negative publicity from the deaths of two holidaymakers would hurt the town's main industry of tourism. There were no eye witnesses to the shooting, but Tyson was seen in the vicinity of the murder hours before and lived on the estate where it took place. Although bullets matching those that killed the British tourists were found at his home most of the case against Tyson was circumstantial. The key evidence came from a former friend who told the court he was asked to dispose of the gun. Tyson's lawyers plan to tell the Appeal Court in Lakeland that the friend and others who gave evidence had been offered immunity from prosecution for crimes they committed if they gave evidence. They also say the jury was racially biased against Tyson and he did not receive a fair hearing as he is black. Prosecution lawyers will argue that the jury reached their decision based on all the evidence that was presented at the trial. 'The verdict was reached without of improper reliance on evidence vouching for the veracity of key witnesses,' said Assistant Attorney General Cerese Taylor. Tyson, now aged 19, never spoke at his trial and has shown no remorse over the murders. At the end of the trial two friends of Cooper and KouZaris, who met at university, lashed out at President Obama for failing to make any comment about their deaths. Paul Davies and Joe Hallett said letters had been sent to Mr Obama but did not get a reply. They said the deaths of their friends was not worthy of 'ten minutes of his time.' The rebuke follows Mr Obama's personal intervention into the shooting in Florida of a young black teenager by a white neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was later cleared of murder with his acquittal causing outrage.","Shawn Tyson was sentenced to life in prison for the murders of British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris .

"A 36-year-old woman who had sex with a 12-year old-boy has been jailed for 10 years. Joy Leaann McCall, from Ocala, Florida, had sex three times with the young boy who was the same age as her own children. She was given 10 years in prison for each charge of lewd or lascivious battery on a child between 12 and 15 but told the sentence would run concurrently. Sentenced: Joy McCall, pictured, was given 10 years in prison for having sex with a 12-year-old boy . McCall pleaded guilty to the second degree felony charges and was given a 134 day credit for time already spent in jail.

He said the messages 'continued to get more heated' and he later received photos of her posing in underwear. McCall arranged to meet the boy at a local shopping mall where she picked him up and ended up having sex in the back seat of her car. The boy claimed he contacted her again five days later. She collected him and drove him to some woods, where they had sex again. Guilty: McCall admitted to police she had sex with the victim . He claimed they met for a third time on February 16th and had sex in the same wooded area. McCall, a shop worker, later admitted to police she had sex with the boy. The affair leaked out after the young boy confided in a friend who told the victim's mother, according to the Ocala Star Banner. Police were called after the boy's mom read some of the text messages sent by McCall to her son. 'She was able to see through the different text messaging that had occurred between McCall and the juvenile. And determine the dates that the incidents had occurred,' Sergeant Angy Scroble told WCJB back in February.","Joy Leaann McCall, 36, had sex three times with the 12-year-old boy who was the same age as her own children .

"An army veteran from Florida was shot dead has he tried to stop two thieves from stealing his car. Floyd Lassiter confronted the pair in the early hours of the morning and was gunned down outside his home in St. Petersburg. The former Army Master Sergeant had suspected thieves would try to steal his Toyota Camry after earlier taking the car keys from his home in a burglary.

"Two teachers from the same Georgia school have been charged with sex offences against children. Former teacher of the year Debra Tanksley, 37, has been accused of sending sexually explicit photos and thousands of inappropriate texts to one of her students. A week earlier her 24-year-old colleague Ashley Ashe appeared in court on charges that she had oral sex with a student. Police in Burke County, Georgia, said they hoped the arrest of the two women would not 'open a Pandora's Box' into allegations of inappropriate behavior. Accused: Debra Tanksley, left, and Ashley Ashe, right, both allegedly had inappropriate relationships with students at Burke County High School where both women teach . Tanksley and Ashe both worked at Burke County High School. Ashe was first to be arrested after she was accused of having a sexual relationship with a student. The married teacher is alleged to have confessed to having oral sex with the 16-year-old boy. She is also said to have admitted kissing the teen off campus. During a court appearance on May 9th she claimed her confession was made under duress and asked for it to be withdrawn. Ashe was charged with aggravated child molestation charges. During the investigation police learned about Tanksley's alleged relationship with a teen student. Tanksley is alleged to have become involved with the student earlier this year. Burke County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt Dedric Smith said they had recovered a large number of text messages. 'The text messages were very detailed as to what they wanted to do,' said Smith. School: Both women are teachers at Burke County High School, pictured . Smith refused to go into detail of what the pictures were other than to say they were of a sexual nature. He also said during the course of the relationship she offered to fix the grades for the student. 'The text messages detailed what the student needed for GPA average and she went in and changed the grades in that particular class to get that student up to what the student wanted,' Smith said. Smith admitted having two teachers from the same school on sex charges was a concern. 'We hope it's isolated incident not something that's going to open up Pandora's Box with other stuff coming forward,' Smith said. Investigators started questioning Tanksley's relationships with students after looking into Ashe's past with another student, Smith said. Tanksley was Teacher of the Year for 2012-2013, the school system confirmed. The Burke County School System said Tanksley is placed on administrative leave.","Former teacher of the year Debra Tanksley has been accused of sending sexually explicit photos and thousands of inappropriate texts to one of her students .

"Battered by 25ft waves, a terrified British couple and their pet Jack Russell clung for hours to a life raft after their yacht sank. Leonard and Lisa Rorke are lucky to be alive after finding themselves stranded in the open ocean during a storm, 900 miles off Bermuda. They were eventually rescued after a passing tanker answered their distress call. Rescued: Henri Worthalter, left, of Belgium; Lisa Rorke, Dexter a Jack Russell Terrier and Leonard Rorke, right, from Peterborough . ‘We really did not think we were going to live,’ said Mr Rorke, 55. ‘It is nothing short of a miracle that we are still here and have survived. We were clinging on for life when we were found.’ The . Rorkes, crew member Henri Worthalter, 29, and their terrier Dexter were . forced to abandon their 49ft yacht Blue Pearl on Thursday night after . she began to sink following two days of severe storms in the Atlantic. U.S. coast guards rescued Leonard Rorke, 55, Lisa Rorke, 50, from Peterborough along with their Jack Russell Terrier, Dexter . The group, who had planned to take three weeks to sail across the ocean from the Caribbean, leapt into an inflatable life raft. ‘We had to jump and hold on for dear life,’ said Mr Rorke. ‘We left with  nothing, but we are just grateful to  be alive.’ The . couple, from Oundle in Northamptonshire, were able to activate an . electronic radio beacon in the life raft that allowed the US coastguard . to direct ships towards them. A British-registered tanker called the Tilda Kosan was among three vessels that answered the distress call. The 351ft ship, which was on its way to Mexico with a cargo of gas, was 36 miles from the Rorkes when it began the search. Despite . the atrocious conditions and pitch darkness, the captain managed to . locate the life raft. Due to its size, the tanker had to make three . passes before it could manoeuvre alongside. Mr Rorke, a computer technician, said  the rescue was the finest piece of seamanship he had ever seen. ‘I . cannot find words to adequately describe how skilful the captain was in . getting alongside us,’ he said. ‘We were being tossed around in the . life raft and literally clinging on for our lives.’ The . group were hoisted aboard the tanker in the early hours of Friday. It . is due to drop  them off in Bermuda today before continuing on its . journey. The rescue effort . began after  Mr Rorke and his 50-year-old wife sent out a mayday signal . when they realised they were sinking after the bulkhead broke up and the . yacht began taking  in water. Three sailors including a British couple and their dog had to be rescued in the Atlantic Ocean 900 miles northeast of Bermuda . The . US coastguard was notified by the International Rescue Centre after a . message came in saying that people were in a life raft and needed help. Mr . Rorke praised the speed with which the coastguard reacted, saying that . the radio beacon on the raft lasts only for about 48 hours. Search . and rescue controller James Hines of the 5th District Command Centre in . Portsmouth, Virginia, said: ‘The presence and proper activation of the . emergency position indicating radio beacon was instrumental in saving . the crew members.’ Neighbours . of the Rorkes, who have two daughters, said the couple had discussed . the dangers of bad weather before they left their £300,000 detached home . to start the trip. Richard . Morley, 63, who lives on their street, said: ‘We talked about how the . middle of the ocean was probably the best place to be if there was a . hurricane or anything. ‘We were just saying how you would rather be there than in the harbour with boats and everything flying everywhere. ‘I am glad they are OK – they are a nice couple.’","Leonard and Lisa Rorke were stranded in ocean with pet Jack Russell .

"A paedophile teacher drugged and molested up to 60 boys as young as ten at a British private school after four decades spent abusing children around the globe. William Vahey, 64, plied them with sleeping pills before carrying out his sickening attacks during class trips abroad, it emerged last night. The married teacher appeared to have an ‘immaculate record’ when he started work at the elite Southbank International School in 2009. In reality, he had covered up a child sex conviction and spent 40 years abusing ‘hundreds’ of youngsters in nine countries.

Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools and chairman of . governors at Southbank International, described the case as ‘the worst . thing that I’ve ever been involved in in 40 years of education’. Scotland Yard is now trying to formally identify Vahey’s victims, all boys aged between ten and 14. Southbank . International, which has 758 pupils and charges fees of £25,000 a year, . revealed Vahey had been investigated over a previous ‘incident’ during . his time at the school. But it claimed it was not pursued at the request . of both parents and child. Vahey . underwent a Criminal Records Bureau check when he was taken on and . another three years later. 'Felt physically sick': Southbank International School's chair of governors, the former Ofsted chief inspector Sir Chris Woodhead (pictured), confirmed that pupils at the school were among Vahey's victims . Both gave him the all-clear even though he . had a child sex conviction in California dating back to 1969. The father . of two – who lived in a stunning £1.8million Georgian property in Maida . Vale, west London, with his 66-year-old wife Jean – was highly . respected in the private education community. But unbeknown to teachers . and parents, he had spent years hiding his conviction and did not sign . the sex offenders register in the US. Last . night FBI investigators described his sordid activities as ‘one of the . most prolific and heinous suspected sexual predator cases we have ever . seen’. Sir Chris said he felt physically sick at the abuse. He said . it ‘beggars belief’ that Vahey was able to teach in the UK and at other . schools in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Madrid, Athens, Venezuela, Iran and . Lebanon despite his conviction. Yesterday, parents said they felt ‘upset and betrayed’. One . mother whose son went on a field trip with the pervert said: ‘I . couldn’t sleep last night. I am shocked, very shocked. My boy is 13 now . and his class teacher was Vahey. Even if they find my son in the photos, . I would rather not know and just forget about it. ‘My son is very . worried. He asked me “did I get molested?”.’ Another mother said: ‘Every . teenage kid who went on those trips is asking, “Was it me?” They are . scared and distraught, can’t believe it’s true, don’t want it  to be . true.’ Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only . caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a . memory stick containing the vile images. She was sacked, but months . later went back to school administrators after viewing the USB stick and . finding images of Vahey and sleeping nude  teenage boys. Life of crime: William James Vahey (pictured left in 1995 and right in 1986). He confessed to a colleague in Nicaragua that he had been molesting young boys for his entire life, the FBI said . The photos . were catalogued with dates and locations that corresponded with . overnight field trips that Vahey had taken with students since 2008. When confronted, he confessed to using sleeping pills to abuse boys throughout his life. Unremorseful, he said: ‘I was molested as a boy – that is why I do this. I have been doing this my whole life.’ Vahey's career included posts at: . The . Tehran American School in Iran from 1972-73 . The American Community . School of Beirut in Lebanon, 1973-75 . The American School of Madrid in . Spain, 1975-76 . The Passargad School in Ahwaz, Iran, 1976-78 . The . American Community School in Athens, Greece, 1978-80 . The Saudi Aramco . Schools in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 1980-92 . The Jakarta International . School in Indonesia, 1992-2002 . The Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, . Venezuela, 2002-09 . The Southbank International School in London, . 2009-2013 . According . to an affidavit filed at the federal courthouse in Houston, Texas, . Vahey insisted that he ‘never hurt’ any of the boys and that they did . not even know what had happened to them because they were asleep. But . two days after the FBI filed a warrant to examine the memory stick, . Vahey killed himself at the motel in Luverne, Minnesota. FBI Special . Agent Shauna Dunlap said: ‘It appears he was able to perfect his craft . in such a way these children were unable to know what happened to them . and unable to report it. ‘It is fair to assume there are many victims. The figure could be in the hundreds.’ Graham . Lacey, executive principal at Southbank International, said Vahey was . subject to a CRB check when he joined the school, which revealed nothing . untoward. A second check three years later produced the same result and . three references  the school obtained were ‘outstanding’. Yesterday, Mr Lacey confirmed that 50 to 60 pupils had fallen victim to the predator. He . wrote to parents: ‘This disclosure which we learned this morning, left . us all appalled. As staff we feel upset, angry and betrayed. We can only . imagine what you as parents must feel.’ He described Vahey as an . ‘extremely popular teacher’ but admitted that ‘rumours were in fact . circulating amongst students and parents’. He added: ‘There are perhaps . lessons here to be learnt.’ Mr Lacey said there had been an incident . involving the teacher which was investigated at the time, but the . parents and child did not want to pursue it. Pupils are being offered . counselling and a meeting for parents is due to be held next week.  A . spokesman for Scotland Yard said last night: ‘We are liaising with the . school to ensure that any potential victims who  come forward receive . the necessary support.’ Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, Venezuela where alleged pedophile William James Vahey taught from 2002 until 2009 .

"The death toll from Chicago's weekend of gun violence has climbed to 11 - with 82 injured - in one of the worst bursts of shootings the city has ever seen. Despite the murder rate being at its lowest in 50 years, gang violence and drug related shootings turned parts of the 'Windy City' into a war zone over the Fourth of July weekend. The bloodshed has now prompted police chiefs to vow to crack down on the spiraling level of gun violence in President Obama's home city. Scroll down for video .

Warren Robinson (left), 16, was shot dead by an officer while hiding under a car and Tonya Gunn (right), 44, was shot and killed at a barbecue in just two of the shootings that took place across the city at the weekend . Murder scene: The 'Windy City' was turned into a war zone over the Fourth of July weekend . Two teenagers and a woman were among those who died - two of which died after being shot by police during a chaotic shootout. Although murder rates remain comparatively low, more than 100 people have been murdered in Chicago this year with more than 500 shooting incidents having taken place. On Friday night, a gunman who fired on a group of friends in a Chicago street was injured in returning fire from a veteran carrying a concealed weapon. The unidentified former military man - who is himself in a critical condition in hospital - shot Denzel A Mickiel, 22, twice after Mickiel allegedly fired at him and three of his friends as they left a party in the city's south side on Friday night. Mickiel is in critical condition following the spar and one of the veteran's friends was also hurt.

Three people are being questioned after officer Jeffrey Brady Westerfield, pictured, was found dead in his patrol car . Police and investigators flooded to the scene where Officer Westerman was found murdered in his patrol car . Security consultant Ross Rice told CBS Chicago the weekend’s violence speaks to a larger problem. 'I think that is representative of the gang, drug, gun violence problem that still persists in Chicago,' he said. 'It’s not a law enforcement problem solely. There’s not going to be a law enforcement solution to this. You can’t arrest your way out of gang violence.' On Saturday night, a 16-year-old Warren Robinson was shot dead by police officers. Police say he was hiding under a car, gun in hand pointed at an officer. His mother told ABC News that wasn't true. 'He didn't have a gun on him,' Georgina Utendahl said.

"British Airways first officer Sean Murphy, right, who is said to have broken his jaw during a fight with fellow pilot Peter Lytollis during a stopover in Texas . Two British Airways pilots are under investigation after allegedly getting into a bar room brawl, it can be revealed. Senior first officer Sean Murphy, 39, and pilot Paul Lytollis, 43, were enjoying an evening out at a bar in Houston, Texas, with other staff during a stopover when they came to blows. According to sources, Mr Lytollis landed a punch on Mr Murphy which broke his jaw during the fight at the British-themed Sherlock’s Baker Street Pub in March. Last night, British Airways confirmed an internal investigation was under way but refused to confirm details of the incident. The Mail on Sunday understands that the pair have both been suspended until a decision is made over their futures but BA refused to  confirm this. It is not known whether there was any police involvement. Staff at the pub recall a fist fight on one of the lower levels of the bar, which is just 200 yards away from The Marriott Hotel, where BA staff stay during stopovers. One waitress said a group of British visitors were playing pool when there was a loud argument. She said: ‘I don’t know what it was over, but there was a lot of shouting, some pushing and one of the men ended up on the floor. I remember one of the girls who was in the group was crying. They all left soon afterwards. ‘I wasn’t serving in that area but was walking back to the kitchen. The place was not that packed and I just glanced over. There certainly wasn’t a big group involved.’ She added that the group of six people were all casually dressed and the incident took place mid-way through the evening. Mr Murphy lives in Twickenham, London, with his girlfriend, Emma-Jane Ellis, 33, who also works for BA as an air stewardess. According to his Friends Reunited page, he used to be married to Andrea, 41, and has three young children.

Paul Lytollis lives with a woman called Louise Shaughnessy in a large three-storey semi-detached house in Hale Barns, Cheshire. Yesterday a woman who opened the electric gates at Mr Lytollis’s home said he was not there and refused to comment when asked about the incident. Neighbours said he ‘kept himself to himself’. Last night, a British Airways spokesman said: ‘As this matter is currently under internal investigation it would be inappropriate to comment.’ Asked about the pilots being suspended, she said: ‘We do not comment on the status of individual staff members.’","Sean Murphy and Paul Lytollis were at a bar on a stopover in Houston, Texas .

"Friends of millionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, say he had been living in fear after being threatened by 'investors' in a property deal he was putting together . A British hotelier murdered on the Caribbean island of St Lucia is feared to have been caught up in a money-laundering scheme that cost him his life, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Friends of millionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, say he had been living in fear after being threatened by ‘investors’ in a property deal he was putting together. One theory being considered by police is that money he was using to finance a new hotel development came from a drugs gang who were using the legitimate business to launder their cash. When that deal failed to materialise, they demanded their money back. Mr Gobat was unable to pay so they had him killed. ‘There is a lot of talk among his friends that Ollie was involved in a property deal that went wrong. 'The people who had lost their money in it carried out this murder,’ said a friend. ‘Everyone is saying he was in over his head and that it was drug money.’ Police have so far refused to reveal any motive for the murder but said they are looking at a ‘mountain of evidence’ and have interviewed his family and business associates. The manner of Mr Gobat’s death last week on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing. Mr Gobat was shot twice in the head in the passenger seat of his car before the vehicle was set on fire. Investigation: One theory being considered by police is that money he was using to finance a new hotel development came from a drugs gang who were using the legitimate business to launder their cash . A St Lucia police spokesman said Mr Gobat’s death was ‘no ordinary murder’ but refused to elaborate further. A police source said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a professional killing.’ The victim’s parents Theo and Helen flew from their home in Esher, Surrey, for a sunset memorial service held for their son yesterday.","Oliver Gobat, 38, was found dead in a car on a dirt track in St Lucia .

"Police sources in Tampa identified four people found dead this morning in a raging fire at tennis star James Blake's mansion as Darrin Campbell, his wife Kimberly and their teenage children Colin and Megan. While there was no official confirmation of the victims, public records list Campbell and his family, a well known businessman in the south Florida area, as living at the home Blake was renting out. The four bodies were recovered from the burnt out home, but have yet to be officially identified. The 7,600-square foot home million-dollar home, located inside the exclusive Avila Golf and Country Club north of downtown Tampa, went up in flames around 6a.m. Scroll down for video . Victim: Darrin Campbell, pictured right, his wife Kimberly and their teenage children aged 19 and 16 were identified as the victims of the fire that engulfed the home they were renting from tennis ace James Blake, left . Fire: The blaze was so ferocious on May 7 that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day . A Hillsborough County Sheriff's spokesman said: 'We have just been given the all clear to go into the property. The bodies are still in there.' Neighbors in the exclusive cul-de-sac also said a family of four lived in the home. Mr Campbell's mother confirmed to MailOnline that her son was living in the home owned by James Blake. Blake, who retired from professional tennis last year, was reportedly at his Connecticut residence at the time of the fire. According to TMZ Sports, the family had been living in the house for a little more than a year and kept to themselves. Both children, Colin, 19, and Megan, 16, attended Carrollwood day school, and the principal reportedly said this afternoon that they will be missed. Guards were posted at the front gate, turning away visitors, Fox 13 reported. According to her Twitter, Megan has just yesterday won an academic award at the school. It's . unclear whether the four people found dead in the house were killed by the fire or . some other cause. TV . reporter Meredyth Censullo, most recently of ABC, tweeted that the . victims had 'gunshot wounds to the head.'

Darrin Campbell was reportedly found dead on the floor, and Kimberly in a bed. It's not clear where the children were found. Censullo tweeted that several gas . cans were found on the second floor of the mansion. Campbell, 51, has held a number of senior jobs with south Florida based companies after graduating from Michigan University. His most high profile position was with P.O.D.S - the company that makes portable storage containers. Based in Clearwater, he was chief executive of the company for just under three years. Campbell, who is originally from Detroit, Michigan, began his career in 1992 at Ford Motor Co, according to an article in the Tampa Bay Times. He worked in various financial positions, principally financial analysis before moving to San Antonio, Texas as chief financial officer for the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer company. In 2000 he relocated to Tampa and joined Anchor Glass Container Co. as senior vice president of sales, leaving as chief executive to join PODS.

Campbell said he and his family visited the theme parks in the area about a half-dozen times a year. Officials confirmed they had received reports of gunshots but they said the fire could have set off the rounds. The fire broke out before 6a.m. and Hillsborough County Fire Rescue crews rushed to the scene. Hours . later, firefighters were still there putting out hot spots at the home. It could be days before detectives are able to sift through the charred . debris, officials said. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and it is too early to determine if it is suspicious, police said. Blake purchased the home in Avila for $1.5 million in 2005, according to Hillsborough County property records. Neighbors told detectives that Blake hasn't lived in the house for a while and was renting it out, police said. Detectives haven't talked with Blake, whose agent said he was certain Blake was not in Florida. 'He's not in Florida, I can tell you 100 percent that he's not in Florida,' Carlos Fleming told The Associated Press. It had five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

Blake's . next door neighbor reportedly told TMZ Sports that he heard several . large explosion in early this morning and saw an 'instant fireball . inferno' when he went outside to check it out. He said the sound seemed to be coming from the garage of Blake's house. They . added that detectives may not be able to even enter the remains of the . home until Thursday, due to structural damage. This will delay the official . identification of the victims. Once it is safe to enter, investigators will likely be on site for days gathering evidence.

"A couple whose £200,000 yacht sank in an Atlantic storm have spoken for the first time about their dramatic rescue from the raging seas. Lisa and Len Rorke described the terrifying moment they leapt for their lives as huge waves threatened to wash them away. Back on dry land, they now face financial ruin after revealing that the vessel was not fully insured for their ill-fated ocean crossing. Leonard and Lisa Rorke, pictured, with Dexter their dog on dry land after their dramatic rescue 900 miles off Bermuda in the Atlantic . Former primary school teacher Mrs Rorke, 49, said: ‘We really are up the creek without a paddle.’ She added: ‘We are so grateful to be alive, but we have lost everything. The yacht was our home and now it is gone.’ The trip was supposed to have been the start of a new life for the Rorkes, who were planning to sail around the world with their Jack Russell terrier Dexter. The pair, married for seven years, said they had no fears about crossing the Atlantic when they set out on April 12 along with crew hand Arieh Worthalter. But their dream trip almost came to a terrifying end when their 50ft yacht the Blue Pearl sank about 900 miles from Bermuda. Lisa and Len Rorke's dream trip almost came to a terrifying end when their 50ft yacht the Blue Pearl sank about 900 miles from Bermuda . The three ship wrecked passengers Leonard and Lisa Rorke and Arieh Worthalter were eventually rescued when US coast guards picked up their distress call. The British-registered tanker Tilda Kosan, pictured, carrying a cargo of propane gas to Mexico, reached them two hours later. The pair, from Oundle, Northampton, were nine days into a 3,000-mile journey between the Turks and Caicos islands and the south of France when conditions turned treacherous. After the seven-year-old boat was battered for two days by 30ft waves, the trio and the dog were forced to leap into a life-raft. ‘I knew we were in trouble when I saw Dexter’s dog bed go floating by,’ said Mrs Rorke, who taught children for 27 years. ‘He looked at it as well and you could see he knew something was up,’ As the water flooded in, she grabbed food, water and survival gear, leaving jewellery and other mementoes behind. ‘That was our life, our home and here it was going down. Everything we owned was on the boat and we were losing it,’ she said. Lisa Rorke says an emotional goodbye to the crew on board the Tilda Kosan, the vessel that came to their rescue after their ship sank in the Atlantic . With the boat almost submerged, Mrs Rorke – who is just 5ft 2in tall – mistimed her jump as she leapt into the wildly tossing life-raft. She ended up partially in the water before she was hauled out by 29-year-old Belgian Mr Worthalter. They then activated a radio beacon to pinpoint their position, as the craft was tossed around on the  raging sea. ‘It was like being in a washing machine’, said Mr Rorke. Eventually US coast guards picked up their distress call and the British-registered tanker Tilda Kosan, carrying a cargo of propane gas to Mexico, reached them two hours later. The 351ft ship was pitching so violently that its captain Nino Dionisio feared the group would be sucked underwater before they leapt on to  steps dangling down from the deck. After disembarking from the Tilda Kosan, an emotional Leonard and Lisa Rorke head for dry land in Bermuda . Mr Rorke said they were insistent that three-year-old Dexter was  also rescued. ‘If he had gone in the water I would have gone in after him,’ said the South African-born former detective. The group were dropped off in Bermuda on Monday, where Mrs Rorke said an emotional farewell to the 13 Filipino crew, wearing the blue boiler suit that each had signed under the words, ‘It was an event we will never forget’. She is now hoping to be reunited in the UK with her daughters Cara, 21, and Zoe, 19. But the couple must now face the fact that they have no full cover. As they had only owned the boat for seven months, maritime insurers would only offer a third party premium – which does not cover a sinking.","Couple face financial ruin after revealing yacht that sank was not insured .

"Beyoncé's sister has spoken out for the first time since her famous elevator bust with her brother-in-law, Jay-Z . Solange Knowles described the shocking showdown as 'that thing' and insisted that any ill feeling she had to the rap star was forgotten. 'What's important is that my family and I are all good,' Solange said. 'What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that.' Knowles, 28, who spoke to Lucky magazine about the bust up, was caught on a security camera in May as she lashed out at Jay-Z while her older sister stood by and said nothing. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Solange Knowles has said there are no bad feelings between her and Jay-Z in her first interview about the spat. She will appear in the August issue of Lucky magazine . They were in an elevator at the Standard Hotel in New York after attending the Met Gala when Knowles kicked and attempted to slap Jay-Z. In the footage, a man who looks to be a bodyguard tries to hold Solange back but she manages to rain blows on the rapper several times, and even hits him with her purse. The incident was caught on the elevator's camera and leaked by a hotel worker before it spread across the internet. The employee was fired by the hotel following the furor. The following day, the two sisters and Jay Z addressed the video captured by cameras at The Standard Hotel in New York. Brawl: Solange, right, her sister Beyonce and a shocked Jay-Z are pictured emerging from an elevator at the Met Gala after-party following the argument that was caught on surveillance camera . 'As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it,' they said in a statement. 'Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.' 'The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false,' the statement continued. 'At the end of the day families have problems and we're no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.' Seething: An angry Solange is pictured in a car as she leaves the event at a New York hotel in May .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a rare night out on their Royal tour Saturday when they attended a rugby union match in Sydney. It was the first time the royal couple had been out in the evening away from official duties during their whirlwind tour of Australia and New Zealand. William, 31, sipped on a beer as he sat next to Kate to watch the match between the New South Wales Waratahs and South Africa's Northern Bulls. Scroll down for video .

William wore his glasses in order to watch the match closely, and dressed in a bright blue sweater, checked shirt and jeans. Sir David Manning, one of his closest aides, also attended the stadium The Waratahs won, beating the Bulls 19-12.

The Duke and Duchess were presented with a framed photograph of a jet in flight before posing for a photograph with 1 Squadron. William climbed into the front pilot's position in the aircraft before switching to the back seat, which is used to control the jet's weapons systems. The Duchess then saw her chance and stepped elegantly into the front seat despite wearing four-inch heels and a tight-fitting knee length white LK Bennett dress with blue flowers.

Chief of Air Force Air Marshall Geoff Brown and Commanding Officer of Number 1 Squadron, Stephen Chappell talked the young royals through the jet's operation. Air Marshall Brown revealed the pair were preferring Australia's weather to the conditions turned on by New Zealand - where it was cold and rained for most of the 10-day visit. 'They talked about the weather and that it was a lot better than when they were in New Zealand,' Air Marshall Brown said. Commanding Officer Chappell said Kate was fascinated by the 'dials and gadgets' on the Super Hornet. He remarked there was some 'biplay between the two as to who was sitting in what seat'. Busy schedule: The last time the couple were seen out together at night was for an official State Reception in New Zealand . Where's George? The little prince was nowhere to be seen, having stayed in Sydney for the day while the couple flew to Brisbane .

Prince George was absent, staying behind in Sydney with his nanny. Their Royal Highnesses were greeted by Australian Defence Force chief David Hurley and wife Linda on the tarmac. Kate turned to the high street for the day in a £245 ($440 AUD) Lasa Poppy Print dress by luxury British designer L.K. Bennett, with her hair half swept from her face. She has hardly put a foot wrong in the fashion department during the whole tour - and today was no exception for the Duchess of Cambridge .

The couple flew in from their base in Sydney in an Air Force jet for the day leaving their son, Prince George, at Admiralty House with his nanny. Her husband wore a black suit with a maroon and navy striped tie. The RAAF band played verses from Advance Australia Fair and God Save the Queen as the duke inspected the waiting Royal Guard. William is no stranger to the military having served more than seven years in the British army and air force. Last September he finished a three-year tour of duty as a search and rescue helicopter pilot and has made sure to connect with service men and women during the Australian and New Zealand tour.

"A 29-year-old teacher has been accused of having sex with three of her students on the same night. Ellen Niemiec is alleged to have romped with the students during a house party last month. Families of her victims were in court to see the married mother of three face charges of sexual battery with a student. While the charges relate to a single night, the attorney for the victims said there were multiple acts. He also said they took place away from the school but also on the school campus. Accused: Ellen Niemiec, pictured, allegedly slept with three of her students on the same night . 'It started off with kind of sexual talk and it ended up dirty talk and then it ended up texting pictures and it's our understanding that this teacher had, would have sexual talks with her class on numerous occasions,' said Mike Bosnak. 'And it escalated from that into, you know, actual physical, the physical part of this.' Niemiec, from Summerville, South Carolina, taught at Cross High school. She is alleged to have sex with the three students on April 11th. The incident was reported to school staff and police called in to investigate. Arrest warrants were issued and she turned herself in at the sheriff's office Thursday. Berkeley County Magistrate James Polk set her bail at $21,092 during a Thursday night hearing. He also told her to stay out of Cross and have no contact with the high school students there. Berkeley County Detective Brian Fenton read a statement stressing the seriousness of the charges. 'She was entrusted with educating and keeping her students safe,' Fenton said. While the charges relate to a single night, the attorney for the victims said there were multiple acts . Gone: Niemiec was placed on administrative leave when the allegations surfaced and she is no longer employed at Cross High . 'That's the trust she violated. The Cross community is a very tight-knit, small community. In small communities the school is the center of the community. When a teacher violates her students' trust, she essentially violates the whole community's trust.' Her attorney David Aylor told the Post and Courier newspaper he didn't have a chance to talk with Niemiec. 'Obviously, this is the very beginning of the case,' he said. 'This is obviously extremely difficult for her and her family.' Niemiec was placed on administrative leave when the allegations surfaced and she is no longer employed at Cross High, the Berkeley County School District said in a statement.

"This is John Hinckley Jr., the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades. Clutching a bottle of soda in his hand and casually dressed, the 58-year-old enjoys his freedom on a stroll on Easter Sunday near his mother's home. Hinckley is rarely seen since his incarceration at a secure metal health facility following the assassination attempt in March 1981. Scroll down for video . Smirk: Hinckley took a stroll on Easter Sunday near the home of his mother, Jo Ann, in Williamsburg, Virginia . Freedom: Hinckley has spent three decades in a mental hospital. His family and lawyers have been fighting for his eventual re-integration into society . Mingling: A judge ruled last year that Hinckley can spend more time out with his mother, unsupervised. The judge said he must better socialize with locals in the area with a view to getting a job and making friends . Support: Jo Ann, 86, has been steadfast in her loyalty to her son and has turned mental health campaigner . But his appearance in public follows a court ruling last December when a judge agreed to increase the amount of unsupervised visits Hinckley Jr. could have with his mother, Jo Ann. By being expanded to 17 days a month his family hope it will lead to his eventual release. But the judge warned that he still 'exhibits deceptive behavior'. As part of a carefully monitored program, he is allowed to stay on an exclusive gated estate set among the lush greens of a golf course near Williamsburg, Virginia. These exclusive photos are the first time Hinckley has been seen at his home since being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the attempt of President Reagan's life. Wearing a blue fleece jacket, cream chinos and black sneakers, Hinckley Jr emerged from his mother's detached home near the historic town. He passed several joggers who were completely unaware of his global notoriety. As part of the conditions of his 17-day release he is also allowed to drive a Toyota Camry. He has to carry a GPS monitored cell phone and, although unconfirmed, the Secret Service are said to watch his movements from a distance. His 86-year-old mother has stood by her son since being locked away. She has spent a large part of the three decades promoting mental-health awareness and aiding in his rehabilitation. At the time of the assassination attempt she said: 'We were dumbfounded. I did not think any of us would survive'. Mrs Hinckley, who was widowed in 2008, agreed to allow her son to stay at her home as part of his eventual return to society. Neighbors on the quiet, tree-lined street rarely see her and she never talks about her son. On the road: Hinckley has been allowed the use of a Toyota Camry while on his extended release . Trip: Hinckley was out and about again on Monday, driving away in this car. He went to visit a white-haired man. the judge overseeing his release said it was important for him to 'socialize' When in Williamsburg, Hinckley is a regular customer at fast food restaurants near his home. The young staff at his favourite Wendy's restaurant have no idea of the identity of their customer who usually orders a cheeseburger, fries and coke. All of the servers were born at least two decades after Hinckley Jr's assassination attempt. He was roughly their age, in his early 20s, when he became fixated with actress Jodie Foster, then one of the best known child stars in Hollywood for her portrayal of a teen prostitute in Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'. A college dropout, he was living off an allowance from his wealthy parents John and Jo Ann who were based in Denver, Colorado. In 1980 Hinckley learned that Jodie Foster was attending Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He began to follow her across country until he was able to establish contact with her on two occasions. Hinckley . Jr. believed he could never establish a relationship with Jodie Foster . unless he could do something that would draw her attention. Chaos: On March 31, 1981, Hinckley opened fire on Reagan outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington DC. The president was hit under the arm and the bullet missed his heart by an inch . Infamy: Hinckley was trying to get the attention of Jodie Foster, who he was stalking after he saw her in Taxi Driver. Reagan joked to Nancy, pictured together here four days after the shooting: 'Honey, I forgot to duck' Obsession: Prosecutors found masses of material which showed Hinckley's dark fascination with Foster, trial evidence above. In his hotel room in DC hours after the attack, police found a letter to her in which he wrote: 'There is a definite possibility that I may be killed in my attempt to get Reagan' On the morning of March 31, 1981, he stood among a small crowd outside the Hilton Hotel in downtown Washington DC. Inside the President was addressing a union conference. As Reagan emerged flanked by his security detail Hinckley Jr. opened fire with a six shot .22 revolver. He wounded James Brady, a policeman and a Secret Service agent before his last shot ricocheted off the president's armor-plated limousine and struck Reagan beneath his left armpit as he was being bundled into the car by other agents. The bullet penetrated within an inch of the president's heart. One lung flooded with blood and Reagan,68, lost half his body's blood supply. Doctors said that had the Secret Service not rushed the president to a nearby hospital as quickly as they did, he might have died. A trauma team led by Dr Joseph Giordano was hastily assembled to receive the president. As he was about to be put under anesthetic Reagan joked, 'Please tell me you're all Republicans'. His surgeon Dr. Giordano, a Democrat, replied, 'Today, Mr. President, we're all Republicans'. The operation lasted about three hours, and the President's humour continued when his wife Nancy arrived in the emergency room, telling her 'Honey, I forgot to duck'. Hinckley Jr did not attempt to flee . and was held at the scene where photographers and TV news crews had . captured the pandemonium that followed as the shots rang out. In the would-be killer's hotel room police found a letter he had addressed to Foster. 'There . is a definite possibility that I may be killed in my attempt to get . Reagan,' Hinckley wrote. Foster later said she had never heard of . Hinckley Jr. Brady was the most seriously wounded after being struck by a bullet in the head. He . was left paralyzed on the left side of his body and later dedicated his . life to gun control by starting the Brady Campaign which has been the . most vocal campaign to outlaw assault weapons. Police officer Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy recovered from their wounds. Hidden: Despite his notoriety, Hinckley has rarely been pictured since his trial. Here, in this photo from 2003, Hinckley is pictured being driven to cour tin an attempt to be given greater freedom . Hinckley was charged with 13 offenses but found not guilty by reason of insanity on June 21, 1982. Prosecutors had argued that he was legally sane and the verdict caused widespread anger among politicians and the public. Several US states rewrote laws regarding insanity while in Montana, Idaho and Utah the laws were scrapped altogether. Hinckley Jr was sent to the St Elizabeth's Hospital, a 300-acre site in Washington DC, where he was diagnosed with narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders. In 1987, after applying to a court for home visits, his hospital room was searched and staff found photos and letters showing a continued obsession with Jodie Foster. He had also tried to find the address of mass killer Charles Manson and became a pen pal of serial killer Ted Bundy. As a result he was denied the chance for home release and his parents, who had moved to Virginia from Colorado, despaired that he would ever be set free. But in 1999 a court granted him limited release to spend time with his parents, elder sister Diane, 61, and brother Scott, 64. These ended up being revoked after he was found to have smuggled material about Foster back into his hospital room. By 2005 he was granted permission to spend three nights a month at his parent's home after psychiatrists for the Government agreed his psychotic disorder was in full remission. Fast food junkie: Hinckley is said to love ordering a cheeseburger, fries and a coke at his local Wendy's . One condition of the release was for Hinckley Jr to see a psychiatrist once a week in Williamsburg. In the last decade the amount of time Hinckley Jr. has been allowed out has increased as doctors said he was no longer a danger to the public or himself. While at St Elizabeth's he struck up a romantic friendship with a former patient Cynthia Bruce. She has never talked about their relationship. Last year U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman expanded the length of the home visits to 17 days a month. In a 106-page report he said Hinckley Jr must show he can better integrate himself into the community and socialize with others in Williamsburg before a full release can be considered. The judge wrote that allowing Hinckley Jr to have longer home stays could help him find a possible job and make new friends, adding he was satisfied he 'will not be a danger to himself or to others'. But he stopped short of allowing a plea for him to spend 24 days each month with his mother. Friedman wrote that it would be 'unwise' to let Hinckley have more freedom without more evaluation. He warned Hinckley 'continues to exhibit deceptive behavior even when there are no symptoms of psychosis or depression'. Federal prosecutors had wanted a much slower release schedule and had pointed out Hinckley had lied about seeing two movies during one of his release periods. The lies were only uncovered because Secret Service agents were monitoring his movements. Hinckley's lawyer Barry Levine said his client was ready to be freed. 'John has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate that the conditions that existed back in 1981 no longer exist today,' Levine told the Washington Post. 'We think John is on a perfect trajectory moving toward unconditional release, and this is part of that.'","Hinckley, 58, is allowed to spend 17 days a month with his mother, Jo Ann, in Williamsburg, Virginia, following a court order last year .

"The Kansas City man who confessed to killing the 27-year-old wife of his prayer group leader has asked his lawyers to get the confession excluded from his upcoming trial because he was under the influence of a demonic exorcism at the time. Micah Moore, 25, claims he wasn't in his right mind in November 2012 when he confessed to killing Bethany Deaton, his attorneys said, and recanted it after getting some sleep. Moore initially told investigators leader Tyler Deaton had ordered him to kill Bethany to keep her from revealing the group's secrets, including that Deaton was having sexual relations with other male members. Bethany's body was found inside her locked minivan at Longview Lake on October 30, 2012, with a loosely tied bag over her head and a suicide note and empty 100-count bottle of acetaminophen nearby. Confession recanted: Micah Moore, pictured here in November 2012, has denied he killed Bethany Deaton, despite admitting to her October 2012 murder . On the basis of that evidence, the Jackson County coroner initially listed the cause of death as suicide. Other than Moore's confession, there is no evidence Bethany's death was the result of a crime, Moore's attorneys wrote. Her embalmed body was returned to Kansas City from Texas for an autopsy and the cause of death was changed to 'undetermined.' Moore and Deaton were part of a roughly 20-member prayer group who came to the Kansas City area from Texas to be part of International House of Prayer University (IHOP), an evangelical Christian organization focused on missions and preparation for the end of time. Members lived in a communal-type arrangement in Grandview, where Tyler Deaton controlled everything from how members spent their free time to when they were required to worship, Moore's attorneys said. After Bethany Deaton's death, IHOP conducted a meeting to help members of the prayer group process their grief, 'as they said that Tyler had not allowed them to grieve her death,' IHOP spokesman Nick Syrett said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. 'That this was a planned 'exorcism' meeting is simply not true,' he said. Moore's attorneys, however, describe Bethany Deaton as a deeply disturbed woman whose husband of only two months rejected her physical advances and had her shunned by the rest of the group, driving her to suicide. 'At a time when she had been physically rejected in the most humiliating way a woman can be rejected, she was also being socially rejected,' the motion asserts. During an evening prayer session on November 8, 2012, an IHOP-affiliated group called Prisoners of Hope put 'their hands on the cult members, shouting at demons to leave and scream-praying in tongues, soon had many in the group crying and yelling and falling to the floor,' Moore's attorneys wrote. Silenced: Moore told investigators that Bethany Deaton was killed for fear that she would tell her therapist about being sexually assaulted . Syrett said Moore confessed to two IHOP leaders and asked them to accompany him to a local police station, where he was charged with first-degree murder on November 9, 2012. 'This meeting was to help these young people process recent events and to hear their hearts related to these events,' Syrett said. 'It was not in the slightest way for the purpose of 'exorcising' demons out of people.' A message left on Tyler Deaton's Facebook page and an email to his father seeking comment were not immediately returned. Tyler Deaton is not suspected of any involvement in his wife's death at this time. Micah Moore, 23, who was a member in Deaton's religious sect and lived with him and his wife in Grandview, Missouri, has been charged with killing Bethany in 2012 and making it look like a suicide. Moore initially accused Deaton of giving him the order to kill his wife for fear that she might tell her therapist about being the victim of several sexual assaults, according to court documents. But Moore later recanted his confession. In January 2013, Moore, 23, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Bethany Ann Deaton, whose body was found on October 30 in a van at Longview Lake, Kansas. There was an empty pill bottle by her, a bag over her head and a suicide note, indicating to police she had taken her own life. After the 23-year-old confessed, he said that Bethany's husband Tyler Deaton told him to do it. His attorney later said it was the act of a distraught and confused young man under extreme psychological pressure and that no actual evidence of a crime existed and that his confession. Moore is currently free on $250,000 bond, according to the Kansas City Star. It was claimed in December 2012 that Tyler Deaton was involved in sexual affairs with at least three other men who lived at the religious community he led. The charismatic Christian was in charge of a group whose members came to Kansas City from Texas to be part of the International House of Prayer. After the arrest of Moore, several men who lived in the house told detectives they had been involved in 'secret' sexual relations with Deaton. Marriage: Tyler Deaton (left and right) and his wife, Bethany Deaton. Tyler Deaton is not suspected of any actions that may have led to the death of his wife . Court records have redacted these men's names but, one witness told police that Deaton mentioned having dreamed that 'he had killed his wife by suffocating her,' a week after her death. The Deatons' other roommates told police of alleged sexual relationships by Deaton to 'discover his masculinity,' because he was 'frustrated' that he 'couldn't get an erection' with his wife according to the probable cause statement seen by the Daily Beast. Another member interviewed by detectives investigating the case said that one night he was lying in bed and that 'Tyler had laid next to him and held him.' 'He stated that he realized now that Tyler was attempting to make him a member of their sexual group.' Another man who lived in the home in Kansas City said that 'he was involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with Deaton' and said that he 'was controlling and manipulative and said that the sexual activity was part of a religious experience'. October 30th - Bethany Deaton found dead with a plastic bag over her head in back of car with suicide note . November 6th - Bethany Deaton buried as authorities declare her death to be a suicide . November 9th - Micah Moore walks into Missouri police station and confesses to her sexual assault and murder - which he further claims her husband Tyler Deaton wanted her to do . November 28th - Micah Moore's attorney retracts his confession claiming that he was suffering mental distress when he made it . A third man said in his statements to police that he had been in a sexual relationship with Deaton and named him as the household's 'spiritual leader.' He claimed that in the weeks prior to his wife's death Deaton had become 'angry' and 'frustrated'. Bethany Deaton was found dead in the back seat of a van on October 30 with a white plastic bag over her head, a purple pillow beside her and an empty pill bottle nearby. Authorities in Missouri initially believed the death to be a suicide as they found a disturbing and tragic note next to her body. 'My name is Bethany Deaton. I chose this evil thing,' read the letter. 'I did it because I wouldn't be a real person and what is the point of living if it is too late for that? 'I wish I had chosen differently a long time ago. I knew it all and refused to listen. Maybe Jesus will still save me.' However, on November 9, three days after her funeral, Micah Moore, a member of Mr. Deaton's IHOP walked into the Grandview Police Department and told officers that he had killed Bethany. Since then allegations of repeated sexual assaults inflicted upon Bethany by male members of the IHOP have emerged, with the shocking suggestion that they may have been filmed on an iPad. It was three days after the death of Bethany that Moore, 23, walked into the Grandview Police department and confessed to her murder. 'I killed her,' he told officers, according to court documents, adding that he had placed the bag over her head and 'held it there until her body shook.' While Moore has been charged with first-degree murder of Bethany, authorities are still investigating Deaton, who has been described as a 'Pied-Piper' like leader. Since his wife's death, authorities in Missouri have said that Deaton - who on his Facebook page lists Harry Potter and learning foreign languages as 'likes' - has returned to Texas.","Micah Moore confessed to the murder of Bethany Deaton in 2012 .

"A Hawaii woman who filmed herself having sex with an 11-year-old boy has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Jean Paleracio pleaded no contest to first-degree sexual assault charges. The 33-year-old was described as a 'sexual predator,' with the judge, Kathleen Wantanabe, telling her, 'there is no other way to put it, Miss Paleracio, other than you took ultimate advantage of a young boy.' Guilty: Jean Paleracio was sentenced to 20 years in prison for repeatedly having sex with a teenage boy . Paleracio, from Kapa, Hawaii, videotaped herself having sex with the boy on several occasions  between May 2009 and September 2013. A former worker with the Kauai Economic Opportunity Early Learning Centre, Paleracio was friends with the victim through his family. Prosecutors at the hearing in Lihue said the young boy would be scarred for life following the abuse. Paleracio was accused of producing or participating in preparation of child pornography materials with a minor, and engaging in or assisting others to engage in sexual conduct. She pleaded no contest to first-degree sexual assault and first-degree promotion of child abuse. Prosecutor Lisa Arin said Paleracio had cooperated with the investigation and showed true remorse. As a result, Arin said her office did not seek consecutive 20-year sentences. Children's Centre: Paleracio was employed at the Lihue Early Learning Center . Prosecuting attorney Justin Kollar said he was satisfied with the no contest plea, as it means the victim would not be exposed to the trauma of a trial. 'Ms. Paleracio's actions were sickening and predatory and cannot be tolerated in our community,' Kollar said. As a result of the plea deal, eight other class A felony charges were dismissed. A pre-sentence investigation of Paleracio showed she had completed two years of college and has no prior convictions. The judge said Paleracio was someone who used to work with children and should appreciate, more than most, the fact that forcing a child to perform sexual acts can have long-term traumatic effects.","Jean Paleracio, 33, repeatedly videotaped herself having sex with her underage victim .

"The world is 'adrift' and America is in decline because of the 'extraordinary vacuum of leadership in this country,' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Saturday. 'People both inside America and outside America no longer know what America stands for,' the outspoken politician told attendees of an Iowa GOP fundraiser, and that's because of 'the lack of leadership we have in the White House.' 'America is not being respected around the world the way we used to be and we’re not being respected because we longer mean what we say and say what we mean,' Christie, a probable 2016 presidential candidate, told a group of roughly 1,000 Republicans at a party for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's birthday. 'People both inside America and outside America no longer know what America stands for,' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told attendees of an Iowa GOP fundraiser tonight . Christie was in Iowa today to attend a Birthday Bash fundraiser for Gov. Terry Branstad, left. Branstad, the state's longest serving governor, is up for reelection on Nov. 4 . The five-term governor's birthday is not for several weeks but he celebrated early this year, turning the annual affair into a fundraiser for his reelection campaign. Party faithful and candidates in the midwestern state's midterm elections gathered at the 7 Flags Event Center in Clive, Iowa, on Saturday evening to fete Branstad, the state's longest serving governor - and to see Christie, the event's special guest. Fresh off a speech in Washington, D.C. this week in which he threw caution to the wind and proclaimed that 'it's time to start offending' people, Christie traveled to Iowa today, a key presidential primary state, to stump for conservative firebrand Steve King and attend Branstad's birthday bash. At a fundraiser for King in Akron on Saturday afternoon, Christie endorsed the Republican congressman and encouraged Iowans to elect more lawmakers who aren't shy about sharing their convictions. 'One of the things that Steve and I share is an absolute commitment to speaking our mind,' Christie said, according to Iowa's KTIV News Channel 4. 'And I think that would be a good thing no matter what office you're running for,' he added. 'Speaking your mind is something that people of this country want more of. Christie said that people are not always 'going to agree with you' but 'fact is, if they know where you stand, that's the most important thing.' Christie greets Joni Ernst, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Iowa, at tonight's party. 'Maybe you'll be making some more trips to Iowa soon. I don't know, what do you think?' Ernst asked Christie tonight . Though he has not officially declared his candidacy for president, Christie, now in his second term as governor of New Jersey, is widely expected to seek the Republican nomination to the presidency in 2016. Speaking about a potential campaign today in Akron, Christie said, 'I've got a lot to work on before I worry about that decision and a day job that keeps me fairly busy,' according to KTIV. Christie acknowledged today that he's 'considering' a run in 2016 while continuing to claim that he hasn't made a decision yet. 'When I do, I will certainly let everybody know,' he noted. At tonight's event in the Des Moines suburb Christie seemed every bit the presidential candidate, however. Flanked by two bulky security guards, Christie hung out near the stage after the evening's official program ended and took photos with dozens of well-wishers, desperate to snatch a moment of his time. After MailOnline attempted to get in on the action and ask the governor a question, a handler for the usually approachable governor intervened and said his boss wouldn't be speaking to press that evening. 'He's working the crowd right now,' the Christie aide told MailOnline bluntly as the governor moved away to take another photo. Christie poses for a selfie with former Iowa state senator and U.S. Ambassador to Lativa Chuck Larson Jr. at the conclusion of Branstad's party. Christie hung out near the stage after the evening's official program ended and took photos with dozens of well-wishers . Also in attendance at the governor's birthday party tonight was Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst, a state lawmaker competing to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate. In her remarks she teased Christie about his possible presidential campaign and told him, 'It's so nice to have you back in Iowa.' 'Maybe you'll be making some more trips to Iowa soon. I don't know, what do you think?' the Des Moines Register says Ernst playfully asked Christie. Christie has already been to Iowa three times this election cycle and he announced tonight that he'll be making a fourth trip to the Hawkeye State next week on Thursday. 'Folks ask me why I'm coming to Iowa so much,' Christie said. 'Well, it's because Terry Branstad asked me to come to Iowa, and when Terry Branstad asks you to come to Iowa, you do not say no. Definitely not.' If Christie wants to win over Iowa voters, he'll have to work a lot harder to schmooze them before they convene their caucus early next year, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll taken this month shows. Of the 16 Republican possible Republican presidential candidates Iowans were asked about by the news publications, Christie ranked eighth. The survey of likely Republican caucus goers also found that Christie has high unavailability ratings. Just 39 percent of the state's most zealous GOP voters said they viewed him favorably. And while the New Jersey governor was better liked than Mike Pence of Indiana and John Kasich and Rob Portman of Ohio, he was the most disliked politician of the entire group of candidates tested.","'People both inside America and outside America no longer know what America stands for,' New Jersey Gov.

"Prince William appeared visibly moved yesterday as he was asked to add his signature to an historic Bible, next to that of his late mother. The royal had attended an Easter Sunday service at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Sydney when he was presented with the priceless First Fleet Bible and Book of Common Prayer. The Bible was used in the first Christian service ever held in Australia  - in 1788 by the Chaplain of the First Fleet, Reverend Richard Johnson. Scroll down for video . Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge were presented with the First Fleet Bible and Prayer Book following an Easter Sunday service at St. Andrews Cathedral in Sydney . Family tradition: The signatures in the bible - including that of the late Princess Diana . Over the last 100 years it has been signed by several members of the Royal Family, including the Queen in 1954. William’s parents, the then Prince and Princess of Wales, added their names in 1983, the Duke and Duchess of York in 1988 and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1958. The second in line to the throne looked closely at the signatures as he was shown the books by the Rev Justin Moffatt, rector of St Phillip’s Church in Sydney, where they are kept under lock and key. William and Kate signed their names in the Bible on the same page as Charles and Diana. Afterwards Rev Moffatt said: ‘I am sure the prince was very well briefed but he seemed surprised that so many members of his family had signed the Bible. Making history: The signatures of Prince William and The Duchess of Cambridge in the historic bible . 'He seemed genuinely touched to see so many of their signatures there.’ Rev Moffatt added: ‘Prince William also joked to me ‘It’s in very good nick!’ and I told him that it was very well looked after indeed. ‘He also seemed rather touched when I turned to the page of the Solemnization (c) of Matrimony which was covered with ink blots from the signatures of the first Christians to marry in Australia. ‘I explained to him that the first convicts to settle here held those pens. ‘The prince seemed fascinated.’ The family later visited the Taronga Zoo to view a Bilby called George after the baby Prince . What's this? George is fascinated by the bilby, a small marsupial . The Duchess wore an elegant dove grey Alexander McQueen coat with Jane Taylor Hat and Gucci shoes to the service in the heart of the city. Her hair had been elaborately coiffed underneath her hat in an attractive half up, half down style. After their day’s engagements were over, the couple flew to Canberra, where they will base themselves for the rest of their stay in Australia. Kate, 32, stepped off the plane in a blue Stella McCartney dress from her existing wardrobe. Her son, Prince George, had also changed into £55 navy shorts and cardigan by Rachel Riley.

"Prince William swigged a generous shot of rum today as he celebrated the £7m restoration of a WWII submarine. The prince downed the neat shot of 55 per cent proof liquor and was presented with a 'Dolphin' insignia as he became an honorary submariner following a rededication ceremony to HMS Alliance in Gosport, Hampshire. 'Where's everyone else's rum?' William joked as he took the glass of Pusser's Navy Rum from Chairman of the Royal Navy Submarine Museum Vice Admiral Sir Tim McClement and necked it in one. Scroll down for video . He's certainly had practice! Prince William downs a tot of rum in one as he attends the Service of Re-dedication of the newly restored submarine HMS Alliance in Hampshire today . The prince also joked about how his hosts were lucky his ten-month-old son Prince George wasn't with him on the tour as he would 'be up to all sorts of mischief pulling things'. During a tour of HMS Alliance, William saw how 65 submariners lived in close confinement for months on end, sleeping in bunks just inches apart 500ft underwater. The ship was built during the Second World War but wasn't finished until1945 so was used in action for 28 years during the Cold War. She has been moored by the Royal Navy Submarine Museum quayside since 1982 and her outer structure had corroded severely but after volunteers and Lottery funding raised £7 million she has finally been restored to her former glory. Cheers to that: Prince William, who is Commodore-in-Chief Submarines and Royal Patron of the HMS Alliance Conservation Appeal, attended the Service of Re-dedication of the newly restored submarine . Tasty tipple: The prince downed the neat shot of 55 per cent proof liquor and was presented with a 'Dolphin' insignia as he became an honorary submariner . Veteran Terry Fearnley, 66, who served in the engine room of HMS Alliance from 1968 to 1971, and is now a guide on the vessel, spoke to the Prince about his son. Terry said: 'I said I thought it was a wonderful thing that the submarine has been restored so faithfully for future generations. 'I told him I hope his son George will come and see it with his family as well. William said ""I hope so but you're lucky he's not here, I think he'd get up to all sorts of mischief pulling on things"". 'I told him ""he can't break anything"" and he said ""you say that"". 'He's such a lovely guy, very easy to talk to.' Good chap: Veteran Terry Fearnley, 66, who served in the engine room of HMS Alliance from 1968 to 1971, and is now a guide on the vessel, spoke to the Prince about his son and said William was very easy to talk to . Cheeky chap: During his visit to the Royal Naval Submarine Museum, Gosport, Prince William said it was lucky Prince George was not here. 'I think he'd get up to all sorts of mischief pulling on things,' he said . Meet and greet: Among his duties for the day, William met descendants of those who died in submarine AE1 in 1914 and paid his respects . Former officer Tim Honnor, 74, who commanded the submarine for 18 months during 1970 and 1971 said William was fascinated in hearing about life on board the vessel. He said: 'I hadn't been on the submarine for 20 years and I came back to see it restored. 'It's incredible the level of detail they have gone to. It is remarkably similar to how it was when we lived here, down to the photograph of the Queen on the wall. 'William was saying he couldn't believe we all live on here. He said how important it was for future generations to see the conditions.' Royal duties: The Duke of Cambridge attended a ceremony, which honoured the 5,300 submariners who lost their lives in the two world wars . After arriving by helicopter at midday, the Prince was welcomed by a small gathering of school children and a line-up of Naval Cadets before attending the submarine's official re-dedication ceremony. On his way in, the Duke stopped to talk to a submariner sporting the most impressive naval beard since the man in the Navy Cut logo. 'He said it was the most fantastic beard he had ever seen,' said engineer/technician Paul McNulty, 22. 'He said, ""Look after that beard!""' The 15 minute ceremony, which also honoured the 5,300 submariners who lost their lives in the two world wars, featured prayers and The Naval Hymn. Suited and booted: A dapper looking William met relatives of the 65 crew, who were a mixture of British and Australian submariners . Afterwards, William met descendants of those who died in submarine AE1 in 1914. He expressed hope that the remains of the submarine will be found when a search begins in September, 100 years after she was lost with all hands off Papua New Guinea. The Royal Australian Navy is sending the minehunter HMAS Yarra to look for the hull of AE1, a British-built E Class submarine lost at sea near East New Britain, Papua New Guinea,, on September 14, 1914 after less than seven months in service. William met relatives of the 65 crew, who were a mixture of British and Australian submariners.'He said he hoped they find it in September,' said Vera Ryan, 71, from Sydney, convenor of the AE1 Descendant Families Association. Her uncle, John Messenger, an Engine Room Articifer, perished on AE1 aged 27. He was her dad's brother and his family never really got over the shock of the loss. 'My grandmother became clinically depressed and never recovered from that,' she said. Mrs Ryan and her husband Peter, 70, had come over especially for the ceremony. 'It's really wonderful, particularly for the Australian descendant families because this was the first Australian Naval casualty in the First World War,' she said. 'There really haven't been a lot since.' Meanwhile, the Earl and Countess of Wessex today toured Bath Abbey and re-opened a section of the town's Roman Baths.

"One little girl stole the Duchess of Cambridge's heart today as she greeted the princess in Dunedin, New Zealand, with a traditional Maori hello - and then politely asked for a hug. Five-year-old Mataawhio Matahaere-vieint welcomed Kate, 32, with a curtsey and a hongi - a greeting, which involves touching noses - before the little girl gave the Duchess of Cambridge a cuddle. Afterwards the little girl said: 'I asked if I could hug her and she said yes, she was beautiful.' Cute: The Duchess of Cambridge was welcomed by five-year-old Mataawhio Matahaere-vieint with a traditional Maori greeting . Kate seemed more than happy to give Mataawhio the hug she requested after they held hands . After greeting Kate with a hug, Mataawhio gave her books for Prince George. Meanwhile, another local Ripeka Potiki, seven, gave the royal couple a gift of albatross feathers from the royal albatross who have their only mainland breeding colony in Dunedin. And William spoke to tribal elder Edward Ellison, 63. He said: 'William said thank you very much for the welcome. 'He said that it was a bit like being in Edinburgh with the conditions, the weather and the bagpipes. 'We are very excited they're here. 'They are an inspirational couple and we hear a lot about them.' Ripeka Potiki, seven, greeted Kate with a hongi, before presenting the royal couple a gift of albatross feathers . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Dunedin this morning to grey skies. The couple disembarked their RNZAF jet - on which they were joined by the entire British media - to a traditional Maori welcome from the Ngai Tahu tribe, the main tribe on the South Island. Elders from the tribe conducted a welcome - or Powhiri - which involved chanting at the couple from some distance before inviting them forward. Although their voices could barely be heard over the roars of nearby planes, the welcome committee carried out the chant with enthusiasm. Then William and Kate walked forward and rubbed noses with their hosts. An elder from the Ngai Tahu tribe greeted the Duchess of Cambridge and presented her with a gift to welcome her to Dunedin . Kate received a hongi welcome from a a  Ngai Tahu elder as she lands in Dunedin, in the south island of New Zealand . The piper at the airport reflected the large Scottish population in Dunedin. A small crowd had gathered at the entrance of the airport to cheer and wave to the couple as they got into their car to make their way to a morning church service. Stepping off the couple's Air Force jet, the Duchess of Cambridge looked elegant as she paraded a New Zealand designer - of sorts - for the first time on the royal tour. Emelia Wickstead, a favourite of Prime Minister David Cameron's wife Samantha, is New Zealand born but London based. She paired the coat with a hat by Jane Taylor, a favourite milliner, and the Queen's diamond fern brooch, a gift from the women of Auckland in 1954, for the second time on the trip. The Duchess of Cambridge stepped off the Air Force jet looking as immaculate as ever in a bright blue outfit by a New Zealand designer . After a day of engagements in Dunedin, Kate and William will spend the night at a luxury £6,420 per night resort in Christchurch, without Prince George.

"For once, she was truly in the driving seat. Despite a tight-fitting LK Bennett dress and skyscraper heels, the Duchess of Cambridge firmly rejected her husband’s offer of a back seat as she stepped elegantly into the front of a Super Hornet fighter jet yesterday. It was a fitting symbol of the Kate-mania that has erupted in Australia, as thousands of people chanted her name on the 13th day of the Royal tour. Former RAF pilot Prince William, who once famously romanced Kate by landing his helicopter next to her family home, had asked his wife: ‘Do you fancy jumping in the back?’ as they took a tour of the Royal Australian Air Force base Amberley in Brisbane, Queensland. But the Duchess, wearing a £245 lasa poppy dress which has already sold out, was having none of it, asking officials if she could try out the controls instead. Scroll down for videos .

On Brisbane’s South Bank, scenes  were similar to when the late Princess of Wales visited the city, and locals also compared the hysteria to that faced by One Direction. Thousands chanted ‘Kate, Kate, Kate’, as they thrust gifts at her and fought for space to take a ‘selfie’. Some people had camped out overnight to secure a decent spot.

"President Barack Obama made a rare 2014 campaign stop on Tuesday evening in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to rally the party faithful for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke. At a packed gymnasium, Obama held up Democrat Mary Burke as a skilled businesswoman who will fight for the type of middle-class opportunity that made his own success possible. Riffing on health care, the minimum wage and women's issues, Obama steered clear of referring directly to the state's Republican governor, Scott Walker, instead lumping him together with a Republican Party he accused of pushing antiquated and failed policies - such as opposition to fair pay legislation backed by Democrats. But even an appearance by the president wasn't enough to keep some of Burke's supporters at the rally engaged - midway through Obama's remarks, attendees began to trickle out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On the campaign trail: President Barack Obama attends a campaign rally for Democratic challenger for Wisconsin Governor Mary Burke at North Division High School yesterday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin . Obama made a rare campaign stop yesterday in Wisconsin in order to boost Burke's chances of winning next Tuesday's election . But even an appearance from the president wasn't enough to keep some of Burke's supporters at the rally engaged - midway through Obama's remarks, attendees began to trickle out. President Barack Obama, right, kisses Wisconsin Democratic Gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke during a campaign rally at North Division High School on Tuesday, October 28, 2014, in Milwaukee . Even the setting for Obama's rally - a high school in a mostly black part of Milwaukee - served as a reminder of how limited Obama's appeal has become, both in geography and demographics . 'Some people --not a lot, but some -- are leaving as the President is speaking,' FOX6 reporter Mike Lowe tweeted. A video taken in the overflow room of the event, held at North Division High School, also shows a stream of attendees heading for the exits. This is the second time this month Obama's had this happen at a campaign rally. Attendees of an event for Maryland's Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown also walked out on Obama, showing just how far the president's standing has fallen since he won reelection in 2012. Democrats hope Obama's appearance with Burke will help put her over the top in next week's tight race, while Republicans confidently predict Obama will have just the opposite effect. Defeating Walker, a potential 2016 presidential contender and nemesis of labor unions, would be a major coup for Democrats that could help boost the party's morale in a rocky political season. Democrats are still bruised from a failed 2012 effort to recall Walker. This year, polls show the race deadlocked between Walker and Burke, with very few voters undecided. 'The eyes of the country are on us,' Burke said as she introduced the president. Obama has been a rare sight on the campaign trail this year - he made his first appearances just over a week ago - in large part due to low approval ratings that make him a potential liability for Democrats. Even the setting for Obama's rally - a high school in a mostly black part of Milwaukee - served as a reminder of how limited Obama's appeal has become, both in geography and demographics. Opposition: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker speaks to members of the media following a tour of Vortex Optics in Middleton, Wisconsin, on Monday. Walker is being challenged in his reelection race by Burke . Only seven voters in the ward where Obama held his rally voted for someone other than Obama in 2012, records show. Still, the White House hopes Obama can help turn out high numbers of voters who backed his own presidential campaigns - chief among them African-Americans, Hispanics, young people and women. 'The country as a whole is doing better. Wisconsin's not doing so good,' Obama said. 'Over the next week, you have a chance to change that. You have a chance to choose a governor who doesn't put political ideology first.' Speaking about the economy, Obama said that unlike Walker, 'Mary Burke doesn’t believe that the minimum wage ""serves no purpose,"" ' he said. 'It don't make no sense!' an audience member shouted in reference to Walker's position on the issue. 'It don't make no sense,' Obama replied, according to Bloomberg. 'It don't make no sense,' the president said. 'We need to strengthen the middle class for the 21st century. That means we need leaders from the 21st century who actually believe women should get paid the same as men,' Obama said to cheers and laughter. The rally before 3,500 people, including former 'West Wing' actor Bradley Whitford, opened a week of last-minute campaigning by Obama. He plans to travel to Michigan, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Pennsylvania - all states where Democrats are optimistic about the governor's races, in contrast to the party's gloomy expectations for the Senate. Shaking hands and kissing babies: President Obama works the crowd after a rally at North Division High School  in Milwaukee . But even in Wisconsin, Obama's ability to fire up Democrats without driving up GOP turnout is in question. Joe Fadness, head of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Obama's appearance with Burke would remind voters that Obama's economic policies are on the ballot on Election Day. 'Wisconsin can't afford a governor who will walk lock-step with President Obama and his failed policies that have hurt our country and would take Wisconsin backward,' Fadness said. Before arriving at the rally, Obama headed to a chic downtown sushi joint, where he met privately with about 25 donors who gave $16,200 and up to the Democratic National Committee.","Obama called on a crowd of approximately 3,500 supporters in Wisconsin to get their friends to the polls on Nov. 4 at a rare 2014 campaign stop .

"Punters are backing Irish horse Mutual Regard in the final hours before this afternoon's Melbourne Cup. Bookies say Japanese stayer Admire Rakti is still a favourite and the public is also throwing its support behind Who Shot The Barman – but they are warning it may have more to do with its cool name rather than its chance of winning. Tattsbet's Gerard Daffy said Mutual Regard's popularity could be pinned down to its jockey. 'It's the Damien Oliver factor,' Mr Daffy said. Scroll down for video .

"Brighton bomber Patrick Magee has returned to the city where he planted a bomb that ripped through the Grand Hotel killing five people and injuring another 34. Magee attended a panel discussion alongside victim's daughter Jo Berry following a screening of the documentary Beyond Right & Wrong at The Old Market in Hove. The intended target of the 1984 IRA terrorist attack was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Tory Cabinet, who were staying at the hotel during the Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video . Jo Berry, whose father was killed in the explosion, and Patrick Magee, the IRA member who planted the bomb . Patrick Magee leaving Maze Prison, near Belfast, as part of the prisoner release programme in 1999 . Patrick Magee, aged 35, pictured after he was found guilty at the Old Bailey of planting the bomb . Magee was handed eight life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1986, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 35 years. He was released in 1999 under the Good Friday Agreement - having served 13 years for the crime. The documentary follows the story of Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion, and her reconciliatory journey with Magee. Ms Berry believed it important Magee attended last night's documentary screening. She said: 'For me, inviting Pat to be there is to show a living example of reconciliation and the power of empathy. It is really important to have him there to demonstrate that. 'Yes, some people will be upset but I think that for peace sometimes you have to take these risks.' Magee declined to give press interviews ahead of the 30th anniversary of the bombing, but Ms Berry believed he had changed considerably.

Sir Berry was killed in the bomb blast but his daughter Jo has become friends with the IRA bomber responsible for planting the device . 'When he planted the bomb he wasn’t seeing human beings. It was a strategy and now he sees human beings and wonderful human beings. It has been about him getting his humanity back. That has changed him, definitely. 'He regards me as a friend. He knows that my dad was a wonderful human being and he knows that some of the qualities I have came from my father and that weighs heavily on him.' Grand Hotel general manager Andrew Mosley said the commemorations were an opportunity to remind staff of what happened 30 years ago. 'To reflect on what it must have been like for our colleagues at the time and to remember those who lost their lives, those who were injured, the community in Brighton that was so badly affected, and members of the emergency services who were called to the blast. 'The message we want to send above all else is that we have not forgotten what happened here 30 years ago.' The hotel bomb was planted by Patrick Magee and caused the midsection of the hotel to collapse (pictured) Patrick Magee stayed at the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the weekend of September 14 to 17, 1984 under the pseudonym Roy Walsh. He planted the bomb under the bath in his room - number 629. The device had been fitted with a long-delay timer made from components and a safety device. It detonated at 2.54am on October 12 when the midsection of the hotel collapsed into the basement. Margaret Thatcher was still awake at the time working on her conference speech for the next day. Her bedroom and sitting room were not damaged and the Prime Minister and her husband escaped without injury. They were driven to Brighton police station and she gave an impromptu interview to the BBC where she said the conference would still go ahead. Five were killed including Tory MP Sir Anthony Berry, North-West area chairman Eric Taylor, Lady Shattock (wife of the western area chairman), Lady Maclean (wife of Sir Donald Maclean) and Roberta Wakeham (wife of the Parliamentary Treasury Secretary). The IRA claimed responsibility the next day and said it would try again. On 24 June 1985 following investigations into who had stayed in the room, Patrick Magee was arrested in Glasgow. Four members of an IRA unit were also imprisoned for involvement in the plot. Meanwhile, former Tory minister Lord Tebbit has said he can never forgive Magee after his bomb injured him and left his wife paralysed. The then trade and industry secretary, Lord Tebbit was severely injured in the blast and his wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down and needing 24-hour care. Lord Tebbit, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, said: ‘I am often asked if I can find it in my heart to forgive the creature, Patrick Magee. That is not possible, for Magee has never repented.’ Speaking to BBC News he added: 'One can hope that there’s a particularly hot corner of Hell reserved for him and they can repent in his own time there.' He continued: ‘Magee is just a low creature and an object of contempt, particularly as he now tries to make something of a living out of talking about it. ‘He was no more than a monkey on an organ grinder's organ.’ For the 83-year-old former RAF pilot, the anniversary was ‘just another day’ as he and his wife live with the injuries they sustained in the attack. Lord Tebbit and his wife Margaret  (pictured at their Bury St Edmunds home) were both injured in the bombing . Lord and Lady Tebbit leave hospital after being injured in the IRA bombing . In a statement, David Cameron said the anniversary was a timely reminder of Mrs Thatcher’s words at the time that ‘Britain will never be cowed by terrorists’. He said: ‘It is a message we repeat today as we face down the threat from violent extremism, whether in the skies over Iraq or on the streets of our towns and cities. ‘As we remember today those killed and injured in Brighton, we must renew our vow that terrorism must never win.'","IRA bomber Patrick Magee visits Brighton alongside victim's daughter .

"Hillary Clinton got back at a heckler who interrupted her with a bullhorn on Sunday by making a joke about his mental health. Clinton was giving a speech on early childhood development to the American Academy of Pediatrics in San Diego, California, when an unidentified man set off an alarm on the noise-amplifying device and began shouting at her. 'You know there are some people who miss important developmental stages,' Clinton facetiously told the 3,000 or so pediatricians listening to the speech after the man was hauled out by security. Hillary Clinton was interrupted during remarks on Sunday in San Diego, California, by a heckler with a bullhorn. Clinton winced, made a joke about the heckler's mental health, then went on with her speech . The unidentified heckler can been seen in this photo, taken from a video of the event, hollering at Clinton as he is led out by security . It was not immediately clear what the individual who made the disturbance was upset up about as he did not make his case through the bullhorn. Clinton was at the event to announce a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the Academy, according to The Hill. As part of the foundation's To Small to Fail program, Clinton said, it would work with the Academy to encourage parents to begin reading to their children at a young age. The former secretary of state and presumed 2016 presidential candidate is no stranger to heckling at her speaking events. At an event last October in New York, a man began harassing Clinton about her involvement in the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. 'Benghazi, Benghazi, you let them die!' he shouted at her. Clinton responded to that man with a lecture on democracy and appropriate behavior in a civil society. 'We have to be willing to come together as citizens to focus on the kind of future we want, which doesn't include yelling, it includes sitting down and talking with one another,' she said. At an April event in Las Vegas, Nevada, Clinton was memorably accosted by a woman wearing a blonde wig. The woman threw a black and orange athletic shoe at Clinton for inexplicable reasons. Clinton responded to that incident lightheartedly. She ducked the flying object and made a Vegas-themed joke. 'Is that somebody throwing something at me?' she asked the 1,000 person audience at the event sponsored by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. 'Is that part of Cirque de Soleil?' she said, referring to the popular acrobatic group that performs in Vegas and at other venues across the country. 'My goodness, I didn’t know that solid waste management was so controversial,' she continued. 'Thank goodness she didn’t play softball like I did.'","Clinton was giving a speech on early childhood development to American Academy of Pediatrics in San Diego, California, at the time .

"A violent mugger jailed for attacking pensioners with a knife has escaped from an open prison – becoming the second dangerous inmate to go on the run from the jail in less than six months. A police search was under way last night for Sabul Miah who was sentenced to two life sentences in 2003 for a serious of stabbing attacks and violent robberies. He has been missing for at least three days after failing to return to Standford Hill, a category-D prison in Sheerness, Kent. Miah was let out on day release on Thursday. Missing: Violent criminal Sabul Miah was serving two life sentences when he escaped from the open prison . It is another embarrassment for prison chiefs after armed robber Michael Wheatley – known as the ‘Skull Cracker’ – absconded while on day release in May. Wheatley, 55, was recaptured days later after robbing the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey at gunpoint. He had robbed the same building society 13 years earlier. Last night, MP Philip Davies, who campaigns against open prisons, criticised the Ministry of Justice for placing dangerous criminals like Miah and Wheatley in one. He said: ‘Dangerous criminals should not be placed in open prisons where they could easily escape. ‘You would have thought that the Ministry of Justice would have learned the lessons from the Wheatley experience. They should have tightened the system up straight away at Standford. I will raise this matter with the Secretary of State.’ Miah, 40, from Poplar, East London, was convicted of robbing at least 15 pensioners in what a judge described as ‘persistent and cruel crimes against the elderly’. His violence included slashing a war veteran’s throat and stabbing an 82-year-old woman’s hand. He would target his victims after watching them withdraw their money from post offices in the Tower Hamlets area, follow them home and rob them at knifepoint outside their houses or in the lifts of their buildings. Miah had a crack and heroin habit. At his trial, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin told Southwark Crown Court: ‘These were heart-rending offences committed against some of the most vulnerable people in the community without the least sign of mercy. The court will do everything to protect people against such terrible crime.’ Second World War veteran George Rowe (left), 79, had his throat slashed by Miah in a lift. His attacker has now escaped from the same open prison as did 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley (right) earlier this year . Miah was given two life sentences with the condition that he would only qualify for parole after eight years. It is believed that parole was delayed due to ‘bad behaviour’ in prison. Last night the Ministry of Justice confirmed that Miah was reported missing on Thursday after failing to appear for afternoon roll-call. Kent Police were notified immediately. His final victim was George Rowe, 79, a Second World War veteran. Miah slashed his throat in a lift. Mr Rowe’s daughter, Pat McFarlane, a teacher, said that her father had left his council-owned flat in Limehouse, East London, to pick up his and his wife’s weekly pension from the local post office on December 30, 2002. Mrs McFarlane, 53, from Stratford, East London, said that Miah followed Mr Rowe to his building. ‘My dad was about to get into the lift as he lived on the fourth floor, when Miah shouted to keep the door open. My dad, being the gentleman, kept the lift door open as it was raining. Once inside, Miah demanded the money. Miah robbed Mr Rowe of £123 – the weekly pension – and tried to run off. When Mr Rowe tried to snatch the money back, Miah slashed his throat and pushed him back into the lift. Mrs McFarlane said: ‘My dad staggered out of the lift with blood pouring out of him. A police search is now under way after Miah escaped from Standford Hill open prison (pictured) in Kent . ‘Neighbours saw him and called an ambulance. They saved his life. My dad was never the same. He left hospital after two weeks, but could not return home as he was so scared.’ Subsequently, doctors discovered that Mr Rowe had lung cancer, and he died in April, 2003. Mrs McFarlane believes the trauma of the robbery worsened his health condition. She said: ‘That man has robbed us of my dad. He would have lived much longer. Miah destroyed our family.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have made major changes to tighten up temporary release processes and open prison eligibility. Absconds have reached record lows.’ He declined to comment on how two prisoners managed to escape from the same prison in five months. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, which campaigns for tougher sentences for criminals, said: ‘Open prisons are undermining proper punishments and putting the public at very real risk.’ Latest figures from the Ministry of Justice show that in the financial year 2013/14, 225 inmates escaped from open prisons, or within the ‘open element’ of category B or C jails.","Sabul Miah has been missing from Standford Hill prison for at least 3 days .

"They experienced grief most parents wouldn't dare to imagine, clutching six newborn babies as they died in their arms. But Steve and Lindsey Justice have vowed to stay strong - and insist they still want to try for more children. The college sweethearts still beam when they recall the moment a doctor said they were pregnant with sextuplets. And despite enduring a loss of such magnitude just three weeks ago, they smile at the thought of parenting more children, whether biological or adopted. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Lindsey and Steve Justice held all six of their babies, who were born at 21 weeks and died in their arms . Strong family: The couple had two daughters - four-year-old Hannah and two-year-old Hope - before falling pregnant with septuplets . Former NFL player: Steve was drafted by the Carolina Panthers before he and Lindsey set up their own gym . 'We are still hopeful,' Lindsey told People. 'We still want more kids. That could mean adoption, it could mean fertility drugs. We're taking it one day at a time.' Former Carolina Panther Steve and his wife Lindsey already had two daughters - Hannah, four, and Hope, two - and dreamed of having a third before discovering that Lindsey had contracted an ovarian disease. Finally, after a year of fertility treatments, the pregnancy test flashed pink. And a scan showed they were expecting seven girls. He urged them to selectively abort some of them to give the rest a chance of reaching 23 weeks and a strong prospect of survival. But they refused. However, at 12 weeks, Lindsey miscarried one. Just 10 weeks later, on September 23, she felt contractions. To watch the full video visit WCNC. All six girls were born in ten minutes and within two hours had died in their parents' arms. And while they tried to cope with the grief themselves, they also had to find the words to explain the ordeal to their infant daughters. 'Hope still lifts up my shirt every day and says ""baby?""' Lindsey told People. 'What do you tell her? The girls were so excited to have six little sisters.' Now,  the couple has decided to speak out about their horrific ordeal as a sign of support to others who have gone through similar situations, and to show that they will move forward through their trauma. 'We don't have strength right now, we are broken, we are in deep mourning,' Lindsey told NBC. 'We held each one of our six girls and said goodbye to them. Strength: The couple of Charlotte, North Carolina, has vowed to speak out about their ordeal to stay strong . Glimpses of happiness: The couple are pictured with their two daughters ahead of their tragedy . Trauma: Lindsey had already miscarried a seventh fetus at 12 weeks before her waters broke at 21 weeks . 'They were all living. They all have birth certificates, they all have a first name a middle name and a last name.' The couple, who live in Charlotte, North Carolina, met at Wake Forest college where Lindsey played soccer and Steve played football. After marrying in 2009, they had two daughters - four-year-old Hannah and two-year-old Hope. When they tried for a third, they discovered Lindsey had inherited PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome, which vastly reduces the chance of getting pregnant. On Steve's birthday, Lindsey handed him a positive pregnancy test, NBC reported. One trip to the doctor's surgery found there were at least six babies - and later it emerged there was a seventh. No regrets: Lindsey recounted the birth to NBC but said she does not regret keeping all seven babies . He urged them to abort some. 'Steve and I didn't even have to look at each other. That was just not going to be an option,' Lindsey said. They were hit by tragedy in the 12th week when Lindsey miscarried. It was not until four weeks later that their doctor revealed yet another surprise: all six remaining babies were girls. However, as they were still celebrating the news, Lindsey's waters broke. 'I started to feel some contractions and I wanted to not believe that,' she said. 'What I would give to nurse them, to hold them, to rock them to sleep, to dress them. I want to be their mom, I want them to be here, you know. But that wasn't God's will.' However, the couple maintain they do not regret their decision to keep all seven. 'I would do the past 21 weeks again and again and again if I had the choice,' Lindsey insists.","Former Carolina Panther center Steve Justice and wife Lindsey endured fertility treatment to conceive third child, within a year conceived seven .

"A record high number of workers in part-time jobs has helped create the biggest fall in unemployment for 40 years. It means the jobless total is below two million for the first time since the recession struck in 2008 – with just 6 per cent of Britons now out of work. It follows a drop of 538,000 in the unemployment figure in the past year, the biggest since records began in 1972, the Office for National Statistics said. The number of people with jobs reached a record high of 30.7million and the ONS said the number of part-time workers also broke records at 6.8million. There are now 4.5million self-employed people, 279,000 more than a year ago. The increase in part-time workers was largely driven by women with young families, or those in their 50s and 60s returning after a career break. While the number of men working part-time rose by just 6,000 over the past year, there were an additional 138,000 women with part-time jobs – almost 380 a day. The fall in unemployment could place the Bank of England under more pressure to raise the base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent. Charles Levy . Charles Levy, senior economist at Lancaster University’s Work Foundation writes: . 'Unemployment is falling fast, but this is masking signs of a weaker labour market. 'Our economy is creating jobs, but at a fraction of the rate seen earlier this year. 'The 154,000 person decrease in unemployment is a remarkable drop. 'However, rather than being accompanied by a surge towards employment, we see individuals withdrawing from the labour market. 'Despite our growing population, 91,000 fewer working age people were either in work or looking for work in the three months to August, compared to three months before. 'A shrinking labour market remains a cause for concern despite the economic recovery.' Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, had indicated interest rates could rise when the unemployment rate fell below 7 per cent. But when the figure dropped below this threshold faster than expected, the Bank did not raise rates, saying it had to take into account low wage rises, GDP, investment and productivity. Economists have predicted that with inflation well below the Bank’s target of 2 per cent, rates may not rise until the summer. Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons yesterday, David Cameron seized on the unemployment fall as ‘great news’ but admitted there was ‘more work to be done’ as wages lag behind the cost of living. Average pay grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months to August compared with 2013, failing to keep pace with inflation at 1.2 per cent. George Osborne last night urged the Low Pay Commission to recommend another inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage next year. Earlier this month it was increased to £6.50. The Chancellor said: ‘We want to make sure that Britain’s lowest paid continue to benefit from the growing economy, which is why the Government has today stated its ambition to increase the real value of the national minimum wage without an adverse impact on employment.’ The number of people out of work and the unemployment rate for each UK region: . North East, 119,000, unemployment rate 9.3% . North West, 233,000, 6.7% . Yorkshire and the Humber, 189,000, 7% . East Midlands, 128,000, 5.5% . West Midlands, 207,000, 7.5% . East of England, 152,000, 4.9% . London, 301,000, 6.6% . South East, 215,000, 4.7% . South West, 127,000, 4.6% . Wales, 94,000, 6.5% . Scotland, 151,000,  5.5% . Northern Ireland, 53,000, 6.1% . Tory MPs were keen to point out Labour had warned the Government’s austerity programme would cost a million jobs. In 2011, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it was ‘complete fantasy’ to think the private sector could generate enough jobs to cope with public sector staff cuts. But figures show there are 1.4million more people in employment than there were three years ago. Tory MP Robert Halfon told the Commons yesterday: ‘We are the true workers’ party now, the modern trade union movement for hard-working people.’ Danny Alexander, Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary, hailed the figures as evidence of a ‘jobs-rich economic recovery’. But Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said they mask a fall in real earnings. Union Unite’s Len McCluskey said: ‘This is a part-time recovery built on the back of low wages and an explosion of self-employment …leaving millions … without rights, security or guaranteed income.’ Record levels of women in work have seen the number of stay-at-home mothers go into freefall, official figures show. The employment rate for women is 68 per cent, the highest since records began in 1971, compared with 78 per cent of men. But as the figure for women in work tops 14million, the number of stay-at-home mothers has hit an all-time low of two million. Twenty years ago there were almost three million. In the past 12 months there was a fall of 30,000 women caring for their children full-time. But stay-at-home fathers rose by 10,000 to 234,000, more than double the number two decades ago. Campaigners said many parents felt forced to return to work due to financial pressures and Government policy, which they said favoured mothers in employment. From next September, couples who both work will receive up to £2,000 per child to help with childcare bills, to encourage women back to work. The scheme will allow working couples earning up to £300,000 to receive a 20 per cent rebate per child on their annual childcare costs. The tax break is in contrast to child benefit cuts in recent years, which hit one-earner families’ incomes by more than £50,000. Lynne Burnham, of Mothers At Home Matter, said meagre wage rises and pressure from politicians to return to work or be considered ‘lazy’ had driven a fall in stay-at-home mothers. She added: ‘According to David Cameron, it seems you are worthless unless you go out to work, but stay-at-home mothers work as hard as anyone else …[and] receive little support.’ From April, married couples can transfer £1,000 of income tax allowance to their spouse. This will benefit part-time workers and stay-at-home parents – although it will be worth only £200. Siobhan Freegard, of parenting site Netmums, said returning to work was ‘often not what mums want but is the only way they can make ends meet’. ALEX BRUMMER: Good news, but part-time work and low pay means there’s no tax bonanza . Welfare reforms, championed by Iain Duncan Smith (above), have made living off the State less attractive . Britain's phenomenal pace of job creation, which has reduced the unemployment rate to 6 per cent of the workforce, is one of the great achievements of the Tory-led Government. But it has come at a price – average earnings and living standards have been savaged, undermining the tax base of the economy. That people in Britain have been willing to get on their bikes and get jobs, many of them self-employed and part-time, is a huge tribute to the nation’s work ethic and the positive impact of welfare reforms, championed by Iain Duncan Smith, that have made living off the State less attractive. The UK’s strong job creation is reaching down to the young unemployed, contrasting starkly with the eurozone where the jobless rate is 11.2 per cent and above 50 per cent among young people in Greece and Spain. The reasons why average earnings in Britain have not increased, as the market for labour has tightened, are complex. The main explanation is that new employees have been taken on to the payroll at lesser wages than a previous generation doing the same or equivalent work. In contrast to public sector workers protesting wage freezes and caps, employees in the wealth-creating sectors have been willing to accept below-inflation pay increases in recognition that the nation has been through the deepest downturn for a century and they need to contribute to restoring prosperity. The jobless total has fallen to two million since the Government came to office and the participation rate, the broadest measure of the appetite for work, is now higher than in any other advanced economy in the world, including the fast growing United States. Yet despite this, income tax receipts have failed to rise by the 6.5 per cent forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility and have only risen 0.8 per cent. This makes if far more difficult for the Chancellor George Osborne to achieve his revised goal of balancing the budget by 2017-18. Many of the jobs created have been in expanding but lowly paid parts of the service economy including retail, hotels and food services, where pay can be up to 20 per cent below other sectors. Moreover, the jobless rate has fallen fastest in poorer regions such as the North East where average pay is less. In addition, the Coalition’s introduction of the £10,000 personal allowance has taken many workers out of tax and the Chancellor is promising to raise this threshold to £12,500. The downward pressure on wages will not last forever. Bank of England interest-rate setter Martin Weale argues that as the labour market tightens, with falling unemployment, employers will have to pay more for entry-level workers, pushing up average earnings. Private sector forecasters note that salaries for advertised jobs are already outpacing inflation increasing at a 1.9 per cent annual rate. This suggests employers will have to improve the lot of existing staff if they do not want them to move elsewhere for higher pay. Hard work and patience should finally be rewarded better.","David Cameron hails 'great news' as number in work reaches 30.7million .

"Real Madrid's Karim Benzema has emerged from Cristiano Ronaldo's shadow as his side's prolific form has seen them sweep to the top of La Liga and he believes his best is still to come. Just over a month ago the pressure was firmly on Benzema's shoulders as he had only scored two goals in nine games but after his recent performances he is assured of a warm reception at the Bernabeu against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. The Frenchman got the only goal in Tuesday's Champions League win over Liverpool but it is not so much his goals but his unselfish role in attack which has come in for praise. Karim Benzema (above) celebrates scoring the winner as Real Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 on Tuesday . The France striker feels that his best footballing years are still to come, despite being in superb form . Real lead the way in La Liga with 24 points from 10 games, scoring 37 goals, one point ahead of Valencia and champions Atletico Madrid. Benzema has linked up well with his strike partners and especially Ronaldo who has 17 goals to his name. 'I don't know whether this is my best moment but I feel good, working hard, getting the results and I want to continue this way,' Benzema told Marca. 'I am 26 and I think that my best moments are still ahead of me. People have always told me that from 26 or 27 onwards you enter your best stage as a player and I hope that is the case with me. 'I will continue working hard. For me it isn't just about scoring goals, it is more about being involved in the play and creating chances -- sometimes they go in and sometimes they don't. 'I enjoy good football and if I can help my team mates to score then great. I try to give passes to Cristiano because I want him to score. 'I am having a good time at the moment and the team is as well. We have a strong squad and the proof is that the players that come off the bench can make the difference and that is the key for a team. Benzema has also praised the influence of his manager at Madrid, Italian Carlo Ancelotti (above) Benzema has led Madrid to the top of La Liga and through to the the Champions League knock-out stages . 'It is important to have good understanding, we are a team and we need to help each other.' Benzema is grateful for the support from coach Carlo Ancelotti who stood by him when he was struggling. 'Carlo has always backed me as has the president. The whistles were because people expected a lot from me,' he said. 'I don't know whether it will happen again but it is part of football.' Barcelona visit Almeria on Saturday following back-to-back defeats in La Liga that have seen them slip to fourth place two points behind Real Madrid. Lionel Messi got both goals to equal Raul's Champions League scoring record of 71 as Barca beat Ajax Amsterdam 2-0 on Wednesday but he is still one short of drawing level with Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra as La Liga's top scorer on 251. Barcelona coach Luis Enrqiue (above) rejected the claim there is a problem causing Barcelona's dip in form . 'The team doesn't have problems,' Barcelona coach Luis Enrique told reporters regarding their recent dip in form. 'Obviously there is the odd issue as normal after each game but we are concentrating on improving and cutting out the errors. We know that there will be situations like this during the season.' Atletico Madrid, in third, travel to Real Sociedad who are searching for a new coach having sacked Jagoba Arrasate with the team standing second from bottom of the table.","Karim Benzema has been an essential component in Real Madrid's form .

"Huddled in a wheelchair, wearing just his pyjamas and a thin dressing gown, a filmsy blanket draped over him. Stranded, 'in agony', freezing and longing for a bite to eat. That was how 95-year-old Arthur Wilson was found, 10 hours after he was told he was to be discharged from Warrington Hospital after suffering from pneumonia. The great-grandfather, who was waiting to be taken back to his care home, was found in the 'freezing' discharge lounge, where he had been left all day. His daughters said they are 'outraged' after seeing their elderly father, who had been admitted two weeks earlier, sitting in his pyjamas covered with a single blanket. Arthur Wilson was found by his family 10 hours after he was told he was to be discharged from Warrington Hospital after suffering pneumonia. The 95-year-old was huddled in a wheelchair, wearing just his pyjamas and a thin dressing gown, with a filmsy blanket draped over him . Mr Wilson, who suffers Paget's disease - a painful bone disorder - had not been fed all day and was left 'in agony' from sitting in his wheelchair. His daughter Elaine Naylor, 61, an NHS worker, said: 'I was incensed and didn't realise how ill he looked until I saw the photo. 'The matron of the discharge lounge couldn't apologise enough but somebody should have realised he had been there a long time and organised something else. 'It's just about showing some compassion.' Mr Wilson was left waiting in the discharge lounge due to delays getting medication, which took from 9.40am to 12.20pm last Tuesday. Hospital staff then struggled to locate an ambulance to take the grandfather-of-four back to the Ferndale Care Home in Widnes, Cheshire - just 4.5 miles away. During his 10-hour wait, Mr Wilson, who hadn't eaten since breakfast, was offered a sandwich but refused it because he was on a puréed diet. His daughter Lynda Pennington, 63, said she was 'horrified' when she arrived at the hospital and saw how her father looked. She said: 'On Tuesday morning he was moved to the discharge lounge and he had to wait for his medication before he was able to leave. 'I didn't hear anything so at 3pm I phoned and they assured me he'd be home in the next couple of hours. 'When I phoned about 5.40pm and he was still waiting for an ambulance, I went to the hospital to bring him home myself. 'When I saw him he looked awful. All the windows were open and he was freezing cold so I asked for another blanket. The great-grandfather, pictured with his daughter Lynda Pennington,  was waiting to be taken back to his care home when Mrs Pennington found him in the 'freezing' discharge lounge, where he had been left all day . Mrs Pennington and her sister Elaine Naylor, right, are 'outraged' after seeing their elderly father in such a condition. They are also 'disgusted' after discovering a 'do not resuscitate' order had been placed on his notes without his family being consulted . 'He hadn't eaten because he'd only been offered a sandwich and he can't eat that. They obviously hadn't checked his notes. 'I was told that if I wanted to drive him, then I'd have to sign a waiver so I suggested we booked a taxi instead. 'They said we could but argued we couldn't take the hospital wheelchair off the premises. 'I said it was ridiculous because I wasn't about to run off with it. Paget's disease disrupts the normal cycle of bone renewal and repair. It causes bones to weaken and become deformed. Bone pain is the most common symptom of the disease, and it often affects the pelvis or spine. The pain can be aggravated by lying down. The disease is caused by a problem with the process of bone renewal that results in bone being replaced at a faster rate than usual. It leads to enlarged bones that are weak and brittle. 'When the taxi arrived it wasn't one big enough to fit a wheelchair. I wasn't happy because they knew he needed one. 'In the end we had to lift him into the taxi and lift him out again at the other end. 'It took three people to help and my dad was screaming in pain. He'd been sitting down in a wheelchair all day, which he's not supposed to do and that had caused his bones to really ache. 'He was in agony and really distressed.' Mr Wilson, a former printer's assistant, finally arrived back at the care home at 7.45pm - more than 10 hours after he'd been moved to the discharge lounge. Karen Dawber, director of nursing for Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust told MailOnline: 'We take all complaints seriously and are currently investigating the issues that Mr Wilson's family have raised and have already implemented planned changes to our discharge lounge, which has now changed locations to make it more accessible to the main hospital. 'Our matron has spoken with the family and offered our apologies, which I would like to extend. 'I am very disappointed by the level of care Mr Wilson was offered in our discharge lounge. My expectations of compassionate care are quite clear to my nursing staff and in Mr Wilson's case these were not met. 'The member of staff, an NHS Professional, is no longer working for the trust as a result of not meeting our standards of care. A spokesman for Warrington Hospital said the trust is investigating the family's complaint . 'The discharge lounge offers patients the option of a chair or bed to relax and rest in during their stay and in cases of transport being delayed. Mr Wilson was offered the option of a bed, which he declined, preferring to sit in a comfortable arm chair. 'We offer refreshments and snacks to patients waiting in the discharge lounge and we have now taken practical steps to offer hot food to patients who have a longer than expected wait.' Kelly Jackson, head of patient transport service for North West Ambulance Service, said: 'We would like to apologise to the patient and their family for the delay in their transportation. 'We accepted the booking just after 1pm. Unfortunately, we were not advised by the unit of the time the patient would be ready to travel and an afternoon discharge was selected. 'We were also informed that the patient required a double crewed ambulance which caused a further delay in waiting for that type of transport to become available. 'We are sorry to the patient and their family for the distress the delay caused and would encourage the family to contact us further if they wish to do so.'","Arthur Wilson, 95, was left in the discharge lounge at Warrington Hospital .

"David Cameron visited the Rochester and Strood by-election today . David Cameron has warned voters that victory for Ukip in the Rochester and Strood by-election would help establish the party. On a visit to the Kent constituency where defector Mark Reckless is on course to crush the Conservatives, the Prime Minister dismissed the party as being about 'stunts and politics'. ‎Senior Tories had declared the contest a 'must-win' but‎ Mr Reckless has a 15 point lead over his former party according to the latest opinion poll. Yesterday, Mr Cameron, who had pledged to 'throw the kitchen sink' at the attempt to hold the seat and halt the Ukip surge made his third of five expected visits ahead of the November 20 poll. Speaking at Chatham Docks where he toured a company making parts for the Crossrail project alongside Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst, he said: ‎'I think Kelly is the strongest local candidate who will work the hardest for the seat. 'If you vote for Kelly it's about you and your new MP and the work she'll do for you. 'If you vote Ukip, it's not about you, it's about them. 'It will be about stunts and politics and trying to make a thing out of Ukip rather than trying to deliver for the people of Rochester and Strood.' Mr Cameron added that a Ukip win would 'effectively give them a boost for their campaign'. Hours after Mr Cameron's visit, Ukip leader Nigel Farage appeared at a rally alongside candidate Mr Reckless. Ukip is odds on favourite to win the by-election, which was triggered after Mr Reckless defected from the Tories. A poll published on Friday showed Ukip had widened its lead over the Conservatives by six points since an identical survey a month earlier, suggesting the huge Tory effort to keep the seat is failing to gain traction. There are warnings that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives fail to win. The Prime Minister accompanied the Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst (left) at the Crossrail site in Chatham, Kent . Mr Cameron said a win for Ukip in Rochester would boost Nigel Farage - seen wiping away a tear at the 'Seas of Red' poppy exhibition in London today . Former leadership contender David Davis was last week reported to be taking soundings about a possible plot to depose Mr Cameron if the seat is lost. Mr Davis is said to have told fellow MPs that there is a 'window' of opportunity to organise a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron between the by-election and Christmas. The contest comes after Douglas Carswell became the first elected Ukip MP last month.","On a visit to Kent constituency the PM dismissed Ukip 'stunts' to win votes .

"Joe Biden shouldn't expect to be recognized by many people during his trip to Los Angeles this week - apart from those who love his movies. After the vice president's visit shut down roads in the city on Monday, late night show host Jimmy Kimmel asked 11 people on Hollywood Boulevard who he was - and none guessed correctly. A few even suggested he was a movie star, while another guessed he was in a terror group. Only the 12th person was vaguely close, calling Biden 'the assistant president'. Scroll down for video . Who is he? A team sent by Jimmy Kimmel (pictured) on Monday asked people on Hollywood Boulevard to identify Vice President Joe Biden - but no one knew who he was . 'The Vice President is here so they closed a bunch of streets which, no offense, but do we really need to stop traffic for Joe Biden?' Kimmel asked on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday night. 'I mean, I know he's the vice president but I wonder how many people even care if he's here... We asked Americans a very simple question: Who is Joe Biden?' One girl gave a wise guess that he might be 'a man', while a couple of people were sure they'd seen him in movies that they couldn't name. One man, who was wearing a cloth on his head decorated with marijuana leaves, admitted he was under the influence and struggling to recall who Biden was - before suddenly remembering he was 'that old dude' from Pineapple Express - a movie about a weed dealer. Confused: Two passersby struggle to remember who Joe Biden is as he arrives in Los Angeles on Monday . No idea: Some people guessed that he was the governor - or perhaps a movie star or a terror group . Not sure: This man told Kimmel's camera crew that Biden was a Republican set to run for president . Fan: When presented with a picture of Biden, one man says he's 'that old dude' from Pineapple Express . Another passerby guessed 'a terror group' while another assumed he was a Republican, and yet more thought he was the governor - with one suggesting he was a Washington D.C. Congressman. Biden arrived in Los Angeles on Monday afternoon to attend two Democratic Party fundraisers - one for Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley and another for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. On Tuesday, he is expected to attend a roundtable discussion on minimum wage with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

"Forgein molluscs and killer shrimps have colonised Britain’s rivers so extensively that some already look like the Caspian Sea, academics have said. A Cambridge University study has found that invasive species from Turkey and Ukraine are overwhelming native British species. Travelling to our shores on ship hulls or clinging to ornamental plants imported for our gardens, the animals are creating eco-systems that will support other foreign animals. 'Pink peril': The killer shrimp, pictured, is among the invasive species that are colonising Britain's rivers. The animals kill and feed on native British shrimps . Five of the most invasive freshwater creatures from the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov are now in Britain - including the quagga mussel, found just two weeks ago in the Wraysbury River near Heathrow airport. Researchers say that, with at least ten more of these high-risk species established just across the channel in Dutch ports, Britain could be on the brink of what they describe as an ‘invasional meltdown’. They have called for greater monitoring on areas at most risk - the lower reaches of the Thames, Severn, Great Ouse and the Norfolk Broads. Their dire warning, published on Monday in the Journal of Applied Ecology, says the issue is vital for ‘national biosecurity’. Greatest threat: The invader scientists are most concerned about are the quagga mussel, pictured, which alarmingly was first discovered in the UK just two weeks ago . Study author Dr David Aldridge said: ‘In some parts of Britain the freshwater community already looks more like the Caspian Sea. ‘The Norfolk Broads, for example, typically viewed as a wildlife haven, is actually dominated by Ponto-Caspian zebra mussels and killer shrimps in many places. ‘Pretty much everything in our rivers and lakes is directly or indirectly vulnerable. Tiny killer: The quagga mussels, discovered in a reservoir near Heathrow, will smother and kill native mussels, affect water quality and block pipes . ‘The invader we are most concerned about is the quagga mussel, which alarmingly was first discovered in the UK just two weeks ago. This pest will smother and kill our native mussels, block water pipes and foul boat hulls.’ Other invasive species include the demon shrimp, bloody red shrimp and the killer shrimp - dubbed the ‘pink peril’. Each of these species kill and feed on native British shrimps. But more alarmingly, the foreign invaders act as a gateway for further invasive species, because they kill the competition and in some cases create an eco-system which is favourable for other invaders to thrive. The zebra mussel, for example, provides an ideal home for invasive shrimps which have striped patterns to blend in with the mussels’ shells. The shrimps, in turn, provide food for larger invaders such as goby fish. Gobies have now made their way down the Rhine, one of the main corridors to Britain, with populations exploding in the waterways of western France over the last few years. The invading gobies eat native invertebrate and displace native fish such as the already threatened Bullhead. Dr Aldridge said: ‘If we look at The Netherlands nowadays it is sometimes hard to find a non-Ponto-Caspian species in their waterways.’ Sarah Chare, deputy director of fisheries and biodiversity at the Environment Agency, said: ‘Invasive species – such as the quagga mussel – cost the UK economy in excess of £1.8 billion every year. ‘The quagga mussel is a highly invasive non-native species, affecting water quality and clogging up pipes.’","Invasive species from Turkey and Ukraine are colonising Britain's rivers .

"The life of Marilyn Monroe will once again be brought to the screen, but this time the small screen as Lifetime has announced it will be making a miniseries about the iconic actress, starring a woman who has had a storied career herself - Susan Sarandon. The Oscar winner, who took home a golden statue for her work in Dead Man Walking, is set to star as Monroe's mother Gladys Baker in the new series, appropriately titled Marilyn. It should be a very juicy role for the actress, as Baker was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose own life may have been even more traumatic than that of her tragic daughter. Scroll down for video . Big role: Susan Sarandon (above) will play Marilyn Monroe's mother Gladys Baker in a new miniseries about the actress . Complicated woman: Baker (above with a young Marilyn) was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose own mother committed suicide and whose father died of syphilitic insanity . Legend: Monroe (above) would go on to become one of the most famous actors of the twentieth century . Baker watched as her mother killed herself and her father died of syphilitic insanity, eventually becoming a devout Christian after a wild youth, and raising her daughter to believe that sex should be avoided at all costs. Monroe of course would go on to have numerous tumultuous relationships in her lifetime, most famously with two of the men she married, baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the role of Monroe has not yet been cast. This news comes as rumors of yet another big screen movie about Monroe, this one titled Blonde, continue to swirl, with reports stating earlier this year that Jessica Chastain would play the blonde bombshell after Naomi Watts dropped out of the project. More movies: Jessica Chastain (left) is also set to play Monroe in the film Blonde, this after Naomi Watts (right) dropped out . Perfect: Michelle Williams (above) gave perhaps the most definitive portrayal of the actress in the 2011 film My Week With Marilyn, earning an Oscar nomination for her work . No doubt making the task of playing Monroe that much more daunting is the critical praise that was heaped upon the last actress to portray her, Michelle Williams, who went on to earn an Academy Award nomination for her pitch perfect performance in the 2011 film My Week With Marilyn. Said Roger Ebert of Williams' work on the film, 'She evokes so many Marilyns, public and private, real and make-believe. We didn't know Monroe, but we believe she must have been something like his . Of course an obvious choice for the role could be Sarandon's own daughter, actress Eva Amurri. Ideal casting?: The role of Monroe has yet to be cast, but sarandon's own daughter Eva Amurri (above) would be a natural choice . The two have shared the screen in films like The Banger Sisters and Middle of Nowhere, in which they played mother and daughter, as well as That's My Boy, in which they played the younger and older version of the same woman. The four hour miniseries, based on J. Randy Taraborrelli's book, The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe, is set to start filming later this year. It will air in 2015.","Susan Sarandon will play Gladys Baker, the mother of Marilyn Monroe, in a new Lifetime miniseries about the actress which will air in 2015 .

"Bloomingdale’s is hitting back against crafty shoppers who buy special occasion merchandise only to return it after a single wear. The store is now attaching what they call a ‘B-tag’ to dresses in visible spots, like hemlines. Once removed, a dress will be rendered nonreturnable under new conditions outlined by the national retailer. The B-tag, first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday, has been attached to all dresses retailing for over $150, a store associate in the chain’s SoHo, New York location told MailOnline. The associate also said that the device is being used at all of Bloomindale’s nationwide outlets. Hitting back: Bloomingdale's will now include this B-tag, snapped in-store by MailOnline, on all dresses that retail for more than $150 . New measures: Customers will not be able to return a garment once the bulky B-tag is removed. Instructions are provided to help shoppers take the tag off of merchandise. The store’s e-commerce business has also picked up on the practice. Online ‘details’ indicate when items will be delivered with a B-tag attached. ‘Please note that this dress will be delivered with a black B-tag attached, with instructions for removal included. If the B-tag is removed, the dress cannot be returned,’ reads an online description for a French Connection ‘opal sequin’ dress. The SoHo store associate told MailOnline that, for now, dresses are the only item at Bloomingdale's to receive the B-tag. Bloomberg says that the retailer is ‘using the tactic to combat a practice known as “wardrobing” — buying clothes and using them once — a form of return fraud.’ They say that the ‘National Retail Federation estimates [“wardrobing”] cost the industry $8.8 billion last year.’ Internet option: Online shoppers will also find B-tags affixed to dresses they purchase from Bloomingdales.com . MailOnline paid a visit to the dress department of Bloomingdale’s SoHo location in search of the B-tag. We quickly discovered the large black plastic tag hanging out from underneath each dress’s hemline. The B-tag is a rudimentary piece of black plastic that . resembles many of the store’s electronic security tags in bulk and . size. The tag is not, however, electronically charged in any way. Its teardrop shape and bulbous nature would make it difficult to wear a . dress with it still attached. In this way, the B-tag tactic will likely prove very effective. The B-tag does come with removal . instructions, as promised on Bloomingdale’s website. However when MailOnline . attempted to remove a B-tag from the hemline of Sue Wong beaded dress, using the instructions provided, the device’s concept . seemed slightly less successful. Widespread release: Bloomingdale's is already using the B-tag in all of its nationwide locations . ‘To remove tag, lift “B” disk,’ an instruction card affixed to the dress explained. When MailOnline lifted the “B” disk, the B-tag’s tiny puncturing prong did indeed lift away from the dress a bit. But it became caught in the cocktailware’s polyester tulle webbing in the process. The garment would have ripped if we had pulled any tighter to release the tag. When attempting to return the “B” disk to its original spot we discovered that once the disk is lifted, the device’s seal becomes irreversibly broken. Had MailOnline purchased the cocktail dress with the B-tag in this form, it would have likely been rejected by store associates. A spokesperson for Bloomingdale's told MailOnline in a statement that the B-tags 'are in place to reinforce the fact that Bloomingdale’s will be unable to accept a return of merchandise that has been worn, washed, damaged, used and/or altered.'","The new store policy applies to dresses priced at more than $150, a sales associate told MailOnline ."

Today, his relatives and friends listened to a series of emotional speeches, before attending a reception at the nearby Westin St Francis Hotel, a source told the New York Daily News. Crystal, a longtime friend of Williams who paid tribute to the Mrs Doubtfire actor during the Emmy Awards last month, was reportedly 'in tears' as he opened the memorial. Goldberg, Hunt and Williams's three children later gave speeches, before guests heard a musical tribute from Stevie Wonder with the Glide Memorial choir, it is said. The venue itself was decorated with posters of Williams, while attendees were given ribbon wristbands reading, 'Love the stillness of life', according to US Weekly. Williams's children Zak, 31, Zelda (pictured), 25, and 22-year-old Cody were also present, according to reports .

His funeral later took place at Monte's Chapel Of The Hills, a picturesque funeral home in leafy San Anselmo, according to his death certificate. Following Williams's death, his grieving widow revealed he had been struggling with deep depression, anxiety and a secret diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. Actor Rob Schneider, a long-term friend of Williams, said he believed the comedian's suicide was brought on in part because of new medication he was taking to combat the disease. He tweeted: ‘Now that we can talk about it #Robin Williams was on a drug treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s. One of the side effects is suicide.’ Co-star: Williams's 'Mork & Mindy' co-star Pam Dawber was among dozens of celebrities at today's service . Final resting place: Just a day after his death, Williams was cremated following an autopsy, with his ashes scattered at the beautiful San Francisco Bay area (pictured) Experts say Parkinson’s Disease can make symptoms of depression worse. Earlier this week, The Bourne Identity actor Matt Damon paid tribute to Williams, whom he said he 'owed everything' to. Damon, who launched his career with Ben Affleck in 1997 film Good Will Hunting, told Yahoo! News: 'Ben [Affleck] and I owe everything to him. He said yes to our movie and he got it made. 'I could never thank him enough. I look around at the life I have and how blessed I feel and so much of it started with him.' The 43-year-old actor added that he was 'shocked' when Williams committed suicide last month and hopes the tragedy will raise awareness of depression and how debilitating it can be.

"Fury: Kirstie Allsopp revealed on Twitter that her thrifty mother-in-law had been denied a mobile phone contract because she has no credit history . As a business owner who has never been in debt, Kirstie Allsopp’s mother-in-law should have found buying a new mobile phone to be a simple procedure. But 85-year-old Gretchen Andersen was turned down for a contract – because she does not have a credit rating. Mrs Andersen – who is mother to Miss Allsopp’s partner of ten years, Ben, 55 – employs three people in her antiques shop in Kensington, West London, and has had a bank account for 60 years. But because she has never borrowed money and appears to have chosen not to pay her utility bills by direct debit, she does not have a credit history and was told by Carphone Warehouse that she could not purchase a phone and contract with O2. Financial experts warned that her situation – which Miss Allsopp, 43, revealed on Twitter – reflects a wider problem that affects thousands of thrifty elderly people who handle their money in a similar way. Miss Allsopp said Mrs Andersen felt ‘personally insulted’ when she was turned down because it seemed she was being told she ‘wasn’t good enough to have a phone’. The television presenter added: ‘They came back and said she hadn’t got a good credit rating and my mother-in-law was like “How on earth can I have a not good credit rating? I’ve never had a debt in my life”. And that’s when they said yes, that’s why.’ James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, said: ‘If this woman is being prudent and hasn’t built up a credit history then she shouldn’t be penalised for that. ‘There is still a significant part of the elderly community who like to go to the post office and pay their bills. They don’t like to have direct debits because they feel they have better control of their cashflow that way.’ A spokesman for Carphone Warehouse said: ‘There can be a number of reasons why customers fail their initial credit check … We are working with O2 to investigate this matter to try to resolve the issue for the customer.’","Gretchen Andersen employs three people in her Kensington antiques shop .

"The 13 Army soldiers currently quarantined at an American base in Italy, after spending 30 days in Ebola-ravaged Liberia, are doing well and have not shown any sign of the deadly disease so far. Major General Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Forces in Africa, is also in quarantine and spoke to reporters in a video conference on Tuesday about conditions in isolation at the American base in Vincenzo, Italy. Gen Williams said his troops have spent the first three days of their 21-day quarantine eating meals together, skyping with family and working out. He added that spirits are high, and that the soldiers are proud of their work in Liberia fighting the 'silent enemy' of Ebola. 'The morale is high and very comfortable with the contribution we made,' said Gen Williams. Scroll down for video . Symptom free: Major General Darryl Williams spoke to reporters via video conference on Tuesday, just three days after he and a dozen solders were put in quarantine after returning from a month in Liberia . Under supervision: The returning Army soldiers are being confined to a housing complex with barracks, a dining hall and a gym, but no outside access, and must not interact with other personnel at the site. Above, the base in Vicenza . Gen Williams went on to explain that isolation means no contact with the outside world. At meal times, a team comes in to drop off food and they exit the dining area before the soldiers being monitored enter to eat. After the meal, eating utensils, including plastic cutlery, are burned. Their temperatures are taken twice a day. 'The team provided us the ability to have exercise equipment, so the folks are eating well, they are exercising...I have the ability to get on computers and interface with my family,' Gen Williams said. 'I am a grandfather, I talk to my daughter and granddaughter on Skype.' Flown over: The soldiers must also undergo twice-daily temperature checks for the deadly virus. Above, 100 U.S. Marines arrive at Roberts International Airport in Liberia on Thursday to join the fight against Ebola . Former commander: Upon his departure from Liberia on Saturday, Williams (pictured) transferred command of Operation Unified Assistance  to Major General Gary Volesky, who runs the 101st Airborne Division . Deadly virus: Ebola has already claimed the lives of at least 4,922 people, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Above, a health worker carries a two-month-old baby to an Ebola holding center in Monrovia, Liberia . The more than a dozen returning Army soldiers are the first wave of an expected 3,000 U.S. troops to be deployed to the Ebola hot zone countries in the coming weeks. Another 75 are expected to enter quarantine later this week. The Army is so far the only U.S. service to require a mandatory three-week isolation for soldiers fighting the Ebola outbreak in Africa - even though none of the soldiers had contact with sick patients. These first soldiers spent their month in Liberia building treatment units and training local health care workers. But, the quarantine policy was put in place to reassure both military families and the Italian government that the Army was taking the Ebola threat seriously. A military-wide solution to the troops being sent to Africa is expected to be decided later this week, by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.

"Some three-year-olds have spent so long in front of the TV and strapped into pushchairs that they appear to be unable to walk, the Government’s top expert on troubled families has warned. Louise Casey, 47, told a meeting in Westminster last week that a headteacher had informed her one child had spent so much time alone left in front of the screen that they could not even chew. Prime Minister David Cameron’s adviser admitted at the meeting on child protection and Sure Start children’s centres that successive governments have tried and failed to cope with problem families. Shocking findings: Louise Casey, 47, told a meeting in Westminster last week that a headteacher informed her one child had spent so much time alone left in front of the screen that they could not even chew . Miss Casey said the problem of young children being unable to walk is a clear sign of the height of the challenge to help England’s 120,000 most troubled families, reported The Sunday Times. The University of London history graduate, who was born in Redruth, Cornwall, said of governmental efforts to help: ‘Will any of these things touch those families? The answer is they haven’t done yet.’ National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Russell Hobby said: ‘It’s an extreme case, but more frequently we hear of children who can’t speak when they come to school.’ He told the Sunday Times those children can ‘only grunt’ and some also still wear nappies at the age of five. Mr Hobby said that issue and not being able to speak are ‘two most common complaints’. Sat down: Some three-year-olds have spent so long in front of the TV and strapped into pushchairs that they are unable to walk, prompting Mail cartoonist Pugh into action . Miss Casey's comments echoed the thoughts of Jackanory and Play School creator Joy Whitby, who warned last week that parents should avoid leaving young children unsupervised in front of the TV. ‘If I had a child under five at home again, I wouldn’t want to leave him in front of the television set unsupervised if I could possibly help it,’ the 82-year-old producer told the Daily Telegraph. Last year Miss Casey released a study that revealed a shocking culture of criminality at the heart of Britain’s most feckless families who think nothing of having children they cannot afford. The hard-hitting report revealed that those responsible for antisocial behaviour feature a high incidence of incest and sexual abuse, physical violence and a spiral of alcohol abuse and crime.","Government expert on troubled families Louise Casey, 47, spoke of problem .

"For years, customers at Fat Smitty's hamburger restaurant have stuck personalised dollar bills to the eatery's walls and ceiling. Now the owner of the landmark diner - which sits on Highway 101 in Discovery Bay, Washington - has finally taken down the vast collection of banknotes and donated the cash to charity. Carl 'Fat Smitty' Schmidt struggled over his decision to remove the thousands of dollar bills that have slowly accumulated in his restaurant over the last quarter of a century. Made of money: Fat Smitty's manager Casey Carson (left) talks with customers Matt Organ and Tim Crawford last week. On Saturday the Discovery Bay, Washington, restaurant's vast collection of dollar bills totalling $10,316 was taken down . Tradition: Carl 'Fat Smitty' Schmidt struggled over his decision to remove the thousands of dollar bills that have slowly accumulated in his restaurant over the last quarter of a century . But on Saturday, he enlisted Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts to take down the money ahead of a refurbishment. After a lengthy count, it turns out he had amassed $10,316 in $1 bills. Mr Schmidt, a retired marine, said he is giving all but $3,000 to a local Boy Scouts project. Over the years, Boy Scouts regularly stopped at Fat Smitty's on the way home from camping trips. The rest of the money will go to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Schmidt's connection to that hospital was not immediately known. Casey Carson, who is Mr Schmidt's nephew and now manages Fat Smitty's, told the KitsapSun.com: 'It is hard to take all this down. It makes it easier to know that the money is going to charity, and hopefully people will put it back up again.' The Fat Smitty's tradition began in 1985 when a travelling salesman wrote his name on a single dollar bill and tacked it to the wall. Over the course of the next 27 years, more than 10,000 customers followed his lead, writing messages on their own dollar bills. Mr Schmidt was unable to find the salesman's original banknote during Saturday's clean-up. Fat Smitty's: The landmark diner sits on Highway 101 in Discover Bay, Washington . History: The Fat Smitty's tradition began in 1985 when a travelling salesman wrote his name on a single dollar bill and tacked it to the wall . End of an era: Mr Schmidt was unable to find the salesman's original banknote during Saturday's clean-up . His nephew had estimated there would be $6,000 in cash stuck to the restaurant's walls and ceiling - his guess ended up more than $4,000 short of the final total. The building that houses Fat Smitty's has operated as a restaurant since the 1940s. Mr Schmidt took it over in 1983 and finally passed on the reins to Mr Carson two years ago. Mr Carson said: 'Four generations of families have come here to eat and four generations have worked here. 'I got married here in 1994. There is so much history that you don't really want to change anything.' A newly decorated Fat Smitty's is scheduled to reopen in March when Mr Carson hopes customers will continue to tack dollar bills to its walls.","Tradition at Fat Smitty's diner in Discovery Bay, Washington, was instigated by travelling salesman in 1985 ."
"Stuck: Firefighters had to break apart a chimney to extract Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa, 30, who had gotten stuck while trying to break into a home . Firefighters took apart a chimney brick by brick and then squirted in dish soap while freeing a woman who got stuck while allegedly trying to burglarize a home in California. Neighbors heard the sound of a woman crying coming from the chimney of a two-story home in Thousand Oaks early Sunday morning. ABC reports that when police arrived, they found Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa, 30, still conscious but stuck near the top of the flue. Firefighters used handheld demolition hammers to remove bricks from the chimney in order to get down to where Nunez-Figueroa was trapped. Once they reached her, they poured soap down the chimney to make removal easier, according to Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Captain Mike Lindbery. 'Chimney flue was lubricated with dish soap prior to hoisting patient,' read the accompanying caption to a photo of the rescue tweeted from Lindbery's account. Nunez-Figueroa was lifted out of the destroyed chimney and taken to the hospital for an evaluation before being arrested for illegal entry and giving false information to a peace officer. The homeowner spoke to CBS and said that he met the woman online, and that this was not her first time trying to break into his home. 'It’s actually the second attempt for her trying to access the inside of my house,' he said, 'from the roof.' Demolition: Using handheld jackhammers, firefighters went to work tearing apart the chimney to free Nunez-Figueroa . Repeat offender: The homeowner claimed that this was not the first time that Nunez-Figueroa had attempted to break in through the roof . Lubrication: Firefighters sprayed liquid dish soap down the flue in order to make it easier to extract Nunez-Figueroa . Extracted: Firefighters lifted Nunez-Figueroa from a destroyed chimney after lubricating the flue with dish soap to make removing her easier . 'I’m feeling better, not so weirded out anymore that that person isn’t in my chimney anymore,' the homeowner said. 'Trying to figure out what I’m going to do with my chimney since it’s in pieces but better my chimney than probably me,' he added.

"These stark pictures show a Romanian caravan park located just outside the city of Hogdalen, Stockholm.

"Mark Twain only lived in Hannibal, Missouri, for 13 years, but many of his most famous stories were inspired by this humble Midwestern city. A visit to Hannibal today, with its excellent museums, preserved historic sites and old-timey antiques shops, offers a way to appreciate the impact this place had on one of America's best-known writers. And of course, Hannibal sits on the banks of the Mississippi River, which figured so large in Twain's life and writing. Famous fence: In Hannibal, Missouri you'll see the fence that Mark Twain's character Tom Sawyer persuaded other children to whitewash when he was supposed to paint it . MARK TWAIN BOYHOOD HOME & MUSEUM . A mere $11 gets you a look at nine historic sites and museums, all within a few blocks of one another. They include the actual houses where Twain and the real children who inspired his characters Huckleberry Finn and Becky Thatcher lived in the mid-1800s. You'll see the bedroom window the adventuresome Twain climbed out of as a boy; you'll see the fence that his character Tom Sawyer persuaded other children to whitewash when he was supposed to paint it. You'll also get a real sense of what Hannibal was like when Twain lived here in the 1840s and early '50s, and how this place fed his imagination and sensibility. This was no lonely rural spot; it was a bustling river town, with three blacksmith shops, a distillery, tobacco factory and two slaughterhouses, with pigs herded through the streets. Twain — born Samuel Clemens — was not a privileged child. After his father died, his mother couldn't afford his 25-cent weekly school fee. He was apprenticed at age 11 to a printer, which led to work as a newspaperman. Later he was a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi. Boyhood home: This photo  shows a room inside the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal, depicting Twain and his characters. Twain grew up in Hannibal in the mid-1800s. The town on the Mississippi River inspired many of his most famous stories . An exhibit from a museum gallery operated by the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal The exhibit depicts Twain contemplating his books and characters, many of which were inspired by his memories of growing up in the mid-1800s in Hannibal . His pen name, Mark Twain, was a river call that described the water depth. An interpretive center behind Twain's boyhood home offers photos, exhibits and wonderful quotes from Twain's writings that put his life and work in context. A museum gallery at 120 N. Main St. is filled with artifacts, from his top hat to 15 Norman Rockwell paintings created for special editions of 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Huckleberry Finn.' Twain's quips, prominently showcased, can seem as fresh and cynical as a 21st-century tweet, like this one: 'Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.' You can't miss the statue of Tom and Huck at the foot of Cardiff Hill on Main Street. Sculptures of Twain stand in Schwartz Gardens and Riverview Park. CONTEXT AND CONTROVERSY . The museums also tackle the controversies over Twain's writings. In his own lifetime, 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' — about the wild, ragged son of the town drunk who runs away on a raft with an escaped slave, Jim — was banned because it was considered vulgar. In the late 20th century, the book was banned because Twain's language and depiction of Jim were considered racist. One exhibit offers context for Twain's views: Slavery was legal in Missouri during his youth; his family rented or owned slaves when they could afford it, and he's quoted as recalling that nobody he knew ever questioned it. But one incident made him think twice about it, when he complained to his mother about a slave boy who sang and laughed incessantly. She responded tearfully that the slave child would never see his own mother again, and at least when the boy sang, 'it shows he is not remembering.' Becky Thatcher's home in Hannibal, part of a complex of historic sites and museums operated by the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum. Becky was a fictional character in the writings of Mark Twain, who lived in Hannibal as a boy in the mid-1800s. Twain said a girl named Laura Hawkins, who lived in this house, was the model for Becky . River life: A riverboat docked in Hannibal, Missouri, on the Mississippi River.  Many of Twain's writings were inspired by his memories of Hannibal and the river . THE TOWN AND THE RIVER . For a small city (population 18,000), Hannibal offers some good eating. LaBinnah Bistro, 207 N. Fifth St., has friendly service, charming Victorian-era decor and an inviting dinner menu that includes fish, steak and Mediterranean dishes. LaBinnah is Hannibal spelled backward, named for the town's LaBinnah Club, where Twain spoke on his last visit to Hannibal in 1902 — one of five trips he made there as an adult. The new Mark Twain Brewing Co., 422 N. Main St., offers burgers, a big selection of beers and other pub fare. Hannibal has a wide variety of lodging. Treasure-hunters should check out the half-dozen antiques and gift shops on and around Main Street. If you're driving to Hannibal from St. Louis, about 120 miles (190 kilometers) away, get off the interstate and take the Great River Road, Route 79, which winds through tiny towns, fields and farms, with scenic stretches along the Mississippi. Honored characters: A statue of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn stands in Hannibal.

"Back under observation: Authorities admit they lost panhandler Michael Lively in Dallas after the homeless man was potentially exposed to Ebola while riding in the same ambulance as Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who brought Ebola to America . A homeless man who added to the panic in Dallas after officials let him get away after he potentially came into contact with Ebola-infected bodily fluids was back under observation Sunday evening. Michael Lively, who was the first person to ride in the ambulance that carried U.S. Ebola patient zero to the hospital, was taken to the psych ward of Parkland Hospital following a city-wide search by rattled Dallas police. Police are working to obtain a court order to hold Lively at the hospital, against his will if necessary. Authorities had monitored him a day earlier but want to take his temperature regularly to make sure he doesn't have a fever, a possible symptom of Ebola infection. Losing track of Lively was just the latest mistake by authorities in Texas, who have come in for heavy criticism over their handling of the Ebola outbreak. Lucky for Texas, Lively is not sick and not showing any symptoms of the disease. Texas public health officials say there is 'zero chance' the homeless man spread Ebola to anyone else - even if he became infected with it. Centers for Disease Control Director Thomas Friedan sought to reassure a jittery public during a press conference from Atlanta, police in Dallas combed the streets in search of Lively, who rode in the same ambulance that transported Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan to the hospital. It is possible that Lively came into contact with Duncan's Ebola-infected bodily fluids during that ride. The CDC is currently monitoring 48 people in Dallas who may have come into contact with Duncan while he was contagious with the deadly disease. Clean up: Members of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company are seen as they sanitize the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital on October 5 . Precautions: Hazardous material cleaners spray disinfectant on their personal protective equipment after working in the apartment . Getting a peak: Neighbors watch as members of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company are seen as they sanitize the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital . Contamination: Ebola is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. Duncan was reportedly sweating profusely and vomiting when he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance that picked up Michael Lively next . Ebola can manifest in a patient any time up to 21 days after exposure. A patient is not contagious until symptoms begin to emerge. Lively is rated as 'low risk' for infection by authorities, but officials were still desperate to monitor him. At a press conference on Sunday, CDC Director Thomas Friedan declared: 'There’s no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.' Ebola is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. Duncan was reportedly sweating profusely and vomiting when he was taken to the hospital. He said that of the 48 people at risk for becoming infect with Ebola, just ten are considered high-risk. Three of them are the family members that Duncan stayed with in a Dallas apartment and seven are healthcare workers who came into contact with him while he was contagious. Unlucky number: The ambulance from Dallas Fire-Rescue station 37 that carried infected patient Thomas Eric Duncan picked up at least one passenger being being fully decontaminated. That passenger, a homeless man, is now missing . Projecting calm: Dr Thomas Friedan, the director of the CDC, said health officials in Dallas are successfully containing the Ebola outbreak there . Just arrived: This pictured, obtained exclusively by MailOnline, shows Duncan minutes after he stepped off a plane in Dallas and was greeted by family members . He noted that none of the people being monitored has shown any signs of being ill. On Saturday, Texas Presbyterian Hospital announced that Duncan's health had declined and that he is now in critical condition and 'fighting for his life' against the disease. Duncan is not receiving any experimental drugs to fight the Ebola because officials fear his body could not handle the medication in his current unstable condition. Instead, doctors are giving him 'supportive care,' ABC News reports. Supplies of ZMapp, the miracle drug that cured two American Ebola patients and a British nurse, have run out. Drug makers are working to produce more, but the process takes months. Friedan said today that he will brief President Barack Obama on the outbreak tomorrow and that officials are considering stepping up checks at airports to help prevent infected patients from entering the country. Currently, travelers from West African nations are checked for fever and questioned about their contact with Ebola patients at their departure airports, but are not formally screened before being allowed to enter the U.S. Duncan allegedly lied to airport officials and told them he had not been in contact with anyone infected with Ebola before flying out of Monrovia, Liberia, last month. Fears: Officers hand out facemasks at Newark Liberty Airport today, where it was feared a passenger had Ebola. It later turned out he did not . Relocated: Two of Duncan's relatives who were quarantined inside the apartment are seen leaving and being moved to another, undisclosed location . Friedan stood by the screening procedures, pointing out today that 77 people have been prevented from getting on planes in West Africa thanks to the efforts of airport officials who were trained by the CDC. Despite the calm and collected image that the CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services today, doctors and public health officials have repeatedly fumbled when confronted with the virus. When Duncan first went to the hospital with a high fever on September 25, he was given antibiotics and sent home - despite revealing that he had recently been in Ebola-stricken Liberia. He was not diagnosed with the disease until his girlfriend called an ambulance on September 28. The ambulance transported at least one other person before being taken out of service. Then, after the the case of Ebola was confirmed, family members and friends who had contact with Duncan said they were left to go about their daily routines without contact from the CDC or local health officials. Four days after the Ebola diagnosis, Duncan's girlfriend revealed that his sweat-stained sheets were still on his bed and that no one from the CDC or health department had been by to collect his belongings. It was not until Friday that a cleaning crew finally arrived to remove the infectious items and clean the apartment.","Authorities searched for the Michael Lively on Sunday and took him to a hospital for observation .

"Three men have been charged with hate crime and assault after screaming profanities at a man dressed as a woman before chasing him down the street and shooting him in the bottom. Cody Sigue, 22 Matthew Smith, 21, and Tavon Johnson, 17, began to harass the victim and a friend as they walked down Broadway, near Putnam Avenue, in Brooklyn at around 7am. After hurling anti-gay abuse at the pair, they then chased the men as they ran away - before opening fire. Scene of the crime: The homophobic attackers targeted the man dressed as a woman as he walked down Broadway, near Putnam Avenue (above), at around 7am on Saturday . The man struck by the bullet was taken to Brookdale University Hospital, treated for his injuries and released. Police officers soon caught up with the homophobic gang of attackers, who are all from Brooklyn, and after a brief chase on foot, were able to arrest them all, New York Daily News reports. Johnson and Sigue were charged with menacing and third-degree hate crime, while Smith was charged with assault in the first-degree, cops said. Police sources said Johnson has one prior arrest for marijuana, Sigue has one prior sealed arrest and Smith has 'an extensive arrest history', with 14 arrests including robbery. Caught: After a brief chase on foot , NYPD officers arrested all three of the attackers and they have now been charged with various offences including third-degree hate crime and assault in the first-degree (file picture) One gay witness, Daquan Ruddock, 24, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant not far from the crime scene, described the shocking incident. He said: 'It's messed up. That shows how gay people can't walk around in the street without someone saying something or doing something towards them. It's sad.' Eric Dowling, 30, a barber at M.J. Beauty Salon, said the victim was a customer at the shop. He added: 'It's a violent neighborhood - a lot of things happen. It's a sad thing it happened to him.' Last August, a transgender woman was beaten to death in Harlem, New York, by a group of men who had been shouting anti-gay abuse at her.

"On Thursday afternoon radical new measures were announced for Parliament House, set to force women wearing the burqa to sit in an enclosed room behind glass screens. However on Thursday evening it was revealed by Fairfax Media that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had backed down on the plans proposed by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senate President Stephen Parry earlier in the day. Mr Abbott is said to have been forced to ask Ms Bishop and Mr Parry to reconsider the plan due to extreme public backlash. Despite this, the prime minister is likely to maintain that different measures apply for more secure areas of the building. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has backed down on new measures set to be put in place which ban Muslim women wearing the burqa from sitting in certain parts of parliament . Labor and the Greens are worried parliament is signalling it's OK to treat Muslim women poorly, and Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has slammed it as 'religious apartheid'. 'The decision by the government to isolate, in their own rooms, burqa-wearers observing the parliament has no security merit at all,' Mr Wilkie said. Mrs Bishop's office told AAP on Thursday night they were yet to have any contact from the prime minister on the matter. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Mr Abbott let the divisive debate on banning burqas and niqabs drag on too long. 'If we're asking our troops to stand up to sectarianism, intolerance and prejudice overseas, we should be prepared to do the same in our parliament,' he told AAP. Labor also wrote asking Mrs Bishop to reconsider the move, saying every Australian should feel welcome visiting Parliament House. Senate President Stephen Parry says security officers need to be able to quickly identify people shouting out from the public galleries. Some senators have condemned the planned move saying it has no security merit, while others said Mr Abbott does not have the power to veto the decision . He insists it's an interim measure until Australian Federal Police and ASIO advise him and Mrs Bishop on screening policies in relation to garments that hide identity. Liberal Senator George Christensen said on Thursday night people shouldn't get their hopes up over the prime ministerial intervention because Mr Abbott didn't have a veto over the presiding officers' decisions. The ABC report that two ministers told them that the move to discriminate against Australians with face coverings was a mistake, and one apparently described the plan as 'incredibly foolish'. Reports from Fairfax Media earlier on Thursday revealed the changes that were set to be introduced for the presiding officers regarding access arrangements. Article C of the changes stated: 'Persons with facial coverings entering the galleries of the House of Representatives and Senate will be seated in the enclosed galleries. This will ensure that persons with facial coverings can continue to enter the Chamber galleries, without needing to be identifiable'. It meant women who wear face coverings will still be allowed to enter parliament and view the proceedings and overcome potential problems for security staff who are required to identify all visitors seated in the lower public gallery. The enclosed space (on a floor above) is usually reserved for children on school excursions, to limit noise disruptions. The move comes as outspoken Senator Jacqui Lambie clashed on live TV with a  Muslim woman as she continued to call for burqas to be banned. Spat: Senator Lambie appeared on the program with Muslim Women's Association spokeswoman Maha Abdo . In a spirited debate on the Seven's Sunrise program, Palmer United Party Senator Ms Lambie said the debate was a 'national security issue' because people needed to be identifiable. But Muslim Women's Association executive officer Maha Abdo, who wears a hijab, laughed off her comments, insisting someone wearing a burqa is not a threat.. 'How is that going to be a threat? That's a question for you,' Ms Abdo said. Ms Lambie said she needed to be able to see people's faces and 'body language' at all times. 'We need to be able to identify people walking on the streets, that's what's going on,' she said. But Ms Abdo insisted Muslim women were allowed to lift their veil to show their faces to authorities. Debate: Maha Abdo, the executive officer of the Muslim Women's Association . 'It is a given that for identification purposes, Muslim women, within reason, can just lift up and show their ID,' she said. Under further questioning, Ms Lambie said she would not ask people to remove hats, overcoats or other clothing as she could see their faces. Ms Abdo replied that she could easily ask to see the face of a woman wearing a burqa if she asked. 'You can see it! No one's stopping you from not seeing it.' Ms Lambie fired back: 'I cannot see who is under that clothing. I can't see if there's a man or woman under that clothing.' 'No one's stopping you from seeing it though!' Ms Abdo said. Fiery confrontation: Ms Lambie came under questioning from Ms Abdo . Ms Lambie also admitted she had never asked a Muslim woman to show their face to her. 'Is there any reason -  why do you -  do you feel offended that I'm asking you to show your face?' she asked Ms Abdo. 'We live in this wonderful country. And I'm very aware, that, you know, you have beautiful faces, and... it would be nice to be able to see them. 'But it still comes back to a national security issue'. The senator also praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott for his 'courage' and 'strength' in publicly branding the burqa 'confronting' yesterday. 'I've said before that I find it a fairly confronting form of attire, and frankly I wish it was not worn,' Mr Abbott told reporters. 'Confronting'. The Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured centre) yesterday repeated remarks he had made in the past about the burqa . 'But we are a free country and a free society and it's not the business of government to tell people what they should and should not wear.' Mr Abbott also said that, as far as he was aware, no woman has ever worn a burqa into Parliament House. Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi has written to Parliament's presiding officers requesting the burqa be banned from the premises. Last month, Ms Lambie re-posted a meme of a woman wearing a burqa holding a gun which was captioned: 'For security reasons it is time to ban the burqa'. Outspoken Independent MP Andrew Wilkie said 'the decision by the Government to isolate, in their own rooms, burqa-wearers observing the Parliament has no security merit at all. The segregation of one group of people like this is nothing more than religious apartheid and deeply wrong'.","On Thursday afternoon new security measures in parliament were set to force burqa-wearing women behind glass screens .

"The man commanding Australia's joint task force in the Middle East says the Islamic State (IS) is vulnerable in Northern Iraq and will be destroyed. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Major General Craig Orme said IS has been successful in waging a 'psychological campaign' with shock and terror tactics, but that their military capability is weak. 'They are not magic,' he said, adding that like any army, IS fighters in Iraq need to refuel, rearm, secure their communication lines and supply their troops with essentials like food and shelter.  IS forces do not have the resources or organisational capability of a conventional army, he said. 'As they have tried to start acting like a state force, they play onto our ground and our expertise and they will get smacked,' said Major General Orme. 'When they do mass we will smack them and smack them hard.' 'If they're sitting in one spot, we'll go and bomb them and we're happy to do that.' Commander of Australian forces in the Middle East Major General Craig Orme pictured (centre) at the Afghan National Army warehouse says he has 'every confidence'  the US-led coalition will defeat IS, adding: 'We will smack them and smack them hard' An RAAF Super Hornet loaded with explosives takes off for its first combat mission in Iraq this week . Major General Orme said IS forces would not be able to rely on intimidation to obtain food and shelter from local people for very long and that the areas of Northern Iraq 'are a long way from their source of strength in Syria.' He told the Daily Telegraph he has 'every confidence' that the US-led coalition will defeat IS over time and said coalition air operations were already having an impact on IS. 'We are in the first quarter, things are looking positive and the wind is with us,' he told AAP reporters. Major General Orme's statements come days after Australian military forces made their first strike against Islamic State militants in Iraq. The Australian Department of Defence confirmed on Thursday that two bombs were dropped from an F/A-18F Super Hornet on to an ISIL facility. The next step will be deployment of Australian special forces to assist Iraqi security forces on the ground, with a legal agreement to proceed in the process of being finalised. 'There is a real sense that Australia is making a significant contribution, that that contribution is highly valued, that that contribution is making a difference,' said Major General Orme. The crew of a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18F Super Hornet disembark their plane after completing their first combat mission over Iraq . The United States has been bombing IS and other terrorist groups in Syria for two weeks with the help of Arab allies. Australia began flying combat operations in Iraq last Sunday. Australia's efforts 'are in response to a request for assistance by the Iraqi Government in combating ISIL terrorists, said a Department of Defence statement. No bombs were dropped in the first Australian mission which saw two F/A-18F Super Hornets leave a military base in Dubai to take out Islamic State targets.The jets flew around northern Iraq for seven hours but it was reported they did not locate targets and no munitions were used.

Authorities have warned a 'long campaign' lies ahead for forces in Iraq, with the recently deployed Air Task Group of F/A 18 jets thought to be the largest since the Vietnam War.They joined aircraft and tanker transportation already operating in the Middle East. Defence Minister David Johnston said previously the government was 'optimistic' that they could quell the threat of Islamic State quickly. But he added: 'We must say months and more because we want to under-promise and over-deliver here. 'I'm quietly confident... but the fact is, we haven't even begun to deal with the threat to the civilian population in Iraq.' Mr Johnston also said there was a chance Australian troops could be the focus of insider attack, which were seen during the Afghanistan War.

Two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18F Super Hornets departed Australiaís main base in the Middle East to conduct their first combat mission in Iraq on Sunday . Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop claimed the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State. Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September. 'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said. Ms Bishop said sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,' 'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' she told The Sunday Times. 'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.' The aircraft were equipped with a 20mm cannon, GPS-guided munitions, laser-guided munitions, sidewinder heat-seeking missiles and radar-guided missiles .

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to carry out air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State. A further three-quarters of voters also believed the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil was real. Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday. Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, Ms Bishop said. 'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,' she said. 'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies. 'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.'

"Claire Blackman, the wife of Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman, says she has been overwhelmed by the support shown to him since he was jailed for murder . The wife of jailed Royal Marine Alexander Blackman last night said she was ‘overwhelmed’ by support for calls for his freedom. Claire Blackman praised the ‘outstanding’ backing from more than 100,000 people, including MPs and senior military figures. There is now huge momentum behind the campaign to urge senior judges to reduce the commando’s sentence or even quash his conviction for murdering an Afghan insurgent. The 39-year-old sergeant must serve at least ten years in prison after being found guilty last month of executing the severely wounded Taliban prisoner in Helmand in September 2011. But the severity of the punishment has sparked a massive wave of support for the first British serviceman to be convicted of murder on active service abroad since the Second World War. Many believe Blackman should have received a more lenient sentence reflecting how the intense stress of fighting on the front line led to a ‘moment of madness’. Speaking on behalf of Mrs Blackman, solicitor Issy Hogg said: ‘She has been overwhelmed by the tremendous kindness and outstanding support which the British public has shown and would like to express her gratitude for the comfort this continues to provide.’ She added that Mrs Blackman ‘wishes to avoid the glare of publicity at this difficult time’. Last night a petition on a government website calling for Blackman to be freed had attracted more than 26,000 names. Another 80,000 people had used Facebook to call for the non-commissioned officer – dismissed from the elite corps in disgrace – to also have his conviction overturned. Lord Ashcroft, the billionaire Tory peer, wrote on Twitter that he could help bankroll the appeal. Blackman, pictured on the day he shot the insurgent, was jailed for 10 years but 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the sentence to be reduced . However, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it would be ‘wrong’ to comment on the clamour for a reduced sentence. He said: ‘This is an independent judicial . decision. The court will have had all the facts, including pleas in . mitigation around the sentencing decision. There may well be an appeal . over the sentence.’ Meanwhile, a survey found that six out of ten people thought the commando’s prison sentence should be halved to five years. One in three of the 900 people questioned by pollsters Survation felt he should serve no jail time at all. Blackman’s legal team have pledged to fight for a reduced sentence at the Court Martial Appeal Court and are studying whether there are grounds to challenge the conviction itself. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it would be 'wrong' to comment on the clamour for a reduced sentence . Supporters have pointed to the case of Canadian soldier Captain Robert Semrau, who was kicked out of the Canadian Army but spared prison for shooting a severely wounded insurgent in 2008. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said: ‘The court should have paid greater attention to this man’s fine record and that he had done several tours of duty in Afghanistan.’ Lord West of Spithead, a former head of the Royal Navy, said it would be a ‘coup’ for Islamic extremists if they succeeded in capturing or killing relatives of Blackman, known during his trial as Marine A, in retaliation. ‘By releasing his name, it is dangerous not just for the marine in prison but also his family,’ he said. ‘I hope somebody is talking to his family and is keeping an eye out.’ Left-wing MP Eric Joyce, a former soldier, said: ‘I doubt whether the judge has the first idea of what it is like to be on the battlefield when bullets are flying around.’ The court martial heard on Friday that Blackman was suffering from combat stress when he murdered the Taliban captive, a scene filmed on a colleague’s helmet-mounted camera. He was also trying to deal with the grief of his father’s death months earlier. He lost his cool near the end of a ‘tour from hell’ in which 23 servicemen died and insurgents had hung the limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’. Blackman, from Taunton, Somerset, claimed he thought the insurgent was already dead but he was told by a judge he had ‘tarnished the reputation’ of Britain’s armed forces.","MPs and senior military figures among those calling for Alexander Blackman's ten year jailed sentence to be cut .

"An alleged stalker is accused of bombarding Lindsay Lohan with more than 1,000 messages and punching a bouncer who barred him from seeing her rehearse for her West End comeback. Daniel Vorderwulbecke will face trial over the altercation at London's Playhouse Theatre, where the Hollywood star made her stage debut last month in David Mamet's satire Speed-The-Plow. It is claimed the 37-year-old, who goes by names including King Lionheart and DJ Dan Cortez, sent Miss Lohan thousands of text messages. Accused: A court heard Lindsay Lohan (left) was harassed for seven weeks by Daniel Vorderwulbecke (right), culminating in him punching a bouncer at London's Playhouse Theatre as she rehearsed for her comeback . Claims: The charges say Vorderwulbecke damaged a bin at the Playhouse Theatre (pictured), where the play is currently showing, before returning three days later and having an altercation with the doorman . He also claims to speak to the actress personally and through social media every day, a court heard. Today he was bailed to the specialist Gordon Hospital for mental health patients in Pimlico, central London, where specialists will prepare a psychiatric report ahead of his trial. His lawyer, Patrick McGovern, said he was probably ‘unfit to plead’ due to his mental health. It is not known what condition Vorderwulbecke is reported to have. It is claimed Vorderwulbecke stalked Miss Lohan for seven weeks between July and September this year by bombarding her with threats in person and through 'various communication devices' including Instagram. On September 8, police were called to the Playhouse Theatre, where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at £100. 'Good but by no means great': Lindsay Lohan had a mixed, but largely accommodating, reception from critics . Stalked: It is alleged the actress was bombarded with messages as she prepared for the production (pictured) Miss Lohan played secretary Karen opposite Hollywood executive Charlie Fox, played by Nigel Lindsay (right) Three days later, on September 11, he allegedly assaulted security worker Cameron Ashrat. A short hearing today before Westminster magistrates', which Vorderwulbecke did not attend, was adjourned until January 15 for the further reports to be drawn up. Magistrate Avrill Newman said: 'The defendant shall be tried on 15 January with a pre trial hearing on November 27. 'He is released on bail to reside at [a] psychiatric hospital... and be accompanied by a qualified medical officer at all times.' Messages: The defendant is accused of abusing her via Instagram, where Miss Lohan posted this selfie today . Social: Miss Lohan has been out in London including at the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant last night (above) Well-earned rest: The actress was seen leaving the popular celebrity haunt with a male companion last night . Vorderwulbecke, whose address was given as the Gordon Hospital, is charged with assault, harassment and criminal damage. He has not yet entered a plea. A former star of The Parent Trap and Mean Girls, 28-year-old Miss Lohan made her West End debut last month after years of making more headlines for arrests and rehab than her acting. She split critics, many of whom were positive but some of whom laid into her with full force. The Daily Mail's Quentin Letts slammed the choice of the actress in Speed-the-Plow, a satire about the barrel-scraping of Hollywood film-makers, as a 'travesty of art', while Mark Shenton of The Stage said the production strayed into self-parody. Popular: Miss Lohan also visited the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant last week after one of her performances .

"James Bond will return - and this time it's to be in a plot which his creator Ian Fleming dreamed up almost 60 years ago. The world's most famous spy will feature in a new novel by Anthony Horowitz, in which he infiltrates the glamorous world of 1950s motorsport to foil an attack on a grand prix race. Originally titled Murder on Wheels, the story was created by Fleming before his death in 1964 for a 007 TV series which was never made. Scroll down for video . Kept in reserve: A new Bond novel will be based on a plot which Ian Fleming, 007's creator, dreamed up years before Sean Connery introduced the spy to Hollywood in 1962's Dr No (pictured). The plot was never used . Unlike most of the ideas for the series, assembled in the late 1950s, Murder on Wheels was never turned into a short story by Fleming and did not become part of the blockbuster film series. It has now been handed to the best-selling novelist and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, who said: 'How could I possibly refuse?'. The book features original characters such as M and Miss Moneypenny, has the working title Project One and is due for release in September next year. Mr Horowitz - who recently wrote a new adventure for Sherlock Holmes - said: 'It's no secret that Ian Fleming's extraordinary character has had a profound influence on my life. 'So when the estate approached me to write a new James Bond novel, how could I possibly refuse? Big shoes to fill: Ian Fleming (left) created the idea in the 1950s and it will be written by Anthony Horowitz (right) 'It's a huge challenge - more difficult even than Sherlock Holmes in some ways - but having original, unpublished material by Fleming has been an inspiration. This is a book I had to write.' The prolific author's screenwriting credits include Midsomer Murders and Foyle's War, and his Alex Rider series about a teenage spy has sold more than 19 million books. He follows in the footsteps of authors including Kingsley Amis, William Boyd and Sebastian Faulks who have written new Bond books since Ian Fleming's death. Mr Boyd's book, Solo, was published last year and featured Bond embroiled in a civil war in 1969 Africa. The Bond books inspired one of the most successful film franchises in Hollywood history, beginning with Dr No in 1962, and have sold more than 100 million copies. Kept under wraps: Most of Ian Fleming's ideas were turned into books or films, but a few are kept by his estate . Yet a small number of plots created for 007 by Ian Fleming have still not been used, and they are kept tightly under wraps by his family. His great-niece Jessie Grimond said: 'There are a few plot outlines which he never used and which, till now, have never been published, or aired. 'Given that Anthony is as brilliant a screenwriter as he is a novelist, we thought it would be exciting to see what he would do with one of them.'","Idea was by the late Ian Fleming, who created ubiquitous spy character .

"Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft, 25, was shot dead in Afghanistan as he patrolled a meeting between peacekeepers and Afghan elders . The family of a soldier killed in Afghanistan have been ordered to repay hundreds of pounds – because he died after receiving his wages. Military bosses said that since Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft was paid a month in advance, his relatives must return £433 to cover the ten days after the 25-year-old was shot. Last night his shocked father Tony described the decision as ‘disgusting’, adding: ‘Jordan gave his life for this country and this is how they treat him. ‘When I read the letter you could have knocked me down with a feather. When it sunk in what it said, it felt like I’d been poked in the eye with a stick. I want to make it clear that this is in no way a question of money, but one of respect.’ The controversy comes after it was revealed MoD civil servants collected annual bonuses of almost £6,000 each in August despite cuts to frontline troops and services. The letter to Lance Corporal Bancroft’s parents was sent by the MoD’s Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre on October 14, not long after the family raised £10,000 for his Duke of Lancaster Regiment. It explained that a refund was being given for annual leave the soldier had been entitled to take, amounting to more than £1,000, but with a sum deducted to cover the ten days after he died in August 2010. Bereft: Jordan's father, Tony, with the letter from the MoD. He said he felt like he had been 'poked in the eye with a sharp stick' when he received it . It said: ‘Following your son’s untimely death, a salary payment for the full month of August was paid into his account. This included £433.13 in respect of pay for the days after the date of his death. ‘Not wishing to cause any further distress or potential hardship to yourself at that time, the MoD took no action to recover the overpayment. However, now a further sum is due in respect of his pay and the “overpayment” has been offset.’ Lance Corporal Bancroft, from Earby, Lancashire, was killed on August 21 last year. The soldier was due to marry girlfriend Lauren O’Hara, 21, after his tour of Afghanistan. He joined the Duke of Lancaster Regiment in September 2001. Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft joined the Duke of Lancaster Regiment during 2001. He had been due to marry his girlfriend upon his return from Afghanistan . Mr Bancroft, 47, a taxi driver, blamed pen-pushers in Whitehall for the letter rather than the Regiment. A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘Service personnel are paid up to the date of their death. ‘Occasionally, deceased service personnel may be paid for the whole month of their death where the notification of death comes after the pay run has already taken place. ‘Whilst this results in a notional overpayment, no attempt is made to recover such sums after they have been paid. ‘However, where a further salary payment or credit is made at a later date, the final payment is adjusted to reflect the correct amount.’","Father said he felt like he had been 'poked in the eye with a sharp stick' when he read letter .

"The RSPCA is under pressure to drop its right to bring prosecutions after it spent £22.5 million on prosecutions over two years. The cost includes £10 million for vets fees and taking care of animals during the prosecution process. The rest covers legal fees, administration and expert witness costs. An independent review that uncovered the cost also showed that the RSPCA has been paying excessive legal fees. Lawyers were paid up to £1,200 a day in some cases – higher than the amounts paid to state prosecutors in child cruelty cases. In the doghouse: The RSPCA spent £22.5 million on legal bills over two years and have been spending excessive amounts on legal fees . The review was undertaken by Stephen Wooler, a former Chief Inspector of the CPS Inspectorate. He was asked by the charity to examine its prosecution policy after several controversial cases, including £326,000 spent on one against the Heythrop hunt in David Cameron’s constituency. Although the case was successful, the judge suggested the public might feel the cash ‘can be more usefully employed’. A key recommendation of the report is for the RSPCA to pass cases straight to the police and the CPS, rather than bringing their own prosecutions. But, two days after the review was published, the charity launched a prosecution against the Cattistock hunt in Dorset. On October 3, a summons was served to Will Bryer, joint master and huntsman, to appear in court later this month. In court: The Cattistock hunt in Dorset . Wooler’s report found that typical RSPCA payments were £90 to £190 an hour for a solicitor to bring a case in the magistrates court, where a day is up to five-and-a-half hours, at a total of £495 to £1,045. This excludes hours spent in preparation. By contrast, a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer is paid from £200 to £250 a day, and this includes preparation time. Fees were even more generous for barristers hired by the RSPCA, with typical payments of £800 to £1,200 a day. A shocked Mr Wooler said the cases in question would not qualify for the CPS rate for a category B offence – a category that includes child cruelty. In such cases CPS lawyers would be paid £1,000 for preparation and one day in court, plus £480 a day for the rest of the trial. Fees paid by the RSPCA to lawyers accounted for more than £8 million of the charity’s legal costs in 2012 and 2013. Mr Wooler declined to make further comment but told The Mail on Sunday he stood by his report. Sir Edward Garnier QC, Conservative MP and former solicitor-general, said: ‘I would like to see the RSPCA reporting offences to the police rather than deciding to investigate and prosecute themselves. When you see the potential for vast differentials in legal charges, that sense of unfairness is apparent. Where is the equality of arms?’ Jonathan Rich, a barrister who has defended hundreds of people prosecuted by the charity, said: ‘The RSPCA’s largesse provides strong financial incentives to advise prosecution in cases which the CPS would never touch. I’ve had cases where RSPCA prosecutors have been on more than ten times my fees.’ Tim Bonner, Countryside Alliance director of campaigns, said: ‘Charities have a duty a duty to spend donations prudently, but the RSPCA’s prosecution operation is profligate. It would be far better if the RSPCA left prosecution to the CPS, like every other charity.’ The Charity Commission will meet RSPCA chiefs to discuss the findings and an RSPCA spokesman last night confirmed that its legal fees are to be scrutinised. The report coincides with a turbulent period for the RSPCA which has lost £7 million in donations from supporters incensed by its contentious campaigns. Mr Wooler’s six-month review is estimated to have cost up to £50,000.","The RSPCA spent £22.5 million on legal bills over two years .

"A young boy who stars in the film Nativity 3 defied the odds to become an actor and dancer after doctors warned he may never walk or talk again after brain surgery. Ben underwent a nine-hour operation because the plates in his skull had not fused correctly after birth. The youngster, from Cannock, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with craniosynostosis when he was two years old. Ben Wilby, 12, worked alongside stars such as Martin Clunes in the new film Nativity 3. He is pictured at the premiere last Sunday . Ben, who plays Bob in the Nativity films, has starred alongside Doctor Who actor David Tennant and Catherine Tate as part of the trilogy. Here, he is pictured at the premier in London's Leicester Square . Ben beat 500 other young hopefuls to win the role of Bob in the hit film, Nativity, and has now starred in all three films . Doctors warned his parents he may not survive the procedure to relieve pressure on his brain. But a decade later and Ben, now 12 years old, has starred in all three Nativity films, alongside co-stars Martin Clunes, Catherine Tate and Ralf Little. Last weekend he joined them at the premiere of Nativity 3, in London's Leicester Square. Ben, who plays 'Bob' in the films, underwent the complex operation at Birmingham Children's Hospital when he was two years old. Craniotosis, which occurs in one in 2,000 children, is a condition where one or more of the plates in an infant's skull fuses too soon after birth. It can cause pressure in the brain, which can lead to blindness, sleeping and eating problems, as well as problems with mental development. His terrified family were told he may not survive, but Ben, who attends the prestigious Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, recovered. He has since gone on to launch an acting career and win dance titles including European freestyle champion. He beat 500 other hopefuls to the role of Bob in the first Nativity film - turning up for the auditions wearing fake tan, fluorescent green hot pants, matching leg warmers and a T-shirt emblazoned with the words Born To Dance. Ben's mother, Jill Wilby, said: 'He just loves these premieres. 'He loves having his picture taken and mixing with stars on the red carpet. Ben underwent a nine-hour operation when he was two-years-old because the plates in his skull had not fused correctly after birth. His parents were warned that he may never be able to walk or talk. Here, he is pictured  after the procedure at Birmingham Children's Hospital . Nativity 3, Dude Where’s MY Donkey, is out in cinemas on November 14. Ben (pictured in a green hood) stars alongside Martin Clunes and Mark Wooton . Ben turned up to the auditions for Nativity wearing an audacious outfit comprising neon green shorts, legwarmers and a t-shirt with the slogan Born To Dance on it . 'The film has lots of laughs, as usual, but it is a real tear jerker. I advise people to take their handkerchiefs when they see it.' Celebrities who attended the premiere included EastEnders actor and Strictly Come Dancing hopeful Jake Wood and X Factor reject Jake Quickenden. Ms Wilby added: 'It has been an incredible ten years since Ben's operation. 'Doctors warned us that if Ben survived the operation he might never walk or even talk. 'Since then he has become a European dancing champion and has starred in three major films. He is my miracle boy. Dancing and acting is all he has ever wanted to do. 'We have never really pushed him - he was the one doing the pushing. 'He lives to perform and put a smile on people's faces.'

"A toddler has died after falling into his grandparents' pond while he played in their garden. A neighbour who witnessed the emergency services' frantic efforts to save the three-year-old, named as Callum Greenwood, said he knew instantly that 'something terrible had happened'. Callum was found 10 minutes after he was reported missing at a relative's address in Elswick Road, Newcastle, around 6.45pm yesterday. Tragedy: A police officer at a house in Newcastle where a three-year-old boy died as he played in a pond . Two Police Community Support Officers were standing outside a large, detached property, which was believed to be the home of the grieving mother's parents. The £300,000 stone property, which stands next to St John's Cemetery, is protected from the road by tall trees and a high stone wall. Next-door neighbour Paul Taylor, 37, a plasterer, said: 'I'd been out to get an Indian and when I came back there was a massive police search on. 'They had closed off the road and the ambulance was there. 'I saw somebody in a blanket being carried into the ambulance. 'I thought obviously something terrible had happened but I didn't know what.' He added: 'It's hard to believe this has happened to someone of that age.' Probe: Northumbria police have launched an investigation into how the boy died . His partner, Emma Taylor, 38, said: 'We could see people crying and screaming. A woman was hysterical. 'When we saw someone being bundled into the ambulance, we still didn't know. 'The people next door are very private. We have since heard the boy was their daughter's child, who had come for a visit.' A man at the property, which is set back from the road, declined to comment. Callum was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, but doctors were unable to save him. Superintendent Mick Paterson, of Northumbria Police, said last night: 'This is an incredibly tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. 'They are understandably absolutely devastated and officers with specialist training are providing them with support.' He said officers were carrying out an inquiry and will prepare a report for the coroner.","Toddler Callum Greenwood went missing in Newcastle on Thursday evening .

"WNBA star Brittney Griner felt fortunate to be 'OK' after getting cut on the elbow in a knife attack in China. Griner, 24, sustained a small cut when she was attacked by a man while boarding a bus after practice Monday in Shenyang. The man, who followed the players onto the bus, also stabbed one of Griner's teammates. She was wearing two jackets and wasn't injured because the knife didn't go through. Lucky: WNBA star Brittney Griner was cut on the elbow by a man in a knife attack in China but didn't need to go to the hospital . 'I was thinking I was going to end up stabbed in China and if he got to us at the back of the bus, I was going to have to fight this man with a knife,' Griner said in an email to The Associated Press. The man was yelling as he chased the players onto the bus. She said he left the scene, and then returned covered in blood and was apprehended by Chinese authorities. 'The guy was clearly either mentally ill or very drunk,' Griner said. 'He was yelling about us hitting his wife and it was pretty clear he had no idea who we were.' Griner uploaded a short video to Instagram on Tuesday showing what appears to be police arriving at the scene of the incident. She captioned the piece of footage: 'Life can be took at any moment! Cherish every moment! AGAIN IM OK! Thank you to everyone that has been checking on me!' The attack took place in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang in Leaoning province, said a report on the website of local newspaper Liaoshen Evening, which had few other details of the incident other than that the attacker was drunk. Despite the ordeal, Griner said she still feels safe in China. Random attack: An agent said the man also stabbed one of Griner's teammates, but that she was wearing two jackets and the knife didn't go through . 'The game the next day had more security than I had ever seen,' she said. 'There were three to four cops at every entrance. They were everywhere and the team said they were going to make sure and add more security now too.' Griner had 19 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks in Tuesday night's win over Liaoning Hengye. The 6ft 8in Griner plays in the WNBA with the Phoenix Mercury and helped the team win a championship this past September. She led the league with a record 129 blocks and was the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year. She also led the U.S. to a gold medal last month at the FIBA world championship. 'We are thankful Brittney and her teammates are all okay after this incident,' the Mercury tweeted from their team account. This is Griner's second season in China and first with the Beijing Great Wall. She led Baylor to a 40-0 season and the 2012 NCAA title.

"A bus carrying paintball players struck and killed a Washington state man inside a zombie attraction at a corn maze in northern Idaho, authorities said Saturday. Jeremy T. McSpadden Jr., 18, of Spokane Valley, Washington, was a role player in the ""Zombie Slayer Paintball Bus"" attraction at the Incredible Corn Maze in Hauser on Friday night, the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office said. Dressed as a zombie, he emerged from his hiding place and ran toward the modified school bus, but he tripped and fell in front of the rear passenger-side tires, witnesses reported. Jeremy T. McSpadden Jr., 18, of Spokane Valley, Washington, was a role player in the ""Zombie Slayer Paintball Bus"" attraction at the Incredible Corn Maze in Hauser on Friday night . Dressed as a zombie, he emerged from his hiding place and ran toward the modified school bus, but he tripped and fell in front of the rear passenger-side tires, witnesses reported . He was run over and apparently killed instantly. Because of the uneven terrain of the corn maze, the bus frequently rocks, and the occupants did not immediately notice what had happened, investigators said. 'It was not until the bus had traveled away from the victim's location and the role players began to reset for the next bus to come along that anyone realized something was wrong,' the sheriff's office said in a news release. The attraction is new this season, according to the corn maze's website. For $15, customers ride the bus, which has paintball guns mounted outside the windows, and shoot at the zombies as the vehicle drives through the corn maze. The bus was going forward, and neither speed nor alcohol was a factor, Sgt. Ward Crawford said. McSpadden was run over and apparently killed instantly. Because of the uneven terrain of the corn maze, the bus frequently rocks, and the occupants did not immediately notice what had happened, investigators said . 'The focus of the attraction is the bus creeps forward so the customers have plenty of opportunity to blast away at the zombies,' Crawford said. 'This looks like it was just a horrific confluence of events.' A recording on the corn maze's information line Saturday morning said, 'We are sad to announce that all of the attractions, including the free drive-in movie, will be canceled for the remainder of the weekend.'

So when the ruins of an ancient church were discovered in thick woodland by Bob Davey, he could have been forgiven for thinking its fate had already been sealed. Instead, the determined church warden used his retirement to embark on a 22-year crusade to return the dilapidated building to its former glory – despite receiving a death threat from the cult. Determined: Bob Davey has spent 22 years restoring the church in Houghton-on-the-Hill, Norfolk to its past glory . But even he was surprised when his noble DIY effort threw up an unexpected gift, unearthing ancient paintings inside its ivy-covered walls. The images depict the Holy Trinity and the Last Judgment and are thought to have been created in 1090, soon after the Norman Conquest. Believed to be the oldest wall paintings in Britain, they have seen the tiny church become an international tourist attraction. They have even earned Mr Davey, 85, an MBE after Prince Charles made several visits to the church. Mr Davey heard about the tower in 1992 when his late wife Gloria came across it on a ramble near Houghton-on-the-Hill, Norfolk, with her WI group. Transformation: The church was engulfed in ivy in 1992 and looks like a different building today . Thought to have been last used in the 1930s, it had no roof, door or windows. Mr Davey and his wife had to push through piles of rubbish outside to get in. They were horrified to find that a satanic temple and pagan altar had been made in the church, which was built around 1000 AD. Mr Davey managed to gain protected status for the church, then sold his antiques business so he could work on its restoration. Significant: The ancient wall painting shows good souls leaving their graves on a journey to heaven . New chapter: A photo of the purification service in 1992 - following the church's occupation by satanic cults . He said: ‘I feel I have a relationship with the building. I have got a funny feeling that I was always meant to save it.’ Recounting his first encounter with the property and the pagan imagery within, Mr Davey said: ‘This annoyed me intensely. I’ve been a Christian all my life and wasn’t putting up with this on my patch.’ Because the site was still consecrated he was able to start services straight away, the first being a purification event following the pagan rituals. Dilapidated: The church's interior walls are cracked and worn by the years in these pictures from 1992 . Early days: Two years into the project, in 1994, the church's roof has been cleared of ivy . He initially had to guard the property at night to deter the cult members, who once drove a car at him and sent him a death threat. He even enlisted the Territorial Army to guard it for a time after the pagans smeared the walls with blood. In spite of some local opposition, he built a road to the church under an old law stating that any consecrated site should have an access route. Progress: This photo from 1996 shows the roof of the Norfolk church being rebuilt . The church today, with a cross in the yard to ward off devil worshippers (left) and an upside-down cross carved by satanic cult members on the inside church wall (right) He has also faced opposition from church authorities, who initially wanted the building to be torn down. It was during his attempts to fix a wall that had been cracked by a German bomb that Mr Davey noticed the unique paintings. He soon realised the walls were covered in dazzling religious murals that had been covered in whitewash plaster. A large section of the artwork is yet to be uncovered as Mr Davey battles to raise the funds for the specialist teams needed to remove the plaster. He added: ‘It’s cost me a lot of money, it’s cost me no end of time, but look what I’ve got out of it. You’ve got to do something when you retire – you can’t sit around watching the telly all day.’ Bob and his late wife Gloria in 2005 - it was Gloria who first told her husband about the abandoned church .

"Tens of thousands of families will have their benefits slashed by up to £60 a week under a new welfare cap, David Cameron will propose today. Households would be unable to claim more than £23,000 a year in handouts for housing and living costs if the Conservatives win the next election. And jobless youngsters would be stripped of benefits altogether under radical plans to save £300million. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is to announce plans for a £23,000 cap on housing and living benefits among families . The welfare cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 families, but plough massive investment into creating apprenticeships for school leavers. The Prime Minister will today issue a ‘call to arms’ to firms to train three million youngsters in an ambitious drive to achieve ‘full youth employment’ within the next Parliament. He will argue it is vital to make ‘difficult decisions’ over welfare to ensure youngsters ‘have the skills to compete with the rest of the world’. On a visit to a manufacturing plant, Mr Cameron will call for every FTSE100 company, as well as hundreds of smaller firms, to take on apprentices with an injection of £1billion in funding. A clutch of household names have already signed up to offer training, including the National Grid, Microsoft, Balfour Beatty, Nestle, Airbus, Jaguar Land Rover, Barclays and BT. Many of the apprenticeships will be at ‘advanced’ level – equivalent to ‘A’ levels, and around 15,000 of them will involve paid technical training up to degree level. Mr Cameron will say today: ‘Because of difficult decisions we will make on welfare, we will deliver three million apprenticeships by 2020. This is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain. ‘It will help give us the skills to compete with the rest of the world. And it will mean more hope, more opportunity, and more security for our young people, helping them get on in life and make something of themselves.’ Reducing the welfare cap from £26,000 to £23,000 – or around £440 a week – will save £135million per year, according to details revealed last night. It will affect 70,000 families. In addition, plans announced at the Conservative Party conference to strip housing benefit from jobless 18 to 21-year-olds will affect up to 30,000 youngsters and save around £120million. George Osbourne said cutting benefits would stop people from becoming trapped in poverty . As Work and Pensions Secretary, he often finds himself up to his neck in it. And even away from the pressures of Government, yesterday appeared to be little different for Iain Duncan Smith. The 60-year-old minister was close to going under as he plunged into a muddy pool while tackling a gruelling 10km assault course. He also hauled himself up climbing ropes and crawled under barbed wire as part of the fourth annual Swanbourne Endeavour endurance event in Buckinghamshire. Organisers promise the charity event will ‘push you to the limit and beyond’. Officials claim the rest of the £300million will be saved both from the benefits bill by getting young people into work, and by reducing reliance on classroom teaching in further education in favour of on-the-job training. The number of apprenticeships has doubled since the Coalition took office – to more than 200,000 a year – but they are vastly oversubscribed with eleven applicants for every place. Chancellor George Osborne said last month that his mission in cutting benefits was to ‘change the welfare system so it doesn’t trap people in poverty and a culture of dependency’. He said the reforms had forced thousands to look for work. Only claimants of Disability Living Allowance will be exempt from the new cap. Around 40,000 of those affected will have their benefits capped for the first time, with maximum losses of £60 a week. Youngsters between 18 and 21 will be forced to live with their families unless they have a job – unless they are leaving care, are estranged from their parents or have dependent children. And they would be given six months to find a job or training – after which their dole would be scrapped unless they take part in ‘community projects’, such as cleaning up parks. Labour supports imposing a cap on the total welfare budget, rather than per household, but says levels of housing benefit should be set per region. The latest jobs figures put unemployment below two million for the first time since 2008. A Microsoft spokesman said: ‘Apprenticeships are a crucial part of the solution to our technology skills shortage.’ A spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses said: ‘We applaud the ambition to dramatically increase the number of young people gaining apprenticeships, but the training they receive must be high quality and meet the demands of businesses.’","Tens of thousands of families to have benefits cut by up to £60 a week .

"This crafty kitty has been driving his owners round the bend with his night-time antics and has been labelled a cat burglar. Mufasa, who is 11-months-old and looks all sweet and innocent, but has been sneaking out of his owners' home in Ipswich near Brisbane, Queensland through an old style louvre window in the laundry room. Over the past few weeks he has returned home from his night-time travels with a stash of stuffed toys including a monkey, giraffe, dog and two teddy bears. Cheeky Mufasa has built up quite a haul of cuddly toys in the last three weeks in his night-time adventures . These are three of the five toys Mufasa has dragged home in the last few weeks- have you seen them before? Mufasa is quite unaware of how famous he has become and is taking each day pretty easy . Mufasa's owners the Skinner family have set up a Facebook page in a desperate attempt to try and find out who the toys belong to. Mother-of-five Sharna Skinner, 33, told Daily Mail Australia: 'Three weeks ago he brought home a stuffed monkey and it was just left under the dining table. 'I thought my husband had left it under there because my daughter likes monkeys but it turned out that it wasn't him. Just a year ago Mufasa was very cute and innocent, the family had no idea what he would become . The curious kitty has been putting his nose in lots of places and has developed a fetish for cuddly toys . 'Then a few more toys have just randomly turned up over the past few weeks. 'Mufasa was getting out through a window which we had no idea he could even fit through and we think he was coming back through our on-suite.' Mufasa belongs to Mrs Skinner's 11-year-old son Malachi who has been out door-knocking his neighbours with the family trying to find out who the toys belong to. Look at those eyes: Mufasa looked like butter wouldn't melt when he was a kitten . Mrs Skinner added: 'Our neighbours thought we were crazy when we started asking if the toys belonged to them, Malachi has been finding it quite amusing and funny. 'We think they are probably from the same place but they could be from different places, we reckon they are from gardens or balconies. 'It’s a bit of an embarrassing thing to get famous for, our cat stealing toys was not what we expected.' Mrs Skinner set up Facebook group called 'Help - my cat is a kleptomaniac' and wants people to spread the word so the can get the toys returned. 'One of the toys was so big he had to drag it home, we just want to find out who owns the toys and give them back'.","Mysterious Mufasa has been sneaking out from his family home in Brisbane, Queensland .

"Friends have paid tribute to John Robins, after he tragically died in a surfing accident off the coast of Western Australia on Wednesday. Mr Robins, a builder and active surf lifesaving club member from Avoca in NSW's Central Coast, was at Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River when either the nose or fin of his board is said to have damaged the main artery in one of his legs causing massive blood loss. The 51-year-old has been described as a 'top bloke' who died 'doing something he loved', Perth Now reports. Friends have paid tribute to John Robins, after he tragically died in a surfing accident off the coast of Western Australia on Wednesday . Brett Beswick, a fellow Avoca Beach Surf Club member said Mr Robins death is a tragedy. 'He volunteered a lot of time for Surf Life Saving. He was a really keen surfer, loved big waves, which is probably why he was at Margaret. 'We used to surf together a lot, pushed each other on to more gnarly waves,' Mr Beswick said. Last year the father-of-two celebrated his 50th in Hawaii, where he fulfilled his dream by surfing 15-foot waves at Pipeline. 'If he was going to go out anyway he went out doing something he loved. I’m glad it wasn’t a shark attack. 'When I first heard about it I thought it was a shark but to hear he bled out while help was waiting to arrive is tragic.' The father-of-two has been described as a 'top bloke' who died 'doing something he loved' At the time of the incident, Mr Beswick said he just about to call  Mr Robins when he heard the news. 'When it’s one of your own it’s a kick in the guts. A lot of people are just walking around in shock, they couldn’t believe it.' Now, the community of Avoca are mourning the loss of their beloved builder who was 'always one of the guys you could count on'. In 2012, Mr Robins assisted in the rescue of a woman who was swept off rocks at Avoca Beach. Following Wednesday's tragic accident, Surfers Point was completely empty, a part from a surfer who placed a wreath in the ocean to honour Mr Robins. Mr Robins was on holidays in WA with his father, wife, and children. The passionate surfer was dragged ashore by fellow surfers The Daily Telegraph reported, and others on the beach performed CPR on the man for nearly half an hour. John Robins, a 51-year-old man,  has died at popular break Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River in WA . One witness said Mr Robins elderly father was watching on from the carpark when the grisly scene unfolded. 'You just wouldn't believe it because the swell was 2m, the winds were only light, and Surfers Point is always powerful but it wasn't as powerful as it gets,' Surfer Darrly Naidu, 27, told The Daily Telegraph, speaking of the horrible circumstances in which the man died. He also told of how two men brought the 51-year-old to shore after they saw him wipe-out, and found him with blood pooling around him in the water. John Robins - from NSW but holidaying in WA - was transported to hospital but died shortly after . Another witness who spoke to the website said the man was losing a lot of blood from what could have been his femoral artery - which is the main supply of blood to the lower half of the body. St Johns Ambulance paramedics arrived at the scene just after 11am, after reports the man had been injured. Mr Robins was rushed to Margaret River Hospital by emergency services according to theABC, but died a short time later. West Australian Police media told Daily Mail Australia a report is being prepared for the coroner.","John Robins died at Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River in WA .

"Tony Blair has told political allies that he believes the Conservatives will win the next election because Ed Miliband has failed to connect with voters, it was reported last night. The former prime minister has apparently said that the Labour leader ‘cannot beat’ David Cameron in 2015. Mr Blair is reported to believe the Conservatives will remain in power next year because Labour has not persuaded Britain it is ready to govern. Tony Blair has told political allies that he believes the Conservatives will win the next election because Ed Miliband has failed to connect with voters, it was reported last night . But last night Mr Blair’s office said the story was ‘absurd’ – and that he believes Labour can win. Mr Blair’s reported verdict on Mr Miliband follows criticism of the Labour leader’s performance from some senior figures in his party. The Daily Telegraph said Mr Blair’s apparent prediction was made in a private conversation with long-standing political allies earlier this month. One person who was present told the newspaper: ‘The Conservatives will be the next government because Labour has failed to make a good case for itself. That is what Tony thinks. He does not think that Miliband can beat Cameron.’ Recent polls have shown Labour’s lead over the Tories narrow to just one percentage point, on average. Some of Mr Blair’s allies fear Mr Miliband is not doing enough to appeal to the centre-ground voters who gave the party three general election victories between 1997 and 2005. Lord Prescott, Mr Blair’s former deputy, has said that Mr Miliband is pursuing a ‘core vote strategy’ of appealing only to traditional Labour supporters and disaffected Liberal Democrats. Other Labour figures are concerned that Mr Miliband has failed to develop a clear strategy for responding to Ukip and its voters’ concerns over immigration and Europe. Last month former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson suggested Mr Miliband should have joined the Army so he seemed less of a ‘geek’. The former prime minister has apparently said that the Labour leader ‘cannot beat’ David Cameron in 2015 . Mr Johnson was defending Mr Miliband after a poll suggested the public did not see him as a strong leader. And earlier this month former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay said Mr Miliband must resign if Labour is to win the election. Mr Miliband has himself confessed to problems with presentation – including in a speech when he admitted he looked less like a prime minister than David Cameron. Last night Mr Blair’s office said: ‘We will not be commenting on unattributed statements except to say that this is not his view. He wants and hopes to see a Labour victory and believes Labour can indeed win under Ed’s leadership.’ A tweet was sent from Mr Blair’s official account @tonyblairoffice saying: ‘TB says: The Telegraph story does not represent my view. Ed Miliband and the Labour Party can and will win the next election.’ A Labour Party source said Mr Miliband would continue with his current strategy. ‘This election will be won by the party which can get the country working again,’ the source said. ‘Labour is the only party which can do this with a plan to save the NHS, change the economy, freeze energy prices and reform the banks.’","Former PM has apparently said  Labour leader ‘cannot beat’ Cameron .

"The key to keeping costs down in the NHS is to prevent people from having to go to hospital in the first place, according to a major report. The amount of money needed to run the health service is soaring due to the demands of an ageing and more obese population who are succumbing to illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. But NHS chief Simon Stevens said part of the solution would be to prevent patients becoming ill in the first place – namely by tackling obesity. NHS chief Simon Stevens wants firms to reward staff with iPads, cash prizes or vouchers for losing weight. File picture . He wants firms to reward staff with iPads, cash prizes or vouchers for losing weight. He is also urging them to hold Weight Watchers sessions and lunchtime running clubs for staff as part of a drive to tackle obesity. In return, they should receive Government tax breaks, he said. The plans are contained in a report on reducing the number of people admitted to hospital in a bid to slash NHS costs. Other measures include: . Mr Stevens warns in his report that unless the NHS receives more money from the Government – or makes drastic savings – it will have an annual deficit of £30billion by 2020. In particular, he wants companies to run schemes whereby staff are rewarded with iPads, shopping vouchers or cash prizes if staff meet certain goals on weight loss. He is also urging them to hold Weight Watchers classes and running clubs and to encourage staff to walk and cycle to work. Firms would receive tax breaks from the Government and would also receive some funding to set up slimming or exercise classes. One way to reduce the strain on the NHS would be to prevent patients becoming ill in the first place – namely by tackling obesity . Mr Stevens himself managed to lose nearly three stone thanks to a weight-loss incentive scheme at his previous job, the US insurance firm United Healthcare. The report also includes plans to recruit an army of volunteers to help feed elderly dementia patients in hospital or care for them at home. These members of the public would then get 10 per cent off their annual council tax bill – as much as £200 depending on where they live. It does not yet specify how much voluntary work would need to be done to be entitled to this benefit or the exact tasks entailed. Mr Stevens wants to avoid patients having to go to hospital wherever possible by improving health services closer to home. He said: ‘There are big changes to the way in which care is going to be provided and that is going to take national and local efforts. The NHS is now at a crossroads - as a country we need to decide which way to go. ‘It is perfectly possible to improve and sustain the NHS over the next five years in a way that the public and the patients want.’ Referring to obesity, he added: ‘We’re going to absolutely have to up our game across the board in terms of prevention and public health. ‘The large increase in obesity is associated in large rise in diabetes and we are now spending £10billion a year treating diabetes.’","NHS chief wants firms to offer staff vouchers and prizes if they lose weight .

"A future Tory government ‘will deliver’ English votes for English laws, Mr Cameron declared yesterday as he made a ‘vow’ on home rule.

Cabinet minister William Hague will chair a committee to draw up proposals for English home rule. Tory backbenchers want Scottish MPs to be excluded from votes on English-only issues. But Labour has refused to support the move – which could undermine its efforts to secure a majority in the House of Commons.

"Bernard Madoff's last surviving son was under investigation for possible involvement in his father's multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme until the day he died from cancer earlier this month, it has been revealed. The court-appointed trustee seeking to recover money for bilked investors began taking aim at Andrew Madoff's $16 million estate which he left his fiancee, ex-wife and daughters, even before his death. They filed an updated lawsuit this summer accusing him and his brother of having full knowledge of their father's scheme and using it as their 'personal cookie jar' that they tapped through sham loans, fictitious trades and deferred compensation. Andrew, who died Sept 3 aged 48 from mantle cell lymphoma, had long maintained that he and his brother, Mark, who hanged himself in 2010 at age 46, worked on the legitimate trading side of their father's firm and knew nothing of the massive fraud. Scroll down for video . An updated lawsuit was filed before Andrew Madoff died from cancer earlier this month, accusing him of knowing about his father's massive fraud. He passed away on September 3 after a battle with lymphoma . They noted that they were the ones who went to the authorities after their father confessed the Ponzi scheme to them in 2008. Two federal law enforcement officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case, said investigators never believed the brothers were unaware of the fraud and both were the focus of active investigations until the time of their deaths. The officials acknowledged, however, that being able to substantiate their suspicions proved difficult, and as investigators unraveled the case's complex web of financial chicanery they had increasingly turned their attention to a case they felt they could prove: tax evasion. Both officials told the AP it was likely Andrew Madoff would have faced tax evasion charges if he had not died. The ultimate goal, they said, was using federal charges as leverage to get him to return money to investors. Attorney Martin Flumenbaum, the executor of Andrew Madoff's will, has maintained that the brothers never 'knew of, or knowingly participated, in their father's criminal conduct.' Flumenbaum did not respond to a request for comment Friday on the possibility of tax charges against Andrew Madoff. During a 2011 '60 Minutes' interview, Andrew Madoff said that from the beginning he had 'absolutely nothing to hide and I've been eager, almost desperate, to speak out publicly and tell people I am not involved.' Bernard Madoff, now 76, is serving a 150-year prison sentence in a North Carolina prison after admitting he fleeced thousands of investors in a scheme that went on for decades. It was revealed that the late Andrew Madoff left his fiancee Catherine Hooper a trust of $50,000 per month in the Bernie Madoff's son's will . Mr Madoff, pictured with Catherine Hooper on NBC News Today Show, always claimed he and his late brother Mark had no knowledge of the ponzi scheme . Five former high-level Madoff firm employees were convicted earlier this year of helping carry out the fraud by conspiring to defraud clients and falsifying records. It is unclear whether anyone else will be charged, though prosecutors describe the investigation as ongoing and have obtained in the last week delays in the sentencing of several cooperators. Days after Andrew Madoff's death, his will was made public, detailing an estate worth $16 million. He left his wife Deborah West - who filed for divorce after the fraud was made public - about $5 million, divided his tangible personal property equally among his two college-age daughters and provided his fiancee, Catherine Hooper, with $50,000 a month until the money he left is gone. Irving Picard, the trustee who has so far recovered more than half of the $20 billion invested in the Ponzi scheme, is seeking to recover money from the estates of both brothers and has the power to pursue money and assets wherever they are disbursed. He charged in his recent lawsuit that the Madoff sons knew about the fraud and tried to cover it up by deleting emails during a Securities and Exchange Commission probe. Picard contends they owe investors $153 million, along with compensatory and punitive damages. His estranged wife Deborah West (right) was left one-third of the millionaire financier's estate. Their children, including daughter Emily Madoff (left) will receive trusts and all of Madoff's personal property . The trustee said the funds he seeks include millions of dollars of customer money that was illegally transferred into accounts held in the names of the Madoff brothers, their spouses and children. In a July release, David J. Sheeham, Picard's chief counsel, noted that the brothers received salaries and bonuses exceeding $20 million in 2007, even as the side of the business they oversaw produced losses of more than $58 million. Sheeham said that the Madoff family continues 'to live a lifestyle that others only dream about, holding on to a broad array of property paid for with ill-gotten gains, all of this while many victims of the Ponzi scheme still struggle. It is time for them to do the right thing and give back the stolen funds.' At the time of the lawsuit, Andrew Madoff attorney Flumenbaum called the new allegations 'unfounded and false.' 'As we stated from the outset, neither Andrew nor Mark knew of, or knowingly participated, in their father's criminal conduct,' Flumenbaum said. 'It was Andrew and Mark who informed the authorities of their father's fraud and put an end to it.'","Andrew Madoff's $16million estate was under scrutiny by a court trustee .

"Just call him Bubba, the one-eyed miracle dog. The 8-year-old Chihuahua mix has been credited with giving his dying owner the will to live after the two were reunited at a Kentucky hospital. Bubba's owner, James Wathen, 73, from Whitley County, Kentucky, has been at Baptist Health Corbin since mid-September. Scroll down for video . Just what the doctor ordered: James Wathen, 73, wasn't eating and couldn't speak above a whisper before his reunion with his beloved dog, Bubba, last weekend . Health crisis: Wathen, 73, from Whitley County, Kentucky, has been at Baptist Health Corbin since mid-September, and his 8-year-old pooch, pictured here during their second meeting, has been staying in a shelter . Healing power of love: After Bubba's second visit, the dying patient sat up in bed and starting eating again . Course of treatment: Wathen is expected to meet with Bubba on a regular basis as he continues his recovery . In recent weeks, his health has taken a turn for the worse as Wathen stopped eating and speaking above a whisper. One of the social workers at the hospital recently visited the patient and learned from him that Wathen was pining for his beloved rescue Chihuahua, Bubba. What neither Wathen nor the hospital staff knew at the time was that Bubba also quit eating. ‘We pulled out all the stops and found the dog,’ Kimberly Probus, chief nursing officer at Baptist Health Corbin, told WKYT. After making some phone calls, nurses at Baptist Health found out that Bubba, who lost his right eye in a fight years earlier and who is missing his lower teeth, was taken to the Knox-Whitley Animal Shelter after his owner was hospitalized nearly six weeks later. Employees at the rescue center reached out to a foster family that has been caring for Bubba and scheduled to bring the pup to Baptist Health in violation of the hospital’s visitation policy, which did not allow pets. Bruiser: The 8-year-old Chihuahua mix lost his right eye in a fight, and his tongue is hanging out of his mouth because his bottom teeth are missing . Last Saturday, little Bubba was carried to James Wathen's hospital bed, and those who witnessed their reunion said there was not a dry eye in the room. ‘He was so sad at first. We had him wrapped in a baby blanket and he was shivering,’ shelter president Mary Ann Smyth told Today.com. ‘The minute we got about 20 steps from this guy’s room... his little head went up,’ ‘His eyes got real bright and he was like a different dog.’ The experience has left both the ailing dog owner and his four-legged pal completely transformed. As soon as he set his one good eye on Mr Wathen, a previously listless and distraught Bubba came to life, and his owner began to cry tears of joy. In what nurses at Baptist Health described as a 'complete turnaround,' following Bubba's second visit Tuesday James Wathen sat up in bed for the first time in a long while, and started speaking and eating again. A video recorded by Ms Smyth during that repeat visit shows Wathen lovingly petting Bubba, and the pup snuggling up to him and licking his gaunt face. While Mr Wathen is not out of the woods yet in terms of his medical condition, hospital staff say he is no longer at death’s door. Special bond: Bubba, who has been staying at an animal shelter and then with a foster family, stopped eating around the same time his owner did at the hospital . ’He doesn’t even look like the same man,’ nurse Kimberly Probus said. ‘I didn’t expect the improvement to be this good. Wathen is expected to meet with Bubba on a regular basis as he continues his recovery, and the hospital is now planning to put in place a new pet visitation policy so that other patients could spend time with their four-legged friends. ‘It makes you realize that animals are not just pets,’ staff at the Knox-Whitley shelter wrote on their Facebook page, ‘they are loved ones.’","James Wathen, 73, wasn't eating and couldn't speak above a whisper before his reunion with Bubba .

"The house where 12-year-old Tia Sharp was sexually assaulted and murdered in August 2012 before her body was hidden in the loft has been demolished and two new houses are being built on the site . Work is under way on the new houses, bringing a new start to the community that was traumatised by the murder of the schoolgirl. The two-bedroom terraced house - 20 The Lindens in New Addington, Surrey - was bulldozed in June last year, along with the two neighbouring properties (numbers 19 and 21). Scroll down for video . Work is under way on two new houses, bringing a new start to the community that was traumatised by the murder of Tia Sharp  by her grandmother's boyfriend . The site of the three houses demolished by Croydon Council last year and soon to be the site of two more . Tia was murdered by pervert Stuart Hazell who lived with Christine Sharp, 48, Tia's grandmother . The decision to bulldoze delighted Tia's family and neighbours who were upset by the sight of the house. It was where killer Stuart Hazell, 39, murdered the schoolgirl and dumped her body in the loft. Killer: Stuart Hazell is led away by police from Christine Sharp's home in New Addington, Surrey . The house where Tia died: The two-bedroom terraced house in New Addington, Surrey, was demolished in June last year . Search: Police sniffer dogs leave Tia's grandmother Christine Sharp's house in New Addington, Surrey without finding Tia's body which was in the loft . He was living there with his girlfriend Christine Sharp, 48, Tia's grandmother. Hazell was one of the 'heartbroken' family members who 'searched' for Tia during a national manhunt in August 2012 after she disappeared. As the distraught and desperate family members comforted each other in the house, they were unaware that missing Tia was just feet away from them, wrapped in bin-liners in the loft. Father-of-one Hazell suffocated Tia during a sex attack after months of trawling internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept. Her body was not found for more than a week by police - even though it just feet away from where they had been searching. The property, which is owned by Croydon Council, was demolished to avoid it becoming a  tourist attraction. Hazell (front) was one of the 'heartbroken' family members who 'searched' for Tia during a national manhunt in August 2012 after she disappeared . Two adjoining houses were also demolished by the council and now building work has been going to replace the three bulldozed properties with two new ones. A Croydon Council spokesman said: ""With the support of residents and local councillors, we decided that demolishing the properties at 19, 20 and 21 The Lindens was the best thing to do given the circumstances of what happened. ""The demolition work has now been completed, and building of two new family homes in their place has begun."" So far, workmen have built the foundations and constructed the shell of the ground level of the houses. It is not known when the new properties will be finished and ready to inhabit. Hazell, who lied that Tia had spent the night at home before heading to a shopping centre in nearby Croydon, was jailed for life in May last year. He pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to guilty on the fifth day of his trial at the Old Bailey.","Houses on site of brutal murder demolished to make way for new builds .

"Apple is believed to have delayed plans to produce a 12.9inch 'iPad Pro' so it can keep up with demand for its 5.5inch iPhone 6 plus handset. The firm confirmed it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 units during the launch weekend, with recent estimates suggesting it may have sold more than 21 million units in the first two weeks - with over 4 million iPhone 6 units reserved in China. It is believed the larger model, the 6 Plus, has proved more popular than expected, causing manufacturers to scramble to produce enough screens. Scroll down for video . The iPhone 6 plus with its 5.5inch screen has proved so popular a larger 12.9inch iPad Pro has been delayed, it has been claimed . Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month. 'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. 'The top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iPhones,' a source told the Wall Street Journal. 'The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,' an unidentified person familiar with Apple's supply chain said. 'It would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen iPad now.' 'Everyone is busy with the new iPhones, Foxconn's bread and butter. Chairman [Terry Gou] has also gone to the Zhengzhou site to monitor the production closely,' a Foxconn official said. At the Zhengzhou plant alone, more than 200,000 workers are making iPhone 6 units — overall, Foxconn has well over 1 million workers. The bigger 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablet was supposed to enter production in December, it has been claimed. It comes as Apple is to unveil new iPads and new Mac computers on 16th October at its California HQ. The new gadgets could go on sale on the 24 October - with new Mac software, called Yosemite, available as a free download even earlier. Last week, rumours suggested Apple was putting the finishing touches to a new version of it's iPad Air - including a gold version. The small event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star-studded launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which saw U2 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band's new album. An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button. According to Tinhte.vn  the device comes in at just 7 millimeters thick, the same thickness as the iPhone 6. An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button. In addition to a redesigned speaker grille, the unit also sports a small hole where the mute/orientation lock switch appears on existing iPad units. The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company's new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. The iPads have a new sleek design and are thinner . New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, 'people familiar with the matter' told Bloomberg. The new iPads are also predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality. The code states that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. Apple Pay has only been announced in the US, so if the iPads do get the feature, it may be limited to only American buyers. Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models. The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion). The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini, and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen. The new iPads are expected to have a rounded design similar to the recently released iPhone 6 . The new iPads are also expected to include Touch ID sensors . Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a 'budget' version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped. The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The new line of iMacs is rumoured to have ultra high-resolution Retina Displays, a thin profile and faster processors as well as improved Wi-Fi antennas. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite.","Claims 12.9inch 'iPad Pro' was due to go into production in December .

"Theresa May yesterday vowed that hate preacher Abu Qatada will not be allowed back into Britain after he was cleared of terror offences in Jordan. The Home Secretary insisted the UK will remain closed to the Al Qaeda-linked extremist, who was deported after a decade-long battle costing up to £1million. Her pledge came minutes after judges in Jordan acquitted the cleric of involvement in plotting atrocities in his home country on the grounds of ‘insufficient evidence’. Scroll down for video . Abu Qatada kisses the hands and legs of his father upon his release . Abu Qatada reacts as his father kisses his head after he was released from  prison . Abu Qatada hugs his mother at her house in the Jordanian capital Amman following his acquittal . Abu Qatada hugs his family members after his release from a prison near Amman . A Jordan court has acquitted radical preacher Abu Qatada, seen here speaking to media after his release from prison, of plotting attacks on Americans and Israelis . Abu Qatada is escorted into the Jordanian State Security Court on Wednesday . Mrs May said: ‘The UK courts here were very clear that Abu Qatada poses a threat to our national security. That’s why we were pleased as a government to remove him from the UK. ‘He is subject to a deportation order, he is also subject to a UN travel ban. That means he will not be returning to the UK.’ However, Qatada is now likely to attract attention for his views on Islamic State, which he has condemned as ‘evil’. There is also speculation that he may join calls for the release of British hostage Alan Henning. Counter-extremist think-tank the Quilliam Foundation said Qatada was ‘no friend’ of the Jordanian government but could now be used against Islamic State. Writings have recently appeared online in the radical cleric’s name – apparently smuggled from his prison cell – which denounced the militants as ‘the dogs of hellfire’. Earlier this month, he condemned the beheading of two US journalists by IS, saying it contradicted Islamic teachings. Relatives of the hate preacher celebrate his acquittal at the Jordanian State Security Court in Amman . Unidentified relatives of Abu Qatada embrace in celebration outside the  court . Home Secretary Theresa May insisted there was no way for Abu Qatada to return to Britain because of the long battle she fought to have him removed. Mrs May attended a rally for Muslim women against ISIS in London. The court ruled there was insufficient evidence against Abu Qatada and his defense lawyer, Husein Mubaidin, says he expects his client to be released within hours . Long stay: Abu Qatada and his family moved to Britain in 1993 and were granted asylum the following year. While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000 . Nevertheless, Whitehall officials have warned that Qatada could still provide religious or spiritual justification for acts of terrorism. Security officials will closely monitor any public pronouncements and will be anxious to see if Jordan imposes the sort of restraints he received in the UK, such as internet or mobile phone curbs. Experts also predicted that now freed, the fanatic could attempt to radicalise British Muslims from overseas. The cleric’s family cheered as the verdict was delivered in Jordan’s capital Amman yesterday. Dressed in brown overalls, Qatada kissed his lawyer through the bars of his caged dock and was later freed from custody and reunited with his wife and children, who left behind taxpayer-funded lives in Britain to join him last year. At the trial, he was accused of providing spiritual support through his writings to men alleged to have planned atrocities aimed at Western and Israeli targets during Jordan’s Millennium Eve celebrations. Prosecutors said books by the cleric were found in the raids and accused him of supplying funds to the plotters. A court had previously found Qatada guilty of the terror offences in his absence. He was granted a retrial on the grounds that evidence obtained by torture would not be used. The 53-year-old preacher was also acquitted in June in another case, a foiled 1998 plot to attack an American school in Amman. Once linked to Osama Bin Laden, Qatada was first arrested in Britain in 2001 but lodged appeal after appeal against extradition while enjoying £450,000 in benefits. He finally agreed to go voluntarily after Mrs May secured a string of promises from the Jordanian authorities that he would be fairly treated. However, former Home Secretary David Blunkett said the length of time it took to deport him made it more difficult to secure a conviction. He told the BBC: ‘Abu Qatada’s managed to do what he wanted to do, which was to prevaricate for ten years. However, it also proves that he was wrong, because the case he made against extradition was that he wouldn’t receive a fair trial in Jordan and he clearly has.’ Abu Qatada was born in the West Bank city of Bethlehem in 1960, which was under the control of Jordan at the time. At the age of 29 he moved to Peshawar in Pakistan to teach about Sharia law, before moving to Kuwait. In 1991 - after the Gulf War - he was kicked out the country along with other Palestinians and returned to Jordan. Two years later Qatada and his family applied for asylum in the UK, claiming he had been tortured in Jordan. This application was granted in June 1994. In the late 1990s Qatada came to MI5's attention as his sermons became more extreme and his influence increased. From his home in North London, he was later described as the 'in-house' adviser to radical groups around the world. In 1999 and 2000 Qatada was convicted in his absence and given a life sentence in Jordan for the two alleged terror plots for which he has been standing trial. Qatada was arrested in the UK for the first time following the September 11 attacks, but was not charged with any crime. He was repeatedly linked with extremist groups over the subsequent decade. Mr Justice Collins, then chairman of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said he was 'heavily involved, indeed was at the centre' of al-Qaeda's UK activities, calling him 'a truly dangerous individual.' While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000. The campaign to extradite Qatada to face the terror conspiracy Jordan began in 2007, but was continually delayed by claims he would be tortured on his return. After initially barring the UK deporting Qatada, the European Court of Human Rights finally denied him leave to appeal in 2012 after receiving assurances from Jordan that he would not be tortured. Qatada finally left the UK to face trial the following July.","Jordanian court  ruled there was insufficient evidence against Abu Qatada .

"A manhunt has been launched to find a 'very pregnant', caped woman suspected of committing four armed robberies across Atlanta.

"A man on board a Ryanair flight was arrested after he allegedly claimed he had bombs, threw lit cigarettes around the cabin and assaulted a fellow passenger. The drama was only halted when a group of men tackled the passenger from hell and restrained him until the plane landed at East Midlands Airport on Wednesday. The flight was returning from Malaga. Once grounded the man was met by Leicestershire Police and charged with common assault, being drunk while on an aircraft and smoking on an aircraft, and is due to appear in court in November. Hazel Hickson, Sue Snodin, Paula Ball and Nicola Ball with Kian Ball, 10 months and Harry Hickson were shaken by the actions of a man on board their Ryanair flight into East Midlands, who has since been charged . Passengers on board a Ryanair flight from Malaga to East Midlands were horrified when a man was allegedly heard saying he 'had three bombs' The man was restrained by fellow passengers until the plane landed safely at East Midlands Airport (File photo) Hazel Hickson, 53, of Groby, who was returning from a five-day trip to Malaga with friends and her 12-year-old son, Harry, said: 'Ten minutes into the flight he was making strange noises. 'I first thought he might have learning difficulties, but then a couple sat close to him asked to be moved. 'He then stood up and said he could take the plane down, and somebody else said he heard him say he had three bombs. 'At one stage a big guy came over but the man's behaviour became worse. 'He then started either verbally or physically abusing an elderly lady in front of him and, when her husband told him to stop, he punched him in the eye, breaking his glasses and making him bleed. 'At that point a group of seven or eight guys jumped on him and dragged him into the aisle. 'It turned into a brawl - one was punching him and another said 'we're taking control'. The man was arrested on landing and is due to appear in court in November . 'An air stewardess burst into tears. The men took him to the back of the aircraft and sat on him for 20 minutes until we landed, and it was the first time in the flight I felt safe. 'If the men hadn't taken control, I think someone else would have got hurt.. It was unbelievable.' The man reportedly started to light cigarettes on board the flight, with Ms Hickson adding that the cabin crew seemed not to know what to do. After being tackled by other irate passengers, the man was pinned down at the back of the aircraft, with the staff said to be visibly upset at the incident. Passengers on board the flight that landed at East Midlands have said that Ryanair staff seemed unsure of how to deal with the situation . Sue Snodin, 56, from Leicester was travelling with her son's partner Nicola and 10-month-old grandson Kian. The budget airline is clear in its terms and conditions about how it expects passengers to behave. 'If, in our reasonable opinion, you conduct yourself aboard the aircraft so as to endanger the aircraft or any person or property on board, obstruct the crew in the performance of their duties, or fail to comply with any instructions of the crew including but not limited to those with respect to smoking, alcohol or drug consumption, behave in a manner which we reasonably believe may cause or does cause discomfort, inconvenience, damage or injury to other passengers or the crew, we may take such measures as we deem reasonably necessary to prevent continuation of such conduct, including restraint. You may be disembarked and refused onward carriage at any point, and may be prosecuted for offences committed on board the aircraft.' Sue said: 'The man started five minutes into the flight, he was shouting and obviously upset, I thought he was on drink or drugs. He lit cigarettes and threw them down the plane. 'I felt the staff were not equipped to deal with the incident and we had to endure a two-and-a-half hour flight from hell. There was a young stewardess trying to deal with him, but she was getting really upset. 'When it was all over, the pilot came out of the cockpit, wiped his brow and asked if he had been removed, but there was no apology, nothing. 'I am putting a complaint into Ryanair.' A Ryanair spokesman said: 'The crew of this flight from Malaga to East Midlands requested police assistance on arrival after a passenger became disruptive. 'The aircraft landed normally and police removed and detained this passenger. Ryanair sincerely apologise to other customers for any inconvenience suffered on this flight.

But critics claim  the flamboyant ruler - who already has 15 wives - is simply trying to ensure any future brides are disease-free. Swazi virgins are seen here during a Reed Dance ceremony during which the King, Mswati III, chooses a future bride. Young girls are being offered £11 a month to abstain from sex . Details have to be established about how the girls will be monitored to ensure they are not having sex. Swazi virgins usually only hit the headlines when tens of thousands of them dance topless before the king at the annual Reed Dance. Each year the 46-year old, sub-Saharan Africa's last absolute monarch, chooses a virgin as his new wife from the ceremony. Last month, he selected a 19-year-old to be his 15th wife. The programme, reportedly financed by the World Bank, will offer girls a substantial income in a country where two-thirds of the population earn less than 60p a day. Swaziland's playboy King, Mswati III (above) - who already has 15 wives has reportedly approved the World Bank-financed scheme to curb HIV transmission in the country . Thabsile Dlamini, a health care worker in the city of Manzini, told South African website IOL: 'The government will pay girls the allowances so they will have money to purchase necessities and can turn down money offered to them for sex.' HIV transmission rates in Swaziland currently stand at 26 per cent, one of the highest in the world. But teenagers say the money is not enough to stop them accepting gifts and money in exchange for sex. Thandi Tfwala, 17, said: 'A girl could get R200 (£11) for just one sex act. 'You don't know Swazi girls. If they don't get more money, they will keep on doing what they do now. 'Our king will have to go to Cape Town for his brides.'","Playboy king said to have approved benefits scheme in bid to curb HIV .

"A construction worker lost his thumb Monday after being bitten by a tiger at an animal sanctuary in a Miami suburb owned by a convicted felon and suspected drug kingpin. According to Florida Fish and Wildlife, the incident took place just before 2pm Monday when the victim allegedly stuck his hand into a cage housing a tiger at the Zoological Wildlife Foundation west of Jupiter. Palm Beach County Fire and Rescue responded to the animal sanctuary off the 190000 block of Southeast Mack Dairy Road and found the construction worker with severed thumb. Mauled: A man working on a construction project at the Zoological Wildlife Foundation, an animal sanctuary near Miami, lost his thumb Monday after sticking his hand into a tiger cage . Dark past: The owner of the privately owned zoo is Mario Tabraue, a suspected drug kingpin who was sentenced in 1989 to 100 years in prison after being convicted of 61 counts of racketeering - but he served only 12 years of his sentence . The man was rushed to St Mary's Medical Center for treatment; he is expected to survive, CBS12 reported. The owner of the facility, Mario Tabraue, has an up-to-date permit to keep wild animals in captivity, the FWC stated. The big cat that mauled the worker remained secure in his cage during the incident. ‘He approached the cage and put his hand in, and the tiger bit his thumb off,’ property manager Whitney Burbank told WESH-TV. ‘There are signs on the cage that say, “Do not approach the cage.""’ The state wildlife agency said they have never received any complaints about the privately funded and operated zoo, which is home to at least nine big cats, four of them tigers. Visitors to the zoo are encouraged to interact with the animals in the vast collection, which includes an alligator, different types of monkeys, birds, two different kinds of anteater, a fox and other exotic creatures. One visitor to the zoo, 'Jen B', wrote on review website Yelp that she got to play with two monkeys, feed two baby tigers and even had a baby grizzly bear suck on her thumb . She said: 'Amazing experience best animal experience ever. best service best everything. got to play with 2 baby tigers feed camels goats, play with 2 monkeys learn and touch many different animals. didn't get rushed. great customer service. baby grizzly bear sucked on my finger. cutest thing in the world,' According to the sanctuary’s website, owners Mario and Maria Tabraue bought five acres of land south of Miami more than a decade ago to create a habitat for exotic animals . 'ZWF offers more animal encounters than any South Florida zoo,' the website boasts. It is a completely private facility and claims to be the 'ultimate haven for endangered and displaced wildlife'. It is co-founded and funded by the philanthropic Mantella family based out of Toronto, Canada. Dangerous side-business: Tabraue's drug-smuggling operation allegedly imported 500,000 tons of pot and hundreds of pounds of cocaine from Colombia, earning him $75million in profit . Philanthropist Sylivia Mantella (pictured), from Canada, co-founded the zoo alongside the Tabraues in 2010 . Sylvia Mantella and her husband Robert are understood to have got involved with the zoo venture when theymet the owner and learned he had just rescued a two-toed sloth and was looking for a home for it . But as it turns out, the owner of the sanctuary has a dark past involving allegations of murder and dismemberment; drug trafficking; corruption and obstruction of justice. In December 1987, the Associated Press reported that Tabraue and his father, Guillermo, were arrested as part of a sting operation targeting a drug-trafficking ring that killed an informant and dismembered his body while smuggling in a half-million pounds of marijuana. An FBI agent said at the time that when federal officials came to arrest Mario Tabraue, the suspected head of the drug ring, his wife tossed a bundle of $50,000 in cash out the back window. The FBI dubbed the investigation 'Operation Cobra' because Tabraue owned an exotic pet store and ranch, where he kept a giraffe, a cheetah and rare birds. During the three-month trial, witnesses recounted how Tabraue and an associate allegedly carved up the corpse of federal informant Larry Nash with a circular saw, dumped it in a horse trough and set it alight. Tabraue's drug-smuggling operation allegedly imported 500,000 of tons of pot and more than 200lbs of cocaine from Colombia, earning him $75million in profit. Tabaue was eventually found guilty of 61 acts of racketeering and sentenced to 100 years in prison, but he was freed after only 12 years because he was recruited as a federal informant. Mario Tabraue was acquitted of complicity in the shooting death of his first wife, also named Maria, which followed a domestic dispute. The case became the subject of Bryan Christy's 2008 non-fiction book The Lizard King: The True Crimes and Passions of World's Greatest Reptile Smugglers.

"A man reported to be the gunman in a shooting spree in California that ended with the death of two sheriff's deputies had been arrested in Utah nearly 10 years ago and released, in spite of previous criminal convictions and deportations. Police in West Valley City, Utah, said they took a fingerprint from a man using the name Marcelo Marquez during a misdemeanor hit-and-run arrest in 2003. However, Utah authorities say fingerprints from such suspects are not regularly entered into a database that would flag other arrests in the US or deportations. Accused: Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, as seen in this undated photo provided by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, is accused of killing two sheriff's deputies during a shooting spree . Marquez flew under the radar until he and his wife were arrested Friday after the deadly California shootings. Immigration authorities say the fingerprints have been matched to biometric records showing the suspect's real name is Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, and he had been living in the US illegally after being convicted in Arizona for selling drugs in 1997 and deported to Mexico twice. He appeared to be living quietly with his wife in a suburb of Salt Lake City until his arrest in California. Investigators were trying to determine how he avoided scrutiny. Monroy-Bracamonte and his wife, Janelle Marquez Monroy, 38, are accused of leading authorities on a six-hour chase that began after Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead as he checked out a suspicious car in a motel parking lot. Monroy's father said his daughter was trying to talk to Oliver in California before he was shot and killed. The couple were arguing loudly in their parked car when they were approached by Oliver and his partner, Mauro Marquez told The Sacramento Bee in an interview in Spanish from his home in Phoenix. Dead: Placer County  Sheriff's Homicide Detective Michael David Davis Jr was shot and killed on Friday by Marcelo Marquez, 34, who had been previously convicted on drug charges according to police . Line of duty: Deputy Danny Oliver was also gunned down by Marquez, who brandished an AR-15-type assault rifle, according to police . Marquez said his daughter told him from her jail cell that she had wanted to leave Monroy-Bracamonte 'because of the madness he had and drugs.' After Oliver was gunned down, a motorist who resisted surrendering his car keys was shot in the face. Two deputies who approached the couple on a road were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon, police said. Homicide Detective Michael David Davis Jr, 42, died at a hospital. Monroy-Bracamonte was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking. Monroy was being held on suspicion of attempted murder and carjacking. They were scheduled to make their court appearance Tuesday, and officials said they would announce formal charges. No attorneys were listed for either suspect in jail records. Immigration officials say Monroy-Bracamonte was last deported in 2001 — and that his fingerprints match those of the man held in the California rampage. Two years after the deportation, court records show, Marcelo Marquez was arrested on April 21, 2003, in West Valley City for misdemeanor hit-and-run and making a false police report. He pleaded guilty, received a year of probation and was fined about $500. Police spokeswoman Roxanne Vainuku said an index finger print of the suspect was taken and sent to state authorities. In Utah, fingerprint data is entered into a biometric database for all suspects booked into jail. But for those who are cited and released, police take a print from a single finger that's kept in state criminal records. But unless there's a request from an investigator, the print is not run against the biometric database to determine whether the person has a prior record outside Utah or is using an alias, said Alice Moffat, director of the Bureau of Criminal Identification. 'We get hundreds of those misdemeanor citations every day,' she said. Records show Marquez obtained a driving privilege card for persons without proof of legal immigration status in June 2011 — the month before the state began requiring fingerprints for the cards. When the identification card expired the following year, he didn't renew it, said Utah Department of Public Safety spokesman Dwayne Baird. Sacramento County sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. Lisa Bowman said her department still has been unable to confirm information released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement that Marquez is really Monroy-Bracamonte. 'We understand Marquez has many aliases,' Bowman said in an email, without confirming any alternate identities. 'People do this every day with false birth records, false identifications, scams with Social Security numbers. It could have been a number of any of these but I cannot confirm at this time; it is part of this case investigation.' Investigators still have not been unable to unearth a motive for the shootings, nor why the couple was in Sacramento, Bowman said.","Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, 34, was arrested under the name Marcelo Marquez for a misdemeanor hit-and-run in 2003 .

"From the position of a woman’s ‘bump’ to the movement of a suspended ring, there are many old wives’ tales that claim to be able to predict the sex of an unborn child. But now mothers-to-be may want to keep an eye on the world’s weather, as experts have suggested that changing temperatures affect the sex of babies. A Japanese study has found that more baby girls are  born, compared to boys, when temperatures rise in the country. A Japanese study has found that more baby girls are born, compared to boys, when temperatures rise in the country. It reinforces previous research that suggests temperature plays a role in the sex ratio - but some of the results contradict each other . ‘The recent temperature fluctuations in Japan seem to be linked to a lower male:female sex ratio of newborn infants, partly via increased male foetal deaths,’ according to scientists from M&K Health Institute and Shimizu Women's Clinic, both in Hyogo, as well as the University of Copenhagen. ‘Male concepti seem to be especially vulnerable to external stress factors, including climate changes,’ they wrote in a study published in the journal, Fertility and Sterility. Previous studies have also shown that the sex ratio is sensitive to factors such as temperature. Researchers recently found that more girls are born in tropical countries than boys, but warmer periods in Northern Finland led to more baby boys being born, Smithsonian reported. This reveals that some studies seem to contradict one another. Earlier this year, pollution in central Scotland was linked to a skew in the sex ratio in favour of girls. Previous studies have shown that the sex ratio is sensitive to factors such as temperature. Researchers have found that more girls are born in tropical countries than boys, but warmer periods in Northern Finland led to more baby boys being born. A stock image of a pregnant woman is pictured . To come up with the latest results, experts in Japan studied birth records and miscarriages in Japan between 1968 and 2012. Overall, more girls were born compared to boys and temperature fluctuations – particularly from a hot summer to a cold winter – saw the sex ratio become temporarily more pronounced. The study claims that temperature fluctuations have influenced the ratio, but makes it clear that climate change may not be responsible for skewing the number of girls and boys that are born. Climate change affects people living in poor parts of cities more than more affluent residents, a study claims. Joyce Klein Rosenthal, a researcher at Harvard University said that people living in poor neighbourhoods are at the most risk of suffering from heat-related illnesses. This is because poor areas tend to be more cramped and are hotter overall than more desirable places, which may have wider boulevards or parks, she told Time magazine. In poorer neighbouroods, buildings may be built from cheaper materials that retain heat and few people may own air conditioners. In a study of New York City, Dr Rosenthal found a link between the affluence of neighbourhoods and the number of people who died from heat-related ailment, which are known to affect senior citizens. Olga Wilhelmi, a researcher at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, said that climate change effects poorer neighbourhoods more because many people do manual labour. They may spend long periods of time outside in high temperatures and come home to a hot building where they are more likely to suffer from heat stroke, she said. It does however seem to reinforce previous studies that have found that male foetuses are more susceptible to events that can stress pregnant women, such as extreme heat waves. ‘Two climate extremes, a very hot summer in 2010 and a very cold winter in January 2011, showed not only statistically significant declines in sex ratios of newborn infants 9 months later in June 2011 and October 2011 but also statistically significant increases of foetal death rates immediately, in September 2010 and January 2011,’ the researchers wrote. Animal studies have shown that rainy periods lead to more male chimpanzees, while loggerhead turtles produce more female offspring in warmer waters. Temperature is also known to determine the sex of reptiles. If the world is getting hotter and rising temporaries do favour the birth of girls, a change to the global sex ratio may happen one day. A study in 2002 found that 101 boys are born compared to 100 girls. Another study has found that climate change affects people living in the poor parts of cities (such as new York, pictured) than more affluent residents. This is because poor areas tend to be more cramped and are hotter than more desirable places, which may have wider boulevards or parks .","Study in Japan suggests temperature affects the sex of babies .

"Brussels’ shock demand for £1.7billion more from Britain has pushed us closer to leaving the EU, a furious David Cameron admitted yesterday. The Prime Minister insisted the payment – which works out at £56 for every taxpayer – was ‘not going to happen’. And asked if the demand makes it more likely that the UK will vote to leave in his promised 2017 referendum, he said it ‘certainly doesn’t help’. Scroll down for video . Defiant: David Cameron has insisted Britain will not be paying the surprise £1.7billion bill demanded by the EU . The European Commission made the surprise demand for the money on Thursday after recalculating the relative wealth of each member state. Britain was told to pay more because its economy has performed better than expected. But countries including France whose economies have under-performed will receive multi-million-pound rebates – something critics said was essentially a reward for their ‘basket case’ economic policies. Mr Cameron made it clear he was ready to take legal action to try to block the EU charge, which he compared with being ‘clubbed with lead piping’. He interrupted a summit of European leaders in Brussels yesterday morning to demand discussion of the huge backdated charge, securing agreement on an urgent meeting of EU finance ministers next month to review the proposed payments. Controversial: The UK was told to pay more as its economy has exceeded expectations but under-performing countries including France  will receive multi-million-pound rebates (French President Francois Hollande, right) Adamant: Jose Manuel Barroso, the outgoing president of the European Commission, indicated that the £1.7billion bill was not up for negotiation . But Germany’s powerful leader Angela Merkel – whose country is set to receive a rebate – suggested Britain would eventually end up paying the vast sum, and said she had no problem with the calculations. And Jose Manuel Barroso, the outgoing president of the European Commission, indicated that the £1.7billion bill was not up for negotiation. Farcically, 24 hours after it emerged Britain was facing the budget surcharge, the Commission was still unable to explain how the figure had been calculated. The chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the UK by the EU in comparison with other member states . There was a growing row last night over whether the UK should have been better prepared for the charge. It emerged that Chancellor George Osborne had known about the demand on Tuesday but, embarrassingly, he had not passed on the information to the Prime Minister, who did not find out until Thursday. David Cameron was left red-faced as he was forced to admit he had been kept in the dark for days about the shock £1.7billion demand after George Osborne failed to inform him. The surprise bill was presented to the Treasury by the EU Commission last Friday. But extraordinarily it was almost a week before the Prime Minister learnt about it on Thursday. And according to Labour, the Office for National Statistics might have known about it five months ago. Mr Cameron yesterday refused to apportion blame for the farcical series of events that led to him being told only hours before he arrived at an EU leaders’ summit in Brussels on Thursday. A three-page document informing the UK of the £1.7billion surcharge to be paid by December 1 was sent to the Treasury at the end of last week. It is understood senior officials were told of the massive demand on Monday and the Chancellor yesterday admitted he was told ‘earlier this week’. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘I personally first became aware of it over the last couple of days.’ But Labour suggested that the Government should have known months ago that the budget recalculation was being done. Pat McFadden, the party’s Europe spokesman, said: ‘The UK’s Office for National Statistics published a report over five months ago detailing the changes made to UK growth figures which it clearly stated were for use in the calculation of a Member State’s contribution to the EU budget. ‘Did the Government delay making news public about this expected revision to the UK’s EU contribution because of fears about how it would play out for the Conservative Party?’ The EU’s financial demand is terrible timing for the Tories, coming weeks before the Rochester and Strood by-election in which Ukip is threatening to snatch the seat from them. At a campaign event in Chatham last night, Mr Cameron suggested a lower sum could be acceptable, saying: ‘If it is two billion euros, no we are not going to pay.’ Earlier in Brussels he had spoken of his ‘downright anger’ at the surcharge and said he would not pay on December 1. The £1.7billion bill represents almost a fifth of Britain’s net contribution last year. Mr Cameron said: ‘It is an unacceptable way for this organisation to work – to suddenly present a bill like this for such a vast sum of money with so little time to pay it. ‘And it is an unacceptable way to treat one of the biggest contributors to the European Union. ‘I am not paying that bill on December 1. If people think I am, they have got another think coming.’ Mr Cameron demanded an investigation into how the bill was calculated, adding: ‘We will challenge this in every way possible. There may indeed be legal action.’ The prime ministers of Italy and Holland have also spoken out against the demands made to their own countries. Asked whether the colossal bill made it harder to argue that Britain should stay in the EU, Mr Cameron said: ‘Well it certainly doesn’t help, let’s put it like that. ‘I think there is a strong case for Britain involved in the European Union, if we can reform it in the way I have set out. ‘When you are presented with a bill like this, with a month to go, is that helpful for Britain’s membership of the European Union? No, it certainly is not.’ In Britain, the demand was criticised by even the most strident supporters of the EU, with Europhile Lib Dem MEPs joining Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers in condemning the EU Commission. Catherine Bearder, a Lib Dem MEP, said: ‘Just as pro-EU sentiment in UK reaches a 23-year high, the Commission clumsily gives Eurosceptics an open goal with budget request. Senseless.’ Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘It’s just not acceptable to try to change the fees for the EU over many previous years, and then demand the money back at a moment’s notice, without a proper explanation.’ Labour’s Europe spokesman Pat McFadden said: ‘It’s unacceptable that the outgoing EU Commission should spring a backdated bill on member states in this way.’ Eurosceptic Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The Prime Minister should tell them to stick their 2billion euro demand where the sun doesn’t shine. We’re already paying £20billion a year in EU membership fees. They’ve got a damn nerve coming back for more.’ The French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of Fawlty Towers. All major outlets highlighted the Prime Minister’s fury, with the Dauphine Libere running the headline: ‘Angry Cameron refuses to take out his cheque book for Europe’. Europe 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the Fawlty Towers theme, portraying Mr Cameron as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit Basil Fawlty’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring John Cleese. Europe 1 writes on its website: ‘A diner unconvinced by the proposed EU menu, David Cameron refuses to pay the bill. ‘It has to be said this is a bit rich, because Brussels is demanding an additional two billion euros from Britain as part of its share of EU budget. ‘Faced with this request, the British Prime Minister has abandoned the traditional English reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on Friday.’ Le Parisien runs a picture showing Mr Cameron with his mouth wide open, and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the UK Independence Party. ‘Under immense pressure from Eurosceptics, notably since the last European elections which saw Ukip win more than 27 per cent of the vote, David Cameron believes that this demand does not support the issue of Britain being in the EU,’ the Paris daily wrote. Like many other papers, L’Express and Le Monde concentrate on the reaction of Francois Hollande to the growing crisis, quoting the clearly irritated Socialist president as saying: ‘Respecting treaties is for everybody.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the only way to avoid the surcharge was by leaving the Union. ‘The EU is like a thirsty vampire feasting on UK taxpayers’ blood. We need to protect the innocent victims, who are us,’ he added.","Shock EU demand made on Thursday works out at hefty £56 per taxpayer .

"A schoolgirl took a fatal overdose 'on an impulse' while experimenting with self harm, an inquest has heard. Thirteen-year-old Gabriele Rimseviciute sent pictures on the Snap Chat app to friends, showing a photograph of an arm with injuries and another holding a hand full of tablets. An inquest in Bolton heard, that she also exchanged messages on the controversial social media site Ask FM discussing suicide. Eventually after using the internet to research pills, the teenager - who was upset about the breakdown of her friendship with a boy - took an accidental overdose of tablets. She was found on the bathroom floor by her mother at home in Wigan, Greater Manchester after suffering a seizure, and died two hours later in hospital. Police examined her phones and computer and found 23 body harm photographs. She had also been exchanging messages on the controversial social media site Ask FM. The hearing in Bolton was told Gabriele, originally from Lithuania, had been living in Britain for three years and appeared happy to family and teachers at Deanery Church of England High School in Wigan. Her mother Vilija Achranoviciene said her daughter was popular and well-liked with a wide circle of friends. She had a good school attendance record and had no illness or mental health problems and Mrs Achranoviciene said she didn't know about any history self harming. Her school also had no concerns about her well being and had said she had been 'a normal girl who had settled in well and spoke good English'. But the hearing was told that friends discovered Gabriele had been having 'suicidal thoughts' and in the hours before her death last February she told one boy at school she could 'kill herself without hurting people.' Mrs Achranoviciene heard her daughter being sick at 1am and went to help. Gabriele initially  told her mother to leave but a shortly later she asked for assistance and she was found lying on the bathroom floor having a seizure. An ambulance took her to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan where she was pronounced dead at 3.40am. The inquest heard the medication was kept in the kitchen and also in a first aid box which had been in her daughter's room, the inquest was told. Det Insp Joanne Clawson of Wigan Police said Gabriele's phone and computer was examined and it was found between 23.52pm and 00.02am in the hours before her death, she had searched the internet for information about overdosing. She added: 'We spoke to nine of her friends from school and a number were aware that she previously self harmed. Part of our questioning covered whether they informed an adult which they hadn't. In fact no parent, teacher or adult had been informed. 'Around Christmas time two of the children had received a Snap Chat message which had a picture of an arm with self harm injuries and another with a hand full of tablets. ' The officer added that as part of the investigation Gabriele's iPhone and Samsung mobile phones were examined as well as a laptop. She said: 'Two of the friends at school confirmed they received a Snapchat on Saturday 15th February. 'The other girl didn't open the message until the following morning Sunday 16th and in doing so attempted to contact Gabriele. When she wasn't able to she went on ASK FM and struck up conversation with someone from Lithuania who told her of Gabriele's death. She spoke of a male school pal who had been conversing with Gabriele. Det Insp Clawson added: 'It would appear from the conversation she had previously had conversations with this boy. He didn't think she was serious.' The hearing at Bolton Coroner's Court was told Gabriele, originally from Lithuania, had been living in Britain for three years and appeared happy to family and teachers at Deanery Church of England High School in Wigan . 'He sent her an anti-self harming song from You Tube but a message from Gabrielle had words to the effect of ""I won't be here any more"". The medication Gabriel took was not available in the UK. Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb said there were three reported deaths associated with high concentrations of the drug and that it could cause seizures. Returning a conclusion of misadventure assistant coroner Simon Jones said: 'To her teachers and school and to her family Gabrielle was a happy 13-year-old with no problems. The other sequence of events is a 13-year-old girl carrying out acts of self harm taking photographs of her and having done so sending them to school friends with messages expressing thoughts of suicide and similar comments. A supportive message posted on the AS.FM website to Gabriele . 'I find it difficult to believe that a 13-year-old would understand the implications of what she was doing against a background of a young person who was clearly troubled or upset who had been self harming and who had had a disagreement with a young boy whom she had had some relations with. 'I recognise that taking a large quantity of tablets may simply be an expression of the way she feels rather than a serious attempt to end her life.. In these circumstances I don't believe for one minute Gabriele intended to kill herself. 'What I think is a far more likely explanation is that what Gabriele did was either in the form of experimenting with tablets or an expression of her mood and unhappiness in the same way that she had been self harming. 'It was a reflection of how she felt about herself and her relationship with the boy to whom she had been friends. I believe this was an impulsive act carried out shortly after a number of very brief internet searches.'

The two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to Perth for examination by the department's experts. Department of Fisheries' principal shark scientist Dr. Rory McAuley said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident. He said while results were inconclusive, it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught. 'We have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on Thursday and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received,' he said. Surfer Sean Pollard lost parts of both arms in the attack near Esperance, Western Australia on Thursday . Sean Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday which is believed to have been caused by a Great White shark . Examinations by Fisheries scientists have revealed that the bite on Sean's surfboard was caused by a Great White shark . 'Jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations. The first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length.' An online appeal to help in Sean's recovery has also been launched and has already raised over $5000 . 'Our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae, which will assist us with our research work.' 'Now that our investigation is complete, material will be made available to other research institutions,' said Dr. McAuley. WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety. 'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said. 'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials. Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible. Beaches in the Wylie Bay area have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident. Caution signs at key access points will remain in place, while department vessels which have been on the water will remain on patrol. Incident: The attack occurred in scenic Wylie Bay, on Western Australia's south coast . A separate online appeal has also been launched on Indiegogo Fundraiser, encouraging everyone to give generously towards Sean's recovery. Set up by Natalie Banks, founder of the No WA sharks culls campaign, it said,'Sean's medical assistance would not have been cheap at all! Let's show how much we really do care about people!' 'Every effort is being taken to get a hold of Sean's family in terms of this fundraiser, including calling Bunbury Police, South Bunbury Football Club and certain members of the media.' 'I got involved because it's a tragic incident and because of my connections with family and those who have had shark attacks before, they need all the support they can get,' said Ms Banks. So far the appeal has raised well over its $1000 goal and is at more than $5000 with more than 100 people donating. 'Blown away by the support of the community.' 'So we've been speaking to Paul De Gelder (shark attack survivor) in Sydney to see if he'll speak to Sean, depends if Sean is willing,' she said. 'Assist (fundraising money) Paul to go from Sydney to Perth, the rest will go all to medical expenses involved in surgery he has had and the treatment he's going to need, including counselling for family.' The campaign will close on October 14. The sharks campaigner says the system has let Sean down and more needs to be done to educate people in what's happening at their popular beaches. 'In Cape Town South Africa, there's a shark spotters program, flags and alerts, to alert people of shark activity.' 'We're not doing enough of this in WA. There needs to be a national view on this, I think, how can educating people harm the public,' said Ms Banks. 'Think government needs to do more for surfers and beach goers to have greater access to devices that are proven to work..., surf smart (electronic devices on surfboards), wet suits which deter sharks, these things should be available to the public at subsidised costs.' 'Why are these products not more accessible when our premier is talking public safety issues.' For the latest detection and sighting information, beach users should check the Surf Life Saving Twitter – twitter.com/SLSWA. Report any shark sightings to Water Police on 9442 8600.

"Zookeepers have moved a step closer to saving the Tasmanian devil from extinction after four joeys were born in captivity. The Tasmanian devil, the world's largest carnivorous marsupial, is on the verge of being wiped out by Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a form of contagious cancer which was only discovered in 1996. The rapid decline in their population - up to 90 per cent in some wild areas - has seen a number of zoos launch conservation programs to save the species. One of four Tasmanian devil joeys which Taronga Western Plains Zoo has recently bred in a bid to keep the endangered animal from being wiped out . Taronga Western Plains is part of a national population insurance program designed to help save the Tasmanian Devil, which is experiencing a rapid decline in population from the Devil Facial Tumour Disease . Taronga Western Plains, in central New South Wales, is part of a national program designed to help save the species. The killer disease, which is exclusive to Tasmanian devils, spreads from biting and the first symptoms are small lumps or legions around the mouth, which later develop into large tumours across the animal's body. As the disease worsens, the animals lose the ability to eat and typically die within three to five months, primarily from starvation and the failure of bodily functions. The animals are iconic both in Australia and overseas. It has been the mascot of numerous Australian sporting teams, as well as being the basis for the Looney Tunes cartoon character Taz. The Western Plains joeys, one male and three females, were born in March and are the offspring of their mother, Moretti. Zookeeper Denyell Woodhouse told Daily Mail Australia: 'Moretti is a very protective mother and we are really pleased with how she is caring for and nurturing her offspring.' The new joeys, one male and three females, were born in March 2014 and are the offspring of their mother, Moretti . The disease, which is exclusive to Tasmanian Devils, has seen up to a 90 per cent decline in some wild populations . Zoo keeper Denyell Woodhouse (second from left) said: 'It is hoped that in the future these four joeys will play an important role in the breeding program once fully matured, continuing to create greater genetic diversity in the insurance population' Ms Woodhouse says the joeys will stay in the care of their mother for 12 months, before gradually becoming independant . 'The joeys will stay with their mother until approximately 12 months, before they will be weaned and become independent,' she said. Ms Woodhouse said that every birth is important, as the animals will be used in the future to advance the breeding program. 'It is hoped that in the future these four joeys will play an important role in the breeding program once fully matured, continuing to create greater genetic diversity in the insurance population.' The recent births brings the total number of Tasmanian devils born at Taronga Western Plains Zoo to 22 since the program was launched in 2008.","The Tasmanian devil is on the verge of extinction from the fatal Devil Facial Tumour Disease .

"Huntsville schools Superintendent Casey Wardynski said the schools began a monitoring program after receiving a call from the NSA . A secret surveillance program has been running in an Alabama high schools after a phone call from the National Security Agency alerted the district to a 'violent threat'. School officials claim the system began monitoring students' social media accounts in Huntsville City Schools 18 months ago, when the NSA tipped them off that a student was making violent threats on Facebook . The schools began scanning Facebook and other sites for signs of gang activity, watching for photos of guns, photos of gang signs and threats of violence, as part of a  program called SAFe, or Students Against Fear. Internal documents explaining the program were obtained by AL.com, showing four different students - three males and one female - posing on Facebook with handguns. None are on school grounds. Some of the students were already in alternative programs for skipping or drinking. Three are listed as expelled and one was referred for counseling. Huntsville schools Superintendent Casey Wardynski told the news site that there was a 'foreign connection', which was why the NSA - a U.S. agency responsible for foreign intelligence - became involved. He said the student in Huntsville had made the threats while chatting online with a group that included an individual in Yemen. Mr Wardynski, a former U.S. Army colonel appointed as superintendent in Huntsville in 2011, said that about a year and a half ago the NSA called Huntsville and reported a high school student had made a threat on Facebook to injure a teacher. Al Lankford, the city's school security officer, told AL.com that he took the NSA phone call and that security officers went to the high school and eventually searched the boy's car. 'We found a very good size knife and the student was expelled,' Mr Wardynski said. But this week the NSA  said it has no record of a call to Huntsville and insisted it does not make calls of this type. Vanee Vines, public affairs specialist with the NSA, said: 'The National Security Agency has no record that it passed any information to the Huntsville school district, and the description of what supposedly occurred is inconsistent with NSA's practices.' She said any information about a domestic safety issue would be sent to another federal agency, like the FBI. 'Moreover, NSA does not make recommendations regarding school safety programs,' Ms Vines added. The schools began scanning Facebook and other sites for signs of gang activity, photos of guns, photos of gang signs and threats of violence, as part of a program called SAFe, or Students Against Fear (stock image) Mr Wardynski said the monitoring program has been used to break up a gang called the Wolfpack, which consists of six or seven members related through family and spans across several schools. The students were expelled and placed in alternative school and boot camp programs. 'People are very good about 'If you see something, say something,' he said. The monitoring program is designed to be limited to threats against schools, and students can be expelled from neighborhood schools and placed into alternative programs. When AL.com asked if school officials are also searching online for photos of alcohol, drugs and sex, Mr Wardynski replied: 'None of that.' He insisted the focus is on gangs, threats of violence and threats of suicide. Security officials can contact city police, refer students for discipline or call in mental health services in they feel there is the need.","Huntsville city schools scanning  sites for signs of gang activity and violence .

"Senior staff and journalists at The Sun showed a 'casual indifference' to the security risks that were created by leaks from sources within Broadmoor Hospital, a jury heard. A 'mole hunt' was conducted at the high security psychiatric hospital to find where the tip-offs which led to exclusive stories in the newspaper were coming from, Kingston Crown Court was told. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt described Broadmoor as a 'gold mine' for stories about notorious inmates such as 'Yorkshire Ripper' Peter Sutcliffe, whose psychiatric report he was allegedly given access to. Senior staff and journalists at The Sun showed a 'casual indifference' to the security risks that were created by leaks from sources within Broadmoor Hospital, a jury heard . Pyatt cultivated healthcare assistant Robert Neave, nicknamed 'Tipster Bob', as his main Broadmoor source from late 2007, with Sun head of news Chris Pharo and ex-deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll authorising the payments, the jury heard. Peter Wright QC, for the prosecution, told the jury of nine men and three women that an expert would tell them that such stories 'contribute to the risk and complicate the management of the hospital'. He said: 'A breach of the duty of confidentiality breeds mistrust generally, in staff and in patients alike. 'It exposes others to the risk of reprisal, it is corrosive of the necessary trust between patients, staff and treating physicians. 'It exposes staff and fellow patients alike to danger, damaging to the proper, safe and secure running of the secure hospital in which they work and at which these individuals are detained for the continued safety and protection of the public.' Neave was said to be a source for Pyatt from late 2007 to 2010, but others were also paid for stories, which included a picture exclusive of convicted murderer Robert Napper in the hospital's garden. The prosecution at Kingston Crown Court say leaked stories exposed 'staff and fellow patients alike to danger, damaging to the proper, safe and secure running of the hospital' The court heard that on Boxing Day 2007, Pyatt had warned O'Driscoll and Pharo in an email: 'There is a major mole hunt on for my contact and is obvious he cannot have News International payments in his bank account.' Mr Wright also explained that Pyatt had been given access to a psychiatric report on Sutcliffe and 'the opportunity to sit down and read it'. He said to the jury: 'You might conclude that that in itself was a most gross breach of trust.' Pharo, Pyatt and O'Driscoll also paid an Army private to track Prince Harry's movements while he received military training at Combermere Barracks in Windsor before and after his first tour of duty, the court heard. Pyatt allegedly gave the man, who lived in the barracks and worked in the officers' mess, £500 in March 2006 before any stories had been published 'to get him totally onside for the future'. The leaks led to exclusives, including one about the Prince urging army bosses to send him back to the front line in Afghanistan following his first tour of duty. Appearing in August 2008, it carried the headline 'I Belong on Front Line: Prince's Plea to Top Brass' and Pharo authorised a payment of £1,000 for it, the court heard. Six senior Sun staff and journalists are together accused of an 'over-arching' plot to commit misconduct in a public office and separately charged with being involved in 'sub-conspiracies'. Appearing at Kingston Crown Court, above, six senior Sun staff and journalists are accused of an 'over-arching' plot to commit misconduct in a public office and separately charged with being involved in 'sub-conspiracies . They were arrested as part of Operation Elveden, Scotland Yard's investigation into corrupt payments to public officials. Pharo faces a total of six charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office, while ex-managing editor Graham Dudman and O'Driscoll are accused of four. Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards are charged with three counts each and ex-Sun reporter John Troup is accused of two counts. Pharo, 45, of Sandhurst, Berkshire; Pyatt, 51, of Windsor, Berkshire; O'Driscoll, 38, also of Windsor; Edwards, 50, of Brentwood, Essex; Dudman, 51, also of Brentwood; and Troup, 49, of Saffron Walden, Essex, deny the charges against them. Prison officers were also paid for stories about inmates, the court heard. Dudman allegedly signed off for Troup to pay £300 in relation to a story about an inmate who had killed himself at category A prison HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire in December 2012. Pharo also approved payment for stories from a source at HMP Swaleside in Kent, the jury was told. The trial was adjourned until Monday .

"A two-year-old girl has died of meningococcal disease in north Queensland. The toddler from Dysart - in central Queensland - was airlifted to Townsville Hospital with symptoms of the illness, and later died on Friday. Meningococcal is a bacterial disease spread via droplets from the nose or throat during coughing and sneezing. Scroll down for video . A two-year-old girl (not pictured) has died from meningococcal disease in north Queensland . It can cause fever, diarrhoea and convulsions, and complications can result in death. Public health authorities say her death highlights the danger of the disease. In babies: . In older children and adults: . North Queensland public health physician Dr Steven Donohue said the illness can be treated with antibiotics but severe cases can quickly turn deadly without prompt medical attention. Queensland Health protocol offers immunisation for toddlers at 12 months of age for one strain of the disease but Dr Donohue said that just because a child has been vaccinated does not completely remove the risk of infection. 'It's important to vaccinate children but it's also important if there are signs of rapid and severe infection that those people are seen as quickly as possible by doctors,' Dr Donohue told AAP. 'You don't muck around if you've contacted meningococcal. 'You get those symptoms, you have to go to a hospital day or night, and tell them you've been in contact with a meningococcal.' It is unknown if the girl in this case had been vaccinated though Dr Donohue said the patient did not attend daycare and there was little risk of further cases. 'The probability of secondary cases of meningococcal is actually very low,' he said. 'It's probably 100 to one against having a second case in any one case. 'The risk of any one case to the general community is minimal. Really we're looking at close household contacts.' The girl was flown from Dysart - in central Queensland - to Townsville Hospital where she died on Friday .","The toddler was airlifted from Dysart - in central Queensland to Townsville .

"A man was left with three of his best friend's teeth embedded in his knee after a bizarre accident on a trampoline. Daniel Rigby, 29, from Pollards Hill, London, was lying on his trampoline playing with an iPad when Peter Walsh jumped up to join him. The pair began play-fighting, but Mr Walsh suddenly crash-landed onto Mr Rigby's leg and was knocked unconscious. Scroll down for video . Daniel Rigby, 29 (left) with his best friend Peter Walsh (right), whose teeth became embedded in his knee after a bizarre accident on a trampoline . Mr Rigby saw his friend's face pouring with blood and noticed some of his teeth were missing. Then, when he looked down, he realised his friend's missing teeth had been planted into his own flesh. But medics manage to leave the teeth lurking in Mr Rigby's knee when they sewed up the gaping wound. Mr Rigby said: 'He jumped on and jokingly tried to kick me. I pulled his leg away and his face smashed into my knee and he blacked out. 'He was probably out for a couple of minutes. He was face down and I saw blood coming out of his mouth and teeth missing so I thought it was quite bad. 'I tried to stand up and then collapsed because of my leg.' After Mr Walsh came around, Mr Rigby managed to call a taxi and drag the pair to the Accident and Emergency department at Croydon University Hospital. But he said medics failed to fully remove the teeth, causing a severe infection. Mr Rigby, from Pollards Hill, London, was left with a badly gashed knee (left) and still struggles with swelling (right) Worried the wound had not been properly cleaned, Mr Rigby went to the A & E department at St George's Hospital, Tooting, the next day, where doctors removed the remnants of his friend's teeth. He said: 'When I got to hospital, the doctor took me into a cubicle and I said to him: ""there's still teeth in my leg"". 'He took me off to X-Ray and he said there's only a bit of bone cartilage, nothing to worry about. 'They gave me two stitches and sent me on my way.' The 29-year-old says he is still suffering knee swelling following the incident in March. He is now suing Croydon University Hospital for allegedly failing to remove the teeth. Mr Rigby, who works in scaffolding, has employed a solicitor to file a negligence claim against the hospital for failing to spot that parts of the teeth remained in his leg. He added: 'It's really bad. Since it happened my legs stiffens up and I have to strap it up when it gets really bad. 'I'm very grateful for the treatment I got at St George's but not to the man who treated me at Croydon.' A Croydon Health Services NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We cannot comment in detail on individual cases due to patient confidentiality. 'Patients in our care are advised to contact us again after treatment if their condition persists or worsens. We would encourage Mr Rigby to contact us if he has any concerns about his care.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"From the spectacular setting to the starry front row (and not to mention the covetable clothes), the Chanel show is one of the highlights of the fashion calendar. And creative director Karl Lagerfeld pulled out all the stops to make his SS15 show Paris fashion week's most talked about spectacle. The silver-haired design maestro called in good friends Cara Delevingne, Joan Smalls and Kendall Jenner and Georgia May Jagger, as well as the world's richest model, Gisele, to walk in his show. Scroll down for video . That's one stylish protest! Karl Lagerfeld called in all the biggest names to walk in his SS15 show in Paris today. The model pack was headed up by Cara Delevingne, who carried a quilted megaphone . Previous seasons have seen him transform his catwalk into a giant Chanel-themed shopping mall but this time around, he created Boulevard Chanel No.5 and staged a street protest lead by Cara with a megaphone. His model army, including Edie Campbell, Gigi Hadid and Charlotte Free, carried signs emblazoned with the words: 'Tweed is better than tweet', 'Be your own stylist' and 'History is her story.' Work together and play together: Best friends and housemates Cara Delevinge, left, and Georgia May Jagger, right, walked in Karl's show in Paris today wearing his signature tweed and peals . There's a super in the building! Brazilian model Gisele, who is the world's top-earning model, also took to the catwalk in a beige and white cardigan dress and matching boots . All the big names: New kid on the block Kendall Jenner, left, joined industry heavyweight Joan Smalls, right, on Karl's catwalk today wearing his monochomatic creations . Model army: Karl updated Chanel's iconic tweed for SS15 by offering it in flared trousers and teamed with colourful blouses . Cara, who has previously described Karl as a 'father figure', headed up the demo chanting 'What do we want?' into her quilted megaphone (the new IT accessory?) - all watched from the front row by Alexa Chung, Poppy Delevingne, Laura Bailey and Kris Jenner. Tweed suits, as always, came in abundance. There were flared tweed trousers, purple hued mini skirts, cardigan dresses, and mosaic cocktail dresses in a melange of bright colours. In keeping with the feminist theme, Karl sent a lone male model down the catwalk carrying a 'He For She' protest sign, perhaps a nod to Emma Watson's HeForShe UN campaign for gender equality? Must-have accessory? Gisele really got into the spirit of things at the SS15 show armed with her quilted Chanel megaphone . Call to action: Cara, who lead the pack shouting 'What do we want?' was joined on the runway by best pal Georgia May Jagger . I predict a riot! Cara looked like she was enjoying her day at work as she closed the Chanel show in a wide-leg trouser suit . Follow the leader: Cara, dressed in a tweet suit and colourful floral boots, seemed to be enjoying leading the pack . Here they come! His model army carried signs emblazoned with the words: 'Tweed is better than tweet', 'Be your own stylist' and 'History is her story' down the catwalk . Making a statement: The models marched down the catwalk holding signs such as 'Boys should get pregnant too' and 'make fashion not war' Cara's army: Miss Delevingne lead the model army down the runway in Paris today in a show that was hotly anticipated . While she may be fashion's most famous face, Cara has been very selective in her show choices. She opened the Topshop Unique show in London (she also currently fronts their campaign), but swapped the runway for the front row at Burberry Prorsum. While Kendall Jenner is taking the fashion world by the storm, she has her fair share of haters. The 18-year-old's meteoric rise as a professional runway model has sparked resentment from some of her catwalk colleagues, according to a new report. At New York Fashion Week, Kendall was allegedly bullied by her fellow models, who even went so far as to put cigarettes out in her drink. A source at NYFW told In Touch Weekly: 'The other models worked so hard to get a spot on the runway and didn't think it was fair that she was there.' Say what? The models each carried a sign or banner with bold statements emblazoned in both English and French . The man of the hour: Creative director Karl Lagerfeld leads the procession as models stage a fake demonstration at his SS15 show . Picking carefully: While she may be fashion's most famous face, Cara has been very selective in her show choices but as a good friend of Karl and a current face of Chanel, it made sense for her to close today's show . Independent women: Cara, who has described Karl as a fatherly figure, headed up the demo chanting 'What do we want?' into her quilted megaphone (the new IT accessory?) And in true Mean Girls fashion, some of the models began taking their resentment out on the young reality star. 'They started acting b****y,' the insider said, 'Some even put out their cigarettes in Kendall's drink!' Meanwhile, the model recently revealed she must 'work harder' if she wants to be taken seriously by the fashion world. She said: ""I want to be high fashion. I want to be taken seriously. ""People think that this [success] just came to me. But it didn't. What I have has almost worked against me."" Kendall also explained that her reality television roots had made it difficult for her during castings. She added: ""People didn't take me seriously as a model…I went on castings and some people weren't feeling me because of my name. But it was great when people didn't recognise me. I was like, 'Thank you. Please don't recognise me.'"" Frow: (L-R) Photographer Mario Testino, U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour and director Baz Luhrmann attend the German designer's show .

"While the world thought it was busy invading Ukraine, Russia was quietly hatching plans for another land grab 4,000 miles away - an oil-rich Arctic territory the size of Switzerland. But the former Soviet state needed no tanks, guns or militiamen to conquer this swathe of seabed in the Far Eastern Sea of Okhotsk. Instead, the area - described as an 'Ali Baba's cave' of natural resources - was simply handed to the former Soviet nation by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, a treaty body run by the Unite Nations, on March 15. But the acquisition is seen by experts as merely a dress rehearsal for a far bigger land grab of the North Pole - a disputed region rich in vast and largely-untapped energy deposits. Icebreaker: A Russian arctika class nuclear powered icebreaker smashes its way through ice near the North Pole. Russia is employing every weapon in its arsenal to ensure its stake in the region, militarily, legally and economically . It comes after 13 years of wrangling in the corridors of the United Nations, and finally Russia got its way. 'This . water area of the Sea of Okhotsk has many biological and natural . resources, which have not [been] considered as the main income source of . the country's economy and now we can consider and include it in our . long-term plans,' said Sergei Donskoy, Russian Minister of Natural . Resources and Ecology. He claimed the treasure trove includes hydrocarbon resources exceeding one billion tonnes. He has described it in the past as 'a real Ali Baba's cave in terms of resources', adding that access will bring 'enormous opportunities and prospects for the Russian economy'.

But the former Soviet state needed no tanks, guns or militiamen to conquer the swathe of seabed in the Far Eastern Sea of Okhotsk . It comes amid international tensions over the growing competition for the Arctic shelf. Russia is employing every weapon in its arsenal to ensure its stake in the region, militarily, legally and economically. Two weeks ago, president Vladimir Putin announced the creation of a 'united system of naval bases for ships and next-generation . submarines in the Arctic' to defend Russia’s interests there. Speaking to a Russian Security Council meeting, he suggested 'strengthening of the naval component of the Federal Security Service (FSB) border guard group.' He went on: 'Russian oil and gas production facilities, loading terminals and pipelines in the Arctic must be protected from terrorists and other potential threats. Arctic ambitions: Two weeks ago, president Vladimir Putin announced the creation of a 'united system of naval bases for ships and next-generation submarines in the Arctic' to defend Russia's interests there . 'It makes sense to create a body similar in status to the state commission with broad authority, as it was previously done for the Russian Far East.' Raising the spectre of a new kind of 'cold war', U.S. defense secretary Chuck Hagel last week announced America's own intentions in the region, warning of the 'dangerous potential for conflict there'. 'The melting of gigantic ice caps presents possibilities for the opening of new sea lanes and the exploration for natural resources, energy and commerce, also with the dangerous potential for conflict in the Arctic.' he said. In addition to Russia and the U.S., Arctic sectors have Canada, Norway and Denmark (Greenland). All these five countries, as well as Iceland, Sweden and Finland, are working together in the Arctic Council (established in 1996) on common Arctic issues  in particular on the issues of sustainable development and environmental protection.","Russia was given 20,000 sq mile area in Sea of Okhotsk on March 15 .

"A skatepark dating back to the sport's 1970s peak has become a protected heritage site in recognition of its cultural importance. With its half-pipe, moguls and special skating pool, the Rom skatepark in Hornchurch, east London, is a far cry from the majority of listed buildings. But as it became the first facility of its kind in Europe and only the second in the world to achieve listed status, heritage bosses said the elaborate 1978 concrete construction was an important example of youth culture in the UK. Youth culture: The Rom skatepark in Hornchurch, east London, is a far cry from the majority of listed buildings . Built and designed by Adrian Rolt and G-Force, the leading skatepark designers of the period, the Rom follows the Bro Bowl in Tampa, Florida, in achieving listed status . It has been granted Grade II status, meaning it is nationally important and of special interest, by the Department for Culture Media and Sport on the advice of English Heritage. Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey said: 'The Rom was built in the late seventies for the very first skateboarders and is as popular now as it was then. 'Its listing at Grade II is testament to its design and also highlights how the UK's unique heritage reflects all parts of our culture and history. 'I hope the protection provided by this listing ensures the pool, moguls and snake run can be enjoyed for years to come.'

Old skate shoes strung from a fence at Rom skatepark in Hornchurch which dates back to the 1970s . The Tampa park was added to the USA's National Register of Historic Places in October last year. Roger Bowdler, designation director at English Heritage, said: 'Skateboarding is more than a sport: it has become a world-wide cult. 'The Rom is the finest example in England to this aspect of youth culture, and we are delighted its special interest will be protected for future generations through listing. 'It gives the whole idea of heritage an extra twist.' The Rom, which occupies 8,000 square metres, features a series of bowls and hollows and was among a rash of skateparks built as a skateboarding craze swept Britain in the 1970s. Many were later demolished as the sport's popularity declined. It is a rare survivor and has become one of the most influential sites in British skateboarding culture, English Heritage said. Author Simon Inglis who helped Rom skatepark in Hornchurch, Essex to become the first skatepark in Europe to be grade II listed . Made from seamless pressurised concrete, it is closely based on Californian skateparks. These were themselves inspired by the urban spaces - including oval and kidney-shaped swimming pools belong to the Los Angeles elite - colonised by pioneer skaters. The listing coincides with the publication of English Heritage's Played in London - a book charting the spaces, buildings and sports that have shaped London's cultural and urban landscape for over two millennia. Author Simon Inglis said: 'When most of us think of sporting heritage we conjure up images of Victorian cricket pavilions, of old football shirts or of Edwardian swimming baths. 'But skateboarding has now been part of the nation's recreational life for over 35 years, since it arrived in Britain from California at the height of the 1970s. Some of the pioneers are now grandparents, passing on their skills and enthusiasm to the next generation. 'Lots of people thought that like Chopper bikes and Space Hoppers the fad would soon pass, but as we can see in London alone, where there are at least 75 skateparks currently in use, skateboarding is still as cool as ever, and has received a real boost thanks to the growing number of BMX bikers, who now shares the facilities at most skateparks.' He added that researchers 'honed in on' the Rom because of the six or seven survivors from the 1970s, it retains more of its original features than any other site. 'I really hope that 'the Rom' will now become a place of pilgrimage for young skateboarders wanting to learn more about the sport's early days, and have a brilliant time while doing so,' Mr Inglis said.","The Rom skatepark is a far cry from the majority of listed buildings .

"Richard Horton, 52, was caught drinking while he worked at Albany pub in  Cardiff, and hanged himself  after failing to find work following the incident . A barman who lost his job after being caught on CCTV drinking a pint behind the bar while working hanged himself after failing to work, an inquest heard. Richard Horton, who was also known as Tash due to his distinctive handlebar moustache, was recognised on security cameras knocking back a pint while he worked at the Albany pub in Roath, Cardiff. An inquest into his death at Cardiff Coroners Court today heard how the 52-year-old lost his job at the pub where he had worked for 14 years over the incident. He couldn't find another job and even shaved off his facial hair because he thought it would make it easier for him to get new work. However, after three months of being unable to find employment, he hanged himself at the home he shared with his girlfriend in the city in July. His girlfriend of 11 years, Tiny Dunlop, who moved from the U.S. to Cardiff to be with him, found him unconscious and called an ambulance. However, he could not be saved. Keith Griffith, his friend and the pub's landlord, said Mr Horton was well-known and popular with regulars at the pub, evening running the pub quiz. He said: 'Richard had a very distinctive look, he had handlebar moustache, always carried a black umbrella and usually wore an RAF flying jacket. 'Everyone knew Richard from how he looked. But he was caught on camera drinking. 'He took the route of resignation because he thought he would have a better chance of getting another job. 'From the day he lost his job until the day he died he had been applying for work constantly. 'He stopped drinking alcohol - he even shaved off his distinctive moustache while he was looking for a job.' Mr Horton worked at the Albany pub (pictured) in Roath, Cardiff, for 14 years before resigning following the incident which was caught on CCTV. He was well-known with regular customers and even held the pub quiz . Coroner Thomas Atherton recorded a verdict that Mr Horton, who was originally from Ripon, Yorkshire, had killed himself. He said: 'Apart from the fact that he had lost his job there doesn't seem to be anything that would have precipitated a desire to end his own life. 'Taking into account the degree of sophistication in the method of death I’m satisfied that he intended to take his own life.'

"No surprises: Unmarried mothers to be, those on lower incomes and the less well educated were more likely to want to know their baby's sex . Unmarried mothers-to-be, those on a lower income and the less well educated are more likely to want to know the sex of their unborn baby, suggests a new study. Researchers in the U.S. also found those same women had unrealistically high standards of parenting compared to mothers who were not determined to know the sex before birth. They believe their findings show women who choose not to know the sex of their baby may be more open to new experiences and have more egalitarian views about gender in society. Researchers looked at 182 expectant mothers, of whom around two-thirds knew the sex of their child, measuring aspects of their personality, gender role beliefs and expectations related to parenting perfectionism. Mothers who chose to know the sex of their child tended to be less educated, have lower household incomes and were less likely to be married than women who did not know. Expectant mothers who scored high in parenting perfectionism, meaning they set unrealistically high standards, were also slightly more likely to find out the sex early. On the other hand, women who scored high in 'openness to experience', suggesting they were curious and independent, were less inclined to learn their baby's sex. The strongest effect was a combination of conscientiousness with the belief that women and men should share parenting roles. Participants with this combination of traits were 87 per cent less likely than others to want to know their child's sex before birth. Co-author Doctor Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan said: 'A conscientious, egalitarian expectant mother may want to wait to find out the sex of the baby because she doesn't want to create an environment that reinforces old gender stereotypes.' Lead author Letitia Kotila, a graduate student in human sciences at Ohio State University, said: 'An expectant mother who chooses to find out her child's sex before birth may be giving subtle clues about her views on proper gender roles. 'The results suggest women who choose not to learn their baby's sex may not worry about having clothes, toys and colours for their child that match traditional gender expectations. 'We don't know this for sure yet, but expectant mothers' choice on whether to find out their baby's sex may show gender role attitudes that will shape how they raise their children.' Everything must be perfect: Expectant mothers who scored high in parenting perfectionism, meaning they set unrealistically high standards, were also slightly more likely to find out the sex early . Ms Kotila said: 'These women may be more willing to let their pregnancy unfold naturally and not feel the need for tests to reveal the child's sex.' Dr Schoppe-Sullivan said this study is just a starting point for larger questions about the implications that knowing a child's sex may have for future parenting. She said: 'If you know ahead of time that you're having a girl, are you layering on all the pink and purple in a way that is going to push an extremely feminine ideal on your child? 'This may affect what paths a girl thinks is appropriate, all the way to what kind of careers she considers.'","U.S. study found same women had unrealistically high parenting standards .

"Inside a funeral parlor, a Filipino mother sits and weeps next to a coffin containing the body of her daughter and demands answers. On a hulking American assault ship moored at a nearby port in the Philippines sits a man who might have them - a U.S. Marine authorities suspect in the brutal slaying at a cheap hotel more than a week ago. 'We don't eat without praying first. We don't sleep without saying a prayer. Where were you when this happened?' Julita Laude beseeched God. 'She had so many dreams and that killer destroyed them all.' Philippine police have identified the suspected killer of Jennifer Laude, 26, as 19-year-old U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton. His mother, Lisa Pemberton, told the Boston Herald today that she was not being informed on her son's case. Scroll down for video . Murdered: The killing of Jennifer Laude (pictured left), a 26-year-old transgender Filipino, has sparked public anger in the Philippines. The suspected killer is Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton (right) U.S. authorities are cooperating in the investigation, and have ordered the ship to stay at the Subic Bay Freeport, about 50 miles northwest of Manila, until it is completed. American investigators have worked with local police, but have not made public any details surrounding the case. Ms Pemberton, who lives in New Bedford, Massachusetts, added: 'He is very much loved. Just anyone who knows my son at all has been flooding me and our family with so much love for him.' The killing of  Laude, a 26-year-old transgender Filipino whose former name was Jeffrey, has sparked public anger in the Philippines and revived a debate over the U.S. military presence in a country seen by Washington as a major ally in Southeast Asia. The nations signed a new accord in April that allows greater U.S. military access to Philippine military camps, part of Washington's pivot back to Asia, where it wants to counter China's rising might. Philippine police have identified the suspect as Marine Pfc. Pemberton. He was one of thousands of American and Philippine military personnel who took part in joint exercises earlier this month. He and other U.S. personnel were on leave in the city of Olongapo when Laude was found dead. Police believe that the Marine may have been enraged to discover that Laude was transgender. Heartbroken: Julita Laude, mother of Filipino transgender Jennifer Laude, grieves beside the casket of her daughter at a funeral parlor in Olongapo in the northern Philippines on Friday . Scene: Celson Miraflor, owner of Celzone lodge, shows the area where Filipino transgender Jennifer Laude was seen dead inside a love hotel in Olongapo . Accused: Pemberton (pictured) and other U.S. personnel were on leave in the city of Olongapo when Laude was found dead - he is being held on the ship while an investigation takes place . Philippine police and witnesses said that Laude met Pemberton at the Ambyanz, an Olongapo disco bar, in the late hours of October 11. At one point, they left friends at the bar and checked in at a nearby motel and got a room beside the reception desk. About 30 minutes later, Pemberton walked out, leaving the door ajar, according to the motel staff. A housekeeper entered the room to find Laude's body, partly wrapped in bedsheet, in the bathroom. She had apparently been drowned in the toilet, according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo. Two witnesses - a friend of Laude who was with them at the disco and the motel's housekeeper — identified Pemberton in a gallery of pictures made available by U.S. military authorities as the Caucasian male seen with the victim at the bar and later at the motel, said Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino. DNA tests were being carried out on two condoms recovered from the bathroom, he said. A housemate of Laude, who identified herself only as Alexis, said the victim was a devout Catholic. In the house they shared, she pointed to a Christmas tree that Laude had only recently erected. There were photos of Laude wearing a bikini on the wall. Angry: Julita Laude, mother of Filipino transgender Jennifer Laude grieves for her daughter on Friday . Accompanied by local police, Laude's family filed a murder complaint on Wednesday against Pemberton with Olongapo prosecutors. On Friday, Philippine authorities served a subpoena at the U.S. Embassy for Pemberton and four other Marines, who were sought as witnesses, to appear on Tuesday before prosecutors in Olongapo in a preliminary investigation. The prosecutors will decide if there is enough evidence for charges to be filed in court. The U.S. Embassy said on Sunday that prosecutors had met with the four witnesses. The embassy said it was up to the suspect whether to appear on Tuesday, depending on the advice of his Philippine lawyers. Under local laws, he could be represented by his lawyers at the initial hearing, but any non-appearance might spark more criticism about the government's inability to gain custody of him. 'The United States continues to fully cooperate and collaborate with Philippine authorities in all aspects of the case,' the embassy said. Philippine officials have sought to limit any fallout from Laude's killing, describing it as an isolated case unrelated to the treaty alliance. 'We are very committed to this relationship,' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Friday in Washington. Which of the two governments has custody of U.S. military personnel under criminal investigation is a difficult issue. The Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows U.S. forces to conduct military drills in the Philippines, says that the Philippines can prosecute American service members, but that the U.S. has custody over them 'from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings.' Protest: Julita Laude, mother of killed transgender Jennifer Laude, at a rally near the USS Peleliu, where U.S. Marine Pfc Joseph Scott Pemberton is being held . Campaign: Activists shout slogans during a rally near the USS Peleliu, where U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton is being held for allegedly killing Filipino transgender Jennifer Laude . Justice: The transgender woman's mother sits in front of a sign which reads: 'Justice for Jeffrey S. Laude and to all the victims of US soldiers' at a press conference on Friday . The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted U.S. personnel must serve sentence in Philippine detention. Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favor of the U.S. and undermines the sovereignty of the Philippines, which was an American colony until 1946. They recall a case of another Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005, also at the Subic Bay Freeport. Business as usual? U.S. Marines from the USS Peleliu, where U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton is said to be detained, jog around the pier at the Subic Bay free port on Saturday . Held: The USS Peleliu, where U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton is said to be detained (pictured on Saturday). The killing of Laude has revived a debate over the U.S. military presence . Smith was held at the U.S. Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country and sparking anti-U.S. protests. Protests, typically small, have again taken place in Manila and Olongapo. Most have been by left-wing activists, who have long called for an end to the U.S. presence in the country, as well as gay, lesbian and transgender groups that have labeled the killing a hate crime. On Saturday, dozens of activists managed to enter the former U.S. naval base at Subic where the suspect's ship is moored. They chanted 'U.S. troops out now' in the shadow of the USS Peleliu, and called for the scrapping of the Visiting Forces Agreement. Paulino, the Olongapo mayor, confronted the protesters, saying his city of 280,000 people welcomed the American troops and backed the accord. 'We won't agree for the VFA to be junked because it gives us a livelihood,' Paulino told a protest leader, saying visiting American troops filled restaurants and bolstered tourism. When U.S. troops left Subic and nearby Clark Air Base in the early 1990s, ending nearly a century of American presence in the Philippines, 'we went hungry,' Paulino said. 'Who came to help us? No one,' said the mayor, who owns a rent-a-car company and is a beer distributor in Olongapo. At the funeral parlor, Laude's best friend, Roann Dollette Labrador, said the victim had spoken about her death before. 'She mentioned that she wanted to die young, when she's still fresh-looking,' Labrador said. 'And once, she told me that she would like people to get hyped up and talk about her when her time comes.'

"Labour is under intense pressure to allow watchdogs in to inspect the second-class health service in Wales. It follows the Daily Mail’s investigation into allegations of appalling care, long waiting lists and limited access to lifesaving treatments on the Welsh NHS. The issue sparked controversy at Westminster yesterday, with Jeremy Hunt warning there was ‘absolutely intolerable pressure’ on hospitals on the England-Wales border as thousands of patients flee the Labour-run health service. Scroll down for video . The Health Secretary told MPs: 'The NHS is happy to treat more Welsh patients, but the trouble is they aren’t prepared to pay for it, and that’s why Welsh patients get a second-class health service' ‘For every one English patient that is admitted for treatment in a Welsh hospital, five Welsh patients are admitted for treatment in an English hospital,’ the Health Secretary told MPs. ‘I have written to the Welsh health minister to say the NHS is happy to treat more Welsh patients, but the trouble is they aren’t prepared to pay for it, and that’s why Welsh patients get a second-class health service.’ There were angry exchanges between the Government and the Labour administration in Wales over a planned study of the health services in the four nations of the UK. Ministers accused Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford of blocking the visit of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The watchdog, which conducts audits of public services across the developing world, wants to conduct a comparative study of UK health services. Fighting back: Carwyn Jones accused critics of playing politics with people's health . Mr Drakeford wrote to Mr Hunt accusing him of ‘a tissue of lies’ about the state of the Welsh health service, adding: ‘The NHS in Wales will not be the victim of any Conservative Party ploy to drag its reputation through the mud for entirely partisan purposes.’ Mr Hunt insisted the Welsh government had given written agreement to take part in the study, insisting in a letter to Mr Drakeford, seen by the Mail: ‘On a matter as important as this, I do not agree with you that their findings should be withheld from the public. 'You claim repeatedly that the NHS in Wales is not performing worse than the NHS in England – in which case you have nothing to fear.’ A Welsh government source insisted an OECD investigation ‘absolutely will’ go ahead at some point and accused Mr Hunt of ‘moving the goalposts’. In Cardiff, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said patients had ‘genuine concerns’. She demanded to know why more than 40 per cent of patients in Wales waited over six weeks for an MRI scan – in England and Scotland it was 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. In the Commons Stephen Mosley, Tory MP for Chester, raised concerns about the strains placed on health care in his constituency by patients from Wales. Asked by Tory MP for Monmouth David Davies how many patients who live in England had written to him to request treatment in Wales, Mr Hunt said: ‘Given the perilous state in Labour-run Wales, you will not be surprised to know that not a single English patient has written.’ In the Welsh Assembly, Labour’s first minister Carwyn Jones accused critics of ‘playing politics with people’s health’. ‘I don’t pretend in any way that the health service in Wales is perfect, but it’s not in England,’ he said. A Welsh government spokesman said: ‘Some Welsh patients, especially those who live close to the English border, will find it easier and quicker to access routine NHS hospital services in England because they are closer to their homes.'","Westminster controversy follows Daily Mail investigation of Welsh service .

"With Africa gripped by the Ebola outbreak, experts are working around the clock to prevent the spread of the deadly disease. From the building of medical centres and tests at airports, to scientists working on diagnostic tests and a vaccine, the fight is underway to contain and treat the disease, which has killed more than 3,800 people so far. And now, the outbreak has been plotted on an interactive map, which details the world’s most deadly outbreaks since 541 - when plague struck Europe and beyond. Scroll down for video . Click on the map below to learn more about the world's deadliest outbreaks . It allows people to access symptoms and death tolls at the click of a button, and see the spread of disease marked on a map of the world. The first outbreak to be mapped is the Plague of Justinian of 541 and 542. It ravaged areas of modern-day Europe, Northern Africa, and Russia, killing 5,000 people a day at its peak. Yersinia Pestis - the organism responsible for the Bubonic Plague afflicted the Eastern Roman Empire. People suffering from the illness complained of fevers, headaches, fatigue, necrosis - the death of body tissue – and the swelling of the lymph nodes, especially in the area of the armpit or groin. The first outbreak to be seen on the map is the Plague of Justinian of 541 and 542. It ravaged areas of modern-day Europe, Northern Africa, and Russia, killing 5,000 people a day at its peak . The map also shows how the Black Death of 1346 to 1350 rocked Europe, the Middle East, Russia and northern Asia. It killed approximately two thirds of infected humans within just four days. A more targeted outbreak struck in 1665, known as the Great Plague of London. The outbreak killed an estimated 100,000 people, approximately 15 per cent of London's population at the time. It was caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected rat flea.

No-one knew what was causing the plague, so Londoners used superstitious measures to protect themselves. These included wearing lucky charms, taking quack cures, such as 'powdered unicorn horn' and using chicken feathers to draw the poison out of the body. More practical measures, such as placing money in bowls of vinegar to avoid the transmission of the disease and smoking tobacco - as suggested by the College of Physicians - were also used to try and prevent the spread of the plague. The map shows that the Second Cholera Pandemic of 1829 to 1851 affected most of the northern hemisphere. This pandemic began, like the first, with outbreaks along the Ganges River delta in India. From there the disease spread along trade routes to Asia, Europe and North America in 1829, lasting 20 years. Symptoms included vomiting, dehydration and diarrhoea. The disease is thought to have killed over 100,000 people. The 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic coincided with the end of the First World War and struck worldwide. It was a one of the worst influenza pandemics in history, killing at least 75 million people between 1918 and 1923 globally. Symptoms included fever, chills, headache, sneezing, a sore throat and fatigue. The map also shows more recent outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, (Sars) which struck in 2002. It started in China and spread throughout Asia over a 12-month period, killing around 775 people. Ebola has so far proved more deadly than Sars, killing more than 3,800 people. This pandemic began, like the first, with outbreaks along the Ganges River delta in India. From there, the disease spread along trade routes to Asia, Europe and North America in 1829, lasting 20 years. Symptoms included vomiting, dehydration and diarrhoea.

The 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic (shown on the map) coincided with the end of the First World War and struck worldwide. It was a one of the worst influenza pandemics in history, killing at least 75 million people between 1918 and 1923 . The map also summarises the deadliest diseases since records began. Smallpox (pictured) is the biggest killer and has been responsible for 500 million deaths . The map was made when fatalities totalled 3,069, at of September this year, and the figures were taken from data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), media outlets and Stanford University. It was created by Buddy Loans. 2014 has seen the worst outbreak in history of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), and the outbreak has a mortality rate of around 50 per cent. The map also summarises the deadliest diseases since records began. Smallpox is the biggest killer and has been responsible for 500 million deaths. Some experts believe that up to 90 per cent of the population of the New World was killed by the disease. Smallpox is an infectious disease caused by either of two variants, variola major and variola minor. It got its name in the 15th Century to distinguish variola from the ‘great pox’ - syphilis. The last naturally occurring case of smallpox was diagnosed on 26 October 1977. Smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC and the earliest known physical evidence of it is a pustular rash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt. Measles is thought to have killed 200 million people, while Spanish Flu killed 100 million. The worst outbreak came in 1918, when it infected 500 million people globally, killing approximately 75 million of those infected. The outbreak even reached areas such as the Arctic and remote Pacific Islands. The map also shows more recent outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) which struck in 2002 (pictured). It started in China and spread throughout Asia in a 12-month period, killing around 775 people . Many measures were taken to prevent the rapid spread of Sars. Here, schoolchildren in Hong Kong wear compulsory face masks. People found to harbour the disease were isolated and treated with antipyretics and oxygen . Bubonic plague – also known as the Black Plague, killed between 30 and 60 per cent of the European population in the 14th Century - and 75 million people in total. Aids is the fifth deadliest disease in human history and has been responsible for approximately 40 million global deaths. Typhus has killed an estimated four million people, and strikes most frequently during times of war and deprivation. For example, it killed hundreds of thousands of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps during World War Two. 2014 has seen the worst outbreak in history of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). There were 3,069 confirmed cases as of September 2014, and the figure is now said to exceed 3,800. The outbreak has a mortality rate of around 50 per cent. This scene shows bodies being taken away in Sierra Leone . More than 750 British military personnel and a medical ship will be deployed to West Africa to help fight the Ebola epidemic. The ship, RFA Argus, which has a fully-equipped hospital including critical care and high-dependency units, will be sent to Sierra Leone in a bid to stop Ebola from spreading, as other preventative measures are being put in place.

"All Draven Rodriguez wanted was a memorable yearbook photo and in the end that's what he got. While the senior at New York's Schenectady High School originally wanted an image of himself and pet cat Mr. Bigglesworth surrounded by lasers, school officials wouldn't put it in the portrait section. But now he's he and Mr. Bigglesworth are sharing the the principal's page with administrator Diane Wilkinson, her mixed chihuahua Vivienne, and, yes, a whole lot of lasers. Draven Rodriguez and cat Mr. Bigglesworth are sharing the the principal's page in their yearbook with administrator Diane Wilkinson, her mixed chihuahua Vivienne, and plenty of lasers . Draven Rodriguez, 16, started an online petition to support his original picture, but school officials said it couldn't be used on the portrait page . Photographer Vincent Giordano described Vivienne as a nervous model while Mr. Bigglesworth was more interested in the technical aspects. 'Diane and Draven were all laughs, they really enjoyed the photo session,' he told Buzzfeed. 'Vivienne and Mr. Bigglesworth really broke the rules of cats and dogs and got along famously for a trouble free photo session!' Draven had tried to start a petition to get an image of he and his cat in the yearbook's portrait section. His campaign soon went viral, prompting support from publications like Gawker, Time, and Cosmopolitan. The final picture will include an urge for animal rescue and adoption. “I don’t want to go in the yearbook with the generic ‘I-look-like-everyone-else’ photo. I wanted a ‘He looks great. Only he would try that’ photo,'' Rodriguez told The Daily Gazette. 'When people look at it, they will know that was me.' School officials said the image of Rodriguez and cat Mr. Bigglesworth did not meet yearbook guidelines for the portrait section . It was reportedly Wilkinson's suggestion to invite him to share her page. 'It was the principal's idea, she went to the student with it, and he loved it,' Corona told The Times-Union. To be included in the senior portrait section an image must be uniform and 'professional looking.' 'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' Rodriguez said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous . Rodriguez was the first to admit the original image was over the top, which was the point to begin with.

"Lord Sugar has called for an end to Britain's benefits culture claiming Eastern European immigrants see the country as 'the land of milk and honey'. The Labour peer said hard-working people found abuse of the benefits system 'demoralising' and that it needed to be 'sorted out'. The 67-year-old, talking ahead of the launch of The Apprentice on BBC 1 tonight, claimed some of the issues could be solved by 'having balls and standing up to Brussels'. Scroll down for video . Lord Sugar, pictured, has said Eastern European immigrants see Britain as 'the land of milk and honey' He told the Sun said: 'What annoys me the most is the total abuse of the benefits system. The claims culture. It is demoralising when you see stories about people who have lots of children who can't be bothered to work because they get more money from the system. That has to be sorted out. 'And the fact that people from Europe can come here, particularly the old Eastern Bloc countries that have joined the European community - they see us like the land of milk and honey. 'Before you know it they are on benefits, national health and all that stuff. You can solve it by having balls and standing up to Brussels.' From November, European jobseekers will only be able to claim Jobseekers Allowance and other key welfare benefits for a maximum period of 3 months. It followed changes that were announced earlier this year to introduce a minimum three month delay to claiming benefits and to cut off benefits after six months unless the individual has clear job prospects. The new rules applied to jobseekers’ allowance, child tax credit and child benefit. He suggested that Eastern European immigrants should have to live in Britain for 'three or four years' and have 'worked and contributed' before being entitled to benefits. As well as hitting out at European immigrants rushing to Britain to claim off the State having made no contribution to the national economy, he also took aim at leading politicians. During the interview the former Amstrad boss - now in his tenth year fronting The Apprentice - was critical of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and said the current coalition was 'no good'. And he said it was 'fair to say' that with the General Election looming his Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'not the most popular of people as far as the country is concerned'. Lord Sugar (pictured centre next to fellow Apprentice stars Nick Hewer and Karren Brady) said hard-working people found abuse of the benefits system 'demoralising' and that it needed to be 'sorted out' But he also backed the MP saying 'he can be Prime Minister'. Alan Sugar was made a Lord in 2009 and has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Labour Party over the years. The Labour Party declined to comment on Lord Sugar's remarks this morning. UKIP's Immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP said: 'It is nice to see that even one of Labour’s staunchest supporters, Labour Peer Lord Alan Sugar, has come to his senses and now recognises how the UK’s benefits system is being targeted by certain groups of EU citizens allowed into our country under the ""free movement of people"" obligations of the single market. 'In fact, it was successive Labour governments who opened the doors to mass unskilled migration into the UK. 'It was Labour who opened the doors to peoples from Eastern European countries simply to garner votes in the institutions of the European Union.' It is not the first time the businessman has sparked controversy. Last week he stormed out of his own boardroom and accused a BBC Radio 4 reporter of 'gutter journalism' after he was questioned about being a bully. The frosty exchange between Lord Sugar and Today Programme business reporter Justin Rowlatt left listeners stunned during an interview to mark the 10th anniversary of The Apprentice. The BBC had been invited to question Lord Sugar at his Essex HQ but minutes into the interview the tycoon accused Rowlatt of being a 'gutter journalist' and 'picking up c**p'. Earlier this year he called for the axe to fall on the BBC’s ‘layers of jobsworths’. Apprentice boss Lord Sugar (pictured) is no stranger to controversy . The Apprentice boss said the BBC should axe the bureaucrats and managers who obsess with penny-pinching and instead focus on producing world-class programmes. The Labour peer used a debate in Parliament complained that the BBC was ‘heavily overstaffed’ by people constantly looking over their shoulders worrying about their critics. In October last year he was accused of posting a controversial Twitter message. The outspoken entrepreneur and Apprentice star posted a photograph of a crying Chinese child to millions of his Twitter followers, joking that the youngster was upset after being told off for leaving Apple’s iPhone production line – a reference to the Asian factories where the phones are made. The tweet prompted a single complaint to the Metropolitan Police from a Twitter user. The police took no action against him .","Lord Sugar calls abuse of the benefits system 'demoralising' for hard-working people .

"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is set to hand Arsene Wenger a major fitness boost ahead of Sunday's crunch clash against Liverpool. The England star was viewed as a key doubt for the visit to Anfield this weekend after injuring a groin in Saturday's win over Newcastle.

Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) could be fit to start against Liverpool on Sunday . Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) was replaced by Ainsley Maitland-Niles after injuring his groin against Newcastle . The midfielder will continue to be assessed between now and Sunday but Wenger is hopeful of being able to name the former Southampton man alongside Mathieu Flamini in central midfield at the weekend. The news reduces the chances of Wenger being forced into playing a makeshift midfield against the Reds due to a string of injuries. Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey are both out, leaving Wenger to consider playing Santi Cazorla in a deep role alongside Flamini with Lukas Podolski out wide.

He's been brilliant for me and I can say that for a number of players at this club. 'He has helped us massively and so it is not just him to blame when things go wrong. 'It is us as well as footballers to take responsibility but he would say the same thing. I am sure he will take responsibility because that's what a great manager he is.

"Nigel Clough's brother Simon has noticed how the Sheffield United manager is subconsciously picking up some of the mannerisms of their legendary dad Brian. And certainly Brian would have been impressed with his son's cup record with the Bramall Lane club – 13 wins in 16 ties after taking another Premier League scalp Southampton on Tuesday night. Clough Sr famously won the league championship with Derby County and Nottingham Forest, and his cup record wasn't too bad either.

He won the European Cup and League Cup twice each with Nottingham Forest – Nigel played in both League Cup triumphs – although 'Old Big 'Ead' never lifted the FA Cup despite reaching the final in 1991. Some of that knockout magic has clearly rubbed off on Clough Jr. Earlier this year he took League One Blades to the FA Cup semi-final, defeating Premier League Fulham and Aston Villa on the way before losing 5-3 to Hull City in a thriller at Wembley. This season they beat West Ham on penalties at Upton Park and a Marc McNulty goal was enough to beat the Premier League's fifth-place side Southampton, whose manager was so upset with Clough's animated presence on the touchline, he refused to shake hands with him afterwards. The Blades boss  (centre) holds out his arms as Koeman refuses to shake hands . Sheffield United manager Clough and coach Chris Morgan (left) have a word with referee Michael Oliver . Certainly, Clough Jnr doesn't adhere to his father's rule of never criticising or berating officials. But he would be proud to see the way his son, who he fetchingly referred to as 'our No 9' at Forest, can maximise the talents of his players. Brian signed a striker called Gary Birtles for £2,000 from Long Eaton and used him to win the European Cup. Nigel signed a striker called Che Adams from Ilkeston Town and gave him his debut against Southampton as a half-time substitute. Brian transformed Kenny Burns' career by converting him from centre-forward to centre-half, Nigel played right-winger Ryan Flynn at right-back against Southampton to cope with injuries and the loss of cup-tied players, and it worked. Clough believed that if a player was good enough he was old enough. Clough had no hesitation in starting with 17-year-old Louis Reed on Tuesday and he didn't look out of place against established Premier League players Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama.

"Residents in a quiet cul-de-sac were shocked to discover a pet cat had been decapitated, its paws cut off and a threatening message painted in the animal's blood on a garage door. Rhonda Gibson, who lives a few doors down from the targeted house on Hazel Court in Arundel, told the MailOnline the Gold Coast suburb is usually very quiet as most of the residents are either retired or young families. 'It's a really quiet area and there's lots of retired people in the area.' Scroll down for video . A message was left on a garage door at a Gold Coast home in the early hours of this morning while their car was set on fire . 'Nothing much ever really happens here.' When news  that a cat had been mutilated a few houses down reached the Gibsons, as cat owners they were very upset. 'Of course that makes you feel ill, but thankfully it wasn't our cat,' Mrs Gibson said. She also said residents in the house next-door to the targeted home told her they felt the force of the fiery car when the explosion rattled their windows and shook their home. There had been no previous trouble in the street, and the residents of the house involved were not known to Mrs Gibson or her husband. An investigation is underway after a car was also set alight outside the same home in Queensland in the early hours of Tuesday. The torched vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, belonged to the homeowners. A gruesome message left on the exterior of the house, in what's believed to be cats blood read: 'Whers (sic) my money? Tik Tok!'. Residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion around 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle. The cat's head was left at the front door of the house. People thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on Tuesday morning. Residents were seen cleaning the horrific graffiti off their wall alongside their burnt car . Senior Sergeant William Lithgow from Southport Station told the MailOnline the incident appears likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants. 'It's not a random act, the home was targeted specifically.' The cat had been 'decapitated and otherwise dismembered', though the animal did not belong to residents at the home, Senior Sergeant Lithgow said. 'Police are continuing to investigate and the occupants are cooperating.' Detective acting Inspector Greg Aubort said the occupants were disturbed by the message. However, he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links. 'We're interviewing the occupants and looking for motives of any persons of interest that might be involved,' he told said. Insp Aubort said given the nature of the incident, police were eager to catch the culprits as soon as possible. 'It's an abhorrent attack on an animal,' he said. 'I think any case where you have the intentional killing or maiming of an animal is a disgusting act and we'll certainly be looking to prosecute those responsible to full extent of the law.' Police were called to the Arundel address after reports of an explosion . RSPCA Queensland has offered a $5000 reward to help catch those responsible for the incident. 'They cannot get away with this,' CEO Mark Townend said. 'This is one of the worst acts of animal cruelty that the RSPCA has seen.' Mr Townend said he feared the offender would strike again. 'It's a stepping stone to violence against people,' he said. Investigations are ongoing and anyone with information have been urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","Neighbour Rhonda Gibson said she was shocked to hear of the incident in such a 'quiet area'

"Professional footballers have been urged not to sign for clubs in Serbia because there is a good chance they will not get paid. FIFPro, the world players' union, and the Serbian players' union have warned players of severe financial problems in Serbian football, with eight of the 16 teams in the countries SuperLiga unable to pay employees after having their bank accounts blocked by the Serbian national bank. 'We hate to do this, but it is our job to protect the players', FIFPro secretary general Theo van Seggelen said in a statement. FIFPro has warned players against sealing moves to Serbia as their teams are struggling financially . 'Players haven't been paid for months and encounter serious financial problems. Clubs are on the verge of going bankrupt. 'On top of that, I received the shocking news that one of the clubs totally disrespects the players' rights and even allows hooligans to threaten their players.' FIFPro said players at FK Radnicki 1923 were threatened by fans earlier this month after deciding to go on strike because they had not been paid for three months . The Serbian players' union said there were 115 cases concerning 'overdue payables' at the national dispute resolution chamber . Its president Mirko Poledica said the situation was 'alarming' and added: 'There are only approximately 500 professional footballers in Serbia. 'We would not be surprised if some of the clubs file for bankruptcy in the near future. 'Therefore we must send a message to all countries and recommend all foreign footballers not to come to Serbia, because there are no guarantees that they will be paid.' FIFPro said many players at Radnicki, who had not been paid since August, were struggling to pay for food and some had been evicted from their homes. 'There are players who lack the money to buy milk for their children', Poledica said. FIFPro secretary general Theo van Seggelen has said players in Serbia haven't been paid for months . He highlighted one player who has only received one month's salary since he joined the club, adding: 'He only received 1,000 euro in four months, but this is not enough to cover four months' living expenses . Serbia is an expensive country.' The players' union has offered financial support of 200 euros to all its members at Radnicki, but Poledica said: 'But that is not a structural solution. There are more clubs with similar problems, we cannot pay all the players.' Radnicki players announced on December 1 they would strike and FIFPro said that two days later a delegation of supporters were allowed into their changing room to talk to them. It said these fans 'insulted the players and threatened to beat or stab them with knives if the players were to continue their strike'. It continued: 'One of the more experienced players, Vuk Sotirovic, was hit in the face when he tried to reason with the supporters and protect his younger team-mates.' Radnicki did play their home match against FK Vojvodina on December 7 and FIFPro said during the match supporters displayed various banners with insults and threats directed to the players. Poledica said: 'One of the banners even stated that Vuk Sotirovic could be murdered.' In the wake of that match, seven players left the club, according to the Serbian players' union. Poledica said: 'They feel they cannot provide for their basic needs while playing at FK Radnicki.'","World players' union FIFPro are wary of their members moving to Serbia .

"Film crews have begun shooting part of the fifth season of Game of Thrones in southern Spain, delighting local authorities who expect a massive tourism boost. Extras were pictured in Osuna today, a small hilltop town surrounded by olive groves located about 50 miles away from Seville, which will reportedly serve as the backdrop for a battle scene. Osuna officials says visitor numbers to the town are already up by around 15 per cent since producers of the series announced at the start of July that it would film part of the fifth season there. Hotels in the town of around 18,000 residents are fully booked during the second half of October when filming is expected to take place, while a tapas bar in the town has introduced a special menu with dishes named after 'Game of Thrones' characters. Location, location, location: As Spain grapples with an unemployment rate of 24.5 per cent, producers did not struggle to find extras seeking a few days work on the set . Hot stuff: Hundreds of extras can be seen waiting in the soaring temperatures for their big moment . Extras acting in the series of the Game of Thrones leave the bullring as film crews began shooting part of the fifth season of the popular US fantasy television series in the southern Spanish city of Osuna . The Croatian city of Dubrovnik, where three seasons of the popular show were filmed starting in 2011, reported a jump in visitor numbers after the episodes aired and special 'Game of Thrones' location tours sprung up. Season four of the series, a tale of battles and betrayal mixed with a generous helping of sex and bloodshed, averaged 18 million weekly viewers in the United States, making it one of the most watched series on television. As Spain grapples with an unemployment rate of 24.5 percent, the second-highest in the European Union after Greece, producers did not struggle to find extras seeking a few days work on the set. Producer Fresco Film services based in Malaga said it received over 86,000 applications to audition for extra roles. Game of Thrones looks set to be equally bloody and graphic in its keenly-awaited fifth season . Local authorities are expecting a tourism boost as a result of the filming. The tourism information centre in the southern town has extended its hours since filming began. Hotels are fully booked until the end of the month . Osuna is  a small hilltop town surrounded by olive groves which will reportedly serve as the backdrop for a battle scene . The company selected 4,000 people to come to auditions and will hire 550 people to work as extras per day over 17 days of filming, said the company's executive producer Peter Welter. Police in July detained two men in Ibiza who ran a fake website that instructed people interested in work as extras to call a premium telephone line operated by the pair that put callers on hold for several minutes. Police suspect they earned as much as 100,000 euros in a week with the scam. Last week film crews shot part of the fifth season of the show in Seville. Onlookers held up umbrellas to protect themselves against driving rain as they tried to look over a pastel coloured synthetic canvas set up around the gardens of the Real Alcazar palace. The barrier was set up to keep plot details of the Home Box Office series secret. The palace, a masterpiece of Islamic architecture in old Seville packed with columned courtyards and elaborately tiled halls, said on its website that it will undergo 'partial closures' until the end of October during the filming of the series. Producers have reportedly obtained special permission to tint the waters of the pools of the palace's courtyard gardens dark blue for one scene of the fifth season of the series, which started filming in Northern Ireland earlier this year. They will use an eco-friendly product that evaporates several days after being used in the water, according to daily newspaper ABC. Osuna town officials says visitor numbers to the town are already up by around 15 percent since producers of the series announced at the start of July that it would film part of the fifth season there .

Seville, with its picturesque alleys, hidden plazas and flower-decked patios, already draws about two million tourists a year and local officials are optimistic that the series will bring even more visitors. 'We will have to endure some inconvenience, taking into account the possible generation of jobs and the impact on tourism that this will have,' Seville mayor Juan Ignacio Zoido told reporters earlier this week.

On the face of it, The Chris Evans Breakfast Show and The Today Programme would seem to have little in common. But it emerged yesterday that the two breakfast shows, on BBC Radio 2 and 4 respectively, have both seen declines in their listenership. According to figures released by Rajar, which monitors radio audiences, Chris Evans’s programme saw 608,000 fewer people tune in each week during this year’s third quarter (July to September) compared to the period April to June. And Today, which has been suffering a more extended period of audience decline since the end of last year, has seen its numbers fall a further 18,000 to 6.69million over the same period. These are not the only shows to be finding it hard to retain audiences, Radio 1’s breakfast programme, presented by Nick Grimshaw, also saw a drop of 149,000 listeners from one quarter to the next. For Chris Evans, 48, on Radio 2, he has enjoyed a sustained period of growth since taking over the slot from Sir Terry Wogan in 2010. While the presenter had looked set to break the 10million listeners mark, this downturn marks a set-back for the presenter who saw his weekly audience grow from 8.1million when he took over to 9.8million in the period April to June this year. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Chris’s show is the most popular radio show in the UK and the biggest since records began but, like all programmes, is subject to seasonal changes. So while his figures for the traditionally quieter summer period are not as high as those for his record-breaking spring, they are on par with this time last year and the show remains a broadcasting phenomenon, offering a unique mix of music and speech to an incredible 9.3 million people every week.’ In the last 12 months, the programme has dropped 46,000 weekly listeners, compared to an increase of 77,000 for Radio 2 as a whole. The father-of-three, who had previously had shows on Radio 1 and Virgin, was a controversial appointment given his chequered past. The former TFI Friday presenter once admitted to fronting many of his Radio 1 shows while still drunk from excessive drinking the night before and, in 1995, was fined £7,000 for turning up to work straight from a 17-hour pub crawl. Nick Grimshaw's breakfast programme has seen a drop in 149,000 listeners from one quarter to the next . However, Lauren Laverne's morning show remains popular, with an average of 868,000 people tuning in each week . He left the station in 1997 after managers refused to give him Fridays off so he could recover from his drinking sessions, which could sometimes see him consume 20 pints of lager a day. The Today Programme has been experiencing similar difficulties to its Radio 2 counterpart. After introducing Mishal Husain, 41, as a presenter in October last year, the show enjoyed a surge of listeners, but her effect now seems to have worn off, with almost 500,000 of its average weekly audience tuning out since the beginning of this year, dropping from 7.14million to 6.69million. A spokesman for Radio 4 said the expected such fluctuations and that there was no action planned to address the decline. They added: ‘Radio 4 has a loyal listenership with weekly audiences hovering between 10.5m and 11m a week and both Today and The Archers, the biggest programmes on the network, have had a stable quarter on the previous one.’ Other radio stations are enjoying a more prosperous period. Radio 6 Music, which is digital only, has built up a record audience of nearly 2 million people each week. It’s most popular offering is Lauren Laverne’s morning show, which sees an average of 868,000 people tune in each week.","Chris Evans' show lost 608,000 listeners from one yearly quarter to the next .

"More than two dozen British holidaymakers are seeking compensation from a UK tour operator after claiming they contracted nasty stomach bugs or skin rashes at a Portuguese resort. The tourists say they were swept up in outbreaks of gastric illnesses that occurred over the spring and summer months at Holiday Village Algarve. Young children were among those who fell ill with symptoms including diarrhoea, stomach aches or fever during their stay at the all-inclusive First Choice hotel. Robert Andrews sits with his two-year-old son, Austin, who was hospitalised after falling ill at a resort . Holidaymakers claim that the hotel’s cleaning standards were poor and there was mould around placemats in its restaurants, food was left out and diners’ tables were swarmed by birds. Sarah Andrews, 34, from Derby, said her family’s relaxing holiday was ruined when she, her 35-year-old husband Robert and their two children came down with symptoms of illness or rashes. Her two-year-old son suffered from diarrhoea, stomach aches and a high temperature at the hotel, and the illness continued once the family returned home. He was taken to a local GP for tests but his condition worsened and he had to be admitted to Royal Derby Hospital. While in hospital the young boy was isolated and became anaemic. Doctors confirmed he contracted gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or bowels. Sarah Andrews' six-year-old daughter developed a rash thought to be caused by a swimming pool . Sarah Andrews' son was diagnosed with gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or bowels . Mrs Andrews said: ‘It was awful. It was horrible to see my two-year-old in such a lot of pain. It was heart-breaking. ‘You could hear people being ill when you walked down the hotel corridor. You could hear babies screaming, clearly being quite violently sick.’ She said the hotel’s cleaning standards were ‘appalling’ and its manager and staff denied that there was an outbreak of illness. Mrs Andrews said a worker reused the same mop and failed to use disinfectant on the floor after her six-year-old daughter became sick in their hotel room. The tables were scrubbed and the placemats were replaced after someone complained about the mould, she added. Both Mr Andrews and the couple’s daughter were also affected by a skin condition thought to be caused by a hotel swimming pool. Holidaymakers complained about mould around the placemats at the hotel's restaurants . They were prescribed antibiotics and antihistamines once they returned to the UK. Reports of illness first surfaced last May at the resort in southern Portugal. Guests, who have hired Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose in Lancashire, have described queues of people waiting to complete sickness forms after falling ill at the hotel, according to the law firm. Debbie Middleton said she and her children were affected by similar symptoms during their time at the resort in Olhos de Agua. Her baby daughter continued to experience symptoms after they returned home. Farnworth Rose said it has been contacted by 28 holidaymakers to pursue claims for compensation against First Choice. Mrs Andrews said she is hoping the claims will lead to changes at the resort. She said: ‘It would be nice if when you arrive on a holiday and there is an illness there that they let you know when you get there.’ Nearly 30 holidaymakers have hired solicitors to pursue claims for compensation against First Choice . Algarve is a popular destination for British holidaymakers thanks to its beaches and sunny weather . In a statement, First Choice said it is 'sorry to hear that a small number of customers have reported that they were unwell at the Holiday Village Algarve in May'. The tour operator added: 'We closely audit all the resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards. 'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains very popular and 96 per cent of customers who stayed there in May rated their holiday experience as either good or excellent. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.' Anne Thomson, Head of Travel Law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘A number of visitors to the hotel have reported suffering gastric illness and skin infections during their holidays, with many requiring medical attention due to the severity of their symptoms. ‘It is vital that the highest standards of hygiene within restaurants are always maintained in order to protect the health of holidaymakers. In this case, many visitors to the hotel feel that that they have been let down in this respect. ‘I hope that such reports from holidaymakers falling ill are fully investigated by their tour operator in order to prevent any further spread of infection.’","Holidaymakers fell ill while staying at the Holiday Village Algarve resort .

"Delay: One in five 25 to 34-year-olds had or would be postponing their wedding for more than two years, the report said. (File image) Young Britons have turned into ‘Generation Pause’ and now routinely delay life events such as marriage and having children due to financial worries, a study found. One in five 25 to 34-year-olds had or would be postponing their wedding for more than two years, the report said, while one in ten said they could never afford to marry. Meanwhile one in seven 35 to 44-year-olds had or would put off starting a family for at least five years, and a quarter had done so for two years because of a lack of savings and investments. One in 12 envisaged never being able to afford children, and a quarter of this age group believe they will never afford a house. The report, released by investment company SCM Direct, said it showed the extent to which ‘financial constraints are directly impacting on matters of the heart’. It added: ‘We believe the impact of this delay is seismic, not just on a personal level for those who have hit the pause button, but on a wider level. ‘What would be the societal and economic impact if the age that couples started families shifted to the late 30s and mid-40s, with couples in Generation Pause increasingly postponing having children? ‘What will be the impact on the housing market if we move to a nation of renters rather than buyers, or to a model in which people can’t afford to get their first foot on the ladder until middle age?’ More than 3,000 people aged 18 to 85 were asked if they had or would be delaying different life events – including marriage, having children, buying a house and retirement – because of money woes. And Research Plus, which conducted the survey, found a significant number of those aged 25 to 54 had done so – dubbing them ‘Generation Pause’. Nearly half of this age group admitted they would have to delay their original retirement plans due to a lack of savings. A third admitted they were relying on family inheritance to fund their future, while the same number believed they would have to downsize at some point to raise more money for life events. Gina Miller, of SCM Direct, said: ‘We are reaching a crossroad. Life ambitions that were once taken to be a given – marriage, children, buying a property or retiring – are no longer seen as achievable by a significant portion because feelings of financial security and stability are at an all-time low. 'We believe that the UK is heading for a crisis. Britain – one of the most wealthy countries in the world – now has a generation of 25 to 54-year-olds in which only one in six is confident that what they are currently saving will be enough to cover their future plans.’ Anxious: One in seven 35 to 44-year-olds had or would put off starting a family for at least five years, and a quarter had done so for two years because of a lack of savings and investments. (File image) She added: ‘We have been shocked by how prevalent the “pause effect” is and how severely it is impacting people’s lives.’ The study also found that half of women had less than £1,000 in savings, compared to less than a third of the male population. And just one in five women have savings of more than £20,000, against over a third of men. However their problems could be partly due to spending habits. Those in Generation Pause admitted spending four times as much on holidays and three times as much on fashion and personal grooming as they did investing in pensions and savings.","One in ten 25 to 34-year-olds said they could never afford to marry .

"Tough new laws introduced to help ASIO and Australian Federal Police stop would-be terrorists from leaving the country and  joining terror groups overseas are set to be watered down. A review of the Federal Government's proposed counter-terror measures has recommended the bill be passed but also found many of the changes too tough and the committee has put forward 36 recommended changes. Among them, restricting the ability of Attorney-General George Brandis to declare certain country's a 'no-go zone' because of terror links. Scroll down for video . Among key changes called for by the bipartisan committee is restricting the Attorney-General George Brandis from declaring any country a 'no-go zone' because of perceived terror links . Attorney-General George Brandis says the government is considering its recommendations but wants its counter-terrorism measures passed in the next two weeks. 'This is urgent legislation which deals with a clear and immediate threat for the safety of the Australian public,' Senator Brandis said. The crime of 'entering, or remaining in, a declared area' should also expire two years after the federal election, rather than in 10 years as proposed in the bill. The report also urges the government to water down its plans to extend preventative detention orders, control orders and stop search and seizure powers for terrorist suspects. They should expire in 2018 rather than the proposed 10 years, it says. The committee also said that it 'examined whether the Bill incorporates adequate safeguards and accountability mechanisms to ensure the proper application of the laws into the future and whether the Bill is drafted in a way to avoid any foreseeable unintended consequences'. It has called the legislation 'complex' and wants a longer public consultation period. The bill includes a planned increase to the 'Stop, Search and Seizure powers' in the Crimes Act relating to terrorism offences, such as linking with terror groups such as Islamic State, for a 10 year period but the committee wants it be reduced to 24 months post the next federal poll . One of the key element of this second part of new terror laws was the government having the ability to declare a terrorist hot spot a 'no go zone' making it potentially a crime to travel there. Whole countries should not be declared terrorist zones only particular regions, the committee said. The government has responded, with the Prime Minister confirming it would consider seriously the recommendations. 'I am confident that the recommendations of this committee will be serious and we will take them seriously,' Tony Abbott said. 'I am confident that the recommendations of this committee will be serious and we will take them seriously,' Tony Abbott said . He said had a lot of faith in the committee's work. Human rights and Islamic groups have written to the Attorney-General calling on the government to slow the introduction of the new measures. They say the laws will restrict personal freedom and aren't needed to crack down on home-grown extremists. The government wants the laws passed in the next couple of weeks. 'Given the nature of these powers, it is important that their use and ongoing need is assessed within a reasonable timeframe,' the report says. The preventative detention order allows police to detain a terrorism suspect for 14 days with the aim of preventing an imminent terrorist attack. Privacy advocates are concerned about the bill's proposed expansion of biometric data collection, with the Department of Immigration to store more details of millions of Australians travelling in and out of the country. The government wants to legislate for future collection of data such as fingerprints and iris scans, should technology improve. But the committee wants that removed from the bill and 'given the sensitive nature of the data' recommends the government introduce it as separate legislation. Despite supporting the bill, Labor is concerned the legislation is being rushed through and hasn't been properly analysed. Australian Greens leader Christine Milne says Australians should be worried by the laws, which are an 'overreach' and impinge on the rights of ordinary people.","Joint parliamentary committee on security have called for 36 changes to the 'foreign fighters bill'

"eBay paid just £620,000 in corporation tax on sales of more than £1billion last year, its latest accounts show. The online auction site shaved tens of millions of pounds off its British tax bill by legally channelling payments through Luxembourg and Switzerland. The news will reignite the row over the number of global firms that use loopholes to reduce their tax liabilities in the UK. Scroll down for video . eBay paid just £620,000 in UK taxes in 2013 despite its American parent company headquarters pictured) reporting sales of more than £1billion . US parent company eBay Inc announced that its UK arm had achieved sales of £1.3billion in 2013. But eBay UK Ltd officially reported sales of just £164million and a profit of merely £12.4million. On this, it only paid 5 per cent corporation tax – or £620,000 – rather than the usual 23 per cent, after capitalising on generous Treasury tax breaks. The company makes its revenue by charging fees to sellers and takes a small slice of the proceeds of their sales as commission. It also has extra charges for those who sell a lot of goods at fixed prices. eBay is the latest global chain to be accused of using complex overseas accounting to reduce its full tax responsibilities. Yesterday, campaigners urged the Government to close its tax loopholes. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘Many companies making huge profits in the UK are effectively deciding how little tax they will pay. ‘If the Government were to close down the many tax loopholes that exist, big corporations and wealthy individuals would no longer be able to avoid paying the millions in tax the exchequer is owed.’ Ikea has also been accused of sending money abroad to avoid taxes despite acting legally in its handling of funds . Starbucks customers threatened to boycott the chain last year after it was revealed the coffee retailer hadn't paid corporation tax in the UK for three years . Fees paid to eBay by British sellers are sent to a related company, PayPal (Europe) Sarl, in the tax haven of Luxembourg. Meanwhile, eBay UK provides ‘services’ to its Swiss counterpart eBay International AG. Starbucks and Ikea used similar schemes to avoid hefty tax bills, and Apple was criticised this year for paying £11.4million in corporation tax after record sales of £10.5billion. Had eBay paid 5 per cent corporation tax on its full profits of around £300million, it would have had to pay £15million. At 23 per cent, the bill would have been £70million. It said: ‘eBay complies fully with all applicable tax laws and regimes.’","The retailer's UK office reported profit of £12.4million on £164million of sales .

"A 20-year-old college drop-out has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after strangling to death a 19-year-old aspiring actress with a climbing rope. Daniel Bartelt, of Washington County, Wisconsin, sneaked into Jessie Blodgett's bedroom after she returned from a cast party for a production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' in the early hours of the morning. As she slept, he launched a brutal attack on his former high school friend, tying her up and raping her, before fatally strangling her with a climbing rope. Miss Blodgett's body was discovered by her horrified mother later that day. An autopsy ruled the teenager had died from strangulation, with clear ligature marks on her neck and arm. Scroll down for video . Homicide: Daniel Bartelt (right), of Washington County, Wisconsin, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after strangling to death aspiring actress Jessie Blodgett (left), 19, with a climbing rope . In August, a jury took three hours to convict Bartelt of first-degree intentional homicide. His DNA was found on items used in the murder, including a roll of tape under Miss Blodgett's bed. Now, Bartelt has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, reported Fox 6 . During the sentencing, the district attorney said Bartelt was the most dangerous criminal he has ever met in his 17-year career, while others described him as a psychopath and narcissistic. But incredibly, Miss Blodgett's father, Buck, was able to look his daughter's killer in the eyes and tell him: 'I forgive you, as I have every single day.' Sentencing: Bartelt (pictured being led into the court room today) sneaked into Miss Blodgett's bedroom after she returned from a cast party for a production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' in the early hours of the morning . Case: As she slept, he launched a brutal attack on his former high school friend, tying her up and raping her, before fatally strangling her with a climbing rope. Above, Bartelt address members of the victim's family . Aspiring star: Bartelt and Miss Blodgett (left and right) met while attending Hartford Union High School, where they both acted in school productions. They became friends and even recorded a song together . The grief-stricken father added: 'I believe there is good and bad in each of us, so I don’t demonize or vilify you. I not only forgive you, I love you. But I don’t understand what you did.' Bartelt and Miss Blodgett met while attending Hartford Union High School, where they both acted in school productions. They quickly became friends and even recorded a song together. They then both went on to study at the University of Wisconsin, but Bartelt dropped out of the Steven's Point campus after just one semester, returning home depressed. The last time Miss Blodgett was seen, she was leaving the cast party at around July 15, 2013. That afternoon, a new student came to the family home in Hartford for a piano lesson. Scene: Miss Blodgett's body was discovered by her horrified mother at their Hartford home (pictured). An autopsy ruled the teenager had died from strangulation, with clear ligature marks on her neck and arm . Bedroom: Bartelt sneaked into Miss Blodgett's bedroom (pictured from the outside) before killing her . Miss Blodgett’s mother called for her daughter, but after getting no response, she went upstairs, where she discovered the teenager's body lying on her bed. She tried to revive her with CPR before calling 911. During the call, played in court today, Mrs Blodgett told the dispatcher there were marks on her daughter's body that looked 'like strangulation marks'. Behind bars: Bartelt has been jailed for life after being convicted of first-degree intentional homicide . The dispatcher responded: 'There are strangulation marks?', to which the panicked mother replied: 'That’s what it looks like. I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know what’s going on.' Investigators later discovered that Bartelt had used climbing rope to carry out the murder. The rope, along with antiseptic wipes and bloody paper towels, were found dumped in a cereal box in nearby Hartford Park. Bartelt's DNA was also discovered under the victim's fingernails and in her genital area, suggesting sexual assault. 'She's screaming at us and telling us through her body and through her DNA what happened to her,' District Attorney Mark Benson said at an earlier court date. Despite his conviction, Bartelt looked directly at Miss Blodgett's relatives in court today and denied killing the teenager. 'This jumpsuit that I’m wearing, these shackles don’t make me guilty,' he said, adding: 'I know there’s evidence that I can’t refute that would make you believe that I am guilty.' After Bartlett was led away in handcuffs, Mr Blodgett spoke of the star his daughter was and the dreams that she will now never accomplish, according to TMJ 4. But he added: 'I wish no vengeance or retribution.' Bartlett also faced charges of first degree recklessly endangering safety and false imprisonment, for a separate assault that took place just three days before Miss Blodgett's death. Devoted father: After Bartlett was led away in handcuffs, Buck Blodgett (pictured) spoke of the star his daughter was and what she will now never accomplish. But he added: 'I wish no vengeance or retribution' The assault happened in Richfield Park on July 12 when Bartelt attacked a woman just hours after researching serial killers online. The victim said he tackled her to the ground and she believed she was 'going to die' when she luckily wrestled the knife away. She held the knife at him and then escaped by driving off in her car. She needed 15 stitches after the incident. Bartelt told police that it was 'a spur of the moment decision...to scare her'.","Daniel Bartelt crept into 19-year-old Jessie Blodgett's Wisconsin home .

"Invisibility may still be the stuff of fictional works like Harry Potter, but researchers in Japan have developed a way to make mice almost totally transparent. Using a method that almost completely removes color from tissue - and kills the mouse in the process - researchers say they can now examine individual organs or even whole bodies without slicing into them, offering a 'bigger picture' view of the problems they are working on. The techniques will give scientists a 'new understanding of the 3D structure of organs and how certain genes are expressed in various tissues,' said Kazuki Tainaka, the lead author of a research paper published in the US-based Cell magazine. Exposed: This picture released from Japanese research institute Riken on November 6, 2014 shows a decolorized mouse body and some organs glowing with fluorescence protein at the Riken laboratory . 'We were very surprised that the entire body of infant and adult mice could be made nearly transparent,' he said in a statement issued by Japanese research institute RIKEN and its collaborators . The work, which also involved the University of Tokyo and the Japan Science and Technology Agency, focuses on a compound called haem, the constituent that gives blood its red colour and is found in most tissues of the body. The process involves pumping a saline solution through the mouse's heart, pushing the blood out of its circulatory system and killing the creature. A reagent is then introduced, which works to divorce the haem from the haemoglobin that remains in the animal's organs. The dead mouse is skinned and soaked in the reagent for up to two weeks to complete the process. Eerie: The process involves pumping a saline solution through the mouse's heart, pushing the blood out of its circulatory system and killing the creature . A sheet of laser light, which can be set to penetrate to a specific level, builds up a complete image of the body, much as a 3D printer creates physical objects in layers. 'Microscopes have so far allowed us to look at things in minute detail, but that has also deprived us of the context of what we are looking at,' Tainaka told AFP. The new method, which cannot be applied to living things, 'will give us details while enabling us to grasp the bigger picture,' he said. Hiroki Ueda, who led the research team, said in the statement that the method 'could be used to study how embryos develop or how cancer and autoimmune diseases develop at the cellular level. It was hoped the method would lead 'to a deeper understanding of such diseases and perhaps to new therapeutic strategies'. 'It could lead to the achievement of one of our great dreams: organism-level systems biology based on whole-body imaging at single-cell resolution.'","Researchers in Japan have developed a process to make mice almost totally transparent and remove color from tissues .

"An aid worker battling the deadly and fast-spreading Ebola virus in West Africa said the area is completely unprepared to deal with the crisis. Ali Readhead, originally from Perth in Western Australia, has been living in Sierra Leone for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing. 'It's chaos', she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They're totally under-resourced.' 'Patients are getting left in their houses because we just don't have any room.' Perth woman Ali Readhead has been working in Sierra Leone for two years, and more recently has seen the devastating effect the Ebola outbreak is having on the region . In the capital city, Freetown, there are only 30 beds available to those with Ebola, despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus. 'They're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds,' Ms Readhead said. Ms Readhead originally moved to Freetown to work on the women and children's health policy, but when Ebola began to spread received a direct request from the Minister of Health in Sierra Leone to help fight the disease. But she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if Australia and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres, two things which Freetown need so desperately. 'The only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military', Ms Readhead said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid can't. The aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures, urging Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to do more than financially support the situation. The disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected . Ali (centre) seen here at the christening of her god-daughter, said it is impossible to contain Ebola without expert military medical teams from Australia, the UK and the US . 'I've never been more devastated in my life. Last week I returned to Perth after working with the health ministry in Sierra Leone – witnessing first hand how the deadly Ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds.' 'It's terrifying, and to be honest I'm not sure anyone knows when or how it'll end. What I saw will stay with me forever – in some places there aren't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead,' Ms Readhead wrote on Change.org. Just last week there was a direct request made by the government in Sierra Leone to Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Ms Readhead said she believes there is hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there is a risk of infection. The reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted Ebola, and if isolation facilities were set up alongside US and the UK in West Africa treatment would be incredibly easy. Ms Readhead also revealed the wider devastation the spread of Ebola was having on the community, economy, and already struggling healthcare system. In Sierra Leone there are only 30 beds available for Ebola patients, so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals . Ms Readhead (centre) celebrated Australia day with fellow countrymen in Freetown this year . People are terrified to visit hospitals, which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites, a problem the region has already been battling with for years. 'Pregnant ladies are giving birth at home, if your baby has malaria you don't take them to the hospital', Ms Readhead revealed. 'The hospitals are empty beside Ebola patients.' She also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services, and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work. One in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women. This is worst outbreak of Ebola the region has ever seen, and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area. The country's government burial team is seen here carrying the coffin of Dr Modupeh Cole, Sierra Leone's second senior physician to die of Ebola . Fellow Australian Jo Dunlop (left) and British doctor Oliver Johnson have been fighting alongside Ms Readhead (centre) to keep Freetown's main isolation centre open . If it is not contained soon, the projection is grim. Authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received. The reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease. 'We don't have that level of contact in Australia... (and) we've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures', Ms Readhead said when asked if Ebola could post a threat to her home country. Despite the devastating health implications, the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life. Ms Readhead ran the Sierra Leone marathon last year with her mum there to show her support . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun. Mining companies completing projects in West Africa have pulled workers out of the area in fear of Ebola, and others with 'investments in the pipelines are being disbanded.' The disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area, and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken, Ms Readhead warned. 'It can definitely be contained... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients, healthworkers who are able to treat them. 'Unless we have those two things on the ground we don't stand a chance.' On Thursday evening the World Bank announced they would be providing a further $190 million AUD to go towards fighting the deadly virus outbreak.","Australia woman Ali Readhead has been in Sierra Leone for two years .

"At school we're taught that Earth's tectonic plates are rigid and fit together like pieces in a puzzle. But It turns out that this theory may be wrong. A study has suggested that the plates that make up Earth's outer layer are deformed by temperature changes and that they are in fact 'bendy', not stiff. A study by US scientists suggests Earth's tectonic plates (shown) are malleable. They say that the plates can cool and change in size and shape. This means they contract faster in certain sections and deform. During this process earthquakes within the plate can form . The study, supported by the National Science Foundation, was carried out by Dr Corné Kreemer at the University of Nevada and his colleague Dr Richard Gordon of Rice University. Their idea is that plate cooling, which makes the oceans deeper, also affects horizontal movement and that there is shortening and deformation of the plates due to the cooling. In their study they focused on data from the Pacific plate and found that different parts of it were moving at different rates. They found that the cooling of the lithosphere, the outermost layer of Earth, makes some sections of the Pacific plate contract horizontally at faster rates than other sections, which causes the plate to deform. Earth has a unique network of shifting plates embedded in its cold and rocky outermost layer, the lithosphere. The motion of these plates drives many Earth processes, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while also stabilizing the planet’s climate and enabling life. The division of the Earth’s surface into plates, separated by linear zones of concentrated deformation, is a defining characteristic of our planet, and unique among known terrestrial bodies. They say that the deformation could explain why some parts of the plate tectonic puzzle don't make sense. For example they showed that there is a positive correlation between where the plate is predicted to deform and where intraplate earthquakes - ones inside a tectonic plate rather than two rubbing together - occur. The formation of intraplate earthquakes has been somewhat of a mystery until now. 'This is plate tectonics 2.0, it revolutionises the concepts of plate rigidity,' said Dr Kreemer. 'We have shown that the Pacific plate deforms, that it is pliable. We are refining the plate tectonic theory and have come up with an explanation for mid-plate seismicity.' According to the researchers plate cooling, which makes the oceans deeper, also affects horizontal movement and that there is shortening and deformation of the plates due to cooling. Pictured is the Carrizo Plain in California, the most strikingly graphic portion of the San Andreas Fault . Dr Corné Kreemer, associate professor in the College of Science at the University of Nevada, Reno, conducts research on plate tectonics and geodetics. His latest research shows that oceanic tectonic plates deform due to cooling. 'This is plate tectonics 2.0' he said . The oceanic plates are thought to be shortening due to cooling, which causes relative motion inside the plate, Dr Kreemer said. The oceanic crust of the Pacific plate off the coast of California is moving 0.08 inches (two millimetres) to the south every year relative to the Pacific and Antarctic plate boundary. 'It may not sound like much, but it is significant considering that we can measure crustal motion with GPS within a fraction of a millimeter per year,' he said. 'Unfortunately, all existing GPS stations on Pacific islands are in the old part of the plate that is not expected nor shown to deform. 'New measurements will be needed within the young parts of the plate to confirm this study's predictions, either on very remote islands or through sensors on the ocean floor.' To reach their conclusion they used large-scale numerical modeling as well as GPS velocities from the largest GPS data-processing center in the world - the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno.","Study by US scientists suggests Earth's tectonic plates are malleable .

"A spacecraft called Gaia launched by Esa to map the stars in the Milky Way could be repurposed to find planets in the galaxy, say scientists. They say it could be used to find 70,000 worlds outside the solar system, including many that have previously been difficult to find. This would include huge Jupiter-sized worlds around dim stars - but might not include Earth-like habitable worlds. Researchers from Princeton University in New Jersey and Lund University in Sweden say Gaia (illustration shown) could find thousands of planets during its mission. Primary goal of the spacecraft is to map one billion stars in the Milky Way. But a 'by-product' could also be the discovery of planets . Researchers from Princeton University in New Jersey and Lund University in Sweden calculated that the observational satellite Gaia could detect as many as 21,000 exoplanets during its five-year mission . If extended to 10 years, Gaia could detect as many as 70,000 exoplanets, the researchers report. Exoplanets will be an important 'by-product' of Gaia's mission, first author Dr Michael Perryman of Princeton University said. Built and operated by Esa and launched in December 2013, Gaia will capture the motion, physical characteristics and distance from Earth - and one another - of roughly one billion objects, mostly stars, in the Milky Way galaxy with unprecedented precision. Gaia’s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way. It will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about one per cent of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home Galaxy to help answer questions about its origin and evolution. Repeatedly scanning the sky, Gaia will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years. In addition to positions and motions, Gaia will also measure key physical properties of each star, including its brightness, temperature and chemical composition. Eventually, the Gaia data archive will exceed a million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200,000 DVDs of data. The presence of an exoplanet will be determined by how its star 'wobbles' as a result of the planet's orbit around it. More important than the numbers of predicted discoveries are the kinds of planets that the researchers expect Gaia to detect, many of which - such as planets with multi-year orbits that pass directly, or transit, in front of their star as seen from Earth - are currently difficult to find. The satellite's instruments could reveal objects that are considered rare in the Milky Way, such as an estimated 25 to 50 Jupiter-sized planets that orbit faint, low-mass stars known as red dwarfs. Unique planets and systems - such as planets that orbit in the opposite direction of their companions - can inspire years of research according to Dr Perryman. 'It's not just about the numbers. Each of these planets will be conveying some very specific details, and many will be highly interesting in their own way,' Dr Perryman said. One of the main objectives of the Gaia mission is to establish the currently uncertain distance from Earth to various stars, which would allow a much better understanding of the properties of the stars and the planets orbiting them. This image shows the distances from Earth (centre) to the stars (black dots) of some exoplanets . The kinds of planets that the researchers expect Gaia to detect would include planets with multi-year orbits and others that are more difficult to detect via other methods. This would include Jupiter-sized worlds orbiting dim stars, but is unlikely to include many Earth-like planets (Earth-like Kepler 186f illustration shown) 'If you look at the planets that have been discovered until now, they occupy very specific regions of discovery space. 'Gaia will not only discover a whole list of planets, but in an area that has not been thoroughly explored so far.' Ultimately, a comprehensive census allows scientists to more accurately determine how many planets and planetary systems exist, the detailed properties of those planets, and how they are positioned throughout the galaxy. 'Our assessment will help prepare exoplanet researchers for what to expect from Gaia,' Dr Perryman added. 'We're going to be adding potentially 20,000 new planets in a completely new area of discovery space. It's anyone's guess how the field will develop as a result.' Princeton University and Lund University researchers project that the recently launched European satellite Gaia could discover tens of thousands of planets during its five-year mission. In this image, the colored portions indicate the number of observations Gaia would make of a particular part of the sky during its mission .","Researchers from Princeton University in New Jersey and Lund University in Sweden say Gaia could find thousands of planets during its mission .

"Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who has been publicly identified as having the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the United States, was reportedly a passenger on both Brussels Airlines and United Airlines flights before his arrival at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport. Details of Duncan's 28-hour trip from western Africa emerged Wednesday. He flew on two airlines, took three flights, and had lengthy airport layovers before reaching Texas on Sept. 20. Duncan left Monrovia, Liberia, on Sept. 19 aboard a Brussels Airlines jet to the Belgian capital, according to a Belgian official. A request for comment to the airline from MailOnline was not immediately answered. United Airlines said in a Wednesday statement 'The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has informed us that the patient said he flew part of his trip on United.' Scroll down for video . Passenger: Thomas Eric Duncan was reportedly on two United Airlines flights before he was admitted to a Dallas hospital . 'While the CDC states it is unnecessary for it or the airline to contact others who were on the patient’s flights, United is providing information about the flights United believes the patient took, based on information provided by the CDC,' the airline also said. 'We are ensuring our employees have this information and suggest that any customers who have concerns contact the experts at the CDC for further information.' The airline's statement said it believed the man was on board Flight 951 from Brussels, Belgium to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, and later was a passenger on Flight 822, which went from Washington Dulles to Dallas/Fort Worth International  Airport. The first reported case of Ebola in the United States is spooking airline investors and raising the prospect that some frightened travelers might stay home despite repeated reassurances from public-health experts. Flight plan: Thomas Eric Duncan reportedly arrived in Dallas after flying on two airlines and taking three flights . Still, federal officials say other passengers on the flights are at no risk of infection because the man had no symptoms at the time of his trip. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Duncan sought medical care Sept. 24 in Dallas. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, told The Associated Press that even though Duncan took several flights to reach the U.S., his lack of symptoms at the time made it 'extraordinarily unlikely' that he infected anyone else on the planes. Still, the incident spooked airline investors. Shares of United and other leading U.S. airline companies dropped 2.8 percent or more. Shares of European carriers fell by similar margins. Deadly: The Ebola virus has killed thousands in West Africa already . 'The fear is if this gets worse, it would affect people's travel behavior,' said Joseph DeNardi, an analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Health officials ""sound confident that they've got it under control. Hopefully they're right.' The CDC typically notifies an airline when it learns that an infectious person traveled on that carrier. The airline then turns over the flight manifest to CDC, and health officials notify other passengers while the airline deals with crew members. In this case, the CDC told United but not the public what flights the man took. In an interview Wednesday with the AP, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, suggested that doing so would divert public-health resources away from controlling an outbreak of the virus. He said the CDC was focused on finding and tracking anyone who came in contact with Duncan after he began showing symptoms. Public health officials have assured fliers that airports in Africa, Europe and the U.S. are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including screening passengers for fever. An outbreak of SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - crippled air travel in Asia in 2003. Michael Derchin, an analyst with CRT Capital Group, said it was too early to draw a comparison between one Ebola patient and the 2003 SARS outbreak. He noted that SARS is an airborne disease that health officials say is transmitted more easily than Ebola.","Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was reportedly a passenger on both Brussels Airlines and United Airlines flights .

"When petrol and diesel were relatively cheap, many of us were happy to drive cars that did only 20 miles to the gallon. But now petrol costs around £1.30 per litre — nearly £6 per gallon — the need for fuel-efficient cars is greater than ever. That is why the fuel economy of cars is such a selling point. And why manufacturers set such store by producing vehicles that are supposedly able to travel enormous distances on teaspoons of fuel. Claims are regularly made for cars that can go 80, or even 100, miles on a single gallon (4.5 litres). But how accurate are these Miles-Per-Gallon figures? The answer is not very accurate at all. In fact, the official MPG figures handed out as gospel by the car manufacturers are one of the biggest cons in motoring. Running on empty again? There could be a reason - as miles per gallon figures are rarely as advertised . Last week, research by Emissions Analytics, a vehicle data company based in the UK, found that cars on average get 18 per cent fewer miles per gallon than is advertised. And that’s just the average. The really bad news is that if you have a small car with an engine size of less than one litre, then your fuel economy is a staggering 36 per cent lower than the manufacturers’ claims. Most small cars claim to travel 60mpg, but the true figure is just under 39mpg. As the engine sizes get bigger, the discrepancy lessens. With cars of engines of two to three litres, the difference is around 15 per cent, which is still significant. But that does mean if you drive a luxury ‘gas-guzzler’, the gap between its supposed and actual fuel economy is likely to be much less than if you’re driving a cheap supermini. Not only that, on average the actual number of miles per gallon your car will achieve will be greater if the engine size is between two and three litres than if it is under one litre. The great MPG swindle becomes even more alarming when you look at how these figures have an impact upon your wallet. Let’s say you are the proud owner of a Toyota Yaris Hatchback Hybrid, which has an official MPG of 76.3 and you drive 10,000 miles per year, mainly around town, doing the shopping and the school run. Fuelling cynicism: One model of the Fiat 500 boasted 58.9mpg, but the reality in urban driving was 35.5 . Ford Focus Hatchback 1.6 . Claimed MPG: 47.1 . True MPG: 27.4 . Claimed fuel cost per annum: £1,253.08 . Actual fuel cost: £2,289.64 . Difference: £1,036.56 . BMW 3 Series Diesel Saloon 320d . Claimed MPG: 68.9 . True MPG: 40.2 . Claimed fuel cost per annum: £856 . Actual fuel cost: £1,560.60 . Difference: £704.60 . Fiat 500 Hatchback, 1.2 . Claimed MPG: 58.9 . True MPG: 35.5 . Claimed fuel cost per annum: £1,002 . Actual fuel cost: £1,767.21 . Difference: £765.21 . Volkswagen Polo Hatchback 1.4 SE . Claimed MPG: 47.9 . True MPG: 22.9 . Claimed fuel cost per annum: £1,232.15 . Actual fuel cost: £2,739.57 . Difference: £1,507.42 . Vauxhall Corsa Hatchback 1.2 . Claimed MPG: 55.4 . True MPG: 35.2 . Claimed fuel cost per annum: £1,065.34 . Actual fuel cost: £1,782.27 . Difference: £716.93 . Based on 10,000 miles a year urban driving . Using the official fuel economy figures — and, crucially, that may well be the main reason you bought the car — then you would expect to be using around 600 litres of fuel per year, costing around £800. However, the true MPG for that model being driven around town is 47.7mpg, which means that your real fuel cost will be £1,260 — an extra £460. So why are there such discrepancies, and how do car manufacturers get away with it? The heart of the deceit lies in the European Union’s vehicle testing centres. For the past 40 years, the EU has subjected all makes of car to the New European Driving Cycle test, or NEDC for short. One drawback with the NEDC is that it is anything but new — in fact, it is hopelessly out of date. ‘There are two major problems with the test,’ says Nick Molden of Emissions Analytics. ‘First, it is too gentle on cars and doesn’t replicate the real world. And secondly, there are too many grey areas in the way the tests can be conducted — areas that manufacturers are all too willing to exploit in a perfectly legal manner.’ The NEDC is indeed unlike the type of driving most of us are used to. The test is split into different parts. In the ‘Urban Drive Cycle’, during which the car reaches 31mph on four separate occasions, manufacturers are given a full 26 seconds to reach that speed. Mr Molden says this is utterly unrealistic — most of us reach that speed within five seconds. ‘If you try accelerating that slowly in a real situation, it’s almost physically impossible,’ he explains. During the fifth and final part of the test — the ‘Extra-Urban Cycle’ — the car reaches 120 kilometres per hour, or 74mph. But it only has to remain at that speed for a few seconds. The point is that most people drive for considerably longer than a few seconds at around 70mph when they are on a dual carriageway or motorway. To make matters still more absurd, the car is allowed to be stationary for a fifth of the entire length of test even though few of us, even in traffic jams, spend so long with the engine idling. The test therefore gives a skewed picture of a car’s true fuel economy in everyday driving conditions. It gets even worse. Astonishingly, manufacturers are allowed to carry out all sorts of tricks to boost their cars’ performance, some of which beggar belief. In order to improve aerodynamics, manufacturers are permitted by the EU to tape up all the cracks around the doors and windows. This reduces drag and makes the car more fuel efficient than in real life. Then aerodynamic tests — which measure the ‘inertia’ of the car — are carried out on a normal outside test track. But a special ‘rolling road’ is used in the MPG tests under lab conditions, and its rollers are adjusted to take account of the car’s ‘inertia’ measurements. Driven mad: One Vauxhall Corsa model boasts 55.4 miles to the gallon - reality proved it a more modest 35.2 . Brake pads are minutely adjusted in order to remove the slightest modicum of resistance on the wheels — resistance that is permanently there on a normal car. According to a devastating report published by the Brussels-based pressure group, Transport & Environment, the manufacturers also use special lubricants to ensure that engines run more efficiently than they would in normal use. In addition, during most tests the alternator, which recharges the battery while the engine is running, is disconnected so the car uses less energy than in real life. The engine is also specially tuned, the car is kept in fifth gear for much of the test and the weight of the car is kept to a minimum. Extras such as air conditioning and radios are removed, and even the nearside wing mirror is taken off. But that’s not the end of the trickery. According to the EU regulations, the test centres must be kept at an ambient temperature of 20c to 30c. As cars run more efficiently in high temperatures, the centres are kept at — you guessed it — 29c. This is farcical, as the average temperature in the EU is below 10 degrees. It also ignores the fact that for many people in Europe, cars are often run at low temperatures for several minutes during those cold starts in the winter. The true MPG for the Toyota Yaris Hatchback Hybrid, similar to the car pictured, being driven around town is 47.7mpg, which means that your real fuel cost will be £1,260 — an extra £460 on the advertised efficiency . And there’s another bizarre anomaly with the test centres, which almost seems impossible to believe. The regulations stipulate that no slope on the test track can exceed a gradient of 1.5 per cent, so inevitably the motor manufacturers have all ensured the test tracks have this exact gradient built in. This means that the cars are tested for fuel efficiency as they drive . . . downhill! In the eyes of transport experts, the organisation most to blame for this ridiculous system is the EU, which oversees a system that has no bearing on the real world. Malcolm Fergusson, the principal author of the Transport & Environment report, is damning. ‘Lax testing procedures are allowing car makers to manipulate the official tests,’ he writes. And it’s not just the fuel economy figures that are being fudged, he says, but also the levels of carbon dioxide emissions. The system is essentially a joke, and the victims are the consumers, who are conned into buying cars with official figures that are essentially lies. Although a new system is being promised, that is not due for another six years, perhaps longer. For the time being, car buyers need to keep a hawk eye on the real figures — and one place to find them is on the site whatcar.com/truempg, which carries data on 500 cars from Emissions Analytics. The difference they show between the claim and the reality should make car manufacturers hang their heads in shame. But don’t hold your breath.","Regulations allow array of tricks to distance test centres from real life .

'She loved it' said designer Caitline Holstock (pictured left) of Miss Australia Tegan Martin (pictured right) A drawing of the elaborate design which didn't poll as well as the vote with 60% saying they 'hate it' while only 40% said they 'love it' 'Words cannot describe how I'm feeling, so exciting, such an amazing opportunity.' Caitlin said she drew her inspiration back to Australia's indigenous heritage, Australia's oldest heritage to create something with earth colours and blue skies. She also used an indigenous print on the skirt which derived from a King William Barak painting in the 1800s after seeking permission from his brother, an aboriginal elder and close family friend. Caitlin says in previous years some of the costumes have been a little crazy but has relished the idea that the public has been allowed to vote saying it just shows Aussies are behind the design that won. The other finalists : Lorelee Prentice design (pictured left) and Christopher Ditas ensemble (pictured right) The Steve Irwin inspired costume was another finalist by designer Fred Diak . The Dream time design received mixed reactions on social media, despite being voted the best of the finalists . 'This looks ridiculous!' said one comment. There was a range of different opinions on the design on social media . 'I love the idea, it is about Australia, encapsulating and showing to the world. You want Australia to be behind it,' she said. 'Giving the public the chance to vote just means they are behind the idea, more accepting of it.' The Miss Universe Australia facebook page has definitely shown some of the mixed reactions to the widely colourful ensemble. One user made a comment clearly stating here disgust at the design. 'This costume made me spit my coffee all over the tv laughing so hard.. This costume is more suited to Mardi Gras rather than a Miss Universe pagent. Why do we as Australians have to be so tacky when designing these things..??' Another stated 'No Yuck' while some didn't really understand what the creation was about, saying if she didn't understand, how would the rest of the world. Another facebook post said it 'looked ridiculous, I wish there was an unlike button.' A floral draping number by Christoper Ditas channels corrugated iron . Miss Universe Australia 2008 Laura Dundovic (pictured left) showcases the Australian National Costume designed by Jayson Brunsdon and Erin McNaught (pictured right) in a crocodile inspired number . Despite some 'haters' the Dream time sunset design by Caitlin Holstock received plenty of support . This facebook user loved the design saying 'it totally represents Australia' But with all the 'haters' there has been plenty of supporters. 2004 Miss Australia Jennifer Hawkins in a grey number . 'I liked all of this year's designs. They all looked the part and captured Australia,' wrote one user. While another labelled it inspiring, another picked it as her own favourite design, 'the huge sunset and aboriginal skirt stood out!' And while it seems to have topped the list in the voting stakes, a recent poll by the Sydney Morning Herald has shown not all Aussies were so thrilled about the creation. How do you rate the winning Miss Universe national costume? 60 per cent said 'hate it' while only 40 per cent said 'love it'. But Caitlin has brushed off some opinions and says it won't be to everyone's taste. 'People have to remember that it's a costume, not a gown, it does have to be out there in order to compete in internationals, it has to be extreme,' she said. 'I researched looks in the past decade of the countries that won and I drew inspiration from there as I wanted to compete on an international level.' The aspiring fashion designer is also pretty chuffed that Miss Australia herself, Tegan Martin loves the design and can't wait to wear it. 'She loved it, she wanted to be sexy and very Australian, very out there, she loved the idea of the Victoria Secret looking wings.' While Australia hasn't come close to winning the national costume section in the past, Caitlin is optimistic she's in with a chance. 'I hope it's up there with the top designs, I feel I've given myself a chance from the research.' And if she had to pick another winner if her design wasn't voted as the top pick, she's still sitting on the fence. 'I could not pick a favourite, voting was really nerve wracking and had such high stands, they were all great,' she said.

Caitlin Holstock (pictured) with her design that has had mixed reactions on social media . The winning costume was chosen by a public vote from four finalists in the competition that was run by Elucent Skincare. The three other top designs also featured Australian icons like the Sydney Opera House, national flowers and corrugated iron. Christopher Ditas created the corrugated iron inspired design, a floral draping number with shiny blue material.

"Motorists who need disabled parking spaces are finding it increasingly difficult to find themselves a car park as able-bodied people continue to illegally misuse the spots. But some relief may be around the corner with one of Australia's state transport ministers  announcing he's considered deducting points from the driver's licences of those who park in disabled spots without a valid permit. Community and disability groups have welcomed the proposed changes with members taking to social media to show their support. Scroll down for video . Badly behaved drivers who park illegally in disabled spots could soon lose demerit points off their licence . The Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame, which regularly 'shames' drivers parking in disabled spots, is one of the groups which had been pushing for a crackdown. Pictures that regularly pop up on the page include cars without a permit in them or people parked across a number of disabled spaces. Often members take to the social media group to voice concerns about confrontations they had with other motorists when they approached them about parking illegally. The Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame, who regularly out able-bodied drivers illegally using disabled spots, have supported the move . Vehicles taking up more than one space such as this shocking park make regular appearances on the page . Recent features on the page include a crane, skip rubbish bin and a car with a huge trailer and an array of other vehicles parked in disabled spaces, without having a permit. Other badly behaved drivers include a red vehicle parked across one and a half disabled parking spaces outside of a bottle shop, and the driver of a blue four-wheel drive who left their car diagonally across two spaces. On Monday NSW Minister for Roads and Freight Duncan Gay told Daily Mail Australia he is looking at deducting demerit points from drivers if they park in disabled parking spots without a permit. The page also shames drivers who are unashamedly doing the wrong thing . Members are encouraged to take and post photographs of drivers in the wrong . NSW Minister for Roads and Freight Duncan Gay is set to introduce deductions of demerit points for drivers who illegally use disabled parking spots . Minister Gay described able-bodied drivers who abuse disabled carparks as 'low-lifes' and the misuse of the spots as 'sick behaviour'. 'Able bodied people who steal disabled car parks from people who genuinely need them are lowlifes, plain and simple,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have utmost sympathy for the people who are disadvantaged by this sick behaviour.' This move has been welcomed by the Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame group . People are now calling for the same action to be brought in across Australia, and not just NSW . Mr Gay described those who misuse these parking spots as 'love-lifes' 'I’ve asked Roads and Maritime Services to look at introducing demerit point penalties for people caught parking illegally in disabled car parks. 'Just because you can afford to pay a fine doesn't give you the right to disadvantage the needs of disabled people in our community,' Minister Gay added. The Daily Telegraph reported that able-bodied motorists could face fines of up to $623 for the misuse of a permit. Other drivers could be forking out $519 if they're caught out parking in a disabled spot without an official mobility parking scheme permit.","Some Australians who misuse disabled parking spots could soon lose points off their licence .

"Fancy dress firms have come under fire for selling Halloween  outfits labelled as 'skitzo' and 'psycho ward', with a government minister saying the 'horrendous' costumes 'demonise' people with mental health problems. Jokers' Masquerade's website, www.joke.co.uk, is selling a £12.45 'Adult Skitzo Costume', consisting of an orange jumpsuit with 'a set of black vinyl shackles and belt, plus a restraining face mask to complete the look'. It also offers a £20.99 'Maximum Restraint Halloween Costume' consisting of a straightjacket and a mask similar to that worn by Anthony Hopkins when he played cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs. The 'horrendous' costumes have been criticised for 'demonising' people with mental health problems . The tasteless outfits, which can also be found on the 'Fun World' and 'Simply fancy dress' sites, have been slammed by mental health campaigners. Liberal Democrat Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb will give a speech today urging retailers not to 'demonise' people with mental health problems by selling mocking party outfits. Mr Lamb is due to tell the National Child and Adult Services conference in Manchester: 'For me it is horrendous that, this Halloween, a young person experiencing a mental health crisis could easily come across someone in a 'psycho ward' or 'schizo patient' costume - complete with handcuffs and ripped restraints - as much as they could see someone in a Dracula costume. 'This Halloween culture is dangerous. It conditions all of us to fear mental illness - to see people as 'psychos', or 'schizos' or 'freaks'. It makes us believe that mental illness is something other worldly. 'We have to tackle this damaging stigma which prevents young people from seeking help when they need it, or talking about any problems they might be having. 'Everyone should be able to enjoy Halloween but I urge all retailers to behave more responsibly - don't demonise mental illness.' The £20.99 'Maximum Restraint Halloween Costume' consists of a straightjacket and a mask similar to that worn by Anthony Hopkins when he played cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs . A petition has been launched on Change.org calling on sites such as Jokers' Masquerade to remove the costumes from their site. The petition organiser, Rebecca Holdcroft from Leeds, wrote: 'This is offensive, stigmatising and extremely damaging not only to public perception of mental illness, but also the people affected by it. It's not right, and it should stop.' Elsewhere, John Lawlor, chief executive of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW), said people would never wear a 'cancer patient' Halloween outfit, and so they should not treat mental health issues so flippantly. Last year, supermarkets Asda and Tesco were slammed for selling Halloween costumes which were said to have caused offence. Asda withdrew its 'mental patient fancy dress costume' and Tesco took its 'psycho ward' outfit off the shelves. In a blog written after Mr Lamb's criticism last week, Jokers' Masquerade's Mike Dawson said the company was disappointed to have been singled out over the 'Skitzo' outfit which is also on sale on other websites and that it had withdrawn costumes in the past, including one of Jimmy Savile. He added that the company did not intend to offend people but wanted customers to be able to make a choice themselves, saying: 'We will not be forced into knee-jerk decisions, but are happy to receive constructive criticism. 'These past days, we have listened to the mental health proponents and made various edits to criticised products. This has included renaming product titles, descriptions and category pages to dilute this sensitive area for some.' Promotions staff and bar tenders at Bar Risa were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear . An advert declared that the local area had been 'infected' by the deadly disease during the themed night . In a separate controversy, Bar Risa in Birmingham admitted it had made 'a huge error' by staging an Ebola-themed Halloween party on Wednesday night. An advert declared that the local area had been 'infected' by the deadly disease and that the World Health Organisation (WHO) wanted students to go to the bar for 'decontamination and quarantine'. The bar  was decked out for the occasion with fake bio-hazard tape reading 'Quarantine' and signs in red paint outside the club told revellers they were in a 'Safe zone'. Promotions staff and bar tenders were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear and party-goers, many dressed as zombies, had to walk through a 'decontamination tunnel' to gain access. The bad-taste party  comes as the WHO confirmed that nearly 5,000 people have died from Ebola, the fatal disease which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. MailOnline reported on Sunday how websites and bars appeared to be cashing in on the Ebola crisis by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers  treating those who are infected. The costume appeared on the Brands On Sale website, and a description said: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.' Elsewhere, Asda has also been criticised for selling bloodstained cheerleader and American football player costumes. Child-sized blue and white cheerleader and American football uniforms featuring bloodstains and extruding bones, muscle and cartilage, 'sure to be scaring everyone at those Halloween parties' are being sold on its website and in its stores. A spokesman for Asda denied the bloodstains represented bullet holes, saying: 'We appreciate that it isn’t for everyone but the majority of our customers love dressing up at Halloween, especially in spooky or gory costumes which inevitably can include fake blood.'","Jokers' Masquerade's website is selling an 'Adult Skitzo Costume' and a 'Maximum Restraint Halloween Costume'

"Eric Trump's bride-to-be Lara Yunaska doesn't need to buy a Halloween costume this year, thanks to her scary looking wrist injury. The 31-year-old CBS producer posted a picture today of the painful stitches in her arm, the result of the horse riding accident she got into last week. 'Happy Halloween. I have a built-in costume this year!  #FrankensteinArm,' she captioned the photo taken at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where she was presumably having her injury checked out by doctors. Frankenstein arm: Eric Trump's bride-to-be Lara Yunaska posted a picture today of the painful looking stitches in her arm, a result of a horse riding accident she got into last week . The bride-to-be broke both her wrists in a riding accident last Thursday, just two weeks before her November 8 wedding to the son of billionaire businessman Donald Trump. Since then, she has posted a handful of understandably morose photos of her bandaged wrists to Instagram, captioning one: 'Wedding countdown: 2 weeks and 2 casts to go! #HopeImAFastHealer.' This is an optimistic outlook, since a broken wrist typically takes between six and eight weeks to heal; so with her wedding going ahead as planned, she'll be wearing more white than she bargained for. Lara first announced the injury last Thursday with a selfie from her bed, captioned: 'There's no place like home. Also, a #selfie w two broken wrists is quite a task. #imexhausted.' Downcast: Lara , 31 ,both both her wrists in a riding accident last Thursday, just two weeks before her November 8 wedding to the son Donald Trump . Brave face: Lara captioned this image on Saturday, 'Such a lovely day for a walk! Thanks to my dexterous helpers, @torryhixon and #CharlieDog' Passion: Despite her painful fall, Lara has stated that it won't stop her from getting back on a horse. 'There are inherent risks that we all take in life. When you truly love something, it's worth it,' she wrote . But despite her painful fall, Lara has stated that it won't stop her from getting back on a horse. 'There are inherent risks that we all take in life. When you truly love something, it's worth it,' she wrote. 'I wouldn't take back one day of riding - stuff happens. I will ride again and it will be better than ever. Most importantly, I still get to marry the love of my life on Nov 8th.' Lara and Eric, 30, announced their engagement last July and over the summer, revealed that the wedding would take place at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 8. Soon-to-be wed: Lara (pictured last month with fiance Eric Trump and their dog Charlie) is a former personal trainer and now associate producer for Inside Edition . Engaged: Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara last July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York . Eric's father Donald told MailOnline on Wednesday that 'it's going to be interesting' for Lara to fit her casts into her dress at the wedding. 'She'll either disguise it, or else she'll hold it up proudly. That'll be interesting, right?' he said. Trump added that even though her wrists are injured, it won't have any effect on exchange of rings. 'At least her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. The real estate mogul added that what matters most is that they love each other. 'It's too bad,' he said of the accident. 'But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.' Fall wedding: Over the summer, it was revealed that the wedding would take place at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida (pictured) on November 8 . The couple, who have been together for six years, will begin the wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday November 7, followed by the black-tie ceremony on Saturday and a brunch on Sunday. Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara last July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York. Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair, washboard abs and permanent tan. After graduating from North Carolina State University, she attended the French Culinary Institute where she obtained a degree in Pastry Arts.","Lara Yanaska broke both her wrists in a riding accident just two weeks before her November 8 wedding to fiancé Eric Trump, son of billionaire businessman Donald Trump .

"A new book alleges that former President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary have compiled a so-called 'enemies list' of fellow Democrats who didn't endorse Hillary in the 2008 presidential primary, but instead backed her main rival, then-Senator Barack Obama. According to the book, titled HRC - the initials of Hillary Rodham Clinton - she and her husband created 'a special circle of Clinton hell...for people who had endorsed [President] Obama.' The book claims that after the 2008 primary, the Clintons had an aide compile a list of everyone they felt betrayed the former first lady. Enemies: According to a new book, Bill and Hillary Clinton have created an 'enemies list' for Hillary's potential 2016 presidential campaign . Bitter: The Clintons appear to still be a little bitter that President Obama beat Hillary in the 2008 Democratic primary . 'She and Bill would have at their fingertips all the information needed . to make a quick decision,' the authors reported. 'So that friends could . be rewarded and enemies punished.' The book is written by Politico's former White House Bureau Chief Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes - who often is criticized as being a Fourth Estate shill for the Obama administration. According to the book, those who provided Clinton with the most help during the 2008 Democratic primary were rated a '1' in the Clintons' rating system. Those who supported Obama - or committed other acts of political treason - received a rating of '7.' Secretary of State John Kerry, who supported President Obama in the primary, received a '7' rating, according to the New York Post. According to the book, Clinton staffers would often 'joke about the fates of the folks they felt had betrayed them.' Scorned: The Clintons loathe former Senator Ted Kennedy after he gave Obama his endorsement just days before Super Tuesday in the 2008 primary . Ratings: On the Clintons' turncoat 'ratings' system, Secretary of State John Kerry scored a '7' - the worst possible rating . 'Bill Richardson: investigated; John Edwards: disgraced by scandal; . Chris Dodd: stepped down; . . . Ted Kennedy: dead,' an aide once joked, the book claims. Speaking of Kennedy, the book claims the longtime Massachusetts senator 'had slashed Hillary worst of all, delivering a pivotal endorsement . speech for Obama just before the Super Tuesday primaries [in 2008] that . cast her as yesterday’s news and Obama as the rightful heir to Camelot,' the authors wrote. 'Bill Clinton had pleaded with Kennedy to hold off, . but to no avail.' The book claims that the Clinton's enemies list was started in 2008 after Hillary lost the primary to Obama. The planning stages for a potential 2016 candidacy for Hillary gained more steam in 2012 when Obama struggled to beat Mitt Romney in the general election. According to the book, Bill Clinton offered letters of recommendation and political endorsements to those he feels could help his wife win the White House in 2016. He also used it to punish those who supported Obama in the past. According to the Post, Clinton backed Democratic New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell in a primary against Congressman Steve Rothman after the two representatives' districts had been merged into one. Rothman was an early Obama supporter in the 2008 primary, and apparently had drawn the ire of the Clinton camp - with Bill's backing, Pascrell easily defeated Rothman. Rival: Bill Clinton refused to appear with Senator Elizabeth Warren because she could be a threat to Hillary winning in 2016 . The book claims that the Clintons tried to get Pennsylvania Congressman Jason Altmire to support Hillary's campaign in 2008. Altmire, however, endorsed Obama. In 2012, when Altmire was in a primary battle with opponent Mark Critz, Bill Clinton backed Critz, who went on to win the primary. When Clinton did what previously was unthinkable - campaign for Obama in 2012 - the book claims he went out of this way to make sure he did nothing to hurt his wife's chances in 2016. According to the book, Obama asked Bill Clinton to appear with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. He declined, the book claims, because Warren was viewed as a potential Hillary opponent in a 2016 primary.","A new book alleges that the Clintons' enemies list includes John Kerry and Elizabeth Warren .

"Nasa's Curiosity rover has spotted a unique round rock on the red planet. The perfectly spherical formation was found close to another rock resembling a traffic light. However, Nasa claims that rather than evidence of Martian sporting achievement, the 1cm sphere actually shows off a unique weather effect on Mars. Scroll down for video . Anyone fancy a kickaround? An almost perfectly round rock on the Martian surface (shown). Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter . The discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the Martian surface (shown). Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter . Nasa said it was probably an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter. Within the newly forming sedimentary rock on Mars, pores are inevitably created and minerals seep into those pores, gradually building up an erosion-resistant mass. Over time, the soft sedimentary rock is eroded away, leaving a perfectly spherical mass. According to MSL scientists based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., the ball isn't as big as it looks and isapproximately one centimeter wide. Nasa said it was probably an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter, according to Discovery News. Other examples of concretions have been found on the Martian surface before. For example, the tiny haematite concretions, or 'blueberries', observed by Mars rover Opportunity in 2004. The 'ball' is the latest in a long line of mystery spots on Mars. Last week a 'traffic light' was spotted. In the image, a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are stacked on top of each other. They bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on Earth. But it's highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation. The discovery of Martian clusters, known as 'blueberries', a decade ago provided some of the first evidence of liquid water on the red planet. This incredible close up, taken by the Mars Rover Opportunity, reveals these spheres embedded in Martian rock like blueberries in a muffin. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The image was shot from the six-foot (1.8 metre) high, left-hand side mast cam on the Curiosity Rover. It was the 753rd day the rover has been exploring the red planet. The rock was spotted in the image by space video journalist Joe White from Bristol who runs a YouTube channel called ArtAlienTV. 'I saw this one and I thought 'hang on, that looks a bit strange'. I think it looks like a traffic light. 'It is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference, but I would estimate it was about 12 inches [30.5cm]. 'I posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole.' Curiosity is currently at the base of Mount Sharp, which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago. The Curiosity rover has spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on Mars (shown in the red ring in this image). Washington-based Nasa is yet to comment on the latest discovery. The finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on Mars can be . The 'traffic lights' (left) were spotted by Curiosity (right) on its way to the base of Mount Sharp, a geologically fascinating region that could explain how Mars lost its wet and habitable environment. Other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole . The area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of Mars. And, scientists hope the region might reveal how and why Mars lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment, with water flowing on its surface. This, in turn, may provide answers on the future of Earth. Yesterday India's first mission to Mars, the ISRO's Mars Orbiter, arrived at Mars and released its first image (shown) of the red planet's surface. 'Howdy @MarsCuriosity? Keep in touch. I'll be around' the team for the orbiter tweeted on its arrival .","The Curiosity rover has spotted a 1cm rock that looks like a ball .

"A truck was bombed and exploded outside Colorado City, Arizona, last weekend. No one was injured in the recent blast, but Shane Stubbs, who used the vehicle for farm work, suspects it was part of ongoing harassment he says his family has faced since leaving the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a religious sect connected to imprisoned former leader Warren Jeffs. 'I don't know if it's FLDS trying to get back at us in some way or just kids monkeying around,' Stubbs told the Associated Press Friday. 'I'm thinking it's one of those two things.' Efforts from the Associated Press to reach church leaders for comment were unsuccessful. The sect broke away from the mainstream Mormon Church when it disavowed polygamy more than 100 years ago. The church is known for its practice of polygamy and multiple women have come forward, saying they were married as  young girls to adult men and endured abuse. FDLS is also known for its incarcerated leader Warren Jeffs. Jeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas after convictions on child sex and bigamy charges. Former FLDS members who live in the community and have family members who remain followers say he maintains control of the group from behind bars. Bombing: David Stubbs' truck was bombed and exploded last weekend . Search: A spokesman for the Mohave County Sheriff's Office said there are no suspects at this time and there were no eye witnesses to the bombing . Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) found what 'looks like some sort of commercial explosive,' spokesman Tom Mangan told MailOnline, citing examples like dynamite or a cast booster. Mangan said ATF investigators found an 'explosive engine compartment in front of the motor' and that samples have been sent to a lab for further testing. There were no injuries during the explosion that destroyed the Dodge Ram, Mangan said. Mangan directed further questions on the investigation to the Mohave County Sheriff's Office. 'Right now we have no suspects,' Mohave County Sheriff's Office Trish Carter told MailOnline. She said there were no eyewitnesses to the bombing. 'This is not the USA. This is the Taliban,' Sally Stubbs said of the bombing to AZFamily.com. Who did this? Stubbs had previously left the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) Cult leader: FDLS is known for its incarcerated leader Warren Jeffs, who  has been convicted of child sexual assault charges . Andrew Chatwin, who filmed the damaged truck, told KUTV 'The FLDS do not like [Stubbs]. They've destroyed his crops [...] when he was leasing the land from Bruce Wisan.' 'They had that shooting at the Mohave building, now this truck being blown up,' Chatwin also said. 'These are messages, they're hate messages' from FLDS, Chatwin told the affiliate station. Earlier this month, a bullet went through a Mohave County victims advocate's office window, St. George News reported. Area residents who aren't members of the FLDS have told authorities they have been targets of discrimination. A family that sued Colorado City and the neighboring Utah community of Hildale over a denied household water connection claimed the denial was made for religious reasons. The case was settled this year for an undisclosed amount after an Arizona jury awarded the family $5.2 million on its claims. In a separate lawsuit, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged the border towns have supported a campaign of intimidation against those outside of the FLDS, denying them housing and municipal services. Attorneys for the towns have denied wrongdoing. Shane Stubbs told the Associated Press some of his family's problems come from an ongoing land dispute. He said part of his wheat and alfalfa farm belongs to a trust fund that used to be run by the FLDS but has been in control of state of Utah for nearly a decade. The family leases the land from the court-appointed accountant who oversees $100 million in homes and property in the border communities in the trust, Stubbs said. The truck was sitting on this disputed section with a flat tire that hadn't been repaired, he said. 'They've caused us all kinds of problems,' Stubbs said. 'They plowed up our wheat. They've run the cows and their sheep on their field.' Attorneys who have represented the FLDS in legal matters have said the church hasn't had a spokesperson in years. The church has no listed headquarters, and members are instructed not to speak with outsiders. Back in June, Tom Horne, Arizona's Attorney General, said in a press release 'The disbandment of the Colorado City/Hildale Marshal’s Office is necessary and appropriate because this police department has operated for decades, and continues to operate, as the de facto law enforcement arm of the FLDS Church. We have introduced legislation for the past three years to transfer law enforcement to the Mohave County sheriff and unfortunately it has failed to pass.' 'Testimony in support of this legislation shows that when girls have tried to escape from the town, the Marshalls forced them back, and committed many other injustices,' he added. 'When the legislation failed, I found $400,000 per year to transfer to the Mohave County sheriff, to have at least one sheriff in Colorado City. As a result, girls have escaped who said they couldn’t have without the sheriff there. 'My office will not tolerate corrupt law enforcement agencies in this State, and the disbandment of what is perhaps the most corrupt police department in the history of this State will go a long way toward protecting the public from further discrimination and harm in these communities,' Horne also said.","David Stubbs' truck exploded outside Colorado City, Arizona, last weekend .

"British extremists in Iraq and Syria could be charged with treason if they try to return home, MPs were told yesterday. Ministers have discussed using the 660-year-old offence, which carried the death penalty until 1998. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told the Commons that video footage of fanatics swearing allegiance to Islamic State provided potential evidence that could be used in prosecutions under the Treason Act of 1351. Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the Government had discussed trying ISIS fighters for treason . The last person to be tried for treason was the Nazi propagandist Lord Haw Haw, who was hanged in 1946. The offence was never used against members of the IRA despite its attacks on the British state during the Troubles. But the offence could be used once again, amid reports that more than 200 suspected extremists have already been arrested in Britain this year – equal to about one a day. Mr Hammond said ministers had held talks to consider reviving treason – broadly, any attempt to harm or overthrow the sovereign or the Government – under which it is an offence to swear allegiance to enemies of the Crown. The issue was raised yesterday in the Commons by the Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who called for the offence to be used against jihadists who were fighting British forces and carrying out beheadings of British aid workers. ‘Their actions are treachery against Her Majesty, and aiding and abetting enemies of Her Majesty is one of the greatest offences a British citizen can commit,’ he said. Jihadists Abu Abdullah al-Britani (right) - speaking in a southern English accent - appeared a video today in which he said ISIS fighters were looking forward to slaughtering any Western ground troops sent to the region . Ibrahim Kamara, 19, also known as Khalil al-Britani, from Brighton, was reportedly killed in U.S. air strikes . William Joyce was the last person executed in Britain for high treason. Known as Lord Haw-Haw, Joyce was a notorious broadcaster of Nazi propaganda to the UK during the Second World War. His announcement 'Germany calling, Germany calling' was a familiar sound across the airwaves, introducing threats and misinformation that he broadcast from his Hamburg base. In 1945, Joyce was captured and returned to Britain, where he was later hanged. Mr Hammond said he would raise the issue with Home Secretary Theresa May, adding: ‘We have had a discussion about the allegiance question. We have seen people declaring that they have sworn personal allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. That does raise questions about their loyalty and allegiance to this country and about whether the offence of treason could have been committed.’ Supporters of the idea believe it would act as a deterrent to so-called ‘gap-year jihadists’ attracted by the idea of fighting in Syria, as well as taking dangerous individuals off the streets. At least 500 young British Muslims are thought to have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria, of which about half of whom have returned to the UK. Intelligence experts believe returning jihadists now pose a grave terrorist threat to Britain. The Metropolitan Police’s counter terrorism chief said detectives were now mounting an ‘exceptionally high’ number of operations against plots inspired by terrorism overseas. Reports yesterday claimed that at least 24 British jihadists have now been killed fighting with Islamic State and other terror groups in the region. Although treason no longer carries the death penalty and there have been no prosecutions for almost 70 years, anyone convicted could still face life behind bars. The key section that could apply to British jihadists relates to the requirement of British subjects to give allegiance to the Monarch. The offence has carried an automatic death sentence for most of its history – and for centuries male traitors were hanged, drawn and quartered while women were burned to death. The death penalty was dropped in 1998 to accord with European human rights laws. David Cameron hinted at the possibility of treason prosecutions in his speech to the Conservative Party conference earlier this month, calling jihadists ‘an enemy of the UK’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, yesterday indicated that the prospect of treason charges could help act as a deterrent. He told Mr Hammond: ‘All the evidence is that the more that die, the more that want to go and fight.’ Ministers last considered reviving the treason laws almost a decade ago to deal with the threats posed by Islamic hate preachers. But the idea was eventually shelved. Suspected extremists are being arrested at the rate of nearly one a day, Britain’s counter terrorism chief revealed last night. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police are mounting an ‘exceptionally high’ number of operations to thwart terror plots inspired by groups in Syria and Iraq. He revealed the ‘volume, range and pace’ of work to tackle terrorism has undergone a ‘step change’. Police are foiling ‘several attack plots a year’ ranging from spontaneous attacks by individuals to ‘more complex conspiracies’. So far this year, Scotland Yard has already made 218 arrests for terrorist-related offences. Mr Rowley said officers were battling to shut down the flood of online extremist propaganda. But he also praised the ‘dozens’ of families who had helped police with details about love ones abroad. ‘It is only through courageous action like that that we can help,’ he said.","Hammond said ministers discussed  trying returning jihadists for treachery .

"Yes and No campaigners voted in 'incredible' numbers  - pushing turnout to the highest-ever recorded level. Some 84.6 per cent of Scots exercised their right to vote at polling stations across the country. This was higher than any election in the United Kingdom since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1918. Scroll down for video . A record 84.6 per cent of Scots took part in yesterday's independence referendum, with almost four million votes cast . Alistair Darling (left) and Alex Salmond (right) celebrated the level of participation in the referendum . Politicians said the turnout was a 'triumph of the democratic process' and showed that people would vote if they believed there was something worth voting for and that their efforts made a difference. The previous highest UK turnout was 83.9 per cent in the 1950 general election, when Clement Atlee's Labour Party beat Winston Churchill's Conservatives for the second time. In Scotland, the previous record was 81.2 per cent in the 1951 election, when the result was reversed. But turnouts in recent general elections - and Scottish Holyrood elections - have been much, much lower. The last Westminster election, in 2010, saw a turnout of just 65.1 per cent per cent; while the 2011 Scottish Parliament election saw Alex Salmond gain a majority on a turnout of only 50.4 per cent. However, in the historic referendum battle, a total of 3,619,915 people voted Yes or No - a turnout of 84.59 per cent. A total of 4,285,323 people were registered to vote, including 16- and 17-year-olds for the first time. Turnout reached 91 per cent in East Dunbartonshire, 90.4 per cent in East Renfewshire and 90.1 per cent in Stirling. But turnout was lower in 'yes' areas such as Glasgow (75 per cent) and Dundee (78.8 per cent). Mr Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said the turnout was 'one of the highest in the democratic world for any election or any referendum in history'. 'This has been a triumph for the democratic process and for participation in politics,' he said. The previous highest UK turnout was 83.9 per cent in the 1950 general election, when Clement Atlee's Labour Party beat Winston Churchill (above) for the second time . Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, said voters had set politicians a challenge to respond to the desire for change. 'What we are all struck by, whether Yes or No campaigners or supporters, is the incredible turnout that we've seen in this referendum campaign,' he said. 'The challenge for all of us is to tap into that real desire for change and to take on the task of unifying our country whatever the result, and bringing people together to create a better future for ourselves and for future generations.' Colin Fox, from the Scottish Socialist Party, said: 'The big story tonight is the astonishing levels of turnout in a political contest in Scotland, which is on a par with North Korea, China, Cuba and those places.'","Turnout higher than any election in the UK since  universal suffrage in 1918 .

"There's been a significant breakthrough in a suspected double murder, with a handbag, driver's license and other personal items being found close to the discovery of human remains on a Queensland property. Police launched an investigation following the disappearance of Chantal Barnett, 27, and Robert Martinez, 26 in March last year around the Rockhampton and Yeppoon areas, north of Brisbane. Human bones, believed to be male, were found at a property on Bowlin road in Rockhampton on Wednesday, which was previously searched as part of the investigation. Police launched an investigation following the disappearance of Chantal Barnett (pictured right), 27, and Robert Martinez (pictured left), 26 in March last year around the Rockhampton and Yeppoon areas. A handbag and personal items believed to be Ms Barnett's were found close to the discovery of human remains on a Rockhampton property on Wednesday . This handbag, believed to belong to Chantal Barnett, was found near human remains at a Rockhampton property . The driver's license of Chantal Barnett (pictured) was also found along with a handbag and medicare card and personal documents by police. They were all found close to human remains discovered by farmer on Wednesday on a Rockhampton property . Police say significant items of interest, including a handbag, identification, medicare card and personal documents belonging to Chantal Barnett, were located by a farmer at the same search site two weeks prior. 'This has been a continuous and very arduous investigation for 18 months now, finding these items is no accident,' said Senior Sergeant Chris Knight. 'Both families have been briefed and kept up to date with these developments,' he said. A search of the property will be ongoing but police have not indicated a time frame saying the search will keep to a focused area. Forensic examinations will be done on anything else police may find at the property. The discovery has prompted a reward for information. The Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services has approved a $250,000 reward, following an extensive investigation, leading to the conviction of any person responsible for the murders of the Queensland pair. Additionally, an indemnity from prosecution will be recommended for any accomplice, not being the person who actually committed the crime, who first provides information leading to a conviction. Assistant Commissioner Mike Condon said investigators were committed to solving the case and were hoping the reward would encourage members of the public with valuable information to come forward. In September last year police searched an area in Byfield after they discovered two articles of women's clothing, including a women's top and bra . In September police believed clothing found, including a woman's top and bra, had been at the location for some time and was crucial to the investigation . 'There are those people out there that may not be directly involved in the actual crime itself but may hold key information needed for the police to solve this case,' said Assistant Commissioner Condon. 'This announcement means if you are the first to come forward and were not involved in the actual offence, we would be in a position to recommend to the Director of Public Prosecutions an indemnity.' 'There may be those who have assisted in keeping the crime a secret and have been loyal to those involved but may not want to spend time in prison and this is their chance to come forward.' Police are also continuing to appeal for a person who has previously provided information about the occupants of a white VT Holden commodore owned by Robert Martinez and being driven at the time of his death to come forward and provide further information to investigators. 'The condition of the car is a focal point in the investigation,' he said. 'I'll encourage the person who has contacted us and provided us information in relation to the occupants of Robert Martinez's VT commodore sedan, which at the time had a Queensland registration plate 830 RNG to contact us again.'

"Thailand is renowned for its delicious curries and mouthwatering noodle dishes - so much so, many restaurants attempt to replicate these national cuisines, but with limited success. In a bid to clamp down on poorly made, bland meals, the Thai government has stepped in and created its Thai Delicious program. The initiative will use an app to find authentic recipes, alongside a so-called ‘e-delicious’ machine to test dishes across the country.

"Australian swimming star Grant Hackett has been pictured putting himself through a gruelling 90-minute swimming session at a Gold Coast pool. Hackett, 34, was joined poolside by Miami Club and national swimming coach Denis Cotterell during an afternoon in which he spent more than five hours at the Miami Swimming Club, at the southern end of the Gold Coast. The triple-Olympic gold medallist has previously denied that he is using his base on Queensland's glitzy strip to mount a comeback to competitive swimming, or that he is charging toward the 2016 Rio Olympics. Grant Hackett has been pictured back swimming at the Miami Swimming Club on the Gold Coast . Hackett's manager Chris White said it is believed these are the first pictures of Hackett in the pool since Beijing . All eyes were on Hackett on the Gold Coast on Tuesday with the star pictured at the city's Miami Swimming Club . The 34-year-old is training for personal reasons and it is understood he has no plans for a national comeback . The 34-year-old pictured going through the motions prior to his afternoon in the pool . Bask to basics: The champion was holding a kick board, fins and an a snorkel before jumping in the drink . Hackett finished a 90-minute session under direction from coach Cotterell . Hackett's manager Chris White said he believes these are the first pictures of the star seen in the pool since he walked away from the sport in 2008. The 34-year-old told Daily Mail Australia he was just enjoying his return to the water after a tumultuous six years since his retirement. 'I'm thoroughly enjoying being back on the Gold Coast,' he said, 'and I'm keen to remain fit, enjoy a healthy lifestyle and re-establish myself with the community here.' 'Swimming is the ideal mix for both.' He would not be drawn into speculation regarding his future in the sport, other than to say today's training regime was just part of his goal to 'remain fit.' Hackett's motivation to move back home was largely driven by a decision to be closer to his family. It's understood  the swimmer is back training for personal reasons, and not as part of any competitive tilt to return to the national swimming circuit or to add to his medal haul. Hackett collected three gold medals during his career, winning both the Sydney and Athens Olympic 1500 metres and claiming a team gold for his part in the 4x200m freestyle relay at Sydney, in 2000. Although his main motivation is to improve his mental and physical well-being, It is believed that he may be in the selection ranks for the Miami Club when it competes in next year's Australian titles. Hackett told the Herald Sun last month that he has no plans to make a tilt for Rio in 2016 mainly because of his age. 'I would be 36 for Rio,' he said. 'That's probably just getting on a bit too much.' Hackett was all smiles as he was joined by head swimming coach Dennis Cotterell on the Gold Coast .

Hackett has been putting himself in training for a possible club appearance at the Australian titles next year . His base on the Gold Coast provides the perfect escape from a past marred by controversy . Happier times: Hackett is looking a much happier man in the pool . He was joined by several other club members during the five-hour session on the Gold Coast . Hackett finished his 90-minute session on Tuesday under direction from Cotterell who remains the number one man at the head of the national coaching team. Hackett was pictured completely at ease back in the pool - smiling and enjoying himself surrounded by members of the Miami club. The fitter, happier looking Hackett makes for a stark contrast to what has been seen of the star in recent times, most notably when he was  pictured in a dazed state walking around Melbourne's Crown Casino lobby wearing nothing but a towel. It is just one of a number of compromising situations he has been in since his 2008 retirement and divorce to singer Candice Alley. Police have questioned Hackett over the Crown Casino incident and a Victorian spokeswoman confirmed inquiries into the incident are ongoing. Police spokeswoman Sharon Darcy told The Australian that a 34-year-old Queensland man was questioned  over an incident at a Melbourne hotel on February 22. 'He has been released pending further inquiries,' She said. She said police were unable to comment further as the investigation was ongoing. It comes as a difficult year comes to a halt for Hackett who spoke to Daily Mail Australia earlier this year about his his life-changing five-week stint in an Arizona rehab clinic where he was admitted for a sleeping pill addiction. He confessed that his addiction to Stilnox sleeping pills played a major role in him seeking help. At the time he also spoke about a 'sustained amount of pressure and stress' and his bitter divorce to Alley. Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia Hackett said he felt reluctant and 'scared' to go to the US clinic - but was persuaded to go by his dad. 'I was in denial about [help] for a long time, I thought I could manage everything and anything,’ he said in July. 'Because of my athletic background I thought it was a weakness to say ""I need help"",' he said. Hackett’s father Neville previously said the family staged a form of intervention to get the former sportsman into ‘one of the best’ rehab facilities in the world. Three months since his return from the US and it appears that advice is paying off with former great now looking much healthier and happier after packing his bags in Melbourne and moving back to the two places it all began - the Gold Coast and  the pool.

A confidential settlement was signed by both sides in September of 1999. His own past: Sage Kelly's boss Ben Lorello was accused of giving his former girlfriend Lori Schlitzkus an STI which left her infertile and settled a $52 million lawsuit with her in 1999 . Former girlfriend: Lori Schlitzkus said Lorello insisted she give up her job and he put her in a penthouse on West 48th street along with a monthly allowance . Schlitzkus says in the suit filed in New York’s Supreme Court, that she met Lorello at her 'place of employment' in 1995 when he was working at Salomon Smith Barney. Lori Schlitzkus lived in Weehawken, New Jersey until Lorello got her own place in Manhattan. Schlitzkus said Lorello insisted she give up her job and he put her in a penthouse on West 48th street and gave her a monthly allowance. The New York Post reports that Schlitzkus was diagnosed with Chlamydia in 1996 after having unprotected sex with Lorello who she says claimed he was faithful. She thought she was merely having frequent Urinary Tract Infections at the time but learned she had an infection that would leave her infertile. Schlitzkus says she later learned Lorello was cheating on her and that he was 'aware that he was infected with the STI chlamydia, but never informed [her].' Passed a drug test: Benjamin Lorello passed a mandatory drug test this week and claims that Schlitzkus got chlamydia from someone else and that she admitted to stealing his belongings . In anguish: Schlitzkus said that as a result of getting chlamydia she,' 'will for a long time . . . continue to suffer severe physical and mental anguish' Sadly, Schlitzkus learned in 1999 that she 'would be unable to conceive children.' She said that as a result she,' 'will for a long time . . . continue to suffer severe physical and mental anguish.' Lorello denied the claims, saying in a court response that the STI was 'caused by the negligence of plaintiff and/or third parties.' He also said that she 'admitted to wrongfully taking property of defendant.' Sage Kelly’s wife claims that Lorello was one of her husband's 'drug cohorts.' Lorello passed a mandatory drug test this week as part of the  investigation . Colleagues of the real-life 'Wolf of Wall Street' who allegedly pressurized his wife to have sex with a potential client have been drug-tested as a result of the investigation. Sage Kelly, 42, the $7-million-a-year head of healthcare investment banking at Jefferies & Company, is portrayed in court papers filed by wife Christina Di Mauro Kelly as a habitual drug user who was regularly unfaithful and abusive to his children. Mrs Kelly, 39, who is filing for divorce in Manhattan, sent shock waves across Wall Street by naming a string of high-level bankers and businessmen who she claims her husband took cocaine with on a regular basis. Lorello's spokesperson said, 'these completely unsubstantiated 15-year-old personal allegations from a woman who later admitted to wrongdoing were unequivocally denied by Mr. Lorello.'

"The investment banker whose divorce proceedings are sending shock waves through New York City following claims of rampant drug use and partner swapping by his soon to be ex-wife is taking some time off, as his wife is showing off some support from a somewhat surprising source - their daughters . It was announced on Thursday that Sage Kelly, 42, the $7 million-a-year head of healthcare investment banking at Jefferies, had taken a temporary leave of absence from the firm. That same afternoon, his wife Christina was photographed arriving at her lawyer's office with a binder covered with Post-it notes from the couple's daughters, Cameron and Logan. Scroll down for video . The morning after: Christina Kelly (above) arrives at her lawyer's office in New York City on Thursday . Showing support: The notes had messages from the couple's daughters Cameron and Logan . Taking a break: Sage Kelly (above) will be taking a temporary leave of absence as the head of healthcare investment banking at Jefferies . The notes said; 'I don't like you, I love you'; 'Your [sic] the best mom'; and 'I love you.' She was also accompanied by a man wearing an earpiece who followed closely behind her and appeared to possibly be a bodyguard. The bodyguard: Christina also had some muscle with her as she traveled to her lawyer's office with a bodyguard by her side . Bad week: News of Sage's break comes just one day after documents in the acrimonious divorce between Sage and his Christina (above) became public . Bombshell claims: Christina stated in court documents that her husband used drugs including cocaine, ecstasy, Molly, Ketamine, mushrooms and even heroin . Jefferies Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler released a statement on Thursday addressing Sage's leave, saying, 'In an effort to deal with these matters, Sage Kelly has requested a voluntary leave of absence. In her affidavit Christina makes numerous drug claims about her husband Sage, including: . -In 2002 he snorted heroin at a club in Southampton and then tried to walk home barefoot several miles . -In 2007, while doing Ketamine, he became so depressed that he demanded to hold their daughter for several hours until he came out of his K-hole . -In 2011 he had a magic mushroom party, at which he consumed so many of the fungi the group hid the bag from him. He then found the bag and began popping them in his mouth, after smearing blood on his face . -In 2012, after a night of cocaine and booze in Boston, he pressured Christina into having sex with Marc Beer and Beer's girlfriend in order to secure his business. Sage also had sex with Beer's girlfriend that evening in a bed next to Beer and Christina . -In May 2014 he attended a drugfest Bachelor Party in Las Vegas filled with illegal activity including drugs and hookers . -Sage was only able to have sex with Christina and only showed interest in sex after doing cocaine . -Sage has admitted to occasional drug use, but denies most of Christina's claims . 'Sage is embroiled in a deeply personal and painful situation, and, as such, we have decided to accept his decision to take time off to focus on doing what is in the best interest of his children. 'We cannot express how deeply we regret the agony and distraction that this has caused all of us, not to mention our clients, each of whom has categorically denied the allegations. 'We are not happy to be in this unfair position.' FOX Business is reporting that Jefferies has lost five clients already as a result of this scandal. Details of Christina Di Mauro Kelly's shocking affidavit filed in her divorce and custody case against her husband were made public on Wednesday. The papers filed by Christina portrayed her husband as a drug addict with a penchant for everything from cocaine, Molly, ecstasy, and Ketamine to magic mushrooms and even heroin. She also claimed that at one point in their relationship her husband pressured her to have sex with Aegerion Pharmaceuticals boss Marc Beer, something that led to a foursome with the three and Beer's girlfriend in a room at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston, this after a night of cocaine and booze. Elsewhere in her affidavit, Christina describes a drug-fueled sex party with hookers that took place in Las Vegas this May, an incident in which she claims Sage was having a negative reaction to Ketamine and, while in a K-hole, held their terrified 3-year-old daughter for several hours, and another during a mushroom party when he smeared his own blood on his face after a morning spent popping the psychedelic fungi. Sage has denied his wife claims, saying, 'While [she] and I used recreational drugs on occasion at certain social events in the past, the Wolf of Wall Street tale she tells this court is a work of fiction.' Getting on with things: Christina was spotted later in the day on Thursday in a new outfit outside her apartment . His wife also admits to her own substance abuse problems, having been caught on video snorting cocaine at their apartment this July and getting charged with felony DWI and endangering the welfare of a child after crashing her Range Rover into a telephone pole in 2010 while both her children were in the car. She ultimately received three years of probation. They are fighting over money and custody of their children. Christina claims that both frequently did drugs while their children were in their care.

Struggles: Christina (above in a 2010 mugshot) has admitted to her own problem with substance abuse, and was even charged with DWI in 2010 after getting into an accident with her children in the car . It is unknown at this time if two other men at Jefferies also named in Christina's documents will also be taking some time off. Christina made claims that her husband's boss at the company, Ben Lorello, also did cocaine, and that Sage had sex with the wife of close friend and co-worker Dung Nguyen during a night of drug use and partying at their Sag Harbor home. As of now, Lorello has taken over Sage's responsibilities at Jefferies.","Christina Kelly was photographed arriving at her lawyer's office today with a binder full of love notes from her two daughters .

"A two-mile, £600million tunnel must be built under Stonehenge to end decades of congestion on one of the country's busiest roads, business leaders have warned. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said reducing congestion on the busy A303 was 'vital', despite the difficulty of bypassing the World Heritage Site in Wiltshire. He said the landmark could not be moved, so traffic should be diverted under it and urged Chancellor George Osborne to give the go-ahead to the project in next month's Autumn Statement. Drivers have suffered years of congestion on the A303 passing Stonehenge, but pressure is mounting for a tunnel to divert traffic . Business groups are urging the Chancellor to act to ensure the slowdown is no more than that and that the economy continues to grow at a steady pace. Top of the wish-list is investment in infrastructure. The EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, complains that Britain’s road network is ‘crumbling’ while the British Chambers of Commerce says business is ‘dismayed’ by the lack of action on infrastructure. Mr Cridland said both he and business want to see ‘diggers on the ground’ – and his top priority is a tunnel under Stonehenge to ease traffic on the A303. He added: ‘Look at the main links that are really important to the country in terms of growth. The link between London and the South West is under invested in.’ Plans to build a tunnel under Stonehenge were dropped seven years ago on cost grounds but ministers and civil servants are again looking at the idea. An announcement about upgrading the whole A303 - which runs from Honiton in Devon to Basingstoke, Hampshire - is expected in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement next month. A new visitor centre has been built at Stonehenge and an adjacent road closed, but the area remains blighted by massive traffic jams. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said reducing congestion on the busy A303 was 'vital', despite the difficulty of bypassing the World Heritage Site in Wiltshire . Mr Cridland says it is ‘the right thing to do for the country’. ‘We should just get on with it. It’s the only solution,’ he insists. 'The most significant barrier is Stonehenge. You obviously can't move it, so why not go under it?' he said. Mr Cridland said investment in infrastructure was one of a series of measures business wanted from the Chancellor. Security of energy supplies was also crucial for industry, while moves to boost business investment, such as extending tax credits for research and development, should also be included in the Autumn Statement, said Mr Cridland. He also backed the free movement of labour in Europe, saying that overseas workers were needed to plug skills shortages. Business wanted to remain in a reformed European Union, said Mr Cridland, adding it was disappointing that so much coverage of the EU was negative. He called for more British students to spend part of their course in another area of the EU to promote better links between countries. Mr Cridland said he was optimistic about the British economy, forecasting growth of 3 per cent this year, but expressed concerns about 'headwinds' from the eurozone.","CBI boss John Cridland calls for Chancellor to back new road next month .

"A house dating back to the early 1700s once lived in by the 'real Robinson Crusoe' has gone up for sale. Minards House in Oreston, Plymouth, Devon, is said to have once been lived in by Alexander Selkirk, who experts believe is the man behind the fictional castaway. Written by Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe follows the life of a wealthy adventurer as he voyages around the world and eventually ends up shipwrecked. Minards House (pictured) in Devon which dates back to the early 1700s and was once lived in by the 'real Robinson Crusoe' has gone up for sale for £395,000 . The plaque outside the property was one of several put up during the 1970s denoting Plymouth's link to the ambitious wayfarer Alexander Selkirk . Dr Bonnie Latimer, a lecturer in English at Plymouth University, said: 'What many may not realise is that the original novel isn't entirely fiction. 'One of his likely sources was the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk's story of being deliberately abandoned on the island of Juan Fernandez by his ship's captain after they argued. 'Selkirk only lived on his island for four years, but when rescued by a passing ship, he is supposed to have presented a wild figure, sunburnt, bearded, and clothed in goats' skins - just like Crusoe himself.' In the early eighteenth century Minards House was a pub, and Selkirk supposedly stayed there for some time before heading out to sea again on HMS Weymouth, and subsequently dying of yellow fever. Donna Pullinger, who moved into the four-bedroom, detached house 12 years ago, said: 'There's a plaque on the house, and I've got some old documents. In the early eighteenth century Minards House was a pub, and Selkirk supposedly stayed there for some time before heading out to sea again . Donna Pullinger moved into the four-bedroom, detached house 12 years ago, but has decided to put it up for sale . 'In a book someone gave me it says he stayed here. I've also got all the old deeds. 'We get quite a few people standing outside and peering in. 'I'd love to go back in time and see what it would have been like then.' The plaque outside the property was one of several put up during the 1970s denoting Plymouth's link to the ambitious wayfarer. The house is on the market for £395,000. A spokesman for Plymouth City Council said: 'Selkirk came to Plymouth aboard HMS Enterprise in October 1720 and subsequently transferred to HMS Weymouth. 'Between ships, on December 12 1720, he married local widow Frances Candish at St Andrew's Church. Frances is thought to be the landlady of an Oreston pub where he may have lodged - the Old Inn - along the quay from the Kings Arms. Minards House is said to have once been lived in by Alexander Selkirk, who experts believe is the man behind the fictional character Robinson Crusoe . The house is a 'substantial older property' close to the site of Oreston's original quayside . 'Most waterfront properties of the period have long gone. 'The plaque is on ""Minards House"" - a substantial older property close to the site of the Old Inn and original quayside.' Dr Latimer said: 'After Selkirk returned to Britain, in 1712 his rescuer published an account based on Selkirk's experiences. 'This caught the public imagination, and was reproduced in cheap, accessible formats for the common reader, with Selkirk himself becoming a minor celebrity. 'In the end, though, this exciting adventure didn't much change Selkirk from the rough-and-tumble sailor he was. 'He returned to sea, stopping at Plymouth on a voyage home in 1720, where he probably married and lived for a short time. 'The lure of the water was too strong for him, however, and the following year he returned to his ship, dying at sea in 1721. There is some debate over whether Selkirk ever met Daniel Defoe, but the sailor is understood to have been behind the character Robinson Crusoe . 'But his story, transfigured through the imagination of Daniel Defoe, would immortalise his life for thousands of readers around the world, and means that he is still remembered nearly 300 years after his death.' However, Nicholas Seager, a university lecturer and Defoe scholar, said: 'There is some debate about whether Defoe ever encountered Selkirk, but in short there is no proof that he did, so it's safest to assume he did not. 'And we should recognise that Defoe did not simply base Robinson Crusoe on Selkirk; he adapted and supplemented the source. 'There are many other literary sources for Crusoe, but this real-life one surely had an impact.' Mrs Pullinger said: 'When we moved in we put a lot of the character back in, as the staircase was horrid and modern, and we also put slates on the floor and put in a wood burner - so it's more like it would've been back then. 'It's a lovely house and I will miss it but I'd love to stay in the village.' Written by Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe is the story of a castaway and his adventures on a remote tropical island near Trinidad. First published in 1719, the novel recounts Crusoe's experiences on the desert island including his battle to stay alive and his encounters with cannibals, captives and mutineers. The story is widely believed to have been influenced by the life of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who was a castaway on an island in the Pacific off Chile for four years. Others have suggested he was inspired by a separate novel about a desert island castaway. Some say it was inspired by Robert Knox's account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon in 1659 . In the book, Crusoe sets sail from Hull on a sea voyage in 1651 against the wishes of his parents who want him to go into law . In the book, Crusoe sets sail from Hull on a sea voyage in 1651 against the wishes of his parents who want him to go into law. He eventually ends up shipwrecked in a storm 40 miles out to sea on an island, which he calls Despair, near the mouth of the Orinoco river in 1659. It is thought the details of Crusoe's island were probably based on the Caribbean island of Tobago, since that island lies a short distance north of the Venezuelan coast near the mouth of the river. He fetches arms, tools, and other supplies from the ship before it breaks apart and sinks and builds a home near a cave which he excavates and makes marks in a wooden cross as a makeshift calendar. Over the years, Crusoe discovers native cannibals who visit occasionally to kill and eat prisoners. When one of the prisoners escapes, he teaches him English and names him 'Friday' after the day of the week he arrived. Eventually, Crusoe escapes on an English ship before embarking for England in 1686 with Friday.","House once in by 'real Robinson Crusoe' has gone up for sale for £395,000 .

"Kymberlie Shepherd had always dreamed of becoming a mother. It was set to become a reality when the 26-year-old went into labour last Thursday at a Perth hospital with her fiancée Wayde Kelly by her side. But minutes away from giving birth to Kyden Thomas Bede Kelly, things took a tragic turn. Ms Shepherd passed away  after suffering an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare complication that occurs 6.1 times in every 100,000 deliveries. Scroll down for video . Wayde Kelly and Kymberlie Shepherd were expecting their first child when the 26-year-old went in labour in Perth last Thursday. But minutes away from giving birth, things took a tragic turn . The 26-year-old dance teacher passed away after suffering a rare complication as she was giving birth to their son, Kyden Thomas Bede Kelly . 'Everything was going well. Kymmy had been given the gas to help relieve the pain, but she still did her make up again so she was looking how she wanted for the photos after the birth,' Mr Kelly told Daily Mail Australia. 'She was pushing hard and they said the baby was close. I looked up to change her iPod as she told me she was light-headed. 'As they got the oxygen on her, she just lost consciousness, let go of my hand and had a fit. 'It's something I will never forget.' Mr Kelly said he experienced 'mixed emotions' meeting his son Kyden for the very first time . He was told Kyden was born at 10.36am but couldn't bring himself to see him for an hour because he was worried about his partner . Mr Kelly said the couple had never heard of an amniotic fluid embolism and never predicted something like this could happen. 'I was told Kyden was born at 10.36am, but Kym was in a serious condition. I couldn't even go and see him for an hour as I just wanted to know about Kym,' he said. 'They worked on her for two hours before they stopped and just said she was fighting and while she was they would too. 'We were told at about 12.15pm that she had passed away and I just sat in tears and shock at the table.' Mr Kelly said the couple had never heard of an amniotic fluid embolism and never predicted something like this could happen . He said he was glad there were so many people out there who would be able to tell their son what type of person his mother was . Mr Kelly said he experienced 'mixed emotions' meeting his son for the first time. 'It was Kymmy's dream to hold him. I didn't think I could enjoy it without her. But I wanted to see if I could find a positive in anything and I did,' he said. The couple, who got engaged last December after four years together, had spoken often about having a baby and decided now was the perfect time after she was made a permanent dance teacher at Safety Bay Senior High School. 'She would have made the best mum. Having a baby was the one thing she had always wanted to do,' he said. 'We were so excited. Kymmy had the baby's room and absolutely everything sorted. 'She was just the most selfless, kind, caring and giving person.' Mr Kelly said it was Kym's dream to hold their son and she would have made the best mother . He was unsure if would enjoy being a father without Kym, but said he wanted to find a positive out of losing her . Mr Kelly proposed to Ms Shepherd last December at Mount Warning in Queensland after four years together. The couple, who had lived together in London for two years and travelled extensively, recently moved to Perth to start their life together. 'My favourite thing about her was her bubbly personality and infectious smile,' Mr Kelly said. 'Everyone she met knew who she was and I have never heard a bad word said about her.' He said he was glad there were so many people out there who would be able to tell their son what type of person his mother was. 'I will tell him she had such an amazing impact on everyone she came in contact with,' he said. 'She had such a love of life and I'll tell him that she would want him to do what he loved.' The couple, who got engaged last December after four years together, had spoken often about having a baby . The couple, who had lived together in London for two years and travelled extensively to 25 countries, recently moved to Perth to start their life together . Following Ms Shepherd's tragic death, Mr Kelly now wants to raise awareness about amniotic fluid embolism. 'It is the number one cause for maternal death in developed nations, but no one I know or had spoken to had any real knowledge about it,' he said. 'I didn't even know if could happen before the birth. 'I just hope that somewhere down the track, someone, somewhere can come up with an epipen-like solution that could be available in all birthing suites.' Mr Kelly plans to move back to the Gold Coast where both their families are to raise Kyden.","Kymberlie Shepherd, 26, passed away last Thursday at a Perth hospital after giving birth to her son .

"Birmingham's renaissance under Gary Rowett got firmly back on track with a ruthless obliteration of shell-shocked Reading in the Sky Bet Championship.

Reading pulled one back in the 19th minute. Jordan Obita scuffed a volley into the box but succeeded in teeing it up nicely for Murray, who looped a header over Darren Randolph and in.

Cooper gave the ball away cheaply and the youngster showed quick feet before guiding the ball into the far corner. Gray fires past Reading keeper Adam Federici to complete his hat-trick on the stroke of half-time . If anything, it was Birmingham who looked shaky at the back, as Reading kept their heads up and pressed. Yet Gray had his hat-trick in added time, again on the break. David Davis picked the ball up and with Gray to his left and Cotterill to his right against two defenders, slid it to the former who took it well before coolly slotting it home. Thirty seconds into the second half, Shinnie made it 5-1. Birmingham's most-improved player under Rowett forced his way in from the right, jinked into the box and smashed a low shot past the despairing Federici. But there is still time for Shinnie (left) to add another goal just before the break for the rampant home side . David Cockerill (far left) extends Birmingham's lead to 6-1 on the hour mark . In the 59th minute the Royals keeper's misery was compounded as Cotterill's free-kick from the left ghosted straight into the far corner of the net.
