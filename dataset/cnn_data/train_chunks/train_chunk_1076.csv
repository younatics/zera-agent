"Shocking footage released by West Yorkshire firefighters shows one of their crew being deliberately pelted with fireworks. The incident occurred in the Chapeltown area of Leeds as West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service members extinguished a small street fire. As one of the firefighters prepared to douse the flames he was attacked by a group of people as they emerge from a side street. Yob: A youth launches fireworks towards the fireman and the fire engine in a completely unprovoked attack . Blaze: As the fireworks explode the fireman turns his back and tries to shield himself from the ball of flame . West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service decided to release the footage to show the public the incredible danger they occasionally encounter during bonfire season. The video shows the fire engine driving through streets, skirting small fires that crews had been called to put out. The vehicle then pulls up to one fire and the camera shows a firefighter getting out and preparing to extinguish the blaze. But before he can do so, a man on the other side of the street can be seen firing rockets at the fire engine. As the fireworks begin to go off, the street is filled with multi-coloured bursts of flame and fire. Reckless: The firefighter attempts to extinguish a live firework after the crew were called to the Chapeltown area of Leeds. One of a gang of youths who carried out the attack is visible on the left . Danger: The firefighter ducks for cover as rockets fly towards him and the fire engine .

"Meet Hurricane and Jordan, the heroic security dogs who thwarted Wednesday's White House intruder. The brave Belgian Malinois have returned to work after being treated for minor bruises following the incident, in which Dominic Adesanya, 23, hopped over the north fence and sprinted across the lawn in a bid to reach the executive mansion. President Obama was inside at the time. But as footage shows, Adesanya had no chance when faced with Hurricane and Jordan - who swiftly reached him and stopped him in his tracks. Even when he brutally kicked one of the dogs and punched the other, they didn't let go, preventing him from reaching the first family. Scroll down for video . Job well done: Jordan, left, and Hurricane, right, have returned to work after stopping a White House intruder on Wednesday. The dogs were treated for minor bruises after the intruder kicked and punched them . They were treated for minor bruises and have now headed back to work, the Secret Service said. On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised the agents' response, saying, 'Yesterday's incident underscores the professionalism of the Secret Service.' As the agency shared photos of the dogs on Twitter, it revealed that Jordan, a five-year-old black and tan Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys walks around White House'. Stopped: Dominic Adesanya, who has a history of mental illness, remains in police custody . Hurricane, a six-year-old black Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys playing with his Kong toy', the Twitter feed said. The agency noted both are 'ready to work'. Adesanya, from Bel Air, Maryland, is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and has been charged with felony assault on a police officer for hurting the dogs. He is being held without bond. He was unarmed when he tried to reach the White House. After his arrest, his father revealed that Adesanya had the paranoid belief he was being watched by cameras and had previously been arrested at the executive mansion. He was arrested on July 27 and ordered to undergo mental health screening. Court records show he told an officer that he wanted cameras that had been placed in his home removed. The document also says he told an officer that the security barrier he jumped over 'was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well.' After the arrest he was ordered to get outpatient mental health screening . He was apprehended again on July 30 after he refused to leave the Treasury building,  next to the White House, and swung his fists at officers. Cruel: Video footage captured Adesanya kicking one of the dogs and punching another on the lawn . Dogs have been working for the Secret Service since 1975. The agency trains Belgian Malinois, like Hurricane and Jordan. While the breed is known for its gentle nature, the dogs can also run 30 miles and have a 270-degree field of vision, making them effective at hunting down targets. They resemble small German shepherds and their short hair allows them to work well in the heat. One was used in the team that cornered Osama bin Laden in 2011. Secret Service dogs must complete 20 weeks of training with handlers before they can report for duty. They complete eight hours a week of refresher training once they're on the job. On average, they work until they are about 10. This means that Hurricane, who's six, and Jordan, who's five, have a few more years of work left in them yet. He was supposed to return to court  but didn't show up and warrants for his arrest were issued. His father, Victor Adesanya, said in a telephone interview that his son has been experiencing mental health problems for over a year, but he refused the help the family tried to get for him. Victor Adesanya said his son was diagnosed with paranoia and 'complained about cameras everywhere.' He said at one point his son took down a mirror in the bathroom and cut into the wall, trying to find a camera. He also looked for them in the family's attic. He said his son was not trying to hurt the president. 'He's not violent. He's not a criminal. He's not a murderer. He's just someone that's just mentally disturbed,' he said. The incident came about a month after a previous White House fence jumper, Omar Gonzalez, sprinted across the same lawn carrying a knife, ran past armed uniformed agents and entered the mansion before being felled in the ceremonial East Room and taken into custody. This week a federal judge delayed his arraignment because of questions about his mental fitness. Friends and family said the veteran was suffering from PTSD due to service abroad. Security: A member of the U.S. Secret Service stands guard in front of the North Lawn of the White House in Washington on Thursday, a day after Adesanya jumped over the fence and tried to reach the mansion . The embarrassing  incident preceded the disclosure of other serious Secret Service breaches in security for Obama and ultimately led to Julia Pierson's resignation as director of the agency after 18 months on the job. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who has been leading congressional investigations into the Secret Service, commended the swift response Wednesday night. But he said more needed to be known about Dominic Adesanya, including whether he was doing anything suspicious immediately before the incident that should have led to his detection. Chaffetz also suggested changes might be needed to 'maximize the pain of going over the fence.' 'It seems a little too easy to get over,' he said.","Hurricane and Jordan stopped Dominic Adesanya, 23, from reaching the executive mansion after he hopped over the fence on Wednesday night .

"An amateur photographer was shocked when he found what appears to the the ghost of a condemned criminal, complete with a hangman's hood, in a photograph he took in some former prison cells. Nottingham's Galleries of Justice Museum houses a 15th Century jail, where prisoners were once hanged from the steps. And James Pykett, 25, believes he has spotted the spirit of one of those who died there lurking in the shadows. Scroll down for video . Lurking: The creepy photo snapped by James Pykett which appears to show a ghost with a hangman's hood . Sentenced: Nottingham's Galleries of Justice houses a prison where people were hanged from the steps . Eerie: A close-up of the hooded figure . As a CCTV operator, Mr Pykett is used to looking very carefully at images, but when he examined this one, he said: 'It made the hairs on the back of my neck stick up. 'I believed I could see a shadow and when I zoomed in, I was adamant that I could,' he added. 'At first I thought it looked like a guard but then on closer inspection the figure appears to be wearing a hood which condemned prisoners wore when they were hanged.' Mr Pykett did not spot the 'ghost' when he first took the picture, and only saw it when he was uploading his photos to Facebook. 'This particular photo was uploaded in July, but it wasn't until mid-September when I was messing around with pictures, and doing a bit of picture editing, that I tried enlarging the image, and saw that stuff in the photo,' he said. 'It's almost more spooky that I didn't see the ghost in the photo to start with but that it was there in the background all along.' Mr Pykett, from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, has always had an interest in ghosts, and photographs historical sites like this one in his spare time. 'I am interested in the supernatural, and also in the historical side of these sites,' he said. 'It all started back a few years ago when spent a night in the cells at the Galleries of Justice. 'That night made me want to answer more questions about the site because it was just really creepy down there, and I have become fascinated with paranormal stuff since then.' Fittingly, Mr Pykett is set to marry his fiancée Jodi Wallis, a 23-year-old part-time dog groomer, on Halloween. Faye Rollinson, a spokesperson for the Galleries, said: 'Visitors say that when they are walking in the cell area they often have a feeling that they are not alone. 'People say they have seen dark figures there.' David Cross, who runs the Nottingham Ghost Walk, said: 'Nottingham is one of the most haunted places in England due to historic happenings, including the Norman Invasion.' Several ghosts are said to frequent the area around Robin Hood's statue and Lace Market, he added.

"Found: The body of Abdullah Alkadi, a 23-year-old electrical engineering student from Saudi Arabia was discovered along Interstate 10 on Thursday . Two men have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a college student from Saudi Arabia, whose body was fond on California highway last week - one month after he went missing. Abdullah Abdullatif Alkadi, 23, was found dead on Thursday along Interstate 10 in Palm Deserts, more than two hours away from his Los Angeles home where he was last seen. The Los Angeles Daily News reports that Alkadi had sold his Audi S-5 through Craigslist with an asking price of more than $35,000 the day before he was last seen. Alkadi had moved to the United States in 2010 to pursue a degree in electrical engineering student at Cal State University, Northridge according to his brother, Ahmed, 32, who is also a student there. 'He wanted to make his family, his parents and himself proud,' said Ahmed. 'He wanted to be a contributing member in our society but things turned out the other way around.' 'I want to bring anyone who is responsible or involved to justice,' Ahmed said. 'I have full faith in the justice system here.' The month-long search for Alkadi brought in the FBI at the request of the LAPD, according to spokesperson Laura Eimiller. 'It's not uncommon for the bureau to provide resources on . request in missing persons cases,' Eimiller said. She declined . to further discuss details of the FBI's involvement because Los . Angeles police detectives were leading the investigation. The Los Angeles Times reported that Alkadi's cell phone had been tracked to Beaumont, 80 miles east of Los . Angeles, but that someone had deactivated it. Police located the car Alkadi sold and said the buyer was not connected to the man's disappearance. Peace: Alkadi's brother Ahmed said that Abdullah was a peaceful guy and asked for empathy in spite of any religious or language barriers . Robbery?: Alkadi disappeared the day after he sold an Audi on Craigslist with a listed price of over $35,000, though the buyer was cleared of any connection . No further details have been released about the two men who were arrested, though Police Chief Charlie Beck is scheduled to speak about the case on Monday, according to the LAPD. Ahmed will accompany his brother's remains back to Khobar in Saudi Arabia, where Alkadi's parents live. 'He was a peaceful guy,' said Ahmed. 'Regardless of any barriers we have with language or religion, he’s a human being. I would like the public to pray for his soul to have peace in eternity.'","Abdullah Alkadi, 23, was found dead along Interstate 10 east of Los Angeles .

"Actor Paul Rudd has denied being one of the passengers who helped take down a homophobic man who kicked a man at a Texas airport. Video released of the altercation at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport last Thursday showed a man who looked like the 45-year-old Hollywood star - sparking internet rumors. The Anchorman and Clueless star had been watching the Kansas City Royals win baseball's American League Conference final the night before the brawl, leading some to think he could have stopped off to catch a connecting flight. But his publicist said it was not him, and one of the men who helped restrain the suspect is simply a lookalike. Scroll down for video .

A number of bystanders then intervene when the man starts the unprovoked attack. He is eventually handcuffed by police, and one of those helping them - wearing a brown coat - looks like Rudd. He had been at the Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, watching is beloved team beat the Baltimore Orioles to advance to their first World Series since 1985. During a post-game interview, he jokingly invited all of the fans to a 'party at his mom's house' to celebrate. The resemblance of the man in the video to the Knocked Up star led to a hashtag on Twitter called #PaulRuddSavesLives . During the airport brawl, the unprovoked ringleader of the fight can be seen removing his jacket as he continues to shout at the man in the pink shirt. Assault: The crazed kicked the innocent passenger after shouting a number of homophobic slurs at him .

Some onlookers said they thought the attacker might be on some sort of drug that made him behave that way. 'That guy was crazy... absolutely crazy,' said Andrew Kennedy, who managed to capture footage of the event that later went viral. 'We saw a very troubled man, ‘said Kennedy's brother Andrew. 'We hope that he was under the influence of some kind of substance, because if he wasn't and that's his true personality, then he's going to have a long road in front of him.'

"The French government is considering creating a new tax on smartphones and tablets in a bid to raise millions to support the creation of digital cultural content inside France. The proposal, handed to President Francois Hollande today, outlines a one per cent tax on the sale of Internet-compatible devices, targeting companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon. The tax would yield about 86 million euros per year. The revenue would help cultural industries create French content such as music, images and videos. Possible tax hike; France's President Francois Hollande today looked at proposals for a one per cent tax on smartphones and tablets . The proposal is part of France's 'cultural exception,' a policy that protects French cinema and music industries, and other creative sectors, against foreign - often American - competition. The French government will meet leading figures of the cultural sector in the next few weeks before any decision is made. Today also marked Hollande's first day of consultations with trade union leaders and employers on an overhaul of France's pension system, a reform seen as vital to sorting out French public finances. The European Commission has given Paris a further two years to reduce its public deficit to a targeted three per cent of output but wants France to commit to structural reforms in return. Hollande has made a pension revamp a top priority this year but, with his ratings already at record lows, is also eager to avoid a repeat of mass street protests in 2010 when predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy raised the retirement age to 62 from 60. France's President Francois Hollande, left, shakes hand with French businessman and journalist Pierre Lescure after receiving a report about cultural politics in the digital period at the Elysee presidential Palace today . The government is due to consult employers and trade unions through to parliament's summer recess. However it will not give them a say in a draft law due in the second half of the year as it did with new labour market rules agreed in January. France will see a 20 billion euros ($26 billion) annual shortfall in its pension system by 2020 if it does not act. The government has ruled out raising the legal retirement age beyond 62, but Hollande has said that extending the pay-in period beyond the current 41.5 years is all but inevitable. Two other options include raising the level of contributions to the retirement system and paring down pay-outs by limiting how much pensions are adjusted for inflation. The head of the Medef employers lobby, Laurence Parisot, called for the pay-in period to be raised to 43 years by 2020 and for the retirement age to be lifted to 65 years from 2040. The moderate CFDT union, which was a key backer of the labour reform, said on Monday it could back a deep overhaul as long as it considered fair. The hardline CGT and FO unions oppose raising either the retirement age or the pay-in period. A recent poll showed, however, that nearly two thirds of French would support a reform raising the retirement age and 66 percent think the pay-in period should be raised.","The new tax will target companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon .

"The Earl of Cardigan accused his son of being greedy . The Earl of Cardigan has accused his son of being greedy after he claims he went along with a decision to sell his ancestral home. The 61-year-old Earl lost his battle to stop the sale of Tottenham House in Wiltshire, a Grade I listed estate with 100 rooms. He had been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over the sale of the mansion in the 4,500 acre Savernake Estate, outside Marlborough, Wiltshire, to an unnamed buyer - Mr. A - for £11.25m. But he lost his bid at the Court of Appeal to save the dilapidated 200 year old mansion as judges ruled it should be sold, with the proceeds shared between him and his estranged son, Viscount Savernake. Lord Cardigan said he was ashamed his son had gone along with the decision. He told The Times: 'To my shame, my son has acquiesced in this appalling blow inflicted on my family's historic estate, and somehow I have to try to put that down to youthful greed and somehow forgive him.' He said he was disappointed because his father, the 9th Marquess of Ailesbury, had given the greater share of the estate to Viscount Savernake in a bid to keep it in the family. The Eton-educated Earl had claimed the estate was worth much more than the trustees were planning to sell it for and claimed the price was inadequate. The trustees, chartered accountant Wilson Cotton and John Moore, a barrister's clerk, had been trying to sell the property in Wiltshire. They claimed, much of it lay decaying because it had been unoccupied for years. Sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Vos said he did not gain any assistance from considering whether the trustees were right to regard Mr A's 'bird in the hand' offer as preferable to an international marketing campaign. But he said they were 'justified in acting on competent professional advice.' The Earl of Cardigan has fought trustees for two years to try and save Tottenham House, his ancestral home . Judges ruled that Tottenham House, in Wiltshire, should be sold following the bitter two year battle . The Earl and Countess of Cardigan, pictured in 2002, with their children Thomas, Viscount Savernake, and Lady Catherine Brudenell-Bruce. He has since married Joanne Hill, an American . Their decision to enter into the sale to Mr. A 'was one which reasonable trustees could properly take in the interests of the beneficiaries,' and dismissed the Earl's appeal. The main beneficiary is the Earl's son Viscount Savernake, Thomas James Brudenell-Bruce, who has a controlling 51 per cent share in the estate. The 92,000 square feet mansion has been unoccupied since the 1990's and is 'extremely dilapidated,' Lord Justice Vos added. Together with Lord Justice Moore-Bick and Lady Justice Black he dismissed appeals by the Earl and his son Viscount Savernake - against High Court approval of the sale last December. The Earl's dispute with the trustees  date back to 2011 when they decided to sell off some valuable paintings. They were put up for auction after he lost another High Court fight in 2012 with the trustees over the sale. During the proceedings, the Earl lived off a weekly state allowance of £71 and claimed he was forced to shower at a gym and wash his baby daughter in a sink.","Earl of Cardigan says son has accepted 'appalling blow' to family estate .

"The Earl of Cardigan has revealed he was forced to shower at a gym and wash his baby daughter in a sink as trustees fought to sell his family's £16million estate. For two years, the 61-year-old was embroiled in a bitter legal battle over the sale of Tottenham House in Wiltshire as he tried to persuade the courts to give him permission to lease the Grade I Listed estate to a hotelier. During the acrimonious proceedings, the Earl, whose family name is David Brudenell-Bruce, lived off a weekly state allowance of £71 and was forced to move his family into a small lodge on the estate's grounds. The couple were embroiled in a bitter legal battle over the sale of Tottenham House on Savernake Estate in Wiltshire . Unable to even heat the cottage, he took to bathing his daughter, now one, in a sink and he and his second wife, Joanne, travelled to a local leisure centre to shower. 'Because the trustees would not release any money we have been forced to bathe our one-year-old daughter in the sink and we have been forced to take daily showers in the local leisure centre.' he told the Daily Telegraph. The Earl said the sale would be 'galling' for his father . 'They cut off my income, deprived me of my job and had me living in complete penury every since.' Last week the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the trustees and ordered that it be sold for £11.5million. Trustees had been trying to sell the property in Wiltshire as, they claimed, much of it lay decaying having been unoccupied for years. Last year a deal was reportedly made with a property developer to sell the most valuable part of the estate, Tottenham House, with the Earl and his son, Viscount Savernake, the beneficiaries. But Lord Cardigan argued it was worth more than the £11.5million offer, despite an estate agent valuing the property at closer to £8million. He launched an appeal to block the sale, pleading that the house be kept within his family. But this week a panel of judges ruled it was in his best interest to sell the house. Speaking of how the sale will affect his father, the 9th Marquess of Ailesbury, he said: 'To hear it will be sold against his wishes in his 89th year will be very galling for him.'","Earl of Cardigan has lost fight to block sale of his £16million Wiltshire pile .

"Nur Nadir is seeking £5million in a divorce settlement as well as property and a car . She vowed to stand by Asil Nadir when the fugitive fraudster was jailed for ten years. But now the tycoon’s wife Nur, who is 42 years his junior, is said to be demanding a £5million divorce. Only 15 months after pledging to help Nadir fight to clear his name, she is reported to have begged her husband to let her go. As well as the £5million, she is seeking his four-wheel-drive vehicle and villa in Northern Cyprus. Nadir, 71, who received millions in legal aid from the taxpayer during his Old Bailey trial after nearly two decades on the run, is said to have told her from his prison cell: ‘If you leave me I will reject everything and leave my fight for life.’ Mrs Nadir, 29, is understood to have had a bitter falling out with her husband’s family, which has seen her use Twitter to attack ‘slander and ugly behaviour’. She supported Nadir throughout his trial. The tycoon, who had agreed to return to Britain after fleeing to Northern Cyprus, was found guilty in August 2012 of stealing almost £29million from his Polly Peck empire in the 1980s. Mrs Nadir returned to Cyprus afterwards but was fired from her position at The Cyprus Media Group by its boss, Nadir’s sister Bilge Nevzat, a local newspaper reported. According to another paper, she claims to have been pressured into the divorce by Mrs Nevzat. It reported tweets from Mrs Nadir saying: ‘When I first returned to Cyprus, I had dinner with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law. ‘Bilge Nevzat asked me: “I guess you will divorce my brother now. You won’t ruin your life with him now will you?” And I said of course I won’t divorce him and that I will do anything I can for him to get over this and then I left.’ She added: ‘I wanted to remove myself . from all of what was happening … I wanted to rid myself of all these . events and I begged to my husband to let me go, I told him that I didn’t . have the strength any more. He said: “If you leave me I will reject everything and leave my fight for life. 'I couldn’t handle his sad voice, nor could I handle this responsibility.’ Mrs Nadir’s lawyer has reportedly said the divorce will go through if she lowers her demands and accepts £2.5million. Scroll down for video . Nur Nadir pictured with her estranged husband during his trial . A friend of Nadir said last night that the tycoon’s family did not get on well with Nur, his second wife, and was not surprised they were divorcing. The friend added: ‘When someone as young as her marries someone as old as her grandfather, one draws one’s own conclusions, especially given the reports she’s asking for £5million.’ The friend said Nadir was coping well with life in Belmarsh prison, South-East London, adding: ‘He’s a strong character. He’s actually doing a good job in there counselling other prisoners.’ The Serious Fraud Office investigation and trial cost an estimated £23million. Despite claiming millions in legal aid, Nadir and his wife lived in luxury throughout the case, staying in a £23,000-a-month Mayfair mansion and being chauffeur-driven by minders. Mrs Nadir, who is reported to be back in Britain while the divorce is finalised, could not be contacted for comment. Mrs Nevzat could not be contacted either.","Nur Nadir supported tycoon throughout his trial in 2012 .

"Former Premier League footballer Daniel Agger and his family were left ‘heartbroken’ after their pet dog was killed during a trip to a dog salon, his wife has revealed. Sofie Agger, wife of the ex-Liverpool star, posted a photograph of Charlie the dog on Instagram, saying that he ‘went to the groomer and never came home again’. Mrs Agger said workers at the salon, which has not been named, put him in ‘some dryer box’ last week and it was unclear whether the machine was faulty or the animal was simply forgotten about. Salon death: Sofie Agger, wife of footballer Daniel, posted this photograph of Charlie the dog on Instagram . The footballer’s wife, whom he married in 2010, said of Charlie on December 6: ‘We lost him today and our family are totally heartbroken. He went to the groomer and never came home again. ‘They put him in some dryer box and we still don’t know if they forgot him or the machine had a fault. Are such in shock and still can grasp that our dog had pain like that and then died [sic]. ‘Dearly hope anyone who has a machine like that stop using them. Know it’s a long shot but as I said we’re heartbroken. We will miss you Charlie.’ The interior designer, who studied at Liverpool John Moores University, said of the photograph she posted that the dog was pictured ‘at his best’, adding: ‘This is how we wanna remember him.’ Couple: Daniel Agger married his wife Sofie in 2010 (left).

"Manchester United fear Robin van Persie could be on the sidelines for a further six weeks with a repeat of a thigh injury he suffered at Arsenal. David Moyes desperately needs his principal striker back and, as problems mount, on Friday he confirmed that Wayne Rooney would also miss Saturday's clash against Swansea. But the more serious concern for Moyes is Van Persie, the manager admitting that he ‘would not want to put a date’ on the 30-year-old’s return even after sending him to Holland to work with a fitness coach at PSV Eindhoven. Attacking loss: Van Persie could be out for another six weeks as he recovers from a thigh injury . Egg-ceptional: Robin van Persie posted a picture of his breakfast with head chef Mike Donnelly to Instagram . Such is the unpredictability of the injury the specialists have told United he could return sooner than feared. But Sportsmail understands there is a chance Van Persie could take much longer to recover. He suffered the same injury at Arsenal in December 2007 and did not play in the Premier League between December 16 and March 9, making only 15 appearances. The Dutchman has not been available to Moyes since December 10 and yesterday United’s manager also revealed that Rooney has been sent to Egypt for warm-weather recuperation with a member of the club’s fitness staff, trying to be fit to face Chelsea on January 19. Decline: United have lost all three of their games this year 2-1, and will be hoping to stop the rot . Lengthy absence: Van Persie hasn't played since coming on as a substitute in the 1-0 Champions League win over Shakhtar on December 10, and it may be late February until he's seen next . On Van Persie, Moyes said: ‘We are trying to get him back but it’s a thigh strain similar to the one he had at Arsenal so we are having to manage it correctly. ‘He has been to Holland to work with the guy he knows over there and we are doing everything we can. There are some injuries you can play with but not the thigh.’ Explaining the situation with Rooney, Moyes added: ‘Wayne has been sent away on a sort of hot-weather break. I always hoped I would be able to do it at some point in the season and his groin has not quite recovered yet. Down and out: Wayne Rooney has been kept on the United sidelines through a groin injury . 'We have sent a fitness coach with him and he is away with his family to give him a break. He will continue working because I want to keep him in good shape, and hopefully we’ll get him fit for Chelsea.’ Moyes came in for fresh criticism yesterday from someone who would have been considered a loyal servant of United; former academy director Eric Harrison. Asked if he thought Moyes could turn it around, Harrison replied: ‘At this moment in time, no.’ Harrison was also critical of changes to the coaching staff. Watching on: It means David Moyes will be without his star man as he looks to avoid yet another defeat . Moyes brought in Steve Round, Phil Neville, Jimmy Lumsden and Chris Woods from Everton as replacements for Mike Phelan, Rene Meulensteen and Eric Steele. Speaking to Sky, Harrison said: ‘In hindsight it does look like a mistake, I don’t want to criticise anyone but I’ve got to be honest. They certainly should have kept the staff. They shouldn’t have brought so many in from Everton.’ Moyes responded, saying: ‘I asked Rene to stay at the club so it wasn’t as if I came in here and said, “Let’s get rid of everybody”. ‘I’ve kept all the other backroom staff. I don’t think that’s got anything to do with it at all.’ Meanwhile, beleagured Moyes was charged by the FA yesterday over comments about match officials after last week’s Sunderland defeat. Moyes said his team are ‘having to play them as well as the opposition at the moment’. Meanwhile, left-back Fabio da Silva could be on his way to Cardiff City for the rest of the season with former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer eyeing up a move. Lightning strike twice?

"Military chiefs failed to calculate the potential dangers and the size of the forces needed for the war in Afghanistan, General Sir Peter Wall admitted yesterday, . The former Chief of the General Staff made the damning statement in a BBC documentary ahead of the upcoming withdrawal of Western troops from the country after 13 years of war. Another senior military commander said the UK was ‘under-prepared, under-resourced’ and had no clear strategy to succeed in the conflict. A senior military commander said the UK was ‘under-prepared, under-resourced’ and had no clear strategy to succeed in Afghanistan conflict. File picture . In a scathing critique of the UK’s involvement in Afghanistan, a series of British military commanders admitted a failure to appreciate the size of the task and that mistakes were made in the build-up to the fight. At times, troops were so stretched there was a risk they would be ‘massacred’, it was claimed. Sir Peter, who retired this year, said: ‘We had put forward a plan… saying that… for the limited objectives that we had set ourselves, this was a reasonable force. And I freely admit now, that calculus was wrong.’ The two programmes analyse the muddled decision-making process that led the British government to send 3,300 troops to the country as part of the Nato force in 2006. The documentary revealed that the British military was fully aware it could not wage more than one campaign for any length of time. The documentary revealed that the British military was fully aware it could not wage more than one campaign for any length of time . But, despite being already heavily engaged in Iraq, the UK pressed ahead with a decision to step up its commitment in Afghanistan. In a two-part programme entitled The Lion’s Last Roar?, Brigadier Ed Butler, Commander of the British Forces in Helmand in 2006, said: ‘We were under-prepared, we were under-resourced, and most importantly, we didn’t have a clear and achievable strategy to deliver success.’ His comments reveal a marked difference from his view in 2006 – as the UK stepped up their campaign against the Taliban – when he said that British forces were ‘well-prepared and well-equipped’ to deal with the insurgency. General Lord Dannatt, former Chief of the General Staff, added: ‘We knew that we were heading for two considerable size operations and we really only had the organisation and manpower for one. Therefore perhaps we should have revisited the decision…We didn’t do that.’ In the summer of 2006, some British forces in Afghanistan found themselves effectively stranded in a number of outposts in the north of Helmand province. ‘There was a real danger… that we would find a platoon cut off and potentially massacred,’ said Lord Dannatt. In 2012, David Cameron announced Britain would withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. General Lord Richards, former Chief of the Defence Staff, said he had fought against the decision to announce this. He said: ‘I felt a deadline of that nature was too trusting in our ability to deliver the outcome required.’ The conflict has raised doubts over whether Britain will take part in similar military operations. Bruce Riedel, an adviser to President Obama in 2009, said: ‘The US has a better appreciation after the war in Afghanistan of the limits on British power. It will be interesting to see if Afghanistan marks the end of Britain as a global military power.’ Soldiers carrying equipment towards a helicopter during the closure of Observation Post Sterga 2 in Afghanistan's Helmand Province .","UK was ‘under-prepared, under-resourced’ and had no clear strategy .

"The Metropolitan Police Commissioner admitted that the return of militarised jihadis to the streets of the UK posed a threat . At least five Britons a week are heading to Syria to fight for Islamic State terrorists, Britain’s top policeman has warned. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the true figure was likely to be far higher as officers cannot keep watch on all routes to the war zone. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner admitted that the return of militarised jihadis to the streets of the UK posed a threat. More than 500 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria to fight, half of whom may have returned. But police believe that number will leap by 50 per cent within a year, despite the deaths of up to 30 British jihadis in the fighting and outrage at IS’s beheading of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines. Sir Bernard told the National Security Summit in London: ‘Five a week doesn’t sound much but when you realise there are 50-odd weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50 per cent more than we think have gone already. ‘Those numbers are a minimum. There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders.’ Sir Bernard has backed plans to hand police the power to seize passports if they suspect Britons are travelling abroad to fight with terror groups. He also called for airlines to hand over passenger lists with much more notice. Scotland Yard has seen its terrorist arrest rate rocket by 70 per cent in the past three years, with 218 suspects held so far this year. Cash seizures and interventions at borders are also up by 50 per cent. UK spy planes and armed drones will fly missions over Syria in a significant escalation of Britain’s involvement in the conflict, the Ministry of Defence announced yesterday. RAF Reaper drones will be used to gather intelligence on the threat from IS after being redeployed from Afghanistan. They will be used alongside Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft, a spy plane that carries sophisticated eavesdropping sensors. Although the unmanned drones are armed, their weapons will not be used in Syria, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon stressed. Militant: Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, who was a former security guard for Morrisons, said on social media that he is now a member of the hisbah, the IS all-male police force . RAF Reaper drones will be used to gather intelligence on the threat from IS after being redeployed from Afghanistan. File picture . The Government has ruled out military action in Syria without agreement from Parliament and the surveillance move may be seen by some MPs as ‘mission creep’. An Islamic convert has mown down and killed a Canadian soldier in an attack feared to have been inspired by the murder of Lee Rigby. A second soldier was injured by Ahmad Rouleau who called police afterwards to boast of what he had done. Rouleau, 25, drove off but was shot dead when he charged at officers. The attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, near Montreal, appears similar to the murder of Drummer Rigby, who was run down and stabbed to death outside his barracks in London in May last year by two Muslim extremists.","But Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the true figure could be far higher .

"GCHQ now concentrates on the ‘darkest places’ of the internet inhabited by ‘the plotters, the proliferators and the paedophiles’, its outgoing head stressed yesterday. Its staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploited the so-called ‘dark web’, Sir Iain Lobban said. Sir Iain, who retires this month after six years in charge, also insisted Britain’s electronic eavesdropping agency did not engage in ‘anything remotely resembling mass surveillance’. While he acknowledged that tracking down perpetrators online meant accessing the internet ‘at scale’, he said his organisation was committed to delivering security while protecting privacy to the ‘greatest extent possible’. Surveillance: The GCHQ listening post in Cheltenham, where its staff monitor the 'darkest places' of the internet . His comments come after a turbulent year for the intelligence agency, overshadowed by the disclosures of the former US intelligence operative Edward Snowden. GCHQ has also come under criticism after it was revealed earlier this year they are allowed to spy on British citizens’ use of Facebook, Google and Twitter without an individual warrant because the firms are based overseas. Speaking at the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall, Sir Iain issued an impassioned defence of its work, while paying tribute to his staff, some of whom he said had made ‘the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty’ - although he gave no further details. Referring to his staff, he added: ‘The people who work at GCHQ would sooner walk out the door than be involved in anything remotely resembling ‘mass surveillance’. ‘My staff are the embodiment of British values, not a threat to them.’ GCHQ and its American counterpart, the NSA, came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic after Mr Snowden leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities. After Mr Snowden revealed GCHQ was gathering millions of pieces of data on British citizens, Sir Iain was forced to defend his organisation to MPs in an unprecedented public hearing. In response to whistleblower Edward Snowden's (pictured) claims that GCHQ is spying on British citizens, Sir Iain said his staff would rather 'walk out the door' than engage in mass surveillance . In the hearing before the government’s Intelligence and Security Committee, alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6, he claimed terrorists had started changing their tactics because of Mr Snowden’s revelations. Yesterday Sir Iain sought to underline the scale of the challenge facing the agencies - describing the ‘enormous exodus’ to the internet as ‘the biggest migration in human history’. He said that only a small percentage of all the emails, texts and images sent globally were within reach of GCHQ’s sensors - of which only a small percentage were actually intercepted. But he acknowledged the volumes were still large. He said: ‘We access the internet at scale so as to dissect it with surgical precision. Practically, it is now impossible to operate successfully in any other way. ‘You can’t pick and choose the components of a global interception system that you like - catching terrorists and paedophiles - and those you don’t - incidental collection of data at scale: it’s one integrated system.’ With the ‘vast majority’ of such criminal threats to the UK coming from groups or individuals based abroad, Sir Iain said strong intelligence and cyber capabilities were needed to identify and - where they were beyond the reach of international law enforcement - directly disrupt them. He said: “We all now know that the beautiful dream of the Internet as a totally ungoverned space was just that – a beautiful dream. Like all utopian visions, it was flawed because it failed to account for the persistence of the worst aspects of human nature. Sir Iain said his organisation was committed to delivering security while ensuring privacy to the 'greatest extent possible' 'Alongside the blessings – the comprehensive information, the communities of interest, the commercial opportunities and efficiencies – there are the plotters, the proliferators and the paedophiles. From what we know of ungoverned spaces in the real world, do we really believe that the world would be a better place if the Internet becomes an ungoverned space where anybody can act freely with impunity?” He added: ‘Those who would do us harm don’t want to be found. They use certain routers or applications to hide in the darkest places of the internet. ‘We have to enter that labyrinth to find them. We work to crack their defences. We have to understand what adversaries seek to do to us and dedicate ourselves to preventing them from realising their plans.’ He stressed that the ‘core’ of GCHQ’s mission was ‘the protection of liberty, not the erosion of it’ and that it actively sought to minimise intrusion into people’s everyday lives. He added: ‘By definition, the acquisition, aggregation, usage, sharing and retention of information involve varying degrees of interference with, or intrusion into, the privacy rights of individuals. ‘So those activities can only be undertaken if judged to be necessary in the interests of our statutory purposes - national security, economic well-being or the prevention and detection of serious crime - and proportionate in what we seek to achieve.’ GCHQ was formed in 1919 and employed Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing in the Second World War.","GCHQ hunts paedophiles in the 'darkest places' of the internet, boss claims .

"A mother who battered her toddler son to death has been allowed prison visits from his twin sister and her three other children, it emerged yesterday. Rosdeep Adekoya beat three-year-old Mikaeel Kular for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before she eventually led officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife. Scroll down for video . Rosdeep Adekoya, pictured with her son Mikaeel, was sentenced to jail for 11 years after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide for the killing of her three-year-old son Mikaeel . Adekoya (left) has provoked fury from justice campaigners with news she is being visited by Mikaeel's (right) siblings . The 34-year-old avoided a murder trial and the possibility of a life sentence of up to 35 years after a court accepted her guilty plea to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. Adekoya was visited by Mikaeel’s twin sister on what would have been his fourth birthday. She is also allowed access to her other three children aged ten, eight and six, every fortnight in the visitor centre of Cornton Vale women’s prison in Stirling, central Scotland. Last night campaigners branded the visits ‘disgusting’. The party-mad single mother – who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine – was jailed for 11 years last month and could be free within seven. Five thousand local residents have signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Last night a former neighbour to Adekoya, Julie MacLeod, who started the petition, told the Daily Mail: ‘The fact she is now seeing her other children is disgusting. ‘She killed one of them and when she did that she should have lost her right to see the others. ‘She doesn’t deserve to have them and she could be a danger to them. Why should she have that privilege when she has robbed them of their brother?’ Psychologist Gladeana McMahon told the Sunday People: ‘You have to think about the psychological trauma of a child having to visit a parent in prison and then come away.’ During the court case it emerged that Adekoya had failed to form a motherly bond with Mikaeel. Her internet search history in the weeks before his death included phrases such as: ‘I find it hard to love my son’, ‘I love all of my children except one’, ‘Why am I so aggressive with my son’ and ‘get rid of bruises’. Mikaeel’s father Zahid Saeed, a 30-year-old chef, said he believed Adekoya beat their son to death because ‘he was a miniature version of me’. He told the Sunday People: ‘She saw it as killing my legacy. Her obsession made her love me and hate me too. She would stop at nothing to hurt me for rejecting her.’ Social services were widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. An independent significant case review is going to be held.

"The sick father of British hostage John Cantlie yesterday issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son’s release. In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him. He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them. Scroll down for video . Speaking from a hospital bed, John Cantlie's father Paul has appealed for his son to be freed by ISIS militants . His sole contact with his son in nearly two years has been three video clips showing Mr Cantlie speaking, one in which he says he may die. Mr Cantlie, a 43-year-old photojournalist, was first shown in a propaganda video last month, where he claimed he had been ‘abandoned’ by the Government and pleaded with them to negotiate with his captors. The slickly-made video, which had Arabic subtitles, marked a significant change of tactics by IS, which had previously released barbaric footage of hostages being executed in a desert. Two more videos were later released, one on Monday night, showing Mr Cantlie, who was abducted in November 2012, speaking out against US action in Iraq and Syria. Footage of the journalist, dressed in orange and sitting behind a desk as he spoke to the camera, was released by his captors last month . In an emotional appeal, Mr Cantlie describes how 'very proud' he is of John and tells his captors that his son is a 'good man' Widower Mr Cantlie, from Hampshire, was speaking with the help of a voice aid, having had surgery for throat cancer. At times he is shown holding his hand to his throat as he struggles to speak and some of his words are barely comprehensible. Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die. ‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.’ Mr Cantlie explained how his son was seized in northern Syria, where he had been working as an independent photojournalist. He added: ‘John felt a strong need to help in the best way that he could: as an impartial and respected journalist he knew that he could make a difference by acting as a platform for the world to listen to and take notice, using his journalistic skills for the good of the people, as a friend and as a civilian.’ In the five-and-a-half minute clip, recorded by the BBC, Mr Cantlie spoke of how he was proud of his son and was desperate to see him again. ‘Speaking entirely for myself, this is not how I had imagined I would be passing my 81st year. I want John to know how very proud I am of him. I can think of no greater joy than seeing my dear son released and allowed to return home to us,’ he said. Mr Cantlie said he and his family are trying to communicate with the Islamic State to deliver an ‘important message regarding John’ and said they can only hope that it has been received but they have had no response. Addressing his son’s captors, he said: ‘To those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’ The appeal was initiated by Mr Cantlie’s family who wanted to make contact with the militants. It was approved by the Foreign Office which provided support and advice to the family. Propaganda videos posted by ISIS have shown the British hostage criticising Obama's military strategy for combating the terror group, while appearing to read from a script .

My son John Henry Cantlie has been held as a prisoner by the Islamic State since 2012. 'For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die. 'As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness. 'He was seized in northern Syria, where he had been working as an independent photo journalist, seeking out the true story of the suffering of the Syrian people and ensuring the world was made aware of their plight. 'John felt a strong need to help in the best way that he could: as an impartial and respected journalist he knew that he could make a difference by acting as a platform for the world to listen to and take notice, using his journalistic skills for the good of the people; as a friend and as a civilian. 'I have had many messages saying they cannot conceive what we, his family & all those who love him, must be feeling. 'Speaking entirely for myself, this is not how I had imagined I would be passing my 81st year. I want John to know how very proud I am of him. I can think of no greater joy than seeing my dear son again, released and allowed to return to those that love him.

"Disgraced: Major Armstrong has been stripped of his Military Cross after it was revealed he helped to write his own citation . An officer who was awarded one of Britain’s most coveted gallantry medals for his bravery in Afghanistan has been stripped of it after he exaggerated his heroism. It is the first time the Queen has rescinded a gallantry medal issued to a serviceman and the case could undermine confidence in the awards system in the armed forces. Major Robert Michael Armstrong had been accused of taking credit for others’ bravery after Taliban gunmen ambushed a convoy in Helmand in 2008. Armstrong was awarded the Military Cross for dodging bullets and inspiring Afghan troops to fire rockets at the enemy. But a five-year investigation by defence chiefs concluded he helped to write the medal citation. As a result, the medal will be withdrawn in a decision due to be announced by the London Gazette – the journal which publishes official notices. Former Army Major Charles Heyman told the Mail: ‘It raises questions on the whole awards process. ‘It is good to hear that the Army has come clean and withdrawn his award. Nothing annoys a soldier more than people getting awards that they are not entitled to.’ Armstrong, through his lawyers, said he had had ‘no role in corroborating events referred to in the citation’ and said there were ‘shortcomings and irregularities’ in the process used by senior officers. He also said a report had found there had been ‘no attempt’ to check the facts with any of the Afghan National Army personnel. Gallantry awards are subject to several checks. When a soldier performs an act of bravery on operations, the most superior officer present normally drafts a citation. He or she would speak to all of those present at the action, and they may even speak to the subject themselves to ask what they did – without letting them know they are writing a citation. According to a guide on Honours and Awards in the armed forces, the subject of a citation should not know their name has been put forward. Under no circumstance should they have any part in writing their own citation. The ‘theatre’ commander in charge then assesses citations. The Chief of Joint Operations has his say, followed by the Ministry of Defence’s Armed Forces Operational Awards Committee. Their findings are then looked at by the Services Honours Committee and submitted by the Defence Secretary to the Queen. Last night a defence source told the Mail: ‘Everyone in the Army, especially all those who have been awarded gallantry medals for selfless acts of bravery, will appreciate this robust action. 'The threshold for British gallantry awards is exceptionally high and this announcement ensures their achievements are not undermined.’ In 2008, Armstrong, 41, was a Royal Artillery officer attached to the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment battle group in Helmand. A mixed British and Afghan convoy came under attack from the Taliban, allegedly with roadside bombs, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns. His citation praised his ‘swift, instinctive actions, personal courage and disregard for his own life’, and stated: ‘As a result of his calm leadership under fire losses were prevented and the lives of those injured were saved.’ He was awarded the Military Cross in 2009 ‘for his consistent bravery and inspirational leadership’. Dismissed: Major Armstrong arrives at his court martial in 2012 where he admitted four charges of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline . But upon announcement of the award in spring 2009, it is understood fellow soldiers in the ambush disputed the claims. Two corporals were reported to have claimed there was no hostile fire by the Taliban when a vehicle in their convoy was blown up. The Sunday Telegraph reported at the time that the officer who made the initial complaint felt aggrieved that actions attributed to Major Armstrong were those of other officers. A junior officer lodged a formal complaint and Army chiefs then called in the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police. Separately, the commander of Britain’s 16 Air Assault Brigade, Brigadier Giles Hill, was ordered to carry out a review into the citation. It is understood that he described the Royal Irish Regiment’s performance in handling citations as ‘dysfunctional’. He found significant disparities between what Armstrong claimed had happened and what actually occurred and that the citation contained a number of falsehoods. Lieutenant Colonel Ed Freely, commanding officer of the Royal Irish Battle Group, was arrested and interviewed over claims he had failed to check facts in Major Armstrong’s citation. By this time Major Armstrong had been posted to Northern Ireland headquarters in Lisburn, Co Antrim. It was there, two months after the announcement of his award, that he was arrested. When the Military Police examined his personal computer – to see if he had indeed written himself up for the MC – they found instead that he had illegally stored almost 160 classified documents. A search of his quarters uncovered an inoperative automatic pistol, more than 270 rounds of ammunition and a morphine injector. In February 2012 he appeared before a court martial in Colchester, Essex, and admitted four charges of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline. He was dismissed and handed a year’s imprisonment suspended for two years. Brigadier Hill’s report, and that of the Special Investigation Branch, was sent through the chain of command to the Armed Forces Operational Awards Committee. The committee is chaired by the Defence Services Secretary, Rear Admiral Simon Williams, who is responsible for liaison between the Queen and the forces. He briefed her Majesty on the recommendation and the Queen signed the rescinding order. Armstrong is believed to have declined to appeal and offered to voluntarily decline the award, provided there was no publicity. The MoD said it could ‘confirm that an investigation has concluded into the circumstances surrounding the award of a gallantry medal relating to an incident in Afghanistan.’","Major Robert Michael Armstrong handed medal after Taliban ambush in 2008 .

"A family firm has accused Amazon of using ‘bullying’ tactics to kill off small businesses. Healthy lifestyle company UK Juicers used the internet giant’s online marketplace to sell its products, hoping to expand its customer base. But the firm said that rather than just selling the goods, Amazon tracked which products did well before going directly to suppliers and offering the same items more cheaply. Scroll down for video . UK Juicers, based in York, says it has exclusive UK rights to sell The Spiralizer, pictured above, which turns vegetables and fruit into pasta-like ribbons . But directors Nick Ledger and Paul Hellawell say they are now being undercut by Amazon, who allegedly went straight to the German manufacturers to sell the product itself . This ‘underhand practice’ leaves small businesses unable to compete as they cannot match Amazon’s prices, UK Juicers claimed. The . directors of the York-based firm, Nick Ledger and his uncle Paul . Hellawell, said: ‘It’s not just an economy of scale offering better . prices to the consumer – it’s also an economy of bullying and strong-arm . tactics.’ UK Juicers sells a kitchen gadget known as a ‘spiralizer’ that turns vegetables into pasta-like ribbons. It . can be used to spin a courgette into a bowl of ‘spaghetti’, for . example, and has proved popular with healthy eaters. The firm said it . had obtained the exclusive UK rights to sell the machine, made by German . manufacturer Lurch, and set up a deal to trade through Amazon . Marketplace. But after UK . Juicers was ‘upgraded’ to Amazon’s premium sellers’ service this summer, . its owners noticed the Lurch spiralizer was now also being sold . directly by Amazon. Mr Ledger told The Independent: ‘Amazon was soon . undercutting us by going directly to the manufacturer we’d worked so . hard to locate and secure. It then charged us for the stock we had . sitting in its warehouses but could no longer shift.’ When . UK Juicers complained and pulled out of the deal, Amazon boasted it . sought to stock ‘every product on earth’ and refused to ‘promise not to . go direct with certain manufacturers’. Stacy Mitchell, from the . Institute for Local Self-Reliance in the US, said: ‘Small . retailers … feel they have no choice but to become an Amazon seller. It’s a deal with the devil, though. ‘You . are basically giving your biggest competitor everything you have of . value, including your product expertise and your customers.’ An Amazon spokesman said its sellers’ services were ‘democratising the ability to start an online business’. Amazon said it was 'democratising the ability to start an online business in the UK' and had helped thousands of small businesses . Amazon is driving book publishers ‘to the wall’ as it rakes in huge profits, a leading industry figure claimed. Toby . Munday, former chief executive of Atlantic Books, claimed the online . retailer’s grip on the publishing market was changing it beyond . recognition.

"No bride wants to be upstaged on her wedding day. But Amanda Vasey was more than happy to share the limelight...when her best friend went into labour moments after arriving for the ceremony.

"A GCHQ chief says staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploit the so-called 'dark web'. File picture . GCHQ now concentrates on the 'darkest places' of the internet inhabited by 'the plotters, the proliferators and the paedophiles', its outgoing head stressed yesterday. Its staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploit the so-called 'dark web', Sir Iain Lobban said. Sir Iain, who retires this month after six years in charge, also insisted Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency did not engage in 'anything remotely resembling mass surveillance'. While he acknowledged that tracking down perpetrators online meant accessing the internet 'at scale', he said his organisation was committed to delivering security while protecting privacy to the 'greatest extent possible'. His comments come after a turbulent year for the intelligence agency, overshadowed by the disclosures of the former US intelligence operative Edward Snowden. GCHQ has also come under criticism after it was revealed earlier this year they are allowed to spy on British citizens' use of Facebook, Google and Twitter without an individual warrant because the firms are based overseas. Speaking at the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall, Sir Iain issued an impassioned defence of its work, while paying tribute to his staff, some of whom he said had made 'the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty' - although he gave no further details. Referring to his staff, he added: 'The people who work at GCHQ would sooner walk out the door than be involved in anything remotely resembling 'mass surveillance'. 'My staff are the embodiment of British values, not a threat to them.' GCHQ and its American counterpart, the NSA, came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic after Mr Snowden leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities. After Mr Snowden revealed GCHQ was gathering millions of pieces of date on British citizens, Sir Iain was forced to defend his organisation to MPs in an unprecedented public hearing. In the hearing before the government's Intelligence and Security Committee, alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6, he claimed terrorists had started changing their tactics because of Mr Snowden's revelations. Director of GCHQ Sir Iain Lobban said: 'My staff are the embodiment of British values, not a threat to them' Yesterday Sir Iain sought to underline the scale of the challenge facing the agencies - describing the 'enormous exodus' to the internet as 'the biggest migration in human history'. He said that only a small percentage of all the emails, texts and images sent globally were within reach of GCHQ's sensors - of which only a small percentage were actually intercepted. But he acknowledged the volumes were still large. He said: 'We access the internet at scale so as to dissect it with surgical precision. Practically, it is now impossible to operate successfully in any other way. 'You can't pick and choose the components of a global interception system that you like - catching terrorists and paedophiles - and those you don't - incidental collection of data at scale: it's one integrated system.' With the 'vast majority' of such criminal threats to the UK coming from groups or individuals based abroad, Sir Iain said strong intelligence and cyber capabilities were needed to identify and - where they were beyond the reach of international law enforcement - directly disrupt them. He said: 'We all now know that the beautiful dream of the Internet as a totally ungoverned space was just that – a beautiful dream. Like all utopian visions, it was flawed because it failed to account for the persistence of the worst aspects of human nature. 'Alongside the blessings – the comprehensive information, the communities of interest, the commercial opportunities and efficiencies – there are the plotters, the proliferators and the paedophiles. 'From what we know of ungoverned spaces in the real world, do we really believe that the world would be a better place if the Internet becomes an ungoverned space where anybody can act freely with impunity?' GCHQ (pictured) and its American counterpart, the NSA, came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic after Edward Snowden leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities . He added: 'Those who would do us harm don't want to be found. They use certain routers or applications to hide in the darkest places of the internet. 'We have to enter that labyrinth to find them. We work to crack their defences. We have to understand what adversaries seek to do to us and dedicate ourselves to preventing them from realising their plans.' He stressed that the 'core' of GCHQ's mission was 'the protection of liberty, not the erosion of it' and that it actively sought to minimise intrusion into people's everyday lives. He added: 'By definition, the acquisition, aggregation, usage, sharing and retention of information involve varying degrees of interference with, or intrusion into, the privacy rights of individuals. 'So those activities can only be undertaken if judged to be necessary in the interests of our statutory purposes - national security, economic well-being or the prevention and detection of serious crime - and proportionate in what we seek to achieve.' GCHQ was formed in 1919 and employed Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing in the Second World War.","Sir Iain Lobban said agency is not engaged in 'mass surveillance'

"George Osborne famously started wearing a sleep-monitoring wristband when he was given one for his birthday in May. But it seems the gadget – designed to check its wearer gets a good night’s sleep – may do more harm than good. Experts suggest the devices – which cost around £100 – give buyers an extra thing to worry about. Sleep gadgets can make a person sleep less well because they become obsessed with sleep and worry too much about, experts say (stock image) Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, from the London Sleep Centre, said: ‘People can become obsessed about their sleep through these gadgets, worrying about it and in turn getting less decent sleep.’ The wristbands link up with a smartphone app to allow users to monitor their every toss and turn in bed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed he used his wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime. George Osborne famously starting wearing one of the monitors at night . Former Education Secretary Michael Gove was also spotted wearing a Jawbone wristband – leading to speculation that senior ministers were struggling to sleep at night. Studies claim those who sleep for less than six hours a night have a risk of high blood pressure three times greater than those who get more than six hours. Women who sleep less than four hours a night are twice as likely to die from heart disease as those who sleep longer. Dr Ebrahim added: ‘Anything that allows you to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning is what you should be aiming for, which is generally between six and nine hours’ sleep. ‘But it's not all about time, it's about the quality of the sleep, whether you complete cycles.’ Research has suggested lack of quality sleep is linked to diabetes, obesity and cancer, not to mention deterioration of mental health and memory. Conversely, sleeping too long has also been shown to cause issues.","George Osborne started wearing band after being given it as present in May .

"A couple on benefits lived a lavish lifestyle by scamming more than £100,000 from the public by posing as children’s charity collectors. Glen and Lynne Moore bought a villa with a swimming pool, personalised number plates for their cars and regularly took expensive holidays overseas. When they were not on holiday, the shameless married couple preyed on the public’s goodwill by staging collections for children’s charities. Lynne Moore (left) and her husband of 20 years, Glen Moore (right) have been jailed for scamming £287,000 . The pair were jailed yesterday at Sheffield Crown Court for orchestrating the nationwide charity scam. The couple’s bogus collections took place in pubs, stores such as Toys R Us, at football matches and supermarkets including Sainsburys, Morrisons, Tesco and the Co-op. They even set up a bank account under a false business name to process their ill-gotten gains while living on benefits at a modest council semi in Arbourthorne, Sheffield. A total of £287,000 went through their various accounts - but as they collected cash it was impossible to pin down just how much they made dishonestly, the court heard. Richard Sheldon, prosecuting, said: ‘They collected up and down the country from members of the public but kept all the cash they received for themselves. ‘It was organised, systematic and very lucrative. Hotels were booked and paid for in various parts of the country to enable the fraud to be carried out. This was organised crime.’ Sheffield Crown Court heard Mr Moore, 45, had been married to Mrs Moore, 39, for 20 years. He was the driving force behind the scam and had never worked a day in his life. He relied solely on money obtained either through the scam or from benefits. Mr Sheldon said: ‘His only source of income was crime and benefits or whatever monies she earned, whether legitimately or fraudulently. ‘He backed up his position with violence and she travelled up and down the country to make collections which were passed to him.’ The couple splashed out 27,000 Euros over a year on a rent-to-buy scheme for a four-bedroom luxury detached Lanzarote villa with its own swimming pool which they called ‘Villa Moore’ and 4,250 Euros on a car. Their house was furnished with household gadgets and a chaise longue for 3,399 Euros. Mr Moore even used the money for the dying children to indulge in his favourite pastime of gambling. The Moores would stage fake collections for a period in the UK then jet off to Lanzarote or the United States for lengthy holidays with the proceeds. Detective Constable Gareth Rees who led investigations into the fraud said afterwards: ‘Glen just sits back in his armchair and concocts schemes to make whatever money he can. In my view Lynne was just as culpable. They were 50-50 responsible for what happened.’ Mr Moore, who absconded and is believed to be living abroad, went on trial in his absence. He was found guilty of fraud offences after a three-day trial while his wife pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. They were each convicted of four joint offences of fraud and one of acquiring criminal property. Mr Moore was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in his absence and Mrs Moore for four-and-a-half years. Handing down the sentences the judge Recorder Simon Batiste said: ‘These are in any view despicable offences.’ He said the couple had organised bogus collections on an ‘industrial scale’ and added: ‘This was deliberate targeting of a large number of vulnerable victims. They were sophisticated offences and there was considerable planning.’ Their scam began after Mrs Moore became a registered collector for the well-known London-based charity Tommy’s in 2000 which saves babies’ lives by funding research into miscarriages, still and premature births. After seeing public generosity first-hand the couple decided they wanted a part of it. The couple's modest council semi in Arbourthorne, Sheffield where they lived whilst carrying out their crimes . The last donation Mrs Moore made to Tommy’s was £1,125 in November, 2004 yet for several years afterwards she went up and down the country with collecting tins for the charity. When Tommy’s organisers became suspicious, Mrs Moore was blacklisted. But the couple simply carried on by setting up a bogus charity in Sheffield in late 2010 called Enabled, which was supposed to raise money for terminally ill and disabled children. It appeared there was only one beneficiary - an eight-year-old boy who could not talk and had to be fed by tube. His mother was given a second-hand ipad by the couple to make it look legitimate. One Enabled staff member was sacked for failing to reach the couple’s collection target of £1,000 a week. The couple opened a bogus bank account in Edinburgh, telling the bank it was for a catering firm. Police were called in following an anonymous tip and the Enabled offices were raided. At the Moores’ Sheffield home, detectives found Tommy’s collecting tins, badges and literature and a revealing diary kept by Mrs Moore. The couple were arrested but skipped bail and fled to Spain before returning but Mr Moore has since fled again. Officers combing the books could find no legitimate source of income to explain the large deposits in the couple’s various bank accounts. Over a six-year period, from 2005 to 2011, police discovered £139,581 went through Mrs Moore’s accounts, £77,880 in Mr Moore’s accounts and from 2009 to 2010 in the ‘Coffee House’ accounts, £69,552. During this time Mrs Moore only earned a few thousand pounds from low-paid restaurant jobs. When arrested, Mr Moore claimed allegations he had a lavish lifestyle abroad were ‘funny and hilarious’. In her diary on April 10, 2009 Mrs Moore wrote: ‘Don’t know what to do. Just want to do what is right and legal. Sick of lies and conning people.’ While in Lanzarote on May 3 that year she wrote: “Don’t want to live here. I don’t belong here. Glen punched my arm three times and had a knife to my throat wish never met him.’ She said of the bogus collecting: ‘I didn’t really want to do it.’ She sobbed in court when it was put to her that both children and adults had been defrauded but added: ‘I did it for my own safety.’ The court heard Mr Moore had previously served several jail terms for burglary and importing drugs, while his wife has several convictions for deception.","Glen and Lynne Moore bought a luxury villa with a swimming pool and a car .

"Peter Lewis channels his income in a way that potentially allows him to avoid paying tens of thousands of pounds in income tax and national insurance . Britain's highest earning council boss is paid £318,500 a year for a four-day week – but uses his own company in a scheme that reduces tax bills, it has emerged. Peter Lewis channels his income in a way that potentially allows him to avoid paying tens of thousands of pounds in income tax and national insurance. The 60-year-old works as  director of children’s services at Somerset County Council. A recruitment agency takes a fee – typically 10 per cent. But even after their cut is deducted Mr Lewis would still be left with an annual income of £286,650 – more than double the £142,500 paid to the Prime Minister. It has now been revealed the council pays the executive through his own private company, StubbsStorey Ltd, which is registered in Hampshire and is co-owned by his wife Lynn. Unlike council employees, Mr Lewis can choose how much pay to take from the business and minimise the tax he pays. Using such an arrangement typically allows recipients to avoid paying income tax at 45 per cent and 12 per cent national insurance. If Mr Lewis pays himself by dividends, he faces only flat-rate corporation tax – possibly as low as 21 per cent. As the company is also in his wife’s name, he could also pay her an annual dividend and they could utilise both of their personal tax allowances. There is no suggestion of any wrong-doing. Last night Mr Lewis refused to comment on allegations he was behaving ‘unethically’ when approached at his Southampton bungalow. Asked why he wasn’t paying income tax in the usual way he replied: ‘How do you know I’m not?’ The 60-year-old works as  director of children's services at Somerset County Council (pictured) The tax avoidance scheme was criticised by MPs in 2012 after it emerged it was exploited by thousands of civil servants. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, called it ‘totally wrong’. Tessa Munt, the Lib Dem MP for Wells in Somerset, said she wanted it to be made illegal for local authority employees to avoid tax in such a way. She told the Sunday Times: ‘This sort of arrangement is exactly what drives the voters to despair about politics.’ Mr Lewis, who replaced  disgraced Sharon Shoesmith at London’s Haringey council over the Baby P scandal, was hired by Somerset last year. The council, which is trying to save £18million, admitted the cost was ‘substantial’ but claimed there is a shortage of children’s services directors.","Peter Lewis is director of children’s services at Somerset County Council .

"A picturesque fishing village on the outskirts of Barcelona is under siege – from drunken Britons. To the horror of locals, young tourists are flocking to the fashionable neighbourhood of Barceloneta for outrageous all-night raves. Now residents have swung into action to prevent the area from becoming another Magaluf or Ibiza, which have embraced boozy visitors with raucous bar crawls and cheap drinks deals. A protester holds up a sign reading 'Out with binge tourism' as hundreds of people shout slogans during a demonstration against 'binge tourism' and illegal accommodations in La Barceloneta, Barcelona . The three Italian men were seen running round Barcelona's streets stark naked in the middle of the day . Protests involving up to 200 demonstrators began a week ago – and have continued daily since. Last week, a picture of naked Italian tourists frolicking around Barcelona sparked protests over drunken holidaymakers in the Catalan city. The picture of the three naked Italian men, which infuriated residents of La Barceloneta, a district of the Spanish city, was posted online by photographer Vicens Forner's blog two weeks ago. The men were seen running out of a supermarket with no clothes on in broad daylight, and did not appear to be drunk. Since then anger has been brewing, resulting in the protests this week. Blocks of flats rented to holidaymakers have reportedly been targeted, with chants of ‘out, out, out, drunken tourists’. One local, Andrés Antebi, said: ‘Imagine you’re in a tiny house, with three children, unemployed, with no money for vacations ... and you have to put up with the screams and fiesta of tourists next door. It’s unbearable.’ Others said the authorities had been too slow to address the situation. Oriol Casabella, who leads the local neighbourhood association, said: ‘We’re tired of low-cost, drunken tourism. It’s killing our neighbourhood and dissuading other types of tourists. It’s Magaluf all over again.’ The outpouring of anger came after one group of male tourists ran naked through a supermarket. Others had unashamedly urinated on doorsteps. Prior to the 1992 Olympics, Barceloneta, in the city’s Ciutat Vella district, was a pretty fishing village. But after the Games came the tourists – many of them British, and many of them behaving badly. Now locals fear that Barcelona’s reputation as a cultural hub treasured for its impressive architecture and fresh seafood dishes could become a thing of the past. They believe the cheap flights from the UK offered by budget airlines could see their hometown follow in the footsteps of nearby Magaluf. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘They come here to do what they cannot do in their own countries.’ Jaume Collboni, a local councillor, told The Times: ‘This area is on the point of collapse. We don’t want it become like other resorts.’ Other areas of Spain have already begun to clamp down on inappropriate behaviour by issuing fines. Indeed, Barcelona was among several places to introduce penalties of up to £240 for wearing only a bikini or swimming trunks away from the beach. On-the-spot fines are also being issued to those who are drinking alcohol on the streets. A protester holds up a sign reading 'La Barceloneta is not for rent' after an image of three naked Italian men was published on a blog by a resident of the Barcelona district . But despite these measures, residents in Barceloneta have passed pictures to local newspaper La Vanguardia showing a gaggle of nude male tourists flouting the rules in a supermarket. Another photo showed two women frolicking in a paddling pool in the middle of the road. Barcelona city council has agreed to send more police to restore order to the area, and ensure tourists comply with bylaws designed to curb antisocial behaviour. The unrest follows several high-profile examples of bad behaviour in British tourism hotspots. Last month, in Magaluf, locals were horrified when an 18-year-old girl was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men in a bar, only to be rewarded with a free drink. Barceloneta has changed dramatically since 1992, with billionaires now docking their yachts at a purpose-built marina there. Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner of Chelsea Football Club, regularly has his 535-feet yacht refitted at a workshop there. The area’s soaring popularity has seen a boom in unlicensed tourist flats, with clients arriving at all hours, day and night. Locals renting flats in the village fear they could be driven out by landlords hoping to cash in on the tourist trade.","Drunken Britons flocking to fashionable neighbourhood for all-night raves .

"Hayley Southwell walked free from court today after being found guilty of engaging in sexual activity with the girl . A female PE teacher who groomed a girl pupil and then filmed them having sex in hotel rooms escaped jail yesterday. Hayley Southwell, 27, started a  relationship with the girl when she was 15 but waited until her 16th birthday to have sex with her. Yesterday Southwell was given a  12-month suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty to engaging in  sexual activity with a child under 18 in a position of trust. The court heard how Southwell had started the nine-month relationship with the pupil at The Nelson Thomlinson school, in Wigton, Cumbria, in May last year. At the time the pupil, who cannot be named, was 15 but Southwell groomed her and planned to have sex with her as soon as she turned 16. Prosecutor Greg Hoare said: ‘Police investigations did not show there was anything of a sexual nature that occurred before she turned 16. ‘It was plain they were counting down the time till this girl was 16 and thereafter a sexual relationship did occur.’ The affair came to light after the school received a telephone call in January, identifying Southwell as being in an inappropriate relationship with a pupil. Southwell, who posted pictures of girl pupils taking part in a school sports day on her Facebook page, was then arrested, and her mobile phone and two iPad tablet computers were seized from her home. The 27-year-old wept as she was spared jail after being told there was a 'degree of grooming and planning' to her behaviour . The pair embarked on a relationship with Southwell was teaching at Nelson Thomlinson School in Wigton, Cumbria (pictured) Police found a large number of . messages and images of Southwell and the girl, showing them in various . locations around the country, including in Nottingham, Liverpool, Alton . Towers and in hotel rooms. Judge Peter Hughes QC said Southwell the pair 'rather unattractively' exchanged 'explicit' messages . There . were both videos and photographs they had shared with each other, which . were ‘intimately explicit’ and of a ‘sexual nature’, it was said. Sentencing . Southwell at Carlisle Crown Court, Judge Peter Hughes QC said: ‘Anyone . who chooses a career in teaching knows that it is wholly . incomprehensible in the profession to have an inappropriate relationship . with a pupil.’ He said . that while it appeared to be a case of ‘mutual affection’, adolescent . boys and girls who were discovering and coming to terms with their . sexuality were vulnerable. He . added: ‘There was a degree of planning and in my view grooming because . this was a relationship that began before the girl concerned was ... 16. 'You and her were waiting for her to reach that birthday before you started a sexual relationship. ‘It . was rather unattractively recorded both in still and moving images and . that in my judgment was an aggravating feature in  this offence.’ The . victim, who is no longer at the school, refused to give an impact . statement to the court. In mitigation, David Polglase said Southwell had . previously kept her sexuality hidden from her mother and that she had . shown a ‘degree of bravery’ by admitting the charge. He . said she had ‘genuine emotion and feeling’ for the girl and that at the . time Southwell felt ‘emotionally vulnerable’ due to a past . relationship. Southwell, who . has no previous convictions, was also ordered to sign the sexual . offences register and has been banned from teaching.","Hayley Southwell sent 'explicit' and 'intimate' images to pupil .

"Blue suits are undergoing a surge in popularity - and are outselling their more muted counterparts by four to one . For years they’ve been pushed to the back of the wardrobe. But now blue suits are undergoing a surge in popularity – and are outselling their more muted counterparts by four to one. Figures for John Lewis show that for the first time in its 150-year history, the store is selling one blue suit every four minutes – four times the number sold in black. Meanwhile Marks and Spencer is selling twice as many blue suits as black and have doubled their range to cope with the demand. A spokesman for John Lewis said the colour’s versatility was crucial, adding that different shades meant shoppers could be more adventurous. As a result, they too have shipped in more blue designs – doubling its range of blue suits over the same period. It now sells two blue suits for every black one. Tom Saunders, a buyer for men’ s formal wear at John Lewis, said the versatility of a blue suit was key. He said that while with black it was only really possible to change the weave, there were different shades of blue and so a shopper could be more adventurous. Sales of the retailer’s bolder ‘statement’ blue suits were up 51 per cent on last year, compared with a 20 per cent rise for classic navy. Charles McKenna, buying director at menswear chain Slaters, told the Independent on Sunday: ‘Last year, various shades of grey became very popular. ‘This year, the cloth mills introduced blue in various shades, royal blue being extremely popular. ‘They key point is these suits have to be in a modern shape, slimmer fit, shorter jacket, narrower trousers and teamed with tan shoes.’ Figures for John Lewis show that for the first time in its 150-year history, the store is selling one blue suit every four minutes - four times the number sold in black. Meanwhile Marks and Spencer is selling twice as many blue suits as black and have doubled their range to cope with the demand . Slaters has also expanded its blue suit range by a quarter for this coming autumn/winter season and by a third for the spring/summer season of 2015. At Moss Bross, the formal menswear specialist, there has also been a 36 per cent year-on-year rise in the sales of blue suits. By comparison, there has been a 28 per cent drop in black suit sales. Actor Daniel Craig wore a blue suit in Casino Royale and then again appeared in a midnight-blue tux in the 2012 film Skyfall, helping to kick-start the trend. John Lewis are set to launch a new navy dinner suit for the first time this autumn at 15 of their branches across the UK.","John Lewis is selling one blue suit every four minutes .

"Changing 175 nappies and making up 80 bottles of milk each week is no easy task. But that’s just the start of new mother Sarah Ward’s to-do list. She gave birth to four babies in the space of nine months – despite fearing that she would never conceive. Scroll down for video . Surprise! Sarah Ward, 29, thought she was unable to conceive when along came Freddie (left) - followed almost exactly nine months later by triplets Stanley, Daisy and Reggie (centre). 'At times it's chaos', she said . Big brother... only just! Freddie (right) with younger siblings Stanley, Daisy and Reggie, who were born in March . Her son Freddie was nine months old when she had triplets, now aged 19 weeks, in March. All were conceived naturally. So it may not come as a surprise that the former care manager and her partner Benn Smith, 31, a postal worker, are exhausted. Brood: The couple have their hands decidedly full . Miss Ward, 29, said: ‘At times it feels more like running a nursery than a home, but we feel so blessed. ‘I was stunned when I found out I was pregnant again so soon. When we learned it was triplets we went into shock. ‘At times it’s utter chaos but we just laugh and get stuck in. ‘It takes two hours to prepare to leave the house but we don’t dwell on the hard work. I love babies so I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.’ Miss Ward had tried to conceive for more than a year and was due to see a GP for tests when she became pregnant with Freddie. So after he was born in June last year, the couple did not use birth control. Miss Ward said: ‘We wanted to have at least two children. Because it had taken so long with Freddie, we assumed it would take the same time again, if not longer.’ In fact, Freddie was only eight weeks old when she learned she was expecting. She said: ‘I started shaking. I had barely recovered from having Freddie. I was still wearing maternity clothing. I was wondering how on earth I was going to cope.’ A scan at 12 weeks revealed Miss Ward was expecting fraternal triplets. She said: ‘The sonographer paused and asked if we knew how many babies we were having. Our mouths fell open because we thought she was telling us it was twins. ‘When she said triplets I nearly fell off the bed in shock. Neither of us could speak as she turned the screen to us and pointed out three little wriggling shapes. I just started crying when I realised they would be born before Freddie was one.’ Proud: Miss Ward said: 'When she said triplets I nearly fell off the bed in shock. Neither of us could speak as she turned the screen to us and pointed out three little wriggling shapes. I just started crying when I realised' Loving family: Miss Ward with her partner Benn Smith, 31 (left) and just before she gave birth to triplets (right) Industrial operation: Looking after the four babies involves changing 175 nappies and 80 milk bottles a week . The couple, from Crayford in south-east London, were warned the pregnancy was high risk and offered a selective termination – aborting one baby to give the other two a better chance. They decided against the procedure. What the family need to look after Stanley, Reggie and Daisy: . 80 bottles of milk . 175 nappies . 42 outfits . At 33 weeks, one of the babies showed signs of distress, so surgeons at Medway Hospital, in Kent, had to perform an emergency caesarean section. Stanley was born first weighing 3lb 12oz, followed by Reggie, 4lb 7oz, and sister Daisy, at 3lb 14oz. Miss Ward said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when they kept passing over all these babies. When we saw all three side by side in their incubators it took my breath away.’ The triplets were finally allowed to come home last month. Miss Ward said: ‘It’s like a tag team operation but we still find time for a cup of tea together when they first go to bed. ‘Then it’s back to the washing and laying out all the clothes and washing bottles for the next day. A quick walk to the shop can take hours, because so many people stop and ask me if they are all mine. They can’t believe it when I say yes. ‘But I love the fuss and attention they get. I’m so proud. I once thought I couldn’t have kids and then I got the perfect family in less than a year.’ Mr Smith said: ‘I won’t pretend it isn’t exhausting but it’s lovely to see how close they all are already. ‘Still, we won’t be trying for another any time soon.’ They're a bit of a handful, but Stanley, Daisy and Reggie are now 19 weeks old and full of energy . Miss Ward added: 'A quick walk to the shop can take hours, because so many people stop and ask me if they are all mine. They can’t believe it when I say yes. But I love the fuss and attention they get. I’m so proud' FALLING pregnant so soon after having a baby is highly unlikely as breastfeeding acts as a natural contraceptive. If a mother breastfeeds regularly, there is a high chance she will be temporarily infertile due to high levels of certain hormones such as progesterone. According to the Family Planning Association, breastfeeding is a natural contraceptive method and is 98 per cent effective if undertaken regularly . But it only works if the mother breastfeeds every few hours including at night and only for the first six months of the baby’s life. After this stage women are advised to use other forms of contraception. The method - known as ‘lactational amenorrhea’ - has been considered by doctors as an effective form of contraception since the 1990s. But in reality, very few women in the Western world rely on it partly because they do not breastfeed intensively enough. Nonetheless, it is still possible for women such as Sarah Ward to become pregnant so soon after giving birth particularly if they are not breastfeeding regularly.","Sarah Ward's son Freddie was nine months old when she had triplets .

"We've all had those days. You barely get to midday before your stomach is gurgling angrily. But instead of giving in to your craving for carbs, you opt for a tuna nicoise salad from Pret A Manger, containing — according to the label on the shelf — only 168 calories. So far, so virtuous. Until you inspect the label in more detail to find the calorie count doesn’t actually include the calories in the dressing. To find that out, you have to go to the company’s website, where you’ll discover that the salad including dressing comes in at 399 calories. In other words, the dressing contains more calories than the actual salad — with 24 g of fat for good measure. Your ‘virtuous’ salad has more calories than a McDonald’s cheeseburger, which has 295. Inspect the label of some salads in more detail and you'll find the calorie count doesn’t actually include the calories in the dressing . Pret, which has more than 240 UK stores, appears to apply this practice quite liberally across its salad range. Its undressed ‘Superfood’ salad comes in at 431 calories and 17.9 g of fat, but 662 calories and 41.7 g of fat when the dressing is added. Chef’s Chicken Salad? No better. Without dressing it’s 316 calories — with dressing it’s 547, and the fat rockets from 20.7 g to 44.5 g. So is Pret a one-off? No. The same principle applies at Eat, which has 112 branches in the UK and a similar labelling system. Both Pret and Eat are signatories to the Department Of Health’s Responsibility Deal, which agreed in 2011 to a ‘core commitment to encourage and enable people to adopt a healthier diet’ Its houmous and falafel mezze salad has 395 calories undressed, but pour over the little pot of dressing and it’s almost 500 calories. Again, you have to go to its website to find this out. Its Thai rare beef noodle salad is labelled on the shelves as containing 169 calories, 4.4g of fat and 8.1g of sugar ‘undressed’. A quick check on the website finds that the dressing adds 92 calories, 3.1 g of fat and 14.3g of sugar — that’s around three-and-a-half teaspoons. Consultant dietitian Helen Bond says: ‘Those dressings can add a significant number of calories, which is potentially not good news for your waistline, cholesterol levels, dental health and blood pressure. The phrase 'salad days' was coined by Shakespeare in 1606 in his play Antony And Cleopatra . ‘An extra 231 calories from a dressing each day over five days provides an additional 1,155 calories. One pound of fat contains 3,500 calories, so if you eat the same Pret tuna nicoise salad every day with dressing, over a month you would add 4,620 calories — more than a pound of weight gain.’ Both Pret and Eat are signatories to the Department Of Health’s Responsibility Deal, which agreed in 2011 to a ‘core commitment to encourage and enable people to adopt a healthier diet’ — including promises on clear calorie labelling. Condemning the practice of listing extra calories on websites as opposed to shelves, Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum says: ‘That’s a cop-out. How many people access a website when they’re going in for a coffee and a salad? ‘The Responsibility Deal, which the Government wants all retail outlets and manufacturers to follow, should ensure that the total number of calories within a package is identified on the label, for the very point that sometimes the sauces and the other bits and pieces are loaded with fat, sugar and sometimes salt.’ Your ‘virtuous’ salad may have more calories than a McDonald’s cheeseburger, which has 295 (stock picture) Pret insists it has nothing to apologise for. ‘Pret’s shelf labels make it clear that the nutritional values are for the salad ingredients without its dressing,’ a spokesman says. ‘The dressing is optional and is separately packed inside the salad box because we recognise that customers may wish to add a lot, a little or none at all. ‘Ideally, we would list nutritional values for both the salad and its dressing, but the quantity of information makes this difficult to do. The nutritional values of all Pret’s food, including dressings, are available on the website should customers wish to find out.’ Eat also claims it is ‘absolutely committed to the pledges’ of the Responsibility Deal. ‘We’ve talked to customers to ensure that the information we provide them with is what they would like to see,’ said a spokesman. ‘On a small label, we are only able to present a limited amount of information. Anyone interested in understanding the nutritional content with the dressing can find this on our website or speak to any of our team in the shop, who have this information readily to hand.’ However, the sushi chain Itsu (which has almost 50 stores in London), juice bar Crussh (25 stores in London) and Pod (23 in London) have all found space on their normal-size labels to include calorie counts for both the salads and their dressings — as have bigger chains, including Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Boots. Consultant dietitian Helen Bond . Crussh managing director Chris Fung says: ‘If you really want to do it, you can do it, which is what we’ve done. We think it’s important for us. ‘There are practical constraints, but is that an excuse? I guess it depends on how important it is to you as a business.’ For those minding their waistlines, the message is clear: steer clear of dressings, or pick a sandwich shop that tells you the calorie count of everything you’re eating — not just the healthy bit.","The calorie count of salads doesn’t always include those in the dressing .

"Veteran Great Escape actor Tom Adams has passed away at the age of 76. The performer, who also starred in television shows including General Hospital and The Onedin Line, died on Thursday after battling cancer, his agent confirmed. With a voice described as 'rich and chocolatey' he also worked as a voice-over artist, including adverts, and was a long-running voice of E4, Emma Harvey said. Veteran Great Escape actor Tom Adams has passed away at the age of 76 after losing his battle with cancer . 'A true gentleman and a class act, his personality was as big and warm as his wonderful voice,' she added. 'We'll miss him very much.' Adams, who lived in Windsor, was a young actor when he landed the role of Dai Nimmo, the RAF officer in charge of diversions in The Great Escape.

"One of the greatest puzzles of our age is why, when we can split the atom, blast people into space and send information around the world in the blink of an eye, do we find it almost impossible to open a packet of nuts? Two-thirds of Britons have injured themselves in ‘wrap rage’ incidents, according to a survey this year by trade journal The Grocer. And half-a-million people a year need medical treatment for injuries from attempting to get into tin cans, consumer group Which? has found. So if you’re fed-up of losing wrestling matches with packaging, try these easy yet ingenious tips to come out on top… . A TIN OPENER FOR PLASTIC . PROBLEM: Moulded plastic ‘clam-shell’ packaging completely sealed around each edge — like that found around many children’s toys, disposable razors and small electrical products — is the leading cause of frustration, according to Which?. Struggling with a corkscrew? A tap on the end of a bottle with a shoe should do the trick . As Sir Terry Wogan raged on TV’s Room 101 last year: ‘Has anyone tried to break into a toothbrush lately?’ Getting into this sort of packaging is particularly hellish because the plastic is both hard and an awkward shape. You can’t pull or tear it apart so have to cut into it with scissors — normally at awkward angles to avoid damaging the item you’ve bought. Then you have to avoid cutting yourself on the sharp edges you have created. SOLUTION: Grab an ordinary manual tin opener, clamp it on to an outside edge and open as if it were a can. But bear in mind the can opener won’t go around sharp corners, so in this scenario you’ll have to slice the packet open in straight lines along each side. UNJAM THOSE JARS . PROBLEM: The traditional way of opening a stubborn jar is to bash the edge of the lid on a kitchen worktop — but that can lead to some expensive repairs. Or, if the seal on the lid breaks suddenly while the jar is being held at an angle, brine or beetroot juice all over your floor. SOLUTION: There are all sorts of fancy gadgets on the market to solve this niggling problem. But save your pennies and try an elastic band instead. Use a shoe to bang open a bottle if it's stuck . Wrap it around the lid, several times if necessary, then twist. The thicker bands work best as they give maximum grip — but if you only have thin ones, you can use two or three for the same effect. It works because it stops your hand slipping around the edge of the jar and gives you the extra grip and traction you need to twist the lid off easily. BANG OPEN A BOTTLE . PROBLEM: We’ve all done it — mislaid the corkscrew when we need to open a bottle of wine, or simply forgotten to take one on a fancy picnic. SOLUTION: Stop fretting and grab a shoe. Remove the metallic wrapping that covers the cork and place the bottle into your footwear so that its bottom sits on the insole, at the heel, and the side is snug against the back (don’t use a shoe with any kind of heel or one without some cushioning). Place the bottom of the shoe against a brick wall or tree to create a 90-degree angle then, while carefully holding the bottle in place, start banging gently. After a few knocks, the cork should have risen up enough for you to twist it out with your hands. This is because the banging motion repeatedly forces the wine against the cork at high pressure, forcing the cork to slowly work its way out of the bottle. THE COIN SLICER . PROBLEM: You’re desperate for a snack but, try as you might, the plastic packet full of crisps, nuts or sweets just won’t open, no matter how much you try to pull the sealed top edges apart. SOLUTION: If you don’t have scissors to hand, grab two coins, place them on the opposite sides at the top of the bag (close together) and push them against each other. The coins will work as makeshift scissors and neatly slice the top open. CHEERS TO THE MAIL . Use your trusty Daily Mail to lever off the caps from tricky to open bottles . PROBLEM: You don’t have a bottle opener to hand but the thought of expensive dentist bills puts you off using your teeth. SOLUTION: Pick up your trusty Daily Mail. Take about four folded sheets and fold in half from top to bottom, repeat — and repeat again. Finally fold it from left to right just once, and place one of the corners underneath the bottle cap. Lever the cap off the bottle and enjoy your well-earned refreshment. This works because the repeated folding creates a highly dense makeshift tool that can handle the pressure of shifting a bottle cap without buckling. GRIND YOUR WAY INTO TINS . If you can't open a tin just turn it upside down and rub it against a concrete surface . PROBLEM: It’s easily done — you go camping with enough tinned food to feed a small army, only to discover you’ve left the tin opener at home. SOLUTION: Never fear — here’s an amazing trick that will allow you to get at your food without the need for any tool whatsoever. Just turn the tin upside down and start rubbing it against a concrete surface (any will do). The motion will wear away the ‘lip’ of the tin that seals it shut. After a few seconds, turn it back the right way around and give the sides a squeeze. If you’ve used enough elbow grease, the lid should pop open. CONQUER YOUR KEYRING . A staple remove will get a keyring off too . PROBLEM: Getting keys on or off a keyring should be quick and simple but the length of time it takes most of us to achieve this basic feat — and the number of nails we break while trying to do so — makes us wonder if keyrings were actually designed to confound criminal masterminds. SOLUTION: Save your manicure and employ a staple remover instead. Pinch the teeth of the remover into the middle of the keyring, and the two pieces of metal will part like magic, leaving the perfect amount of space for you to slide a new key in. If you don’t have a staple remover, try inserting a butter knife — which has a thicker blade than a usual table knife — between the rings instead, twisting it gently so they open.","To get into tough plastic packaging use a tin opener .

"Too much? Stephen Fry's quiz show QI appeared on national channel the Australian Broadcasting Corporation so frequently there are fears he is killing off local talent . If you think there’s too much Stephen Fry on British TV, spare a thought for Australians. His quiz show QI has appeared on national channel the Australian Broadcasting Corporation so frequently there are fears he is killing off local talent. Former senator Margaret Reynolds told an Australian parliamentary inquiry into ABC’s content that Fry was on the channel in Tasmania so often she wondered how viewers would know they were actually in Australia. Hundreds of members of the Friends of the ABC, a public lobby group, in Tasmania share her concerns. ‘I am concerned that my future ABC viewing will contain more bought-in programmes from the BBC and Thames Television starring Stephen Fry and Graham Norton,’ Miss Reynolds said. ‘And if I miss them I can always catch them again on ABC2. I can feel myself glazing over at the thought.’ Fry did have supporters, however. Online writer Brian Howis said: ‘Too much Fry!?? No such thing is possible.’ The controversy comes after Fry appeared in 189 TV shows, including many QI repeats, in Britain in two weeks over Christmas. The government-funded ABC’s links with the BBC mean that the Australian network can pick and choose how much of Mr Fry it gives to its viewers – and while that has been limited to QI he has also given radio interviews to the network and even brought his show Down Under to the Sydney Opera House under the auspices of the ABC. All of which has perturbed Miss Reynolds and the hundreds of members of the Friends of the ABC. Pointing out that the ABC had become more dry and boring with the drift toward cheaper programming and away from in-house quality drama, she said the innovative and entertaining shows of the past belong to a bygone era. Miss Reynold’s complaint was powerful enough to result in the Sydney Morning Herald running the headline: ‘Less Fry, More Tassie (Tasmania), ABC Senate Inquiry Hears’. Fry appeared in 189 TV shows, including many QI repeats, in Britain in two weeks over Christmas .","Former senator tells Australian inquiry she wondered how viewers knew they were Down Under .

The 25-year-old died due to severe head injuries sustained by a bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground . As Hughes was working his way up in the cricketing world, his father Greg was always there to support him . 'When he was a kid, I used to cart him everywhere to play,' Mr Hughes said, right before his son was picked to represent Australia for the first time on 2009, Brisbane Times reported. 'I wasn't going to put him on a bus and tell him, ""Off you go"". I just wanted him to enjoy it, and I wanted to be there with him if he wanted me there.' Shortly after, Hughes was chosen to represent Australia for the first time during the team's South Africa tour. He went on to score two centuries.

He plotted his path and he's starting to get a few rewards,' Mr Hughes said. 'He's getting what he deserves. When he was younger, most afternoons he'd hit between 120 and 150 balls and then do his fitness stuff on top of it. He did things properly. 'I didn't do much - I just fed the machine for him. Most kids probably went to their Tuesday and Thursday afternoon training sessions and that was it. He couldn't stop. He's one out of the box.' Sister Megan ( head down), father Greg (striped shirt), brother Jason (striped cap) and mother Virginia (vest) The family, pictured leaving St Vincent's hospital, said they were  devastated at the loss of much loved Phillip .

"Failure: BBC Worldwide's purchase of the Lonely Planet has ended in a 'significant financial loss' the vice chairman of the BBC Trust has admitted . When the BBC bought travel guide brand Lonely Planet, it was seen as a controversial move. And the purchase proved a financial failure yesterday when the corporation admitted it was selling the firm for £80million less than it paid for it. The huge loss has prompted the corporation's governing body, the BBC Trust, to order a review into how this could have happened. US-based NC2 Media is set to buy Lonely Planet, the biggest-selling brand in the UK travel guide market, from BBC Worldwide for £51.5million. This marks a 60 per cent reduction on the £130.2million the BBC shelled out in acquiring the firm – paid in two chunks in 2007 and 2011. The corporation was accused of venturing beyond its natural territory when it originally bought Lonely Planet from co-founders Maureen and Tony Wheeler. Until then BBC Worldwide had mainly been involved in selling formats and shows abroad, rather than buying up other firms. Diane Coyle, vice chairman of the BBC Trust, said yesterday that the deal was a 'significant financial loss', adding: 'The Trust's strategy for Worldwide now is to focus on BBC programme content, and Worldwide would not make this sort of acquisition again.' Paul Dempsey, interim chief executive of BBC Worldwide, said: 'We acquired Lonely Planet in 2007 when both our strategy and the market conditions were quite different.' He added that the travel guide brand 'no longer fits' with BBC plans.

"Stunning footage of a BBC presenter being attacked by a polar bear while in a cage enthralled Britain when it was aired in January. But the Norwegian authorities were less pleased with the stunt - the programme's producer has been fined nearly £6,000 for 'disturbing' the bear. Gordon Buchanan, host of Springwatch, climbed into a clear perspex box known as the 'ice cube' while filming a documentary in Svalbard, a group of Norwegian islands in the Arctic Circle. He then proceeded to film as a 7ft polar bear tried to pry the box open and attack him, throwing its huge bulk at the structure and fearsomely growling. Thrilling footage: But Gordon Buchanan's documentary has led to a fine for its producer . Attack: The filmmakers were accused of 'disturbing' the polar bears' natural environment in Svalbard . The footage was broadcast in a BBC Two programme entitled The Polar Bear Family and Me in January. But now the vice-governor of Svalbard has written to Jason Roberts, a producer of the documentary, criticising him for breaking local environmental laws. Lars Erik Alfheim warned the filmmaker he faced a fine of 50,000 kroner (£5,800) for intentionally approaching the polar bear and disturbing it in its natural habitat. 'By luring the polar bear to the cage it is disturbing it,' he wrote, according to the Sun. 'If the polar bear had managed to get into the cage it would have been in immediate danger of being shot by the surrounding production team before it managed to injure the TV host.' Danger: But a local politician says it was the animal which was put at risk by the filming . Denial: The producer and presenter insist they obeyed all the relevant laws during filming . Polar bears are the main tourist attraction in the remote region, but strict rules are intended to protect both the animals and the humans who go seeking them. In 2011, Eton schoolboy Horatio Chapple was killed by a bear on Svalbard after camping out in the wilderness with other British tourists. Mr Roberts, an Australian who has been filming polar bears for more than two decades, denies any wrongdoing. 'In 22 years of filming bears I've never had any need to shoot a bear or use equipment to frighten one away,' he said. 'The vice-governor is making an example of me.' Tenacious: The 7ft bear repeatedly tried to break in to the perspex box known as the 'ice cube' He added that polar bears are naturally 'curious' and there was therefore nothing unusual about the animal approaching the cage. Mr Buchanan also ridiculed Mr Alfheim's claims, telling the Sun: 'There are no grounds for any kind of prosecution. It is local politics.' A spokesman for the BBC said the Corporation was aware of the politican's allegations but declined to comment.","Gordon Buchanan filmed in perspex box as 7ft bear tries to break in .

"Self-indulgent: The BBC has given extensive media coverage to its move from Television Centre in White City, west London, to nearby Broadcasting House, drawing the ire of some viewers . BBC executives have been accused of wasting licence-fee payers’ money on ‘self-indulgent’ coverage of the corporation’s headquarters move. The last days at the old Television Centre and the move to Broadcasting House - which has undergone a £1billion revamp - has received rolling television coverage and at least 12 news stories on the BBC website. It was even carried as one of the day’s top stories on the main BBC News on Sunday evening. Dozens of viewers have taken to the BBC’s comment pages to vent their frustration at the coverage - which they branded ‘self-indulgent’, ‘self-obsessed’ and ‘self-congratulatory claptrap’. Others pointed out that the offices were only moving ‘down the road’ and that it would make no difference to viewers. One viewer said: ‘I do get sick and tired of irrelevant BBC stories about itself, its buildings and its employees.’ Another wrote: ‘This feels like a bit of a non-story to anyone who doesn’t work at the BBC.’ A third added: ‘Story is a good example of the self indulgence that my £145 assists in a small way in paying for.’ Dozens more comments were taken down by the BBC for breaching its editorial code. The BBC is selling Television Centre in White City, west London, and moving five miles to Broadcasting House on Portland Place, central London. The move was covered on yesterday’s flagship BBC1 News at One television bulletin and repeated broadcasts on the 24-hour BBC News channel. The online coverage included a piece capturing the final Six O’Clock and Network news bulletins broadcast from Television Centre, along with a preview of the ‘fresh look’ for the BBC News Channel. BBC's Broadcasting House is just five miles from Television Centre, yet the move was covered in 12 stories on the website . Web pages included a photo gallery showcasing the ‘beauty’ of Television Centre and a blog asking, ‘Where does television broadcasting go from here?’ BBC correspondent Nick Higham presented a number of video pieces exploring the high-tech Broadcasting House, including one in which he gave veteran reporter Martin Bell a tour of the building before showing historic excerpts of Mr Bell’s work. A BBC spokesman last night defended the coverage. HQ: The BBC has been located at Television House since 1960. It is where Doctor Who, Fawlty Towers and Blue Peter came to life . He said: ‘The move of the BBC’s domestic television news output to Broadcasting House is an important milestone for the BBC as a news organisation. ‘For the first time, the BBC brings its journalists who serve UK and global audiences across television, radio and online together in a purpose-built digital newsroom, which in turn will strengthen the quality of the BBC’s news output for its audiences. ‘We felt it was important to share the changes with them and introduce them to the new home of BBC News.’","BBC gives extensive coverage over five mile relocation .

"Rafael Marquez made history on Friday by becoming the first player to captain his nation in four World Cup tournaments. The 35-year-old led Mexico out for their opening Group A fixture against Cameroon in Natal to set the new record after previously competing in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 finals. Former Barcelona and Monaco centre-back Marquez, who now plays for Leon in his homeland, made his international debut way back in 1997 and collected his 121st cap in the Cameroon match.

He was first handed the captain's armband by Javier Aguirre in the 2002 finals at the young age of 23 and started in all four matches before they lost 2-0 to the United States in the last 16. It was not an occasion Marquez would care to remember - he was shown a red card for a deliberate mid-air headbutt on Cobi Jones late in the match. At the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Marquez played in all three of Mexico's group matches and scored the goal in their 2-1 loss to Argentina in the second round.

"Sol Campbell believes he should replace Gary Neville as England coach. Campbell played 73 times for England between 1996 and 2007 while his former team-mate and fellow defender Neville, who works as a Sky Sports pundit alongside his role with Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson, earned 85 caps between 1995 and 2007. Campbell made the suggestion when he appeared at Cheltenham Literature Festival and was asked by a fan what he would do to stop England conceding so many goals.

Campbell and Neville fume at Urs Meier after Campbell's goal was disallowed in the quarter finals of  Euro 2004 . Campbell and Neville celebrate England's 5-1 win over Germany in September 2001 . 'Get rid of Gary Neville and get me in instead,' he said. 'I've done all the badges.' England, in fact, have kept four clean sheets in their last six games, only conceding in the 2-1 defeats by Italy and Uruguay at the World Cup. Neville, meanwhile, already has UEFA A and B coaching licenses. Campbell went on: 'I'm doing my coaching badges with the Welsh FA. I am on the last year of the pro licence. Whether I'm going to use it straightaway I'm not too sure. Whether I can use it here I don't know. 'But the career I have had should warrant me getting a job.' Campbell says if he doesn't get a job in England within a few years he will look abroad for a coaching post. The ex-Arsenal and Tottenham centre back, who was at the festival to talk about a new authorised biography of his life and career, also said he believed that, as the best defender in the world at the peak of his career, he should have been England captain on more than just three occasions. Racism is still a 'fundamental probem' in the sport which he believes affected his career. 'I had my colour to count against me,' he said. 'I should have captained my country more than three times. I was going toe-to-toe with Beckham and he got the captaincy. 'But I was getting better and better. I became one of the best defenders in the world and then the best defender in the world and captain of my domestic side. But the better you get the further away you get (from the England captaincy). To me it's not right. 'You conduct yourself in a proper way, in a proper manner, not falling out of night clubs and things like that.

'David was picked as captain and of course he ticked all the boxes. But what if every country adopted that kind of format? They don't.' He added: 'Most teams don't go for a star player as captain. Germany don't do it, France don't do it, Italy don't do it and nor do Spain. It's not about the star name.' Asked whether Wayne Rooney is the right captain now, Campbell said there was probably no other sensible choice from the present team.

"After serving eight years of a 14-year prison sentence for attempting to blow up Los Angeles police officers with pipe bombs in the 1970s, a former member of the Symbionese Liberation Army - the group of domestic, left-wing 'terrorists' best known for kidnapping newspaper heiress Patty Hearst - is talking to reporters, and has revealed that, at age  66, she is now a grandmother. Until now, Sara Jane Olson - better known as bank-robbing pipe-bomber Kathleen Soliah - has done her best to stay out of the public eye. Following her release from a California prison in 2009, Olson has been living with her husband in St. Paul, Minnesota, where she lived as a fugitive with her family for nearly 25 years until her arrest in 1999. Olson isn't saying much about her past, or her new role as a grandmother - she's more interested in spreading the word about her new cause: reducing disparities in prison sentences for crack and powder cocaine. Grandmother: Sara Olson, left, works with her daughter Leila Peterson, right,The former radical was part of the Symbionese Liberation Army who kidnapped Patty Hearst .

In 1974, she was a member of the group when it kidnapped Hearst to use as a bargaining chip with authorities in an attempt to get jailed SLA members released from custody. In April 1975, Soliah was one of several SLA members who robbed Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. During the robbery, Myrna Opsahl - a 42-year-old mother of four who was dropping off money for her church - was murdered. Additionally, Hearst later told police that Soliah had kicked a pregnant woman in the stomach during the robbery, causing her to have a miscarriage. Different times: once a fugitive for attempting to blow up Los Angeles police officers, Kathleen Soliah - now known as Sara Jane Olson - is a grandmother . Olson pictured as a student radical in the Sixties . Four months after the bank robbery, in August of 1975, Soliah placed a pipe-bomb under an LAPD cruiser as it sat parked in front of an International House of Pancakes restaurant. Another pipe-bomb was found under an LAPD cruiser parked in front of a police precinct. Neither bomb detonated, and both were linked back to Soliah, who police believe planted the bombs in an effort to avenge the death of SLA members who'd been killed about a year earlier during a shootout with police. As an LAPD officer noted during . Soliah's 2002 sentencing hearing, a little girl was playing near the . patrol car when the bomb was left underneath it, and she could have been . killed if Soliah and her co-conspirators had 'successfully carried out . their terrorist acts.' After . being indicted for the failed bombings, Soliah relocated to Minnesota . and changed her name to Sara Jane Olson. She married a doctor and had . three children - and was active in the 'progressive' community. In 1999, after appearing on America's Most Wanted multiple times, Soliah was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder, possession of explosives, explosion, and attempt to ignite an explosive with intent to murder. She pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder. The other charges were dropped. Justice delayed: Sara Olson was arrested in 1999 on a 23-year-old warrant charging her with planting pipe bombs under police cars in Los Angeles in 1975 while a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army . Now, Olson has returned to activism and - along with friend and next-door neighbor, Mary McLeod - filed a White House petition Thursday asking the president to exercise executive clemency for prisoners serving time under now-discarded sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine. In 2010, Congress cut those sentences to align more closely with those for powder cocaine, but that only applied to new sentences going forward. The women's petition says that left more than 5,000 prisoners still serving time longer than the new rules would require. 'Terrorists': this infamous photo shows newspaper heiress Patty Hearst wielding a gun during a bank robbery in California in 1975 . 'There's just no good argument for that continuing to be the case, so we said let's see what we can do,' said McLeod, a retired attorney who moved into the house next door while Olson was in prison. The petition was McLeod's idea, and one of Olson's adult daughters is helping.The interview occurred in McLeod's living room; Olson, now 66, looks fit, with long white hair and a deeply lined face. She is quick with statistics and opinions about the cause.'The war on drugs is a politically convenient peg on which to hang a lot of things, and that has been done by a lot of politicians,' Olson said. She and McLeod, as many critics have done, said the differences in crack and powder cocaine sentences stem from stereotypes of crack as a drug for poor black people while powder cocaine is for rich white people. Bargaining chip: Patty Hearst was kidnapped by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. She ultimately helped the 'terrorist' group commit multiple crimes . In the petition, the women ask the White House to establish a panel to review individual cases of the prisoners in question, and then make recommendations to President Barack Obama about which of them deserve to be released. That would mimic the 1974 process by which President Gerald Ford commuted sentences of large numbers of Vietnam draft evaders.Anyone can file a petition to the White House, but it requires 100,000 signatures in 30 days to trigger an actual White House review. And that's no guarantee of action, either. Olson and McLeod are trying to circulate it widely in activist circles, and have posted it on Change.org, an online petition platform. Two days after its posting, the petition — one of more than 100 on the White House site https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/ was nearing 100 signatures.

"TOO MUCH INFORMATION by Dave Gorman (Ebury Press £11.99) Comedian Dave Gorman has forged a rewarding career out of asking questions about topics like social media . Comedian Dave Gorman has forged a rewarding career out of asking questions that are mischievously pertinent, or wickedly rhetorical. In this consistently entertaining, if chaotically disorganised, book, Gorman turns his astute, observational wit on the rampant information age in which we live — and which leaves so many of us faintly bewildered so much of the time. The internet and its all-conquering offspring Twitter and Facebook, smartphones, multi-channel TV, advertising, the press, even the small print on toilet roll packaging — all get ruthlessly and, sometimes, very funnily dissected. As Gorman says, on any given day, he is probably fed 100 times more information than he was just ten years ago, yet he feels as if he is retaining 100 times less. Most of us can relate to that. As an example of the absurdity of modern life, he cites a conversation he overheard in a supermarket on December 12, 2012: ‘Y’know it’s 12/12/12 today, doncha?’ said a man to his female companion. ‘Is it?’ she replied. ‘Yeah,’ he said, ‘I saw it on Facebook.’ That’s the problem with the information age: in telling us how to behave, even what to think, it undermines initiative and comes perilously close to making automatons of us. It is a serious point, but he is right to approach it comically, because of the essential daftness of it all. For example, on a website called celebritytoob.com he finds a list of ‘the 15 Coolest Facts about Richard Branson’. Number two is that Branson ‘dropped out of high school at age 16’. Does that even amount to a fact? muses Gorman. Isn’t 16 the age at which people do leave high school? ‘Only two facts into a 15-fact list,’ he observes, ‘and they are already failing the fundamental requirement of factiness.’ We have forgotten how to distinguish the utterly trivial from the even semi-interesting. Furthermore, we’re becoming worryingly captive to the sleek accessories of the information age. Gorman is disdainful of the effect certain kinds of social media have had on our lives and even language . Go to any pub or restaurant and it won’t be long before you see two people sharing a table, both tapping furiously on their phones — maybe even messaging each other. So, Gorman has picked a big and, in some ways, an easy target. That’s probably why he approaches it as he might a stand-up comedy routine, lurching from topic to topic, seemingly as they occur, without any discernible structure. As a result, this is an easier book to dip into than to read cover to cover. I particularly enjoyed his ruminations about Twitter — surely one of the strangest social phenomena of this or any time. Gorman is disdainful of those ‘TW’ words creeping into the language, such as the dreadful ‘twargument’ to denote a Twitter row. These words fetishise Twitter, he says, and make the medium more important than the message. I couldn’t agree more, but then, I have a Twitter account, just as he does. That’s the other great irony of the new media revolution. If the first is that the information age has rendered us rather less well-informed than we used to be, the second is that those most alert to its dangers rely on it most. That’s certainly true of Gorman. When I last looked, he’d made more than 54,000 tweets, and had well over 300,000 followers. Next to him, I am a novice, an apprentice . . . if he will forgive me, a veritable twainee.","Comedian Dave Gorman has forged a career out of asking questions .

"A platoon of Britain’s top actors, including Michael Gambon, Bill Nighy and Toby Jones, are joining a half-baked scheme to remake Dad’s Army, the best-loved British sitcom in telly history, for international cinema release. Who do they think they are kidding? The original comedy, which ran from 1968 to 1977, starred a collection of character actors, bit-part comedians and repertory troupers: when the show launched there wasn’t a household name among them. But as the series gained popularity, every one of them found a place in the nation’s heart. Inimitable: The original comedy, which ran from 1968 to 1977, starred a collection of character actors, bit-part comedians and repertory troupers. As it gained popularity, every one found a place in the nation’s heart . It wasn’t just the scripts, by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, hilarious though they were. It wasn’t only the sublime comic timing of old hands such as Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier, who played the bombastic Home Guard Captain Mainwaring and his wearily aristocratic sergeant, Mr Wilson — the parts now earmarked for Jones and Nighy. Some have attributed the show’s success to its theme, a nostalgic celebration of the bulldog courage and dauntless incompetence that somehow saw Britain through the darkest hours in a thousand years. Others point to its command of the catchphrase — there is guaranteed laughter every time Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones squawks ‘Don’t panic!’ or the lugubrious Highlander Private Fraser, played by John Laurie, mutters: ‘We’re doomed ... doomed, I tell ye!’ If a perfect sitcom could be created by formula, these would be its elements. But it isn’t that simple. Most of the stars of Dad’s Army are long dead. Only Ian Lavender, who was the mollycoddled Private Pike, and Frank Williams, who played the effete vicar, are still with us; the most recent loss was the huff-puffing air raid warden Mr Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee, who died last year aged 86. It was the extraordinary chemistry between all the cast that made the show a joy. That cannot be emulated, no matter how famous or highly paid the 2014 ensemble might be. Bombastic: Toby Jones will take on the role of Captain Mainwaring, originally played by Arthur Lowe . In fact, a glance at the names will tell you that this wrong-headed remake by Universal Pictures is certain to fail, because of their very celebrity. Egos will clash; instead of chemistry there will be only friction. It’s why rock supergroups always produce bombastic rubbish, and national football teams crammed with club superstars usually play like a bunch of sulking divas. By contrast, the original members of Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard appreciated the irony that all of them had stumbled into fame after decades of obscurity. The only juvenile among these veterans was Lavender, who is now 68 but was 22 when the sitcom began. It was not expected to run for more than 13 weeks, but the sense of camaraderie was immediate. Beloved: The original members of Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, pictured, appreciated the irony that all of them had stumbled into fame after decades of obscurity. In the remake, egos could prove problematic . Ask Lavender about those days now and he’ll chat for hours, with unquenched affection and tears, often, in his eyes. His closest friend in the cast was Laurie, who had worked with Alfred Hitchcock and acting greats Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier. Both Pike and Fraser didn’t have many lines in the first series, so the older man taught the young upstart the most important skill in a jobbing actor’s repertoire — how to do the Times crossword. The leisure time also gave Lavender an opportunity to see how experienced actors made themselves comfortable on set. Le Mesurier, for instance, was an incorrigibly lazy man of irresistible charm — he once persuaded a make-up girl to take the watch off his wrist, wind it and buckle it back on. ‘He couldn’t be bothered to do it himself,’ laughs Lavender. Legend: Bill Nighy will reprise the role of Wilson, which John Le Mesurier made his own in the original show . Real acting experience creates great performances in ways that cannot be predicted. Arthur Lowe was 53 when he first played Mainwaring, and had 30 years in rep theatre behind him. As a young man he had developed a photographic memory, to cope with the demands of doing a different play every week in the provinces. ‘The trouble was,’ the writer David Croft once recalled, ‘Arthur thought he still had a photographic memory, but he didn’t. This accounted for those sudden hesitations, which seemed like wonderful comic timing but was usually: “What the hell am I going to say next?” ’ Le Mesurier, on the other hand, did have perfect recall and could even remember the page numbers on which his lines appeared. Lowe’s failing memory was one of the few things that really irritated Le Mesurier: ‘Can’t he learn it like the rest of us?’ he would complain. The hint of petulance in his performance only added to its charm — what Croft called ‘the way he suffers so well’. Damaged: Bill Paterson has the task of bringing Frazer to life, originally played by John Laurie. The actor suffered traumatic shock during World War I, as a gunner with the Honourable Artillery Company . This ideal cast was not entirely assembled by design. Some arrived by accident: James Beck, for example, another repertory veteran, was not the initial choice to be the rascally spiv Private Walker. Writer Jimmy Perry, who had served in the Home Guard himself and came up with the original concept, wanted that role for himself. Croft, shrewdly guessing that his co-writer would gain too much power over the scripts if he was also a star, vetoed that idea and suggested Beck instead. It’s a mark of how integral every cast member became that most fans agree the show never recovered from Beck’s early death, from pancreatitis aged 44, in 1973. But it was casting Jonesie, the town butcher who had fought in the Boer War, that really caused problems. First choice was Jack Haig, a former music hall performer who appeared in the long-running soap Crossroads for 15 years and is now best remembered as Monsieur LeClerc in another Croft comedy, ’Allo ’Allo. Hero: Arnold Ridley, who was 72 when he first played Godfrey, pictured, was a man who had fought in both world wars and who, like his character, had gone ‘over the top’ on the Somme . Haig was set to take the role until the BBC’s head of light entertainment, Tom Sloan, advised him against it — Dad’s Army was expected to flop. David Jason, who was then 27 and just beginning to make a name for himself in a sketch show called Do Not Adjust Your Set, also read for the part — but even in heavy make-up, he couldn’t pass for a doddery hero of the siege of Mafeking. Despite Croft’s misgivings, the part finally went to Clive Dunn, then in his late 40s but used to playing much older characters. These coincidences and happy chances brought together an ensemble that all the casting agents in Hollywood could not reproduce. But even that is not the deepest reason why Dad’s Army should never be remade. Take Sir Michael Gambon — ‘the Great Gambon’, as the legendary actor Ralph Richardson dubbed him. Gambon is to be simpering Private Godfrey, the conscientious objector from World War I who nevertheless won the Military Medal for his courage under fire on the Somme, as a medical orderly. But though Gambon is a theatre heavyweight, he is not a war veteran. Arnold Ridley, who was 72 when he first played Godfrey, truly was — a man who had fought in both world wars and who, like his character, had gone ‘over the top’ on the Somme. Ridley’s experiences left him with an indelible loathing of war. The years he endured in the trenches had shattered his nerves, and for the rest of his life he suffered a recurring nightmare — that the Armistice had never happened, and he was under orders to report back to his regiment to continue fighting. This dread woke him many times in the night, shouting and sweating. But the worst was still to come: in 1939, after Germany had invaded Poland, Britain was once more at war and Ridley felt obliged to join up, aged 44. He served in the British Expeditionary Force with the rank of major. ‘Within hours of setting foot on the quay at Cherbourg, I was suffering from acute shell-shock again,’ he wrote. John Laurie also suffered traumatic shock during World War I, as a gunner with the Honourable Artillery Company. He served in the thick of the fighting at Passchendaele in 1917, and though he survived physically unscathed, he later had a nervous breakdown. When Jimmy Perry screened old newsreel footage from the Western Front during a lull in Dad’s Army rehearsals, he was surprised by the strength of Laurie’s reaction. ‘Turn it off, son,’ pleaded the old soldier. ‘I cannae watch it.’ That heartfelt depth of experience is what imbues Dad’s Army with its universal appeal, and explains why generations of comedy fans cherish it. It was also screened in an age — the late Sixties — when many millions of viewers remembered with fear and loathing what it had been like to feel terror at the prospect of a Nazi invasion. And they were watching a corps of elderly men who knew what it meant to defend their country. They had fought once and didn’t want to fight again, but nothing could make them shirk their duty. It’s an emotion that the cast of any Dad’s Army remake will never fully be able to comprehend. However good they are, they’ll just be acting. The original, inimitable stars had lived it.","The beloved original British sitcom ran from 1968 to 1977 .

"British make-up artist and former model Jemma Kidd has offered a glimpse inside her stunning English country house. The 39-year-old - who became a countess after marrying Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, in 2005 - moved from London to the Hampshire estate with her husband four years ago, shortly after their twins, Darcy and Mae, were born. In images from the new issue of Elle Decor, the 18th century home, which she calls an 'oasis,' boasts a huge garden, lavish rooms and heirlooms from the first Duke of Wellington's personal collection - as well as their own modern, personal touches. Home sweet home: In the new issue of Elle Decor, British make-up artist Jemma Kidd, who became a countess after marrying Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, in 2005, opens up the doors to their Hampshire estate . Spacious: The house is located on the Stratfield Saye estate, which has belonged to the Earl of Mornington's family for two centuries. They keep seven horses on the property . The house is named the Old Rectory and is located on the Stratfield Saye estate, which has belonged to the Earl of Mornington's family for two centuries. Due to its rich history, the couple had to make some necessary changes when they moved in. 'Like in most English country houses, it took three hours to fill a bath,' explains Ms Kidd. What's more, the rooms were lined with antique paper and featured hand basins, and the heating was virtually nonexistent. To modernize it, they added 40 radiators as well as heating under the floors and state-of-the art boilers. Design: The Morningtons chose South African-born decorator Penny Morrison to do the interiors. 'Things should be more eclectic, as if you've collected them over the years,' Ms Morrison says . Mixed genres: In the kitchen, an antique French bench sits by the doors to the garden, and steel bar stools sit at the marble countertop . Warm: Red floral designs decorate the guest room, which features prints of English scenery, a wedding gift, on the walls . It's the mixture of old and new that make the home so charming. 'Everything is calm, happier, and less stressed,' she says of their country abode in comparison to living in London. 'As soon as you drive into the park, it's like you've entered an oasis.' 'Everything is calm. As soon as you drive into the park, it's like you've entered an oasis' One of the unique features is a collection of busts of the first Duke of Wellington, as well as antique trunks that carried his clothes. The latter have been stacked on top of one another in Wellesley's study to be used as tables. In one of the two libraries, large world maps hang on the walls and custom-made bookshelves house an assortment of colorful volumes. The cushions and ottoman are sewn in a . Moroccan pattern, and a faded mirror above the mantle gives the room a . rustic feel. In the drawing room, the fireplace is original to the . house. Making moves: The 39-year-old and her husband moved from London to the Hampshire estate four years ago, shortly after their twins, Darcy (right) and Mae (left), were born . Aristocracy: Ms Kidd's husband (left) is second in line to the title of Duke of Wellington, after his father Charles. Through his mother, Princess Antonia of Prussia, he is a descendent of Queen Victoria . The Morningtons chose South African-born decorator Penny Morrison to do the interiors after seeing one of her projects in a magazine. And they certainly see eye-to-eye when it comes to striking the right balance. 'Things should be more eclectic, as if you've collected them over the years,' Ms Morrison says. And Ms Kidd remarks that the decorator can 'make rooms look chic, but also incredibly comfortable, inviting, and warm.' In the kitchen, an antique French bench sits by the doors to the garden, and steel bar stools sit at the marble countertop. Ms Kidd, whose younger sister Jodie was . an international supermodel, told the magazine that she decided to . abandon city life for the country because it's better for raising a . family. Family: Ms Kidd, whose younger sister Jodie (right) was an international supermodel, told the magazine that she decided to abandon city life for the country because it's better for raising a family . '[In London] There were gas fumes, rubbish on the pavement, and people everywhere,' she explains. 'I just said, ""That's it, I'm not going to bring my kids up here.""' What's more, the property is spacious enough for her to pursue her passion - horse riding. 'In London there were gas fumes, . rubbish on the pavement...

"LAST MAN STANDING: TALES FROM TINSELTOWN by Roger Moore (Michael O'Mara Books £20) Sir Roger Moore’s third book comes on the back of what he calls ‘the phenomenal, worldwide success’ of his autobiography, My Word Is My Bond, amounting, he adds, to two copies sold in paperback and one (in Burkina Faso) in hardback. This winning self-deprecation continues throughout: he also declares Daniel Craig the perfect James Bond, who ‘looks as though he could actually kill . . . whereas I just hugged or bored them to death’. It is perfectly true that, in terms of his own acting ability, Moore has plenty to be modest about. What he does have in his favour is a decency and affability that, far more than versatility as an actor, have turned him into one of his profession’s most respected elder statesmen. Roger Moore as James Bond with Fiona Fullerton as Pola Ivanova in A View to Kill, released in 1985 . And which, by the by, have yielded friendships that he draws on in this collection of showbiz anecdotes, although he is not averse to telling stories second or even third-hand. Such as one about John Gielgud who, on being invited by MPs Glenda Jackson and Gyles Brandreth to celebrate his 90th birthday at the House of Commons, declared he’d be delighted to join them, since ‘most of my real friends are dead’. The same, alas, is also true of 86-year-old Moore. The cast of this book have mostly relocated to the celestial cutting-room. But even in death, they are an illustrious bunch. I had no idea, for example, that Moore was friendly with Frank Sinatra, whom he first met at a fundraising dinner in Hollywood in the 1950s, at which Sinatra fell out, loudly and publicly, with John Wayne. Roger Moore seduced 20 women as James Bond . Jack Warner, the head of Warner Brothers, had bid $1,000 for one of his contract artists, Gordon MacRae, to sing at the event, only for ‘Duke’ Wayne to bid $2,000 for MacRae not to sing. Sinatra was a friend of MacRae’s, and considered it an unforgivable insult. He and the Duke duly squared up to each other, and it wasn’t just their stature as bona fide superstars, but also their difference in size, writes Moore, that made the spectacle ‘something I’ll never forget’. The old trouper is certainly well-equipped for some classy name-dropping. Lana Turner, no less, taught him the art of screen-kissing (‘passion without pressure’) on the set of the 1956 film Diane. And he once took Bette Davis to the dog track at White City, where everyone was too preoccupied with the greyhounds to notice the tiny, middle-aged woman thoroughly enjoying herself going back and forth to the betting counter was a proper, Hollywood giant. Roger with good friend Gregory Peck (left), who he met at David Niven's house in the early 1970s. Roger was also friends with Frank Sinatra whom he first met at a fundraising dinner in Hollywood in the 1950s, at which Sinatra fell out, loudly and publicly, with John Wayne . This book could do with more personal encounters such as that, and less recycling of other people’s stories — including a few that are downright whiskery with age. The best tales are Moore’s own, and I enjoyed the revelation that his great pal David Niven had no time for his neighbour on the French Riviera, Rex Harrison, much to the latter’s chagrin. ‘He’s never invited me for dinner or a drink,’ Harrison used to grumble. ‘Niv’ is one of the many nicknames and diminutives that pepper this book, along with the likes of ‘Albie’ Finney and ‘Greg’ Peck. Moore grew hugely fond of Peck, whom he met at Niven’s house in the early 1970s, and the affection was clearly mutual. Once, at the height of the IRA threat in London, Moore left the house in Belgravia that Peck had rented while making The Omen to find his host underneath his car, checking it for bombs. Roger Moore in his most iconic role. The star has no qualms in saying that his acting left a lot to be desired . If that story is entirely consistent with Peck’s screen image as a thoroughly decent cove, another, about John Mills, is dramatically at odds with the public perception. Apparently, that most upstanding of actors, the very embodiment of the English stiff upper lip, had a party piece that he unveiled on the sets of most films he worked on: he used to drop his trousers, pass wind thunderously, and then ignite it. Ice Cold In Alex will never seem the same again. Somewhat more wholesomely, there is a nice story about Moore’s ‘dear friend’ Cubby Broccoli, the legendary Bond producer, whose passionate Anglophilia dated from an encounter with a waiter at the Savoy, on Broccoli’s inaugural visit to England in 1948. On his first morning, he went down to breakfast and ordered bacon and eggs, only to be told that, because of rationing, he couldn’t have any. But, a couple of days later, the same waiter delivered two boiled eggs under a silver dome, and discreetly confided that he’d smuggled them in from home. Broccoli became instantly smitten with England and the English, and later insisted on making all his Bond films here. One wonders whether that anonymous waiter ever knew how much employment resulted from his simple act of generosity? Regrettably, the book does not enjoy quite the same standard of production as the Bond films. Spelling and grammatical errors abound, and one picture caption turns up eight pages early. But that’s not Moore’s fault. Even if this book is not destined for phenomenal, worldwide success, it certainly deserves to sell more than three copies — and far beyond Burkina Faso.","Roger Moore tells tales of actors who didn't get on and secret grumblings .

Britain has announced a 25 per cent 'Google tax' for multinationals that avoid paying tax locally and Australia has been exchanging information with its government.

ScrollBritain has set its 'Google tax' or Diverted Profits Tax at 25 percent – higher than the standard 21 percent company tax rate - in an effort to encourage multinationals to declare their profits in the UK. Companies use complex international tax structures to divert revenues away from Australia, meaning companies including IKEA, Apple and Google are paying minimal amounts of tax despite raking in massive profits locally. IKEA has made an estimated profit of $1.01 billion in Australia since 2003 but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $103 million and paid $31 million in tax. In 2013 Apple paid $36 million in tax despite making $6.1 billion in Australia, while Google paid just $7.1 million despite making $46.5 million. It's estimated tax avoidance could cost the government between $1 and $3 billion each year. IKEA which has made an estimated profit of $1.01 billion in profits in Australia since 2003, but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $103 million and paid $31 million in tax . Mr Hockey says Australia led the charge on tax avoidance throughout last month's G20 summit in Brisbane and is also cracking down on the practice domestically. The government has injected 60 new staff into the Australian Tax Office to uncover culprits. Mr Hockey says there are 'new and stronger' links between the ATO and other tax offices around the world and clever accounting to hide profits is 'coming to an end'. 'I'm absolutely determined to ensure that everything is done to make sure people and companies who earn money in Australia pay tax in Australia,' he said. However, while Mr Hockey says new resources have been allocated to the ATO to focus on multinationals, the office has also shed more than 2000 staff in the past year. In 2013 Apple paid $36 million in tax despite making $6.1 billion in Australia . Former Treasury official Mike Callaghan said the tax would be difficult to impose because multinational companies are operating within the law. ‘You have to be able to prove that the corporation has artificially diverted its profit and that’s a real challenge,’ Mr Callaghan said. ‘We need to look at how countries can change the law to try to stop the diversion of profits because that’s the problem, the law now is out of date with the way companies are operating.’ UK Chancellor George Osborne said that technology giants including Google and Facebook will face a 25 percent tax on profits generated from their economic activity in the UK from April. In 2013 Google paid just $7.1 million in despite making $46.5 million from local sales . But experts questioned whether it will be possible to raise much from the new levy at all, given how hard it is to know whether money is being artificially diverted. The independent UK Office of Budget Responsibility gave the new tax a 'medium-high' uncertainty rating because it is based on 'assumptions that cannot be readily checked'. It said predicting the response of multinationals – which could also include Amazon, Apple and Starbucks – to the tax is difficult but likely to be 'volatile and large'. Graham Parker of the OBR added: 'They may find other ways of getting around these taxes.'","Treasurer  has warned multinationals they won't get away with dodging tax .

"Britain has lost her empire ... again. Once, Britannia ruled the airwaves, with dramas that were the envy of the world’s broadcasters. But that’s ancient history, and this week the Emmy awards in Los Angeles delivered fresh humiliation. American television shows swept the board, and they deserved to. That’s because, in the States, television is revelling in a new golden age. Far more than cinema or literature, TV is the greatest art form of the era. Visionary hits: Kevin Spacey (centre) and Michael Kelly (far right) star in Netflix hit series House of Cards . U.S. dramas such as the political drama House Of Cards, Breaking Bad and Game Of Thrones are thrilling and unmissable. Modern Family is laugh-out-loud funny. But while America is embracing this golden age, we’re still trying to resurrect the old one. Back in the Seventies, the BBC was one of the best reasons not to emigrate. We watched innovative dramas such as I, Claudius and Colditz, and brilliant comedies like Porridge and Fawlty Towers, with no adverts, for the price of the licence fee. We pitied the Americans, we really did. Their shows were fragmented by commercial breaks that made viewing impossible. The only successful programmes on U.S. television were chat-shows and quizzes, which could be endlessly broken up. But today, U.S. programmes are paid for in a different way. Subscription channels via cable and the internet have empowered producers to create intricate worlds over several seasons. They’ve drawn viewers into the most improbable and addictive scenarios, such as True Detective, a gruesomely compelling murder mystery starring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, or The Good Wife, about a lawyer’s wife trying to piece her life back together after a sex scandal. Cleverly, the big hits win over their audience in stages. First, they screen to a small, dedicated fan-base of subscribers who have paid for access to the production through cable channels such as Home Box Office (HBO) or streaming internet services such as Netflix. That generates excitement on social media, so that when the DVD box-set is released, millions are ready to binge-watch, consuming a dozen episodes over a couple of nights. Finally, the series is syndicated to TV channels worldwide. The result is a triple wave of income that funds the next unlikely but visionary hit. Series' like Breaking Bad (pictured Aaron Paul, left, and Bryan Cranston, right) are revelling in 'golden age' The BBC business model is arthritic by comparison. Entire floors of executives maul a concept before it is approved, injecting blandness and removing risk. That’s why most Beeb programmes are either called The Great British something-or-other, or The Secret Life Of you-name-it . . . safe, formulaic titles. During his visit to Washington, Labour leader Ed Miliband took President Obama a present of a classic BBC box-set — State Of Play, the newspaper drama starring Bill Nighy and John Simm. It is under six hours long. However, the Obamas’ favourite viewing includes Boardwalk Empire and Breaking Bad, which both stretch to more than 50 episodes. Nothing could illustrate more clearly how far UK television has lapsed behind. To make it worse, if you want to catch up on shows that swept the Emmys this week — with the exception of the splendid Sherlock, which picked up awards for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson — don’t expect to find them on the Beeb. You’ll have to pay extra subscriptions to Sky, Netflix and more. Emilia Clarke stars as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, which is 'thrilling and unmissable' according to Daily Mail TV critic Christopher Stevens . So is this an international golden age, or do you have to be American to appreciate the shows? The answer is that you don’t need a Green Card, the all-purpose U.S. entry ticket, but you do need patience: just as when you start to read a blockbuster novel, the rewards don’t flow within the first few scenes. Many British viewers who gave up quickly on Breaking Bad complained it was too cynical to be entertaining. It’s the story of Walt, a failed chemistry teacher, in a stale marriage, broke and dying of cancer. What begins as an attempt to fund his healthcare, by using his chemistry knowledge to make and sell the drug crystal meth, turns into an act of vengeance against the world. Actor Bryan Cranston won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor, and the show won for outstanding drama, with another Emmy going to Cranston’s co-star, Aaron Paul. Viewers who stuck with Breaking Bad beyond the opening episodes know that it becomes psychologically compelling. This summer, my 20-year-old son persuaded his mother, a fan of Mr Selfridge and EastEnders, to watch it with him. Within days, they were gulping down episodes in twos and threes, quoting the dialogue and obsessively connecting the clues. This slow-burning addiction is typical of the best U.S. dramas. The pattern was set by The Sopranos, the tale of a New Jersey gangster boss and his family, launched by HBO in 1999. In his book The Revolution Was Televised, American TV critic Alan Sepinwall argues: ‘The Sopranos is the one that made the world realise something special was happening on television. It rewrote the rules.’ Even if Britain is no longer making many of the best shows in the world, at least lots of the best U.S. shows are crammed with English talent. Take, for instance, Fargo, from the FX cable channel, which won the Emmy for best mini-series, and exemplifies the current superiority of TV over cinema. An Oscar-winning movie from almost 20 years ago became a mesmerising ten-part fable of murder in the snowy wastes of Minnesota. Martin Freeman played the central character, a timid insurance agent who, like Walt, turns into a criminal monster. Game Of Thrones is packed from dungeon to ramparts with British thespians. Sean Bean opened the show, as its battle-hardened hero Eddard Stark, before the conniving Charles Dance took centre-stage as the chief puppet-master in the fantasy kingdom of Westeros. Fargo from the FX cable channel won Emmy for best mini-series (pictured Martin Freeman as Lester Nygaard) That’s not to mention Dame Diana Rigg, who won this year’s Emmy for outstanding guest actress, as the grandmother of a scheming queen. Without this array of brilliant Brits, U.S. drama would be impoverished, and the new golden age would lack much of its glitter. For the most part, the same cannot be said for British writers, though one notable exception is Armando Iannucci, creator of the acerbically brilliant Westminster satire The Thick Of It. He’s transported his political nous to the States, and this week the female star of his White House comedy Veep won her third Emmy in a row. So why has it proved impossible for so many UK producers to match their rivals across the Atlantic? The moribund licence fee is only part of the problem — after all, Sherlock did net a brace of Emmys. But it bypassed the commissioning process that neuters and homogenises so much British drama. Mark Gatiss and co-writer Steven Moffat had the clout to make Sherlock the way they wanted it — though any fan who has seen the original pilot episode, included as an extra in the box-set, knows how close the show came to being converted into the Beeb’s standard output of bland and sterile fudge. Despite the golden era of American television, Stevens says that British dramas like Broadchurch (pictured are the cast of the ITV series including David Tennant, centre) are real UK contributions to the 'new golden age' Mark Gatiss and co-writer Steven Moffat madeSherlock the way they wanted - and it came up top at Emmys . As ITV drama does not go through the same centralised process, individual brilliance has a better chance of surviving. That has given us the two other real UK contributions to the new golden age — Downton Abbey and Broadchurch. Both were conceived by writers with a vivid and distinctive vision. Julian Fellowes’ nostalgic sense of a lost England, and Broadchurch writer Chris Chibnall’s insight into provincial secrets, were allowed free rein. The result was masterful television, a match for anything American cable giants could offer. There are signs Auntie is belatedly recognising the importance of a creative force that moulds a production. Sally Wainwright, who had a surprise triumph with Last Tango In Halifax, was allowed to make Happy Valley without too much interference: the result was stunning drama. Hugo Blick, whose Palestine-Israeli tragedy The Honourable Woman concluded last week on BBC2, was given freedom as a writer and director. And producer Jed Mercurio’s police drama Line Of Duty also bore the hallmark of a series forged by a master craftsman. After lagging so badly for years, the Beeb might finally be learning its lesson. But as the Emmys humiliation emphasised, Britain has a lot of catching up to do.","Television in States is revelling in new golden age says Christopher Stevens .

"A Conservative school board made the controversial decision to remove information about contraception from a biology book because it flouts state law. Members of the Gilbert Public Schools board, in Arizona voted 3-2 on Tuesday night to take out two pages from ‘Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections’ which dealt with contraception. The school board argued that the information in the book went against a law which states that students should be given 'facts about childbirth or adoption over abortion.' Controversial: Members of the Gilbert Public Schools board, voted 3-2 on Tuesday night to take out two pages from ‘Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections’ book, pictured here, . The board covers at least 38 schools and 39,000 students mostly in Chandler and Mesa, in Arizona. Board member Julie Smith told 12 News in Phoenix: ‘By redacting, we are not censoring.’ ‘This school district does offer sexual education classes. If we were censoring, we would not offer anything on this topic whatsoever.’ The biology textbook   describes, among other topics, contraception techniques, including explanations of how the morning-after pill works. And it was this mention of the morning-after pill being able to induce an abortion that led Scottsdale-based legal group, Alliance Defending Freedom, to write to the Gilbert Public Schools superintendent in August. It said that a parent had raised concerns that the text was not compliant with state legislation. The textbook was also criticized for going against the beliefs of some conservative Christians who believe that life begins at the moment of conception. However, the book also points out that abstinence is the only fail-safe birth control method. School board: Ron Bellus, left, and Dawn Brimhall were among members from the  Gilbert Public Schools governing board who weighed in on this week's decision to edit a biology textbook . J. Charles Santa Cruz, left, and Jill Humphreys, right, were among members  who voted 3-2 that the high school textbook does not align with state law on how abortion is to be presented to public-school students . Reed Carr, another board member voted to remove the pages that did not comply with the law . In 2012, Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed the law which states ‘the state has a strong interest in promoting childbirth and adoption over elective abortion,’ in school programs. But the alliance said the materials, which have been used in the district since 2006, present elective abortions as a viable option for students while making no mention of childbirth or adoption. However, an official from the state’s Department of Education said in an email to Gilbert Public Schools last month that the book did not appear on its face to violate the law. Yet they agreed that it was important for locally elected school boards to choose texts they prefer when it comes to a topic such as sex education, ‘where the values of parents are heavily involved.’ There have been a series of debates recently over the best way to teach U.S. teens about sexual health and reproduction in public schools. Last month in Colorado a fight over the content of an advanced history course took center stage as the school curriculum came under scrutiny.","Members of the Gilbert Public Schools board, voted 3-2 to take out two pages from ‘Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections’

"Mexico coach Miguel Herrera has left Manchester United forward Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez on the bench for Friday's World Cup opener against Cameroon. Herrera has chosen Villarreal forward Guillermo Dos Santos and Oribe Peralta to start in attack for the Group A encounter in Natal, Brazil.

Left on the side: Javier Hernandez (right) has been overlooked by Mexico coach Miguel Herrera . Centre of attention: Javier Hernandez (centre) tries to keep hold of the ball during Mexico training on Thursday . Down and out: Hernandez will start Mexico's game against Cameroon on the bench . 'I know that all of my players are going to leave their soul on the pitch to achieve a result,' Herrera said. 'We are ready to go out and win.' With Brazil and Croatia also included in the pool, Mexico know how vital Friday's game is. The Aztecs have failed to reach the knock-out round in the past five tournaments. 'This is a very important game for us, key to our aspirations to progress to the next round,' Herrera said. 'We know it's not going to be easy but we are going to work very hard to beat Cameroon.' Mexico will have to show a vast improvement as they suffered 1-0 defeats in their last two friendlies against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Portugal. Show of faith: Oribe Peralta (centre) is expected to start upfront for Mexico against Cameroon . Eyes on the prize: Giovani Dos Santos will be expected to lead the line for Mexico . 'We are only interested in a win and not on the actual result,' he said. 'A win is what matters, taking three points and that is what we want.' Mexico had to beat New Zealand in the play-offs to reach Brazil and maintain their record of qualifying for every World Cup since 1990. Herrera believes Cameroon's pace poses the biggest danger for his side. 'They have a very good team, with fast players, who have experience,' he said. 'We will try to manage possession.' Shining light: Samuel Eto'o will captain Cameroon as he plays in his fourth World Cup . Cameroon go into the encounter at the Estadio das Dunas finally able to focus on football matters.

'We know that (Mexico) had a lot of problems in qualifying and that it was difficult,' Finke said. 'However, they are a very dangerous team, with an intense spirit. I can see that it is a difficult team but one that can be beaten.' Samuel Eto'o, who will compete in his fourth World Cup, is the Cameroon captain.

"Former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden believes it is 'ludicrous' that Kevin Pietersen continues to be overlooked for England duty. The 34-year-old has not played for the national side since last winter's dismal tour of Australia and had his central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board terminated in February. Pietersen has since expressed his desire to return to the England squad and did so again on Saturday following the appointment of Eoin Morgan as the one-day captain, after which he tweeted: 'Great news that @Eoin16 is new England 1-day captain. Top player, leader and bloke. Hope I get to play for him.' Kevin Pietersen says he is determined to play for England again . However, national selector James Whitaker said the door remains firmly shut to Pietersen, telling Sky Sports on Saturday: 'The ECB management made a decision on Kevin in January and it is the same.' Pietersen responded to those comments on Twitter by saying: 'Despite the rather disrespectful comments by Paul Downton and James Whitaker yesterday, I remain determined to regain my England place!' ECB national selector James Whitaker said the door remains firmly shut to Pietersen . Pietersen showed off his batting skills earlier this week with a 66 off 46 balls for Melbourne Stars in the opening match of the Big Bash League. And Hayden has questioned the decision to freeze Pietersen out as England begin their preparations for a triangular series against Australia and India and the World Cup, which gets under way in February. Australia's Matthew Hayden says it is 'ludicrous' that Pietersen continues to be overlooked for England . Hayden told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'I think it's ludicrous that Kevin Pietersen isn't in the England side, that's just crazy. 'One thing that I really love about him in the Big Bash League is his innovation. 'World Cups are won on innovative batting and we've seen that progression in thinking in batsmen, particularly because of the T20 format of the game.

"A boy whose fear of open spaces left him scared to leave his house is now venturing outside after striking up a heart-warming friendship with a dog. Owen Howkins, seven, and his trusted companion Haatchi have become inseparable after the family pet helped him overcome anxiety. Owen became 'withdrawn' at school when he realised a rare genetic condition made him different to other boys and girls. Scroll down for adorable video... Me and my dog: Owen with his friend Haatchi, who has helped him overcome his anxiety of the outside world . Winners! Owen now loves taking Haatchi to dog shows, where he has proved to be quite a hit . Lean on me: Owen's father said the pair didn't like to be apart . Tragically, it left him scared to talk to people and worried about leaving his home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. But now Haatchi - an Anatolian shepherd dog - has given Owen a new lease of life after dad Will Howkins adopted the pet from a rescue centre. The pair can be seen walking down the road together after becoming the best of friends. Owen suffers from Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, which means his muscles are always tense. Haatchi himself had a difficult start in life, suffering horrific injuries when he was tied to a railway line and hit by a train around ten months ago. He was found days later, cowering, with a mangled tail and back leg. By the time he was taken to a vet's surgery, nothing could be done to save his leg and tail and both had to be amputated. Haatchi's future looked bleak as the RSPCA and UK German Shepherd rescue centre struggled to find him new home. But he was eventually adopted by father Will and fiancee Colleen Drummond, 41, who read about the animal's plight on Facebook. Family favourite: Owen's father Will and fiancee Colleen (left) decided to adopt gentle giant Haatchi after reading about his difficult start to life on Facebook. The Anatolian Shepherd quickly bonded with Owen . Best buds: Haatchi, who quickly bonded with Owen, accompanies the youngster to therapy sessions . What to pick? Haatchi and Owen peruse a sweet stall . Kisses: Haatchi accomapnies Owen even when he goes to have a bath . Colleen, who has been part of the family since Owen was three, said: 'As soon as they met, the effect Haatchi had on Owen was incredible. Before his arrival, Owen didn't like going out. 'When he first started school, he became more aware of being different, and he became even more withdrawn.' Owen's condition requires regular hospital treatment but the simple joy of being around the ""energetic puppy"" makes it easier for him to cope with. Now he feels differently about his syndrome after seeing Haatchi take his ""medicine"" - a mix of manuka honey, salmon oil and supplements. Colleen said: 'Owen used to be scared of strangers but he now wants to talk to everyone about Haatchi and wants to go out all the time to dog shows. 'The difference we see in him can't be put into words.' Will, 33, an RAF engineer at RAF Odiham, said: 'Owen is incredibly attached to Haatchi - in fact, they are very attached to each other. 'Haatchi will come and drink out of the bath when I'm bathing Owen, and they don't like to be apart.' Haatchi, aged 15 months, recently completed his training as a ""Pets as Therapy"" dog. He will soon begin visiting soldier amputees injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as sick and terminally-ill children. Haatchi's amazing survival and the positive impact he has had on Owen's life has resulted in him winning an award from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. It will be presented at the Animal Action Awards event at House of Lords next week. The event will be hosted by Baroness Gale and awards presented by Queen guitarist Brian May. Robbie Marsland, UK Director of IFAW, said: 'When we heard Haatchi's amazing story of survival and the very special relationship he has with Owen, we knew he had to be IFAW's Animal of the Year.' Colleen said: 'We feel completely privileged and honoured that Haatchi is to receive this IFAW award.'

"Joe Burns looks set to make his Test debut for Australia after Mitchell Marsh pulled out of the squad for the third Test against India due to a hamstring injury. The Queensland batsman is part of a 13-man squad for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after impressing Australia coach Darren Lehmann, whom he played under at state level.

Sydney Thunder players celebrate after taking the wicket of Burns during the match on Sunday in Australia . 'You're always trying to look ahead when you can, but you're still living in the moment,' Lehmann told the Cricket Australia website. 'We think he's the best man. He can fit anywhere from one to six (in the batting order). He gives us a little bit more flexibility compared to the other two ... and it's a chance to play a guy who is young.' Burns was obviously delighted to be included. Darren Lehmann, Australia coach, has been impressed with Burns' aggressive style of batting . Mitchell Marsh, pictured bowling against India last week, has pulled out of the squad with a hamstring injury . 'It took a fair while to sink in,' he said. 'I'm over the moon at the news as it is the best Christmas present I could ever hope for. I'm just so happy.' Burns hit 183 against New South Wales in November, impressing the powers that be. 'Trevor Hohns and Mark Waugh saw that and were very impressed,' Lehmann said. 'We think he's got something about him ... hopefully he offers runs, first and foremost. 'He's a very aggressive player, which is always good to see. That's the way we like to play.' Lehmann also hopes batsman David Warner is fit to play after the opener was struck on the thumb in Australia's run chase at the Gabba, when they made the 130 runs needed with just four wickets in hand.","Joe Burns has averaged 42.54 in this season's Sheffield Shield .

"It's not quite bargain basement, but a rare opportunity to buy the world's fastest production car for less than a quarter of the price has arisen. For £200,000 you could get the keys to a Bugatti Veyron, which costs a cool £1million brand new. It's an amazing reduction, but there's a downside - you'll need another £500,000 to repair the supercar, because the owner crashed it. Damage: A Bugatti Veyron is being auctioned off in Switzerland after the unlucky owner lost control of it on the A2 motorway in Austria . Bargain: The Veyron is expected to fetch around £200,000 - about a quarter the cost of a new model . The wreck is being auctioned off in Switzerland after the unlucky owner lost control of it on the A2 motorway in Austria in pouring rain. The Bugatti slid off the road and down a 120-foot embankment. The driver did have some luck, though, as he emerged unscathed. But his car suffered considerable damage to its bodywork, suspension and wheels. It may be a six-year-old model but the cheapest second-hand Veyron currently on the market is priced at £675,000. The auctioneers, who expect the car to fetch around £200,00 say that there is damage to 'front and rear, front sill, both doors and the floor of the vehicle.' Repairs are estimated at around £550,000.

"Kevin Pietersen has not wasted a chance since he was sacked a year ago to press his claims for an England recall, but surely national selector James Whitaker has slammed the door in his face. Responding to the latest whispers, he said: ‘There is no way Pietersen will ever get back into an England team. He’s no longer part of England cricket.’ Pietersen top scored with a ruthless 66 from only 46 balls in his first appearance in Australia's Big Bash for Melbourne Stars this week. Kevin Pietersen scored 66 off 46 balls for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash in Australia . But it does not seem that he will be returning to the England side soon, despite the World Cup approaching . That, coinciding with his friend Eoin Morgan replacing Alastair Cook as one-day captain, seemed to boost his prospects of an international return with the World Cup on the horizon. The 34-year-old even entertained the idea on his Twitter page, saying his 'phone is on' and upon the news that Morgan was made captain, tweeted 'I hope I get to play for him.' But judging by the reaction of Whitaker, it appears both Cook and Pietersen will be free during the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, which starts in February.","Kevin Pietersen hit 66 off 46 balls this week for Melbourne Stars .

Only two sides have ever survived being bottom on December 25 - Sunderland last season and West Brom in 2005. Nigel Pearson knows how to pull off a great escape but the Leicester boss insists there are no quick fixes . And Pearson was Bryan Robson's assistant when the Baggies became the first team in Premier League history to survive the traditional relegation. They stayed up on the final day of the 2004-05 season with the lowest ever points total to beat the drop, 34. Now, Leicester are winless in 12 games and five points from safety and Pearson insisted they must match the Baggies' ethic and strength to survive. He said: 'You're looking at strength of character and we made additions and key players came in then: Kieran Richardson and Kevin Campbell added to what was a really good group of people who had a common goal and worked exceptionally hard. Pearson was Bobby Robson's assistant when the West Brom avoided relegation in 2005 . 'That's always going to be the base line. 'To win things you need those qualities, to avoid relegation you need those qualities. Ability gets you so far, strength of character too, but it's trying to get a balance of the two. 'There is a desire and a willingness to look for the answers. There are no quick fixes in life, well there might be but they don't have enough longevity. It's about winning the next game, as it always has been for us.' West Brom beat Portsmouth 2-0 on the final day in 2005 to send Crystal Palace, Southampton and Norwich down. Pearson insisted Leicester would need to keep a clear head to give themselves a chance of survival. Pearson has highlighted the importance of his squad sticking together during the difficult months ahead . 'I don't think there's any one recipe for dealing with these situations,' he said. 'My time at West Brom was the lowest points total ever to stay up. 'You can never be in control of the situation but there has to be a bit of clarity in your thinking. It's important there's a common goal and ultimately you need people to stay together. 'You will hear other people talking about siege mentalities and utilising some negative aspects to galvanise you but it depends on the chemistry within your own club. 'I don't think there's ever one absolute answer - it's not like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'","Leicester City bottom of the Premier League on Christmas day .

"Kenny McDowall says his elevation to the job of Rangers manager has been ‘tainted’ by the turmoil of close friend Ally McCoist’s departure. McDowall was called to Ibrox on Sunday evening by chief executive Derek Llambias to be told he would be replacing McCoist until the end of the season at least. His first task was to tell legend Ian Durrant he had been demoted on board instructions. Now faced with catching runaway league leaders Hearts and breathing life into a flagging promotion push at a time of unprecedented chaos, McDowall also revealed that McCoist had made an emotional farewell speech to the players on Monday urging them to make him proud by pipping their Tynecastle rivals to the Championship title. Kenny McDowall was placed in temporary charge of Rangers following Ally McCoist's departure . However, flanked by his new coaching team of Gordon Durie – who has swapped jobs with Durrant – and new player-coach Lee McCulloch, McDowall used his first media conference to admit his dream job had arrived in grim circumstances. With a shrug he said: ‘It’s tainted, isn’t it? What can you do? I’ve got to try and make the best of a bad situation. ‘Yesterday was a sad day. Ally came in to say goodbye to the players and staff. The man that he is, he finished by saying nothing would make him more proud than if they went on to win the title. The biggest tribute we can do is to try and pull that off. It would be for Ally McCoist.’ McDowall, whose first game is at Hibs on Saturday, half expected to follow McCoist out the door after Llambias called him to the stadium. McDowall was part of McCoist's backroom staff at Ibrox, but has now taken the top job at Ibrox . ‘It is normally the case in normal situations. But, at the end of the day, boards do what boards do. I can’t control what’s happened. I have just got to be professional and try to get the boys up for the game and get them back winning.’ Missing from the technical area will be Durrant after the former first-team coach was demoted to Under 20s coach. Revealing he was left with little option but to break the news to his long-term colleague, McDowall added: ‘As soon as they asked me to carry out my duties to take the first team they asked me if I would inform the boys of the changes they wanted to make.’ Asked if that was a task the board themselves should have undertaken, McDowall replied: ‘Possibly. That is open for debate. But they asked me if I would do it which I duly did. Gordon Durie will assist McDowall as he tries to claw back a big gap to leaders Hearts . ‘It wasn’t easy, but the boys fully understand because at the moment there is a lot going on, a lot of positions moving about, and mine was one of them. I had to explain it was a board decision and the boys respected that and just got on with it.’ Asked to explain the rationale behind the board’s changes, he shrugged: ‘I’ve no idea. You’d have to ask the board.’ McDowall claimed McCoist’s resignation had come out of the blue despite their close friendship. Asked when he knew of his plans, he insisted: ‘The morning it came out in the paper, believe it or not. I didn’t realise he was doing it. He never discussed it. He was obviously thinking long and hard about doing it. ‘It was a surprise to me as much as anything. But I fully expected him to be here for the year and do the notice. It didn’t happen like that so we have to get on with it.’","McDowall has been placed in caretaker charge for the rest of the season .

"A furious David Moyes stormed onto the pitch to confront the referee after the full-time whistle after a last-gasp penalty from Levante denied him a first away win in charge of Real Sociedad. The former Manchester United boss was far from happy at Santiago Jaime Latre's decision to award a spot-kick to the hosts' deep into stoppage time, after Carlos Martinez was penalised for handball. As a result Sociedad are now without a win in three league games and sit just three points above the relegation zone in La Liga.

They were left to rue their missed opportunities as Canales struck with a clinical finish shortly after the break, before Andreas Ivanschitz struck at the death from the penalty spot.

"David Moyes insists his priority is avoiding relegation as the Real Sociedad boss admitted he faces a tough task to secure a lucrative berth in Europe for next season. The Basque club, who have been weakened by a need to cash in on a number of their best players in recent years, had a poor start to their La Liga campaign before stabilising under Moyes after he replaced the sacked Jagoba Arrasate last month. When they return after the two-week winter break they host second-placed Barcelona at their Anoeta stadium in San Sebastian and the Scot said their first five or six matches in 2015 would be crucial to their chances of moving up the table from their current position of 14th.

Sociedad finished fourth in 2012-13 and qualified for the Champions League, where they finished bottom of their group. Last season, they were seventh and secured a place in Europa League qualifying but were eliminated by Russian side FK Krasnodar. 'It is going to be difficult to get back into Europe, we all have to be clear about that,' Moyes said in an interview published in AS on Tuesday. 'Right now I am focused, and this is my obsession, on winning all the games we can so that we can make sure of avoiding relegation as soon as possible,' the former Manchester United and Everton manager added. 'If we get some good results at the start of the year we can start to look up at the places above us.' Moyes said he was enjoying living in Spain and his biggest challenge was learning the language. 'I am learning words mainly to do with football which are helping me with my relationships with the players,' he added. 'I have given myself time to get to know the players better, the club and everything around it, and my picture is already more complete. 'Everything we want to change in the future has to be done gradually and not in a drastic way. 'We will change things but in a logical way. In any case, the only thing that matters to me is that the team moves up the table step by step.'","Real Sociedad currently sit in 14th position in La Liga .

"Real Sociedad need to toughen up mentally if they are to reverse a poor away record when they travel to Valencia to face Levante in La Liga on Saturday, according to coach David Moyes. Sociedad are yet to win away in Spain's top flight this season and were thumped 4-0 at Villarreal and drew 0-0 at Deportivo La Coruna on their last two trips away from San Sebastian. With 15 matches played, they are 14th on 14 points, one place higher than when former Manchester United and Everton manager Moyes took over last month. 'It's very important to try to finish the year with a win,' Moyes told a news conference on Friday as Sociedad prepare for their final game before the two-week winter break. David Moyes (left) needs to improve Real Sociedad's dismal away record in La Liga . The former Manchester United manager has taken the club one place higher in the table since his arrival .

'We need to be tough in defence so that it is difficult to score past us.' 'I have to learn from the games at Deportivo and Villarreal and I have to find a way to win games away from home.' Moyes said he had no illusions about the amount of work needed to turn Sociedad's fortunes around and achieve the club's goal of securing a place in European competition for next season.

"Alan Irvine has hit back at Joey Barton's claims that West Bromwich Albion 's*** themselves' when in front and urged his players to respond to defeat at Queens Park Rangers by beating Manchester City. West Brom lost 3-2 at Loftus Road last Saturday despite racing into an early two-goal lead and sit just two points above the relegation zone ahead of City's visit to the Hawthorns on Boxing Day. Barton was scathing of West Brom in comments following the match, won by Charlie Austin's hat-trick, and told team-mate Richard Dunne their opponents had gone ahead to early. West Brom boss Alan Irvine has hit back at criticism from QPR midfielder Joey Barton . Barton (right) claimed Baggies 's*** themselves' after racing into two-goal lead before losing 3-2 . 'I said, ""They don't know how to win games and – excuse the language – they'll s*** themselves,""' said Barton. 'They don't know how to get over the finishing line.' West Brom lost after going ahead against West Ham this month, and drew with Manchester United earlier this season – but have seen out four victories after scoring first. Irvine said: 'The fact is we have won games and held on to leads. Like any other team sometimes you don't. We have players clearly who are perfectly capable of winning games. They have done that for us in the past and they will do in the future. Barton celebrates with Charlie Austin after the striker's treble sealed a stunning comeback by the Hoops . 'Joey will know why he said it. I'm not going to pin his comments on the dressing room wall, but I am sure the lads are aware of it. Who knows, maybe we might use it next time we play them.' Irvine believes champions City cannot afford many slip ups if they are to catch leaders Chelsea. 'Man City will have to be very, very good for the rest of the season to make sure they can capitalise on any mistakes by Chelsea,' he said. 'I'm hoping their job is harder after Boxing Day.'","Baggies blew two-goal lead to lose Saturday's top-flight clash at QPR .

"Jose Baxter is discussing his journey from being Everton’s youngest ever player to the brink of a second cup semi-final with Sheffield United when he reveals he would like to say sorry to David Moyes. Having been handed his Premier League debut by Moyes aged 16 years and 191 days, sooner than Wayne Rooney or Ross Barkley, Baxter left Goodison Park at 20, exasperated with reserve football and team-mates who laughed after losses. There was a contract offer from Everton but Baxter failed to put pen to paper. Two years on he has scored at Wembley, been part of a side to beat Liverpool, and made more than 100 senior appearances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sheffield United player Jose Baxter talks about his best position . Jose Baxter left Everton in 2012 after rejecting fresh terms for a new contract at the club . Kick-off: 7.45pm Bramall Lane. TV: Highlights on The League Cup Show, BBC1 from 11.05pm. Referee: Chris Foy. ‘It was an easy decision for me really,’ he says. 'When David Moyes offered me the contract I didn’t say, “No thanks”,’ explains Baxter. ‘It had to be signed by a certain date and I just didn’t sign it. ‘Because he’d been so good to me I do regret a little bit not going in and saying, “Listen, I’m going to move on.” If I came across him now I’d definitely apologise for that.’ It is six seasons since Moyes sent Baxter on for the final 12 minutes of a top-flight fixture against Blackburn, then started the schoolboy a week later at West Bromwich Albion. ‘He hugged me when I came off,’ says Baxter. ‘He’s a top fella – I haven’t got a bad word to say about him.’ The propensity for making bold career decisions is a trait that unites the pair. The player left Everton to gain regular first-team football lower down the leagues, initially with Oldham; the manager elected to re-start his career abroad with Real Sociedad following his chastening spell at Manchester United. ‘He’ll probably learn another language and take his family,’ says Baxter. ‘If he does come back to England there will definitely be a job for him.’ Baxter celebrates scoring for Sheffield United in their FA Cup semi-final against Hull at Wembley in April . Baxter stepped into League One eager to get meaningful action after growing disillusioned with youth football. He played four senior games in 2008-09 but only nine more in the next two seasons, in competition with Marouane Fellaini. Predominantly, he stretched his legs in Under 21 matches. For Baxter, that was not a means to push on. ‘I was going into reserve games and getting beat and was gutted,’ he says. ‘I was looking round and there were other lads laughing saying, “Shall we go for food, or go out for a bit?” I don’t want to do that after losing a game of football. It just shows it means nothing to them. ‘Then I would be around the first team and one player has another by the scruff of the neck because they’ve got a draw instead of a win. ‘I played reserve football from 14 up to 19 and it just got boring. If a first-team player was injured he would come down and wouldn’t take it seriously. It just wasn’t for me.’ He went on loan to Tranmere Rovers for the first half of the 2011-12 campaign. The 22-year-old feels her owes former Everton boss David Moyes for the way he departed the club . ‘The loan system is brilliant – it helped me massively. There are no kids – if you’re good enough you’re old enough. And if you’re old enough you’re ready for a b*****ing.’ Intensity is a difficult thing to manufacture when the consequences of victory or defeat remain fairly unsubstantiated – youth football’s eternal problem perhaps. Baxter did gain a real sense of competition on international duty, captaining England Under 17s at the European Championship of 2009. He played alongside Jack Wilshere and against Mario Gotze, who scored in a 4-0 victory for eventual champions Germany. ‘There have definitely been a few I’ve played against who’ve kicked on,’ is Baxter’s understated appraisal on the last man to score a winning goal in a World Cup final. ‘Jack is certainly one of the best I’ve played with,’ he adds. ‘When we used to go away at 16, you didn’t really know what gym was. He would always be in there working his socks off.’ Hard work is a defining principle of Nigel Clough’s Sheffield United and could prove the determining factor in their ambitions of toppling Southampton in Tuesday’s Capital One Cup quarter-final. This season’s other Premier League upstarts, West Ham, have already been upset by Clough’s side in this competition – on penalties in round two – and Baxter believes Bramall Lane in full voice can provide the setting for another scalp. Baxter talks to Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell at Sheffield United's training ground . ‘It’s a loving football city and they really want us to do well. It’s only what they deserve.’ Baxter has been scouting Southampton since the draw was made six weeks ago. ‘You watch them closer and try to see weaknesses. There haven’t been many. For us to beat them it will be difficult but we will be going into the game to win.’ Ronald Koeman’s side haven’t won in five, losing their last four and Baxter cannot resist. 'When they heard they were playing us in the cup they started getting beat – whether they’re a bit nervous about Sheffield United I‘m not sure.’ Southampton were one of League One’s big beasts back in 2011 before earning consecutive promotions and re-establishing themselves in the Premier League. It is a progression Baxter draws inspiration from. ‘That’s where we want to be. Everyone knows Sheffield United don’t belong in this league but it is the reality. We’re doing our best to get out of it. There is no better way than to play against the big teams and see how far off you are.’ Sheffield United reached the FA Cup semi-final last season after knocking out two Premier League teams. Baxter scored the opening goal in a thrilling match against Hull at Wembley, eventually succumbing 5-3. ‘It makes you want to get there every year,’ he says of the occasion. It was a career highlight, alongside victory over Luis Suarez’s Liverpool in the same competition in January 2013 while at Oldham. Despite his Everton connection, Baxter is a Liverpool fan and was at the 2005 League Cup final at the Millenium Stadium that Chelsea won 3-2. Ask for his preference between going one better with Sheffield United or going up into the Championship, he responds instantly. ‘Definitely I’d rather have promotion all day. That’s easy,’ he says. Baxter has a habit of making tricky choices look simple. One Football League fan will on Tuesday win the £250,000 SkyBet Transfer Fund for their club to spend on players in January. Watch the draw on Sky Sports News at noon.","Jose Baxter left Everton in 2012 after rejecting a new contract .

"Everton ended a run of four games without a win as QPR endured another miserable away day. Rangers have yet to pick up a single point away from home this season and never looked likely to end that sequence at Goodison Park once Ross Barkley put Everton on the way to a 3-1 victory in the 33rd minute. Sportsmail's Dan Ripley rated the players' performances at Goodison Park on Monday night. Everton (4-2-3-1) Tim Howard 6 . Rarely tested but was still beaten after parrying low Mutch strike straight into path of Zamora to stab home. Seamus Coleman 7 . A constant threat down the right and was rarely put under any defensive pressure as he attacked with freedom. Phil Jagielka 7 . Didn't give the QPR attackers a sniff in the first half and did well to control Zamora after striker's introduction. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley was eager to impress against QPR . Sylvain Distin 6.5 . One day short of his 37th birthday but still showed he can compete at the top level even if his pace has gone. Leighton Baines 6.5 . Not his finest game on the left flank, with Coleman doing more of the attacking work on the opposite wing. Booked. Muhamed Besic 7.5 . Helped Everton get on top in the midfield with a number of robust but fair tackles. Passing also up to a high standard. Ross Barkley 8 . Scored Everton's opener with a stunning strike and continues to develop at a promising rate after playing in deeper role. Muhamed Besic helped Everton boss the midfield with some strong challenges . Aidan McGeady 7 . Hit and miss on the wing but delivered a fine cross to the far post for Naismith to score third goal. Steven Naismith 7 . Second half header helped put Everton out of sight even if he struggled to link the midfield with Lukaku. Kevin Mirallas 7 . Scored fortunate free-kick and his runs were difficult for QPR to defend. Went down easily in Hoops' box following Dunne challenge. Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, left, failed to trouble the QPR defence on Monday night . Romelu Lukaku 6 . Hardly contributed anything on the pitch throughout the entire evening. Failed to have a single shot on target. Subs . Steven Pienaar (for McGeady 73) 6.5 . Introduced as sub and immediately got involved, but Everton were already in second gear by the time he came on. Samuel Eto’o (for Lukaku 77) 6.5 . Did more in 13 minutes than Lukaku did in 90. Struck post with fine strike across goal late on after combining with Kone. Arouna Kone (for Mirallas 90) Everton's Aidan McGeady (left) delivered superb cross to the far post for Steven Naismith to score . Subs not used . Robles, Stones, Garbutt, Alcaraz . Manager . Roberto Martinez 7 . Man of the match . Ross Barkley . QPR (4-5-1) Rob Green 5 . Unlucky for first two goals, but his poor kicking throughout the game proved costly as Everton capitalised with third strike. Mauricio Isla 5.5 . Managed to compete with Baines but never got the upper hand on the Everton full-back despite creating a couple of chances. Richard Dunne 5.5 . Subject of a controversial penalty shout after nudging over Mirallas but did help keep Lukaku quiet and starved the striker of service. Kevin Mirallas of Everton goes down in the penalty area under pressure from Richard Dunne of QPR . Nedum Onuoha 5 . Unfortunate to score own goal following Naismith's header. Made 10 clearances but still part of a defence which shipped three goals. Yun Suk-Young 5 . Run ragged by Coleman and looked uncomfortable on the ball as Everton constantly pressed the full-back in possession. Matt Phillips 5 . Hardly got involved and only notable contribution was to fire well over bar in first half before being replaced by Zamora. Joey Barton 6 . His needless foul on Naismith led to free-kick which Mirallas scored from, but midfielder battled well for the Hoops. QPR midfielder Joey Barton had a running battle with Everton's Steven Naismith . Leroy Fer 5.5 . Forceful in the tackle but wayward in his shooting. Hauled off for the more attack minded Kranjcar late on. Jordan Mutch 5.5 . Shot led to QPR's consolation strike, but he had already missed one good chance and dangerous tackle on Mirallas was reckless. Junior Hoilett 6.5 . Always an avenue in attack for QPR despite fading late on. Low-cut back led to Zamora's goal 10 minutes from time. Eduardo Vargas 4.5 . Tough night as a false striker. Only goal scoring contribution came in own box in helping Mirallas free-kick deflect in for 2-0. Eduardo Vargas struggled to impose himself as false striker form QPR . Subs . Bobby Zamora (for Phillips 59) 6 . Helped add substance in the QPR attack and was rewarded with first goal since May after pouncing on rebound. Niko Kranjcar (for Fer 77) 5.5 . Brought on to add creative flair but couldn't help sustain any QPR pressure as game petered out after Zamora goal. Subs not used . McCarthy, Ferdinand, Hill, Wright-Phillips, Henry . Manager . Harry Redknapp 5.5 . Referee . Neil Swarbrick 6.5 .","Everton midfielder Ross Barkley (8) was man of the match .

"He's on the three-man shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or but Manuel Neuer didn't quite end his stellar year as planned on Friday night. The 28-year-old has made a lot of strikers look foolish with his impressive outfield ball skills, but this time the Bayern Munich goalkeeper got a taste of his own medicine as the German giants travelled to Mainz. Neuer was made to look rather foolish for the hosts opener on 21 minutes as Elkin Soto's left-footed shot at the near post rather embarrassingly nutmegged him.

The 34-year-old's goal was Bayern's fourth conceded in 17 league games, the fewest ever in the first half of a Bundesliga season. Despite the Colombian's effort though, Neuer would eventually have the last laugh as strikes from team-mates Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben saw Pep Guardiola's side turn the match on it's head. Robben's 90th minute winner sends Bundesliga leaders into the winter break with a commanding 14-point lead.

When the consultant came on the ward rounds, Savita asked if they could not save the baby, could they induce to end the pregnancy. ‘The consultant said, “As long as there is a foetal heartbeat we can’t do anything”.’ He said that it was the law, that this is a Catholic country. Savita said, “I am neither Irish nor Catholic,” but they said there was nothing they could do.’ Mr Halappanavar told how the couple, who moved to Ireland from India in 2008,  were ‘on top of the world’ about the baby. However, on Sunday, October 21, his wife began suffering back pain and went to Galway University Hospital. The 31-year-old, who was 17 weeks pregnant, was found to be miscarrying when she was admitted to Galway University Hospital in Ireland . An hour after being discharged, Mrs Halappanavar became convinced something was wrong, and her husband drove her back to the hospital. Following a second examination, the couple were told she was having a miscarriage and that doctors would not be able to save the baby. Mr Halappanavar said he was told the miscarriage would be over in a few hours and that his wife would be able to go home afterwards.

Protestor Niamh O'Reilly (left) lights a candle for Savita Halappanavar. (Right) Irish TD Clare Daly wants to see new laws introduced to allow an abortion in specific, life-threatening circumstances . But she began vomiting and shivering uncontrollably on Tuesday night, more than 48 hours after she first arriving at hospital, and her baby died the following day. After an operation to remove the dead foetus, she was  taken to intensive care and died four days later on Sunday 28 October of organ failure. A post-mortem examination found she had septicaemia, a form of blood poisoning, and an E.coli infection. Speaking from India, where he took his wife’s body to be cremated, Mr Halappanavar said: ‘I am distraught, I have lost my soulmate. ‘Doctors refused the termination on the grounds that the foetal heartbeat was still present and being a Catholic country it is not permitted. A total of 4,149 Irish women came to England and Wales for abortions last year . ‘I tried to plead with the  doctors that I am not Irish or a Catholic, so please help and terminate her pregnancy. 'I hope they change the law and make it more people-friendly [rather] than on the basis of religious beliefs. ‘If it had happened in the UK or India, the thing would have been over in a few hours.’ Mr Halappanavar said that he would wait for the outcome of investigations before deciding whether to take legal action against the hospital. The Health Service Executive has begun an investigation and the hospital has launched a review. An inquest is also expected to be held. Abortion is outlawed in Ireland, even in cases of rape and incest, or where the foetus has serious abnormalities and is unlikely to survive. Doctors are allowed to intervene only if they believe the mother’s life is at risk. There have been five referendums on the issue in the past 30 years. The country’s constitution, which gives a foetus the same rights as a living person, cannot be changed without a popular vote. Clare Daly, an Irish MP who has campaigned against the abortion laws, said: ‘This is a situation we were told would never arise. ‘An unviable foetus – the woman was having a miscarriage – was given priority over her life, who unfortunately and predictably developed septicaemia and died.’ But Dr Ruth Cullen, of the Pro Life Campaign, said: ‘The guidelines are very clear that all necessary treatment must be given to women in pregnancy.’ Irish premier Enda Kenny said the government would wait for the outcome of the investigations, adding: ‘A child has been lost, a mother has died a husband is bereaved. That is a tragedy.’ It comes just two months after he told Time magazine that he was personally against abortion, adding: ‘I think that this issue is not of priority for government now.’ VIDEO: Pro-choice rally in memory of miscarrying mother Savita Halappanavar . While abortion is legal almost everywhere in Europe, severe restrictions still apply in some countries - particularly those with large Roman Catholic populations.THE REPUBLIC OF IRELANDAbortion is banned in the Republic of Ireland, where laws governing the procedure acknowledge the 'right to life of the unborn'.In theory, abortion is permitted in the country if there is a risk to the life of the woman - although instances are extremely rare. A provision exists in the Irish constitution for the country's Parliament to legislate on the controversial issue, but no political party has yet opted to do so. More than 4,000 Irish women travelled to the UK to undergo terminations in 2011.NORTHERN IRELANDNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act - which legalised the procedure by registered practitioners and regulated its free provision on the NHS - does not apply.

"Former AC Milan and Italy midfielder Demetrio Albertini is confident misfiring striker Fernando Torres can rediscover his goalscoring touch in the near future. Torres joined Milan this summer on a two-year loan deal from Chelsea but has failed to replicate the form he displayed during his time with both Atletico Madrid and Liverpool. The Spain striker has scored just one goal in 10 league appearances for the Rossoneri and has not started in Milan's last three Serie A games. Fernando Torres has struggled since moving to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal in the summer . The Spain striker (left) has scored just one goal in 10 Serie A appearances this season . 'If you want to see the real Nino (Torres), then you have to wait,' Albertini told Turin-based sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'The current Torres is not the one we all knew. 'He is coming off two seasons in which he played very little, so it's not easy to find oneself after that. 'Fernando must be aware of what he has gone through, he must rediscover self-confidence and belief in himself not just through words, but through action. 'Moreover, we cannot forget that football in Spain and England offers more spaces than in Italy, hence, a striker has at least four or five chances per game. 'For him Serie A is completely new.' Ex-Milan star Demetrio Albertini insists Torres will come good once he rediscovers his 'self-belief' Albertini, who was a team-mate of Torres at Atletico in the 2002-03 season, believes the 30-year-old striker still has to find his feet in Milan but firmly believes the Spaniard can follow the footsteps of his compatriot Fernando Llorente and succeed in Italy's top flight. Llorente moved to Juventus in the summer of 2013 from Athletic Bilbao and struggled early on before becoming a regular for the Turin giants. 'Llorente is a great example,' Albertini said. 'After two or three months he adapted to the Italian training and match tempo, but he was in a side that had won the Scudetto and he and Carlos Tevez were the only additions to the team. 'I think the challenges for Torres are, other than settling in, finding his place in a team that has profoundly changed with respect to last season due to the new coach (Filippo Inzaghi). Juventus striker Fernando Llorente, scoring against Malmo, originally struggled to adapt to Serie A . But Llorente is now a regular for Juve and Torres can follow in his footsteps, believes Albertini . 'When you build a mosaic with five or six changes out of 11 pieces, it is logical to have fewer guarantees and the newcomers will feel even more out of place. 'When a foreign player joins a consolidated team, it is easier to adapt. 'When you put together a puzzle, you start with the outline and fill in the gaps, but if every summer you break up the outline... 'Torres could well be left on the bench as he needs time to adapt. 'It's down to Inzaghi and the player to understand the best course of action.'

"The world’s largest gingerbread house has been constructed in Texas and it’s big enough to board a family of five and packs a gut-busting 35 million calories. Members of the Bryan, Texas Traditions Club pitched in November 30 to snag the Guinness World Record with the help of nearly one ton of butter, 7,200 eggs, and thousands more pounds brown sugar and flour. ‘Basically it has everything but indoor plumbing,’ said Bill Horton, general manager of the Traditions Club. Scroll down for video... World's largest: The world's largest gingerbread house has enough room for an entire family and has an exterior made entirely of gingerbread and icing . Good cause: The house was built by the Bryan, Texas Traditions Club in order to benefit a local hospital . Butter: 1,800 pounds . Eggs: 7,200 . Flour: 7,200 pounds . Brown Sugar: 3,000 pounds . Candy: 22,304 pieces . Total Calories: 36 Million . Horton and his festive construction crew did something remarkable: the modest community of Bryan rallied around the fun and charitable cause and made holiday magic happen. That’s 39,201.8 cubic feet of magic, according to TODAY.com—big enough to muscle out the previous record that was set in 2006 at Minnesota’s Mall of America. ‘I think what impresses me most is the community spirit around the record attempt,’ Horton’s colleague Michael Menchaha told CNN. ‘People came together for this remarkable cause and really worked hard at it.’ The astonishing home was built as a tourist attraction with proceeds all going to the trauma program at nearby St. Joseph Health System. What’s more, nearly all the supplies used in the construction were donated. Holiday wonderland: Santa is allowed a close peek at the amazing house, but most visitors are kept a safe distance form its delectable facade . Challenges: The house has seen its roadbumps including melting heat and dissolving rain and humidity that would make any gingerbread man wobble . Sweet deal: Proceeds benefit  the trauma program at nearby St. Joseph Health System . In less than a week, the house has raised $150,000 and attracts 600 people per night. According to TODAY, a local home builder and architect designed the home, but it was Horton who dreamed it up. ‘I’m both a Food Network junkie and a Google guy, and twelve to fourteen months ago I saw something about gingerbread houses, and it spurred me to find out what the largest one ever built was,’ Horton said. Once he found that out, there was no stopping him. Lofty ambitions: This mockup shows one vision creators had for the record-breaking gingerbread house . Not all sugar and spice: The house contains a skeleton of wood and that holds all the gingerbread together. But the entire facade is edible . Kind souls: The house was built entirely by volunteers and contains a whopping 22,300 pieces of candy . ‘In June, I was at a luncheon with St. Joseph’s Hospital, and I got this crazy idea to build the world’s largest gingerbread house and combine it with their drive to build a center for their trauma program, and they bit,’ he explained. The house construction was not without its kinks. Humidity and heat are issues they’ve had to contest with, but that’s not all. ‘The biggest issue has been bees,’ Horton said. ‘We called in a beekeeper the other night and he said there was a cluster of about 2,000 bees. We’ve worked all around them through the process. They’re not bothering us. They’re just getting drunk on sugar.’ The house costs $2 for children and $3 for adults and will stand through mid-December.","The 22-foot house was built by a group of volunteers from Bryan, Texas's Traditions Club .

"The Grand Theft Auto series was named as one of the games that could lead to reckless driving (file picture) Teenagers who play mature-rated, risk-glorifying video games are more likely to become reckless drivers who suffer more car accidents, police stops and are more tempted to drink and drive. The claim was made in research by the American Psychological Association, which said certain games may increase rebelliousness and sensation-seeking among adolescents. Lead author Jay Hull, of Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, said: 'Popular games that increase reckless driving may constitute even more of . a public health issue than the widely touted association of video games . and aggression.' The researchers conducted a long-term study involving more than 5,000 . U.S. teenagers, who answered a series of questions over four years in . four waves of telephone interviews. Fifty per cent of the teens reported in the first interview that their . parents allowed them to play mature-rated games and among those, 32 . per cent said they had played Spiderman II, 12 per cent had played Manhunt . and 58 per cent had played Grand Theft Auto III. Playing video games . such as Grand Theft Auto III, Manhunt and Spiderman II was associated . with increases in sensation seeking, rebelliousness and self-reported . risky driving, the study said. 'Most parents would probably be disturbed to learn that we observed that this type of game play was more strongly associated with teen drivers being pulled over by the police than their parenting practices,' said Hull. 'With motor vehicle accidents the No. 1 cause of adolescent deaths, popular games that increase reckless driving may constitute even more of a public health issue than the widely touted association of video games and aggression.' Grand Theft Auto IV was a critically-acclaimed 18-rated game, but there were concerns about younger players emulating the violence they saw on-screen . Between the second and third interviews, teens who said they had been pulled over by the police increased from 11 per cent to 21 per cent; those who said they had a car accident went from 8 per cent to 14 per cent. In the third interview, when the teens were about 16 years old, 25 per cent said 'yes' when asked if they engaged in any unsafe driving habits. In the final interview when the teens were about 18, 90 per cent said 'yes' to at least one of the same risky driving habits: . The researchers determined the teens’ levels of sensation seeking and rebelliousness by asking them to rate themselves on a four-point scale following questions such as 'I like to do dangerous things' and 'I get in trouble at school.' The study controlled for variables such as gender, age, race, parent income and education and parenting styles described as warm and responsive or demanding. 'Playing these kinds of video games could also result in these adolescents developing personalities that reflect the risk-taking, rebellious characters they enact in the games and that could have broader consequences that apply to other risky behaviors such as drinking and smoking,' Hull said. The information regarding the teens’ driving habits was based on their own reports during the interviews, and therefore interpretation of the causes of their driving habits was speculative, the authors noted. But Hull added: 'At the same time, because the study began when the participants were playing video games but were too young to drive, it is clear that the videogame exposure preceded the risky driving.'","American Psychological Association says reckless driving in games leads to more car accidents and police stops .

"For most clubs, it would be sufficient to fill a working week with Champions League quarter-final qualification, the resignation and jailing of their legendary president plus the outside world poring over every grim detail. But Bayern Munich are not, and have never been, any old club. Partly thanks to the career of Franz ‘Der Kaiser’ Beckenbauer. Nevertheless, in the full knowledge that his World Cup-winning former West Germany and Bayern team-mate, Uli Hoeness, was likely to be convicted and given jail time the following day and that for some in Bavaria it might already feel like the world was caving in, Beckenbauer chose Wednesday to rake the club’s current football philosophy and expensively-hired new coach with his perpetually sharp claws. Not his way? Pep Guardiola reacts during Bayern's victory over Arsenal in the Champions League . Defensive: Bayern Munich legend Franz Beckenbauer was uncomplimentary on Guardiola's tactics . To explain. It’s the 36th minute of the European champions’ 1-1 draw with Arsenal in Munich. David Alaba has driven forward and, having scored six times from the left-back position for club and country this season, feels entitled to shoot. The Austrian drags an effort meekly wide. On the touchline Pep Guardiola grimaces, not in frustration that the ball hasn’t gone in but at Alaba’s choice of action. The Catalan briefly beats both hands on his shaven skull. With 26 minutes left, Bastian Schweinsteiger sees a free channel down the middle of the pitch, just like the one he used to burst through and score 10 minutes previously. He strides towards goal and, when Laurent Koscielny attempts to close him down, instead of passing to either Philipp Lahm or Mario Mandzukic, who are free, he shoots over from the edge of the box.This time Guardiola is angry. From the touchline he calls Schweinsteiger’s attention in order to reprimand him. Miss: Bastian Schweinsteiger took a shot from far out which Guardiola was very annoyed about . Beckenbauer can’t believe it —  and tells the world on Sky Germany: ‘This will end with us resembling Barcelona and nobody will want to watch us. We risk boring the fans. These players are being told to pass the ball right up to the goal-line. ‘If this is now the Bayern philosophy, it may bring us our joyful moments but we’ll probably end up playing like Barcelona and, when we actually get to the goal-line, we’ll recycle the ball and pass it backwards rather than scoring. ‘I have another view. If I can shoot from distance, above all against a massed defence, then I have to do that. It’s an effective formula.’ Where to begin. Notwithstanding Paul Breitner, Gerd Muller or Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Beckenbauer is by some distance the club’s greatest footballer — world champion for Bayern and West Germany as player and coach. Wild: David Alaba was another who irked Guardiola after he shot when the Spaniard wished he hadn't . Currently Bayern’s honorary president, his role is non-executive. Even if some of his declarations are now taken with a pinch of salt, such denigratory words about the football fundamentals of the Guardiola era will undermine the coach, give fuel to any player unhappy under the Catalan’s steely rule and the use of a word like ‘boring’ will obviously not thrill the sponsors who help fund the coach’s £7.5m (nine million euros) salary. It wouldn’t be accurate to call the words a ‘cheap shot’. No question they are what Der Kaiser believes. But the timing stinks. With the departure of Hoeness and promotion of his deputy on Bayern’s company advisory board, Herbert Hainer (Adidas chairman), there is the opportunity for further corporate instability. The thudding shock of the outgoing man’s jail term will reverberate amongst players, media and fans for a considerable time. Hoeness is indelibly linked to Bayern’s sense of wellbeing and identity. Behind bars: Former Bayern President Uli Hoeness was jailed for tax evasion in the week . For Beckenbauer to call into question the entire Guardiola experiment is therefore something which both the Catalan (extremely sensitive to such matters) and his employers could have done without. Guardiola has already explained, clearly, also to Sky: ‘To have big, big possession but not create chances and just defend — that’s not football. I like when my team has the ball but possession for itself is nothing. I like it more when the ball goes at high speed to the players in the right positions than the players move position a lot.’ Bayern have romped the Bundesliga and should contest the German Cup Final against Borussia Dortmund. Retaining the Champions League now becomes the top priority. Sore though Bayern’s former coach Jupp Heynckes will be that his firm friend Hoeness has fallen so far, the 67-year-old will still afford a grim chuckle at Guardiola’s expense. Heynckes had to cope with all of this himself. Cope and thrive. This is how he deconstructs his handling of the  traumas of Bayern. Champions: Bayern managed 50 games unbeaten on Saturday as they beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 . ‘You’ve got to be able to transmit a sense of serenity to your players,’ he said. ‘Kalle (Rummenigge) and Uli (Hoeness) had a tendency to panic and ask too many questions. I learned early on how to cope with stress. ‘Despite having to compete for places, my players were all pulling in the same direction. The atmosphere in the dressing room was exceptional. I handed over a complete, ultra-competitive team to my successor.’ Ultra-competitive it remains. But is the harmony in jeopardy? The next few weeks will be the litmus test.","Franz Beckenbauer claimed Bayern Munich risked 'boring fans'

"A customer upset with a plate of cold beef at a country pub wrote a negative review on travel website TripAdvisor - and has now been banned. Jane Hepburn, from Berrick Salome, near Wallingford, Oxon, posted the review after she was disappointed with the food and service at The Lamb Inn, Chalgrove. She says that when she returned for a drink more than a month later she was asked to leave by staff who accused her of making 'snide remarks' on Facebook. Banned: The Lamb Inn in Chalgrove asked Jane Hepburn to leave after the bad review . The mum-of-three said 'When we went there in late September, I had relatives over from Australia and we ordered our food and six of us had roast beef. It was freezing cold. 'I asked to speak to the manager and he said that was how it was cooked if we wanted rare beef. 'He was quite arrogant and he said if we wanted it warm we should have come earlier. 'Four days later I wrote review on TripAdvisor honestly about what I thought. 'When I went back there a month later, I asked to be served and the man at the bar said ""I am not going to serve you, I will bar you for writing snide remarks on Facebook"".' Country pub: The venue's licence holder denied asking Mrs Hepburn to leave had anything to do with the review . Mrs Hepburn, 48, said she had been left 'humiliated' by the public embarrassment. 'It was not just that one meal, I had been a few times and on each occasion one member of our group was not particularly happy but I brushed it off. 'I have not spoken to the pub since.' The Lamb Inn's licence holder Victoria Wood admitted Mrs Hepburn had been asked not to drink at the pub, but denied it had anything to do with the TripAdvisor review. 'It is not the case at all. She has been a customer of ours for a while and we have had multiple complaints about her from our staff. 'She was being rude to our staff and she put a really nasty review on TripAdvisor. 'It was a series of events but nothing to do with her TripAdvisor review and comments.' The Lamb Inn later issued a statement which said: 'We have got no comment other than to say Mrs Hepburn's comments are a complete fabrication of the truth.'","Jane Hepburn was disappointed with food at The Lamb Inn, Chalgrove .

"With their thick beards, stern warrior-like features and sculpted torsos, they are models of manliness. But now the 2,500-year old Riace Bronzes have lost a little of their masculine dignity- after they were dressed up in a pink feather boa and a leopard print thong. The ancient Greek warrior statues, one of Italy’s most revered archaeological discoveries, were found at the bottom of the sea in 1972, and recently went on display after a lengthy restoration. Controversial: The 2,500-year old Riace Bronzes, one of which is pictured left in its usual state, lost a little of their masculine dignity- after they were dressed up in a pink feather boa and white veil, right . Photographer Gerald Bruneau, pictured kneeling down, lines up a picture of one of an ancient statue given a white veil makeover and holding a bunch of flowers . But their exhibition in a museum in Southern Italy has proved divisive after a photographer dressed the towering and life-like statues in a white tulle veil, fuchsia boa and leopard print underwear. French photographer Gerald Bruneau, a protegee of Andy Warhol, said the provocative gesture was a jokey comment on the gay marriage debate. He said: 'Down in the south of Italy the men are very macho and conservative and are very upset by the idea of gay marriage. But the ancient Greeks had no problem with homosexuality.' 'Some people will be scandalised but it was supposed to be joyful and reflect the times.' He says he was given permission to shoot the warriors in a veil but then spotted the other items at market stall. Simonetta Binomi, head of Reggio Calabria's National Archaeological Museum, said the photos were 'terrible' and 'in bad taste'. Makeover: French photographer Gerald Bruneau sparked outrage when he dressed the towering and life-like statues (such as the one pictured right) in a white tulle veil (left) Simonetta Binomi, head of Reggio Calabria's National Archaeological Museum, said the photos (left and right) were 'terrible' and 'in bad taste' French photographer Gerald Bruneau, a protegee of Andy Warhol, says the provocative gesture was a jokey comment on the gay marriage debate . She said permission had been given to Bruneau because an earlier shoot with a veil had been done tastefully but they were unaware of the controversial attire. The realistic warriors, one old and one younger, date from the 5th Century BC.They were discovered by a holiday-maker who, when diving, saw an arm sticking out of the seabed off the Italian coast. They are extremely fragile state and have just been restored so the prospect of someone with no expertise touching and dressing the statues raises concerns about how well they are being cared for. A local politician has now demanded a judicial inquiry. Politician Ignazio Messina of the conservative Italy of Values party said: ‘It cannot be art if it mocks a cultural treasure.’","Ancient Riace Bronze statues given controversial makeover for photo shoot .

"From the highest tier of the Emirates grandstand hangs a banner which bears the message: ‘You Can’t Buy Class’. It is an excellent expression of the Arsenal ethos but, as this tremendous contest graphically revealed, it ain’t necessarily so. For wherever we turned on a field awash with talent, we found footballers who had been acquired at great cost, whose gifts seemed to justify the investment. City, built upon the bountiful resources of Sheik Mansour, presented a series of jewels in Sergio Aguero, David Silva, the mightily impressive Vincent Kompany and Jesus Navas. Arsenal, blessed by the favours of an American billionaire, offered their own gems in Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, the debutant Danny Welbeck... and Jack Wilshere. Jack Wilshere put in a grandstand display in midfielder for Arsenal against Manchester City . The England international scored one and assisted one as the game finished 2-2 at the Emirates Stadium . Wilshere's first was a superb dink over Man City goalkeeper Joe Hart to level the scores at 1-1 . Of that starry cast, only Wilshere had joined his club without the formality of millions changing hands. And yet, so great was his influence, that there were times when he seemed capable of organising the entire glittering ensemble to his own requirements. Wilshere, who arrived at Arsenal as a nine-year-old some 13 years ago, delivered the kind of performance for which his public had been praying. His ceaseless commitment was an almost mundane virtue, since even limited players can provide lashings of honest endeavour. But to that industry he added the qualities which make him remarkable: the speed of thought which takes him into dangerous space, the tight control which transforms vague danger into urgent threat, above all, the ability to assess a bewildering situation and apply the appropriate pass. It is a quality which only the exceptional performers possess. There was also the maturity which enabled him to accept some fierce challenges and remain resolutely unprovoked. He has not always revealed such control, and his hair-trigger temper has frequently undermined his contribution to the cause. Too often he played like a man who has been listening to bad advice. Sergio Aguero celebrates with David Silva after opening the scoring for Manchester City . And Alexis Sanchez reels away in style after he thought he'd given Arsenal the winner late on . But a late Martin Demichelis header levelled the scores at 2-2 and resulted in game being drawn . When Paul Scholes observed that Wilshere was not the player he had promised to become, that he had not made significant improvement in the past five years, the Arsenal man was affronted by the criticism. But Scholes was right, his strictures were timely, and yesterday the genuine article shone through. His manager, Arsene Wenger, had many reasons for satisfaction; among them the fact that Arsenal had taken a point from a match they could, and possibly should, have lost. But clearly it was the display of Wilshere’s real ability which had given him most pleasure. ‘He is coming physically to his level,’ said Wenger. ‘Unfortunately, it has taken him time to find that fraction of a second where you feel you can make a difference. It was the first time this season he found it over 90 minutes.’ He might have gone further, but we sensed he was tempting fate with his praise. He has known too many false dawns where Wilshere is concerned to be carried away by one minor masterpiece. But his face told the tale more convincingly than his words. Wilshere’s goal was the kind of accomplishment which only the best players can manage. For once, all the Arsenal passing came together as the ball was worked through the centre of the City defence. When the final ball was played by Aaron Ramsey, Wilshere still had much to do. But he deceived Gael Clichy with a shuffle of feet, bore down on the keeper, and played his chip into the only space available. Paul Scholes had been critical of Wilshere before the game but praised for him afterwards . And Arsene Wenger was also pleased with the display of his much-scrutinised midfielder . His contribution to Arenal’s second was almost as decisive. Discovering space on the fringe of the City area, he stole the swiftest of glances, forced some essential pace on a difficult header and found Sanchez. The new man’s volley was sumptuous, a piece of instinctive skill which almost validated his monstrous fee, but Wilshere’s assistance had been crucial to the score, and his glee was gratifying. Man City raised their own level of performance to impressive heights, and with a nudge from fortune and the barest glimmer of basic competence from the referee Mark Clattenburg, they would have found reward. When they are good, they are very, very good, and at times  they were close to their best. But their most formidable foe was the small, stocky young man in Arsenal’s midfield; up for the fight, ready to answer skill with skill, aggression with sheer ability. Once again, Wenger’s face told the story. He looked remarkably like a gambler for whom the horse had run kindly, the wheel had spun truly. On a different day, he might have settled for a small eulogy of the excellent Welbeck, who announced himself with a smooth insertion of pace and the kind of technique which allowed him to chip Hart in full stride. Danny Welbeck was lively on his debut for Arsenal following his £16million switch from Manchester United . But he missed a gilt-edged first half opportunity when he hit the post after electing to chip Hart . Had the chance not bounced off the inside of a post, the Emirates din would have been still more clamorous. But Welbeck’s speed and presence offered Wilshere the target he has been seeking, and the promise is of a profitable alliance. The last word on Wilshere was spoken by his most perceptive critic. ‘That’s the kind of midfielder I always thought he was going to be, an attacking midfielder,’ said Scholes. Then because his nature is cautious and his attitude that of a hard-nosed old pro, he sounded the mandatory note of caution. ‘It’s still early in the season,’ he said. ‘That’s his first goal, and time will tell. What he’s done is make a great start, and now he’s got the base to go on and have a great season.’ It was as close as Scholes gets to effusive acclaim. And I suspect Jack Wilshere will settle for that.","Wilshere was the standout player for Arsenal against Manchester City .

"A Western intelligence agent 'abducted by Russia' from NATO country Estonia faces up to 20 years in jail, it was revealed last night. Tallinn has accused Moscow of an audacious stunt in kidnapping Eston Kohver from inside the European Union in a potential new East-West flashpoint. The abduction involved a smoke grenade and jamming of Estonian radio communications as he was seized. Raid: Russian security services released pictures of Eston Kohver, who they claim is intelligence-gathering for Estonia. He could be imprisoned for twenty years if found guilty of espionage . Spycraft: A specially convened closed-door court in Moscow was told at the weekend that Kohver was found in possession of a pistol, ammunition, 5,000 euros (£3,970), 'special equipment to carry out covert recording' But the FSB security service - once headed by Vladimir Putin - accuses the 44-year-old agent of being inside Russia when he was held, and is now probing him over intelligence gathering on behalf of the ex-Soviet Baltic state. Kohver is currently held in a high security Moscow prison, after being moved to the Russian capital from its border region of Pskov in an incident that revives memories of the Cold War. He could face between ten and 20 years in jail if convicted of espionage, said a Russian source. A specially convened closed-door court in Moscow was told at the weekend that Kohver was found in possession of a pistol, ammunition, 5,000 euros (£3,970), 'special equipment to carry out covert recording' and 'materials that seem to be assignments for an intelligence-gathering mission'. A close-up of the American-made pistol allegedly found on Kohver when he was snatched . Under the direction of a judge, he was ordered to be detained initially for two months while 'the necessary investigative work is carried out' He was held in a cage under armed guard in the Lefortovo courtroom, close to one of Russia's most notorious jails. Moscow played up the incident by allowing TV channels to show FSB footage of the grim-faced detainee and the items seized from him. Under the direction of a judge, he was ordered to be detained initially for two months while 'the necessary investigative work is carried out'. Tallinn - which has for years had tense relations with Moscow - claimed the KAPO intelligence agent was abducted by 'unidentified individuals from Russia' The West is deeply suspicious over the incident, and its timing, which came two days after Barack Obama visited Tallinn and vowed that an attack on Estonia would be regarded as being against all of NATO. Obama also hinted at a U.S. naval base being established in the country. The EU is today to formalise a new set of sanctions against Russia over its 'aggressive' policies in Ukraine. 'Eston Kohver has been arrested. The sitting was held behind closed doors,' court spokeswoman Yulia Skotnikova told Interfax, declining to further elaborate. 'Eston Kohver, an officer from the Tartu office of the Security Police Department of Estonian Interior Ministry, has been held in the Russian Federation,' said an FSB spokesman. Tallinn - which has for years had tense relations with Moscow - claimed the KAPO (Estonian Internal Security Service) intelligence agent was abducted by 'unidentified individuals from Russia', not the usual border guards. The Estonian Foreign Ministry summoned Russian Ambassador Yury Merzlyakov. The country's Foreign Minister Urmas Paet called the incident 'very alarming' President Toomas Hendrik Ilves - who hosted Obama on his visit - stated on Facebook: 'Just back from KAPO. Confirmed that abduction occurred in the course of cross border corruption investigation. 'Documented. On Estonian soil. Russia admitted this is the work of their special services.' Estonia claimed Kohver was arrested while probing a smuggling operation between Russia and Estonia. Tallin Interior Minister Hanno Pevkur said he was involved in contacts with Russia over the case and initially these were 'constructive'. 'I would like to reassure all citizens of Estonia that the Estonian border is safe and living in Estonia is safe. The matter is about an incident that occurred in dealing with a smuggling count, and this is how it should be perceived. 'A smuggling case. An individual incident. And we are working to resolve it,' he said.","Eston Kohver, 44, was abducted from within EU by Russian spooks .

"A 100 million-year-old plant has been ‘caught in the act’ after being encased in amber during pollination. The hardened tree sap preserved a cluster of 18 tiny flowers from the Cretaceous Period with one of them in the process of making some new seeds for the next generation. The scene is thought to be the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction ever found in a flowering plant. A 100-million-year old piece of amber has been discovered which reveals the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. The perfectly-preserved scene, in a plant now extinct, is part of a portrait created in the mid-Cretaceous when flowering plants were changing the face of the Earth forever . Named Micropetasos burmensis, the plant is made of bunches of very tiny flowers around a millimetre wide. The discovery was made from amber mines in the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar, previously known as Burma. It is a newly discovered species, and so different from anything researchers have seen before that it doesn't seem to have any modern-day relatives. According to researchers, the scene appears identical to the reproduction process that ‘angiosperms,’ or flowering plants still use today. The pollen tubes penetrating the stigma on this ancient flower are the only known fossil of this type, showing the process of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant . The Cretaceous started 125 million years ago and ended with the extinction of the dinosaurs. Prior to that, it was a warm period with no ice caps at the poles. Much of what we now know as dry land was underwater. The now extinct plant dates from the . mid-Cretaceous when flowering plants were changing the face of the Earth, adding beauty, biodiversity and food. The newly-described genus and species of flower was named Micropetasos burmensis. The plant is made of bunches of very tiny flowers around a millimetre wide. Much of the plant life during this period was composed of . conifers, ferns, mosses, and cycads but new lineages of mammals and . birds were beginning to appear, along with the flowering plants. The now extinct plant dates from the mid-Cretaceous when flowering plants were changing the face of the Earth forever, adding beauty, biodiversity and food. Much of the plant life was composed of conifers, ferns, mosses, and cycads but new lineages of mammals and birds were beginning to appear, along with the flowering plants. The flower cluster is one of the most complete ever found in amber and appeared at a time when many of the flowering plants were still quite small. Scientists were able to capture a microscopic image of pollen tubes growing out of two grains of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma, the receptive part of the female reproductive system. This sets the stage for fertilisation of the egg and would begin the process of seed formation - had the reproductive act been completed. ‘In Cretaceous flowers we've never before seen a fossil that shows the pollen tube actually entering the stigma,’ said Professor George Poinar at Oregon State University. The discovery was made from amber mines in the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar, previously known as Burma . ‘This is the beauty of amber fossils. They are preserved so rapidly after entering the resin that structures such as pollen grains and tubes can be detected with a microscope.’ Professor Poinar added that the pollen appeared to be sticky suggesting it was carried by a pollinating insect adding further insights into the biodiversity and biology of life in this distant era. ‘The evolution of flowering plants caused an enormous change in the biodiversity of life on Earth, especially in the tropics and subtropics,’ he said. ‘New associations between these small flowering plants and various types of insects and other animal life resulted in the successful distribution and evolution of these plants through most of the world today. ‘It's interesting that the mechanisms for reproduction that are still with us today had already been established some 100 million years ago.’","Tree sap preserved a cluster of 18 tiny flowers from the Cretaceous Period .

"Tracey Pascall was ordered to pay Wendy and Andrew Petford £10 after conning them out of £4,500 by pretending to have terminal cancer . A mother-of-three lied about dying from cancer to avoid paying back a loan of £4,500 after friends parted with their daughter's wedding fund to help her. Tracey Pascall conned Wendy and Andrew Petford, telling the couple she had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. But the 47-year-old was ordered to pay back just £10 - all the money she has to her name - when she was sentenced to two years in prison at Stafford Crown Court. The couple said the amount was an 'insult' leaving them feeling like they have been 'slapped in the face'. Mrs Petford, 47, from Telford, in Shropshire, said: 'Ten pounds is a massive insult. I feel like I have been slapped in the face. 'To hear that she only has to pay £10 back is like she’s taking the mick out of us even more - it is so insulting.' Mrs Petford was a close friend of Pascall, after the pair met at teacher training college in the late 90s. They were reunited when Pascall got back in touch via Facebook in February 2011. After meeting up she asked to borrow money from Mrs Pascall, claiming she was waiting for funds to clear on her account. To back up her claims Pascall forged letters, claiming she had £54,000 in a Post Office account. Mrs Petford had no reservations about lending her friend the money. She and her husband had saved £4,500 for their daughter's wedding but agreed to lend it to Pascall. But the mother-of-three, who faked a . persistent cough, later told the couple she was dying of lung cancer and . could not pay back the loan. Mr . and Mrs Petford asked Pascall for the money weekly, but their attempts . were met with lies about their friend's worsening condition and forged . letters from the bank. Pascall with Wendy Petford had known each other for years. After Pascall got back in touch, she asked Mrs Petford to borrow the money . The . Petford’s eventually realised Pascall was lying after her letters were . exposed as fakes when the couple visited the solicitor with her. Mr Petford went to meet Pascall to collect a cheque from the solicitors. Mrs . Petford said: 'Andrew said he would go with her, not to try and catch . her out, just because he thought it would be easier. I didn’t realise . until afterwards but she looked panicked. 'He got there and was told there was no cheque, and when he showed them the letter they said it wasn’t one of theirs. 'They had to call the police. Andrew . came home and told me. That’s when the realisation hit home. If that . letter’s forged, are the others? 'The next day the police called us and us and asked us to go down. We took all the letters.' But a hearing under the Proceeds of . Crime Act this month revealed Pascall had just £10 to her name and so . would only have to repay that amount to the couple. Pascall forged a letter from her solicitors to show the Petfords 'proof' that she had £54,000 in a Post Office account . Another forged letter from Barclays claimed to show her bank account had been frozen while the bank's fraud team investigated unusual payments . Judge Robin Onions said: 'Unfortunately you can’t get blood out of however undeserving a stone.' Mrs Petford added: 'She said I’d get the money back and I never doubted her for a second. 'To say she had cancer, that’s lower than low. 'When . we were younger we told each other everything and I used to see her . every day. We were part of a big group, but we spent a lot of time . together. 'She got back in . touch and we went for a drink. Tracey ordered a bottle of champagne. That was her all over - she was always glamorous and I never saw her in . the same clothes twice. 'The whole situation broke me apart. I was off work with depression and had to leave my job. She never even said sorry. 'And the fact that she will only have to pay us £10 back, is the final insult. We are gutted.' Speaking . after Pascall was sentenced in September, Mrs Petford, said the couple . had focused on their daughter's wedding as a way of getting through . their ordeal. Andrew, left, and Wendy Petford had to focus on the wedding of their . daughter Michaela, pictured with baby Olivia, to husband James to take . their mind off the stress caused by Pascall's fraud . 'The wedding was supposed to have been . in 2013, but when Michaela sets her mind on something she always wants . it done straight away,' she said.

"Ancestry: MEP Nigel Farage has ancestors that lived in the area now known as Belgium . Outspoken UKIP leader Nigel Farage caused uproar when he told EU President Herman Van Rompuy he had the ‘charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk’. In 2010 he accused the Belgian of having ‘a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states’, adding: ‘Perhaps that’s because you come from Belgium, which is pretty much a non-country.’ Ordered by EU officials to say sorry, MEP Farage said: ‘The only people I am going to apologise to are bank clerks.’ He was fined £2,400, but has carried on mocking Belgians and the man he called ‘Rumpy Pumpy’. So it came as a shock to the Brussels-baiting MEP last night to learn his roots are far closer to those of his favourite Belgian punchbag than he could have imagined. Farage is directly descended from Georgius Ferauge,  who lived in the Ardennes, a region that straddles France and Belgium. Monsieur Ferauge, Farage’s great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was born in Fumay, just on the French side of the border with modern-day Belgium, in 1681. For centuries, the town was fought over by warring European princes. Ferauge emigrated to Swallowfield in Berkshire  in the early 1700s during the reign of Louis XIV, France’s ‘Sun King’. Over the years, Ferauge was anglicised to Ferridge and then to Farage. Farage, 48, who has a German wife, said last night he had no idea of his ancestral ties with the Ardennes. Outspoken: Nigel Farage caused uproar when he told EU President  Herman Van Rompuy (pictured) he had the 'charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk' ‘I still think Belgium is a non-country and prefer British democracy to being ruled by a Belgian President of the EU,’ he said. ‘It is not about who you feel you are – it is about what system of government you should live under. I accept the Ardennes geography but not the nationality. Belgium didn’t even exist in the days of Georgius Ferauge. It was the Spanish Netherlands, wasn’t it?’","Nigel Farage caused uproar when he told EU President Herman Van Rompuy he had no charisma and looked like a bank clerk .

"20th century beauty secrets: To enhance their appearance, women in 1907 were advised to cry and wear pearls . Today women have a plethora of cosmetics at their fingers tips to help their eyes appear wider and brighter. But a delve into the Daily Mail archives has revealed that more than 100 years ago, those who wanted to enhance their appearance had to reply on more basic methods. A column called 'Little Secrets of Beauty' published in the newspaper in March 1907 advises women to have a good old cry if they want to look good - as long as it's kept short. The article states: 'Crying will make the eyes brighter provided it is not indulged in for too long. A brisk little cry clears out the tear ducts and makes the eyes clearer, but much of it will take away the brilliancy again.' In another surprising tip, they warn: 'The woman facing a bright light while she sews or reads will soon have her eyes of no colour at all.' The column has other advice for women dependent on their hair and eye colour. For women with brown eyes, it's recommended they wear 'brown round her neck and under her chin' to enhance the colour. It adds: 'The brown-eyed woman should dress her hair rather fluffily. She must not wear it plain, and should bring it down well upon her forehead.' Women with blonde hair and brown eyes are in luck as the article states they will look 'charming no matter how she arranges her hair, provided of course that is is well coiffe. It is as well for her to mass her hair high above her forehead so that it will make an aureole for her face.' But the writer laments: 'It is the woman with dull or fishy eyes who is at a loss how to proceed because her eyes lack colour.' Scrubbing up well: Pale-eyed girls were advised to 'treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower' and bath their eye lashes with a little boracic acid in water . For such women, they offer the following advice: 'Do not make ""play"" with your eyes. It is the pale-eyed girl who loves to cast her eyes upwards looking at nothing at all. It is the girl with the pale blue eyes who rolls them and strikes attitudes. 'But be it remembered that while the black-eyed girl may attempt such ""play"" the pale-eyed one never should do so.' They recommend that the 'pale-eyed girl should treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower in the form of a little almond oil and vaseline mixed half and half. In the morning, the eyebrows should be brushed with a little soft bay toothbrush.' Meanwhile, they also advise bathing eye lashes with warm water with a hint of boracic acid dissolved in it. Last resort: Pale eyed girls could always wear a hat but shouldn't make 'play' with their eyes in order to look more attractive . This eye wash is often only used in the modern day to treat the symptoms of conjunctivitis but back in 1907, it was said to keep eye lashes 'well and strong'. If all else fails for the 'pale-eyed girl' then the 20th century beauty columnist recommends she 'wears a hat that tips forward over her face so that the brim may shade her eyes'. When it comes to accessorising, in 1907 diamonds were not a girls' best friend. Instead, pearls were more in fashion according to the beauty column as they are 'softer and vastly more welcoming than diamonds'. Under a sub heading 'crimes against beauty' the writer warns about the causes of premature ageing, some of which remain in vogue today. For example, they state that 'the woman who looks intently at things will soon develop a wrinkle between the eyes' and sleeping with the face in the pillow can lead to 'waking up with a thousand wrinkles'. Times may have changed but beauty writers today still advise against squinting as it can cause lines around the eyes and recommend a silk or satin pillow to prevent wrinkles.","Column called 'Little Secrets of Beauty' published in Daily Mail March 1907 .

"A real-life Walter Mitty who launched a worldwide endurance race on his reputation as a former Royal Marine has resigned from his job as UK director of the company - after it emerged he was never in the military. Richard Lee, 31, boasted of serving with the Royal Marines mountain troop as he built the Spartan Race series into a multi-million international business. In one interview he said: 'The Death . Race was very tough but if you have done a couple of years of training . similar to the Marines, you will be surprised by what you can actually . do.' Scroll down for video . Richard Lee (pictured), 31, boasted of serving with the Royal Marines mountain troop as he built the Spartan Race series into a multi-million international business . It has now emerged the former £26,000-a -year King's School Ely pupil never wore the green beret and lied about his time in the mountain troop. He is pictured above with his fiancee Selica Sevigny . The race is an open country run punctuated with a range of punishing, surprise obstacles - from mud crawls and ice-pit plunges to cargo-net climbs and fire-log leaps - and is described by its organisers as 'an event of pure, primitive craziness'. But now it has emerged the former £26,000-a -year King’s School Ely pupil never wore the green beret and lied about his time in the mountain troop. Mr Lee has admitted that he enrolled in the Officer Training Corps but never qualified after he dropped out through injury. His deceit was exposed by the The Walter Mitty Hunters Club HQ, an organisation run by former servicemen who investigate people who falsely claim they served in the Armed Forces. The Spartan Race blog describes its events thus: . 'We are an international obstacle racing series with three levels of courses: 3 mile Sprint, 8 mile Super and 10-12 mile Beast. 'You will run, jump and crawl your way over a dozen or more obstacles. 'Courses are uniquely designed to test your mental and emotional fitness and push you past your limits. 'Race as an individual, as a part of a team or BOTH! 'What does it feel like to be a Spartan? Register for one and you'll know at the finish line.' A spokesman said today that Mr Lee’s actions 'insult the hard work and reputation of our Armed Forces'. And the group accused Mr Lee of exaggerating his military career to build the British arm of Spartan Race which had a turnover of £2.5million in 2012. A spokesman said: 'Richard Lee was using the spirit, determination and hard graft needed to be a Royal Marine to seek his product, the Spartan Race, which the ethos of the race is all about. 'People like Lee insult the hard work and reputation of our Armed Forces. They use lies to gain advantage from the inspecting and by doing so give a misleading impression. 'The Americans have a law against it. It’s called stolen valour and we would like to see such a law in the UK.' A former Royal Marine of 25 years, from East Devon, said: 'Royal Marines officer training is universally recognised as being the most arduous military training in the world. 'Royal Marines are of an extremely high calibre and a lot of people who start the training don’t make the grade, so anyone going round masquerading as a Royal Marine when they’re not, are undermining the Corps’ values.' Mr Lee made claims in the media about his military career - with many publications referring to him as 'former Royal Marine Commando'. Speaking to race website muddyrace.co.uk in November 2013, Mr Lee said: 'When I was at university, I was in the University Training Corps and that put me through university. 'After this, I went into the mountain troops in the Royal Marines for about three years but I broke my leg which meant I left.' Lee only completed a brief stint in officer training in 2007 at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstone, Devon. (Recruits training there, above) Speaking to a national newspaper about an American endurance event in July 2009, Mr Lee was described as an 'ex-Royal Marine'. But it has now emerged that he only completed a brief stint in officer training in 2007 at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstone, Devon. Mr Lee, who is engaged to Canadian Selica Sevigny, who heads up Spartan Race in Quebec and Ontario, has now stepped down from his role as UK director. CEO Joe De Sena today said: 'Richard and I spoke at length regarding the inaccuracies surrounding his status as a Royal Marine, and ultimately, Richard and I concluded the only honourable thing for him to do would be to resign his position.' A statement from Spartan Race on its official Facebook added that the organisation does not condone 'stolen valour' however long somebody trained for. It read: 'Spartan Race does not condone stolen valour in any form. 'Whether someone trained with the military for one week or four years, they cannot be characterised as something they are not. 'We wish to apologise again to all those around the world who worked so hard to earn proud distinction serving their countries.' The British arm of Spartan Race had a turnover of £2.5m in 2012. (Above, one of the race obstacle courses) Red-faced Mr Lee offered his 'deepest apologies' to all those that have served for their country. In a statement on his Spartan Race blog he said: 'I was wrong, I am sorry, and I want to apologise for the fact I allowed it to be publicised that I had passed out from CTCRM as a Royal Marines Commando Officer. 'From 2001 to 2004, I was in the Officer Training Corps, which sparked my interest in joining the Royal Marines. 'In 2006, I went through selection to become a Young Officer in the Royal Marines, and after being selected, I commenced training in 2007. 'During the 18-month course, in 2008, I broke my kneecap. After surgery and rehab, I was told to take what is known as a ""Back Batch"" where you re-enter training with the following year’s batch during the same period of training. 'In the interim, as my desired career path was to become a mountain leader, I was permitted to attend relevant courses. In a statement on his Spartan Race blog Lee said: 'I was wrong, I am sorry, and I want to apologise for the fact I allowed it to be publicised that I had passed out from CTCRM as a Royal Marines Commando Officer.' Above, Royal Marines parade through Taunton, Somerset . 'I was due to complete my training in 2009, but when I returned to CTCRM, the Medical Officer determined that the damage that I sustained to my knee had not healed sufficiently, and I would not be allowed to Back Batch a second time. 'This was a huge blow, as even from a young age, I was inspired by family members who were in the Royal Marines. 'I have the upmost respect for members of the military, and even during my own time training, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment.'

"Playing shoot 'em up games 'trains' gamers to use real guns - and specifically to aim for 'instant kills' by shooting people in the head. Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik admitted to using Call of Duty as a training aid before the Utoya massacre - and the new discovery raises fears that other groups such as Al Qaeda could use the games in the same way. Players used a pistol-shaped controller in a shoot 'em up, then a real gun on a mannequin - the gamers had 99% more hits in the head than non-gamers. Call of Duty: Players used a pistol-shaped controller in a shoot 'em up, then a real gun on a mannequin - the gamers had 99% more hits in the head than non-gamers . Anders Breivik admitted to using Call of Duty as a 'training aid' before his massacre - now a scientific study has shown that shoot em ups DO hone real-world shooting skills . ¿The more frequently one plays violent shooting games, the more accurately one fires a realistic gun and aims for the head, although we can't tell from this study which factor is the cause,¿ Bushman said . Players who had 'trained' using games also had 33% more shots that hit other parts of the body. The study found that participants who reported . habitual playing of violent shooting games also were more accurate than others . when shooting at the mannequin, and made more head shots. It's not surprising that video games can improve shooting . accuracy -- the military, police departments and others already use video games . for training purposes, said Brad Bushman, co-author of the study and a . professor of communication and psychology at Ohio State University. But this is the first study to show that average players . using violent shooting games with realistic human targets can improve firing . aim and accuracy. ‘For good and bad, video game players are learning lessons . that can be applied in the real world,’ Bushman said. ‘The more frequently one plays violent shooting games, the . more accurately one fires a realistic gun and aims for the head, although we . can't tell from this study which factor is the cause,’ Bushman said. Bushman said these results should give parents and . policymakers pause. ‘We shouldn't be too quick to dismiss violent video games as . just harmless fun in a fantasy world – they can have real-world effects,’ he . said. Brutal: Breivik said he spent up to 16 hours per day playing the violent Call of Duty video game in preparation for the attacks . Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik described how he became a deadly marksman by honing his gun . skills by playing the violent Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare computer . game. The mass killer . even bought a special gun sight used on the game - and attached it to . the hunting rifle he used for his deadly rampage on a Norwegian island. The Call Of Duty series, such as the Black Ops game, have often been cited as violent games . The researchers say that policymakers should examine their attitude to shoot 'em up games - and whether they really are 'harmless fun' The study involved 151 college students who first completed . questionnaires measuring their aggression levels and their attitude toward . guns, and asked about their firearms training, their favorite video games, and . how often they played them. They then spent 20 minutes playing one of three different . video games: a violent shooting game with realistic human targets that rewarded . head shots (Resident Evil 4); a nonviolent shooting game with bull's-eye . targets (the target practice game in Wii Play); or a nonviolent, non-shooting . game (Super Mario Galaxy). For the two shooting games, the participants either played . with a standard controller including a joystick, or used a pistol-shaped . controller. Immediately after playing the video game, all participants . shot 16 ‘bullets’ at a 6-foot tall, male-shaped mannequin covered in Velcro at . the end of a narrow hallway, 20 feet (6.1 meters) away. The gun – a black airsoft training pistol -- had the same . weight, texture and firing recoil of a real 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The ‘bullets’ were .43 caliber rubber training rounds covered in soft Velcro. All . participants were instructed in the use of the pistol and wore safety goggles. Participants who played the shooting game using a . pistol-shaped controller completed the most head shots at the mannequin (an . average of about 7). They were also the only group who completed more head . shots than they did shots to other parts of the mannequin. ‘We didn't tell them where to aim – we just told them to try . to hit the mannequin,’ Bushman said. ‘But the violent shooting game they played rewarded head . shots, and so they shot at the mannequin like they were playing the game, . aiming for the head.’ Participants who played the nonviolent, non-shooting game . had the fewest head shots, an average of about 2. Those who played the other . games, including those who played the violent shooting game with a standard . controller, fell in between those extremes. Participants who played the violent shooting game with the . pistol-shaped controller also made the most shots to other parts of the mannequin, . averaging slightly more than 6. Those who played the nonviolent, non-shooting game made an . average of about 4 shots to other parts of the mannequin, the least of any . group. All of the differences among the groups regarding total hits . and head shots stayed the same even after taking into account the participants' levels of aggressiveness, attitudes toward guns and firearm experience. When the researchers examined the participants' experience . playing video games, they found that those who habitually played violent . shooting games had more total hits and head shots to the mannequin when . compared to less experienced players. Tragic: Breivik also spent hours on the fantasy game World of Warcraft as he set himself up for the massacre . Some killers have credited video games for helping them . prepare, he said. For example, Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian man who . shot and killed 69 people at a youth camp in Norway last year, wrote in a . manifesto: ‘I see MW2 (Modern Warfare 2) more as a part of my . training-simulation than anything else. You can more or less completely . simulate actual operations.’ Bushman said he's not claiming that these games necessarily . lead people to commit violent crimes. ‘But this study suggests these games can teach people to . shoot more accurately and aim at the head,’ he said.","In a real shooting range, hardcore gamers shoot mannequin in the head .

"When most fathers discover their daughter is getting married, they set to work planning a witty speech. But when John Butcher's little girl tied the knot, he wanted to go one better than that. So the 50-year-old from Allington, Kent, spent 200 hours learning to sing so that he could surprise his daughter, Natalie, by serenading her on her wedding day. John had secret singing lessons for more than six months and practised for 180 hours at home so he could be pitch perfect when he performed in front of 100 people on the big day. Scroll down for video . Not your average speech: John Butcher surprised guests at his daughter's wedding by breaking into song . Well-rehearsed: The production manager had secret lessons to help him learn how to carry a tune . Only John's son Chris, 26, knew of his plans after the production manager hired singing coach Darren Eiffert to help him. The father-of-two then belted out a version of the Elvis classic 'Always On My Mind' to his shocked daughter during her wedding reception at The Orangery at Turkey Mill, Maidstone, in October. Natalie, 26, who married software developer Ian Wright, 29, said her father's song was the icing on the cake of their special day. Special day: Natalie, 26, married software developer Ian Wright, 29, and was delighted by her father's surprise . She said: We had the most amazing day which was finished off perfectly with the surprise of my dad singing after the speech. I was in shock but touched by the choice of song and the amount of effort that had gone into the preparation. Everyone seemed to be as blown away as I was and it is something I will never forget.' John's wife, Mel, 47, was equally as shocked and touched by her husband bursting into song. John said: 'My wife Mel was in tears as she knew nothing about the performance and my daughter told me afterwards that it was the closest she came to crying throughout the whole ceremony.' The father-of-the-bride said he came up with the idea to sing at the reception in April but as he confessed he wasn't previously able to carry a tune, he signed up for lessons to help him impress the wedding guests. Impressed: The happy couple were shocked and touched by John's effort . Elvis is in the building: The performance was filmed and uploaded to YouTube . He said: 'I really can't sing and don't pretend to. I spoke to Darren in April about the idea and started lessons in May. 'I've had a lesson every other week and have practised the song for an hour a day since then.' His hard work paid off and people clapped and cheered John's performance - which was filmed in full by one of the guests and then uploaded to YouTube. John said: 'Everyone thought the DJ had mucked up, but then I got up and started singing. People were laughing and crying and standing up waving their hands. 'People came up afterwards and said they didn't know I could sing.' Housewife Mel, said she was proud of her husband's efforts to make their daughter's day even more memorable. She said: 'I generally wise up to exactly what he is up to, I can't believe he managed to keep it a secret for so long. 'I was laughing and crying, I had my face in a serviette, it was very emotional and I was very proud of him especially as he's not the kind of person to put himself at the centre of attention.'","John Butcher, 50, had secret singing lessons ahead of daughter's wedding .

"Friends of the British hostage facing brutal murder by Islamic State fanatics last night said the British Government was 'letting an innocent man die' by refusing to pay a ransom for his release. While his wife told the Mail she is defiantly refusing to give up hope that David Haines will be rescued, close friends of the couple said his fate has been sealed by the UK's refusal to negotiate with terrorists. ‎Dragana Prodanovic Haines yesterday revealed she is in contact with a team of experts desperately working to try to save her husband. Scroll down for video . Friends of British hostage David Haines (left) said the British Government was 'letting an innocent man die' by refusing to pay a ransom for his release . She ‎is living under police guard at home in Sisak, Croatia, with her mother and the couple's four-year-old daughter. ‎In order to maximise the chance of Mr Haines surviving, she is refusing to talk in detail about his plight with even her closest family and friends, believing any slip ups by her could affect whether he lives or dies. Despite 'Jihadi John' indicating her husband would be his next victim, Mrs Haines suggested she still has hope he will be saved by a rescue squad. ‎'I don't want to have any contact with anyone who is not involved in working to get my husband free,' she said. Wedding day: David Haines and his Croatian wife Dragana pictured on their wedding day. She has described how she has been left 'helpless' while experts try and save her husband from execution . 'I cry and I'm helpless. They told me that I can't say anything. I don't want to make his situation worse.' The wife of another former hostage tried to get in touch with Mrs Haines yesterday to offer some comfort and advice but, fearful of consequences, she said she could not speak. Mrs Haines said ‎she 'appreciated' the fact that those around her were understanding that she cannot say too much at the moment. One of her closest friends also told the Mail Mrs Haines is refusing to give up hope that she will be reunited with her husband. But she criticised the British government for‎ not paying off Islamic State terrorists to save him, as other European countries have done. Mrs Haines said that her daughter Athea (left), now four, hasn't seen her father for a year and a half, who is being held hostage every day asks about him every day . Mr Haines, an aid worker for 16 years, was captured near Syria’s Turkish border in March 2013 with Italian Federico Motka . 'We know Dragana can't tell us what is happening. She is so strong. She will not give up hope that David will be rescued,' the friend said. '‎She is in shock. She can't understand what is happening to him. I watched the video and I can't believe the UK does nothing to save him from those animals. 'If he was from Italy or France they would pay and he would be back with his beautiful wife and their child. 'The UK and America won't pay ransoms so they are letting an innocent man die‎. Dragana is so in love, I don't know how she copes. Her daughter will grow up with no father. 'It is the worst thing. I watched the video and he is so thin. I can't think about what they are doing to him. What Dragana is going through is the worst thing in the world. He should never have gone there. He is always trying to do good things for work but it is too risky. It is not worth the risk. 'I know people say paying terrorists is bad. But that is politics. This is a real man. How can the UK see this and they do nothing?' As Mrs Haines waited with their daughter Athea, four, at home in Croatia, she admitted to being afraid anything she said could influence his fate. She has described him as a ‘fantastic man and father’ who is ‘everything to us’. Her determined hope is in contrast to the caution of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Brutal: Mr Haines is said to have been beaten so badly that his kidnappers were forced to arrange medical treatment while he was being held captive . Mr Haines, 44, was popular in Croatia, where he had worked for aid organisations since 1999 . ‘We have to be clear about the nature of the organisation we are dealing with,’ he said yesterday. ‘They are utterly brutal, they are ideologically driven, almost pathological.’ He said ministers had the ‘utmost sympathy’ for Mr Haines and his family. Mrs Haines said: ‘My daughter keeps asking about him every day. She hasn’t seen her father for a year and a half. She has gone through so much. She sees me crying all the time.’ The 45-year-old businesswoman, who met her husband helping refugees during the Balkans war and married him in 2010, said: 'They told me that I can’t say anything. I don’t want to make his situation worse.’ Mr Haines, 44, appeared in a chilling video of the murder of US journalist Steven Sotloff. The killer, a Briton known as ‘Jihadi John’, warned he would be next. He was popular in Croatia, where he had worked since 1999, and his former landlady was distraught yesterday as she clutched a picture of him. Nena Skoric, 67, who he affectionately called ‘mama’, said: ‘He is like a son of my own. I am praying for him. It didn’t matter to him whether people were Croats, Serbs or Muslims, as long as they needed help.’ Mr Haines, an aid worker for 16 years, was captured near Syria’s Turkish border in March 2013 with Italian Federico Motka. He is said to have been beaten so badly that his kidnappers were forced to arrange medical treatment. Some hostages were subjected to waterboarding, electric shocks and mock executions. At one point they were held underground in a city under constant bombardment. Mr Haines may have been singled out because of his nationality, although hostages freed after ransoms were paid have said that in recent months he has been treated more ‘humanely’. Mr Haines gave one freed hostage a message for his family, saying he was being treated well. Mr Motka, who was freed in May after a £4.75million ransom is said to have been paid, shared his cell and has spoken of being tortured. It appeared that Mr Haines was targeted by kidnappers who sold him on to IS for profit. Former Foreign Secretary William Hague has expressed his fear that the world is playing into the hands of Islamic State extremists. 'I do think it is a pity sometimes that the things they put on the internet to serve their own propaganda and glorify what they are doing are so readily disseminated by the press', he told The Times. 'But I am not suggesting that we can control that in any way.' He said it is 'heartbreaking' for a politician to have to deal with a hostage crisis. 'These are some of the most difficult decisions, life and death ones, I had to help make.' But he insisted that paying ransoms is a 'terrible mistake...That then gives millions of dollars to terrorists to kidnap other people'.","Close friends of David Haines have criticised the UK's refusal to negotiate .

While at work, the history of art graduate is simply known as Eugenie York and she's shunned the leafy, affluent Central Park area to live in the thriving Meatpacking District of Manhattan. The princess was reported to be anxious about her move as she knew few people in the city. Her departure has also meant she has to have a long distance relationship with boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank, who works for the London nightclub Mahiki. 'We spend a lot of time on Skype,' he said recently, according to YOU magazine. The royal certainly didn't seem homesick as she was out today as she was pictured laughing and chatting with her female companion. But perhaps her scarf was a comforting reminder of her family back home.

"As a television news anchor Kirsty Young always had to have her finger on the pulse and keep up-to-date with the latest stories. But now the former Channel 5 News presenter is enjoying a slower pace of life after moving to the country with her family. Kirsty, who turns 46 this month, told Marks and Spencer she's happier now she has a better work-life balance as she shares her fashion and interiors tips on the Style and Living section of their website. Scroll down for video . More relaxed: Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young said she doesn't always have to have an 'ear on' to what's happening in the world now she's not a news anchor . Finger on the pulse: Kirsty covered major breaking stories in her role as news anchor for Channel 5, left, but now has a better work-life balance . The mother-of-two, who is married to Nick Jones, founder of the Soho House members' clubs, said: 'There was a point in my life where I felt that things were out of balance, and I felt as though my working life - and my husband's working life - dominated everything. And actually for me that's not the way I wanted to live my life. 'So I wanted to move out to the countryside and luckily my husband said he would give it a go... and he now enjoys it as much as I do.' The couple bought a home surrounded by fields in Oxfordshire which is far removed from their former environment in bustling West London. Rural retreat: The mother-of-two has moved to Oxfordshire with her family . 'We have chickens – all named after newsreaders, respectfully – our dogs are always running around in the garden, they are very much part of the family,' Kirsty said. The stylish Scot continues to work but now enjoys fronting Crimewatch on television and Desert Island Discs on the radio for the BBC after leaving her role as news anchor for Channel 5 in 2007.

But she said she's glad she no longer needs to be constantly switched on to world events. 'I used to be in the news cycle as a newsreader, so you always had to have an ""ear on"", but that's not my life now, so I fully take advantage of that. 'And since we moved out of London and into the countryside a few years ago, I feel that I have more of an oasis of space around my family life that I didn't have before,' she said. Kirsty said she particular enjoys being able to take time off at Christmas - something that wasn't always possible when she was a newsreader. She told M&S that she is looking forward to spending the festive season with her husband and their daughters Freya, 14 and Iona, eight. She said: 'My perfect Christmas is at home and is totally off-duty. My husband takes 10 days off work, so we're there with our daughters and friends and family - no cars, no planes and no trains.'","Former Channel 5 News anchor has moved to Oxfordshire .

"Laura Carmichael shot to fame playing Lady Edith in ITV's much-loved drama Downton Abbey. To reflect the time period from 1912 onwards, Laura and her co-stars have worn minimal make-up as cosmetics were not embraced by aristocratic ladies at the time. So the actress may look unrecognisble to Downton fans in her latest part starring in a Lisa Eldridge make-up tutorial. Scroll down for video . The lady is a vamp: Laura's familiar look as Lady Edith in Downton Abbey, left, and transformed after her smokey eye make-over . The professional make-up artist reveals how she ensures Laura looks glamorous for red carpet events with her smokey eye make-over. The result is a dramatic, smouldering look which contrasts to her familiar, natural appearance as Lady Edith. Lisa explains step-by-step how viewers can replicate Laura's smokey eyes. She begins by smudging black gel eyeliner (L'Oreal's Super Liner Gel in black) onto Laura's eyelids, followed by eye shadow from Charlotte Tilbury's The Rock Chick palette. Expert tutorial: Lisa begins by applying eye liner to the actress' eyelids and then smudges it in with a brush . Get the look: The professional make-up artist used Charlotte Tilsbury's Rock Chick palette . She then puts eye liner and eye shadow along Laura's lower eyelid. Next she applies mascara using Urban Decay's Cannonball Waterproof product. To give the lashes extra volume, she then adds a few individual false eyelashes to the outside edge. As she has created a bold look on Laura's eyes, Lisa keeps the rest of her make-up simple with a Revlon highlighter on the cheeks for a 'fresh faced look' and a pale pink lip colour from Tom Ford called First Time. During the makeover, Laura reveals how she's always had a passion for acting but her big break didn't come for years after she finished drama school. Finishing touch: The look was completed with a subtle pink lipstick by Tom Ford . Big break: Laura worked as a waitress and receptionist after graduating from drama school before winning her part in Downton Abbey . She explained: 'First I did dance classes and wanted to be ballerina. That led to musicals and then at 16, I did plays at the posh boys' schools down the road and had a great time. Then I knew I wanted to do it so went to drama school at 18. 'After I left drama school it was hairy time for me as an actor as I was having to do lots of different jobs - I was working as a waitress and as a receptionist at doctors' surgery. Then I auditioned for Downton and the call came out of the blue that I had got the part and it really changed things.' At the end of the makeover, Laura says she loves the new look Lisa has given her. She adds that she is looking forward to wearing more modern make-up and comfortable clothes in her next film role which is set in the present day.

"A mother of two is turning horses into real life My Little Ponies after inventing temporary tattoos for the animals made from glitter. Sally Rees, 40, from Coventry, has taken inspiration from the ancient tradition of quarter-marking whereby hair on a horse's rear quarter is brushed into patterns for show. The former beauty spa director has dubbed her venture 'quarter-marketing' as brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses. Scroll down for video . Decoration: The temporary tattoos invented by Sally Rees can be applied to the horse's hair . Vet approved: The glue doesn't touch the horse's skin so it's safe to use and the tattoos can be washed off with soap, water and a brush . To apply the tattoos, two types of glue are available - one which lasts a day and one which lasts up to two weeks. The glue doesn't touch the horse's skin so vets say it's safe to use and the tattoos can be washed off with soap, water and a brush. Sally came up with the idea for the sparkly marks while looking for a way to generate extra income after becoming a mother-of-two. She explains: 'I used to be the managing director of a beauty spa until 2009 when I gave it up to look after my two young children. 'Quarter-marketing': Brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses. Temporary: The pictures last a day or two weeks depending on the glue used . 'I had been dabbling with different ideas to bring a bit more money in when I came across someone doing glitter tattoos at a craft fair. 'My daughter fell in love with them straight away and so I started doing them at children's parties. 'About a year ago my in-laws from Ireland were visiting and knowing they have horses I just said: ""I don't know why no-one has made these for horses"". 'It was a lightbulb moment for me - the more I thought about it the more it seemed like a good idea. 'I started to look into it and realised there was a real gap in the market.' No need to be good at drawing: The tattoos are applied using a stencil to ensure a perfect picture . Familiar look: The marks on the side of the horses are reminiscent of My Little Pony toys, right . A year after her eureka moment Sally has turned her idea into a fully-fledged business. Sally's equestrian glitter tattoo kits cost between £19.99 and £59.99 and can be bought from her website glamouratiuk.com. The tattoos are applied using a stencil to ensure a perfect picture. Sally said the products have been popular with horse owners and have been approved by vets. She said: 'We spent a lot of time developing an adhesive that was long lasting but easily washed off. We then tried out our new products on some horses at our local riding school and they were an instant hit. 'Glitter and sparkle is huge in the world of equestrian accessories and now the horses can have some too,' inventor Sally said . Popular: Sally has turned her idea into a successful business . 'We then had a stall at a big horse show and we had queues of people waiting to get glitter tattoos on their horses. 'It's like a 21st century version of quarter-marking, but because of the possibilities for brands to put their logos on horses I call it quarter-marketing. 'The glitter kits are completely safe to use - they have been given the thumbs up by vets. 'Glitter and sparkle is huge in the world of equestrian accessories and now the horses can have some too.

"Monsoon floods have now hit more than a million people in Kashmir and left 450 dead as authorities plan drastic measures to stop more deaths. Days of heavy rain have lashed the mountains and valleys on the border of India and Pakistan, flooding whole towns and causing landslides which have devastated people's homes. Today the waters began to recede as more than 300,000 people were left stranded in Indian Kashmir alone - but authorities warned there could be more flooding to come. Deluge: Tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed by flash floods and landslides which have hit more than a million people on the border of India and Pakistan . An unusual swim: Children with cattle in floodwaters from the Tawi river in Jammu, the winter capital of Indian Kashmir, India. The area is a key region for farming . Bleak: Kashmiri men wade through floodwaters as they try to reach safer places in Srinagar, Indian Kashmir. Phone lines, power and water supplies have been cut off . Hospitals are struggling to cope with the scale of the disaster, which has affected more than a million people. The flash floods have washed away tens of thousands of people and crops for many thousands more in the key farming region in just one week. Phone lines, power and water supplies in the northern Indian region have been down for days and authorities say food and water supplies are running low. Earlier today officials said the death toll in India and Pakistan combined had reached 461 as Pakistani troops used helicopters and boats to evacuate thousands of marooned people, while India's military dropped food for hundreds of thousands. On Pakistan's side of the border, the floodwaters were threatening huge tracts of farmland in Punjab province and millions of people in the cities of Muzaffargarh and Multan, the heart of Pakistan's cotton industry. Pakistan's army planted explosives today which would be used to blow up three strategic dykes to divert waters away from the cities. Spread: Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, has been submerged by the floodwaters. Reports have emerged of angry victims attacking emergency workers . Response: Troops have been deployed and government officials gave up a day's salary for the relief effort in solidarity, but that has not stemmed the tide of anger . Devastated: Srinagar in Indian Kashmir is famous for its mountain views, but around 200 people there have now been killed by flash floods after monsoon rain . Scale: An aerial view shows the spread of the floodwaters. In the most serious floods to hit the region in 2010, an area the size of England was left underwater . Help: Kashmiri Muslims treading carefully today across the remains of a wall on the banks of the River Jehlum in Srinagar. More than 450 people have died in total . Natural beauty: The Dal Lake in Srinagar. Over the border in Pakistan, authorities were considering blowing up strategic dykes to divert the ceaseless flow of water . A senior Multan government official told AFP the dykes were likely to be blown in the evening, but the blast could be put off if the waters recede. Similar drastic measures were taken yesterday to protect the city of Jhang, further upstream, where 10,000 people were evacuated overnight. All schools in the Multan area are expected to be closed for the next two days after troops  rescued 22,000 people stranded by floodwaters so far in Pakistan. Of the 461 dead, 261 were believed to have been in Pakistan while 200 were in India - but the toll is expected to rise. Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said seven more people had died as Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged compensation worth £6,000 to families who had lost their loved ones. In India, reports have emerged of victims attacking emergency workers in their anger at the slow pace of the rescue effort. Rescue: Officials said the slow reaction to the disaster happened partly because the speed of the rising waters took them by surprise and flooded government buildings . Desperate: Phone lines to Srinagar (pictured) have been cut off for days and supplies of food and water are running out as hundreds of thousands remain stranded . Rescue: Thousands of people have also been affected in Pakistan's Punjab province (pictured), where more than 250 people have died and cities are threatened . Refugees: Despite displacing thousands of people including this family seeking sanctuary at a Srinagar mosque, the floods are not as devastating as those in 2010 . Higher ground: Many Muslims living in Indian Kashmir have taken to the foothills of the Himalayas to shelter from the flash floods, leaving their damaged homes behind . Police have been gathering floating bodies including those of a news photographer in Srinagar, a city famous for its lake and mountain views. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a 'massive effort to ensure basic hygiene and sanitation in the water-logged areas of Srinagar' amid fears of a disease outbreak. Indian Kashmir's chief minister Omar Abdullah said  waters had risen so quickly that the entire government machinery was  swamped - literally. 'My secretariat was under water, my police headquarters was under water, my control room was under water, my fire services was under water, two of my key hospitals were under water and there was no cell phone communication', he told a news channel. One doctor at the Ahmed hospital in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, added: 'There is no electricity. The hospital is entirely working on two gensets (portable generators), on alternate basis. Holiday cut short: Tourists were rescued from flooded areas of Srinagar and put on an Indian air force helicopter today as thousands more remained stranded . Over the border: In Punjab province, Pakistan, the flooding was just as severe. Each nation has pledged to help the other recover despite wars over Kashmir in the past . Sombre: A soldier uses a sniffer dog to search for survivors in the mud and debris of a  house which was buried by a landslide in Panchari village, Indian Kashmir . Vast: Panchari village (pictured) was one of the worst hit by landslips, which destroyed homes and left rescue workers picking through enormous pieces of rubble . 'Nothing is coming from anywhere... we had to hijack water, there is no water here. We cut bedsheets in two and sterilised them for use in surgery.' The Indian army has deployed about 30,000 troops for rescue . and relief operations and soldiers distributed 224,000 litres of . water and food to survivors. In a gesture of solidarity, staff . at the  prime minister's office gave up one day's salary . for flood relief. Many people praised the army on social media for its efforts . but others vented their anger at delays in getting help to . survivors. Basharat Peer, a journalist and author of a book on the . Kashmir conflict, who is working as a volunteer in Srinagar, . said the response to the disaster had been woeful. 'It is clear case of mismanagement,' he said. 'Why are the basic . supplies still not made available? Saved: Pakistani Army soldiers evacuate flood victims through helicopters in Jhang, Punjab province. The waters could spread downriver to affect 5 million people . Marooned: This house with farm animals in Jhang, Pakistan, was  just high up enough to avoid the floods, whose waters began to recede in some regions today . Contrast: The red-brown structures of another complex in Jhang were stark against the lush green landscape and the the muddy waters surrounding them . Farming haven: The plains near the foothills of the Himalayas including Pakistan's Punjab province, pictured, are normally rich in soil but crops have washed away . Dirty: Officials fear the sudden deluge will spread water-borne diseases such as diaorrhea if urgent sanitation measures are not put in place soon . Refugees: Thousands of Indians and tourists gathered yesterday at Srinagar Airport in Indian Kashmir as they waited to be rescued from the sudden floods . Relief: One flood victim clutched a bunch of bananas as volunteers distributes aid in Srinagar. The floods have washed away crops and roads, leaving  supplies scarce . Ruined: Homes in Srinagar have been sliced apart by the waters and the landslides which followed, killing hundreds of people. The survivors will face a bill of millions . British MPs warned today that entering the Kashmir dispute would 'smack of neo-imperialism' and appear arrogant. The warning was issued by Tory Greg Barker who said intervention between India and Pakistan would be 'slightly offensive'. Nick Clegg told the Times of India last month that Britain does not want to be a mediator, but other Lib Dems have disagreed. Lib Dem MP David Ward told the Commons: 'There is - and we cannot escape it - a British legacy here and I think we have a responsibility.' 'There are thousands of people searching for their families . They have no idea whether they are alive or dead. We have no . clean drinking water, no medicines and food to feed the . children.' An ancient region in the heart of the Himalayas, Kashmir as it is commonly known is divided between India and Pakistan - but the region is claimed by both countries. Two of the three wars the nations have fought since their independence from Britain in 1947 have been over control of the mountainous zone. However, relations  improved slightly in recent years and each side has offered to help the other recover from the floods. The floods have been happening annually in Pakistan and were at their worst in recent memory in 2010, when 1,800 people died and 20 million were affected. In those floods 62,000 square miles of land were swamped - an area bigger than England. The deluge  cost the Pakistan £6billion, a fifteenth of its total annual output. Analysts said this year's floods do not appear to be on the same scale as in 2010 but could match those in 2012, which killed almost 600 people and affected almost 5 million. Any means necessary: Residents of the summer capital Srinagar rode to relative safety on the back of a tractor, one of the few vehicles which could brave the flood . Patient: The only way to get around Srinagar safely is now by boat, but few are available and residents have had to wait in the upper floors of their homes . Rubble: Survivors in Indian Kashmir's winter capital Jammu were dwarfed by their damaged houses today as authorities vowed to speed up the rescue effort . Nothing left: The disaster has flattened thousands of homes and forced their residents to flee the area. As the waters recede, the repair bill will mount higher .

"Manchester United legend Eric Cantona has added his voice to the growing wave of criticism of FIFA's vote to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. A day after world football's governing body was thrown into turmoil when its own chief investigator Michael Garcia slammed a report exonerating Qatar and Russia of any wrongdoing in their World Cup bids as a misinterpretation of his findings, Cantona gave his own view on the controversy. The former United forward, who is carving out a successful second career as an actor, called the decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar 'a mistake'. Ex-Manchester United forward Eric Cantona has spoken out on the decision to award Qatar the World Cup . Blatter has served four terms as FIFA president and is set to stand for a fifth next year . Football's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the World Cup vote . The following accusations were all made by The Sunday Times in June: . Qatar, he said was just 'a very wealthy country which has bought itself a World Cup'. 'When you award the World Cup to a country, it is to develop football there,' Cantona explained. 'When they gave the  World Cup to the United States, there was great potential there, with the Mexican and South American immigration, to develop football. 'But what is there that can be done in Qatar? How many people live in Qatar?' The tiny gas-rich emirate has a population of around 2.2 million, the vast majority of them migrant workers, drawn from India, Nepal and other Asian and Arabic countries. 'When you are in a very small country, where you have to pay people to fill the stadiums, that isn't the point of it, as far as I'm concerned. 'It is a very wealthy country which has bought itself a World Cup.' On Thursday, FIFA published a report clearing Qatar and Russia of corruption and ruling out a re-vote for the tournaments despite widespread allegations of wrongdoing. Garcia, a former New York federal prosecutor, spent 18 months investigating the controversial World Cup race that ended with the selection of Russia for 2018 and Qatar for 2022. His 350-page report, handed to FIFA on September 5, summed up an investigation that involved interviewing more than 75 witnesses and compiling a dossier with more than 200,000 pages and audio interviews. But he dismissed the published version as 'incomplete and erroneous' and promised to appeal to FIFA's appeals body. Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary-general of the Qatar 2022 organising committee, said: 'We were confident that any impartial investigation was to show that our record was clean and contains no irregularities.'

"Under the eyes of hundreds of police and private security guards the Israeli premier league's only Arab club beat mainly-Jewish rivals Beitar Jerusalem 1-0 on Sunday. Despite on-pitch brawling between Beitar and Bnei Sakhnin players in the seventh minute of extra time, police reported only minor incidents off the field. Police originally banned the game from being held in the Arab town of Sakhnin due to safety concerns after a series of deadly attacks in east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bnei Sakhnin 1-0 Beitar Jerusalem injury time brawling . Arab-Israeli supporters of Bnei Sakhnin light flares and display Palestinian flags during the game . A Bnei Sakhnin supporter lights a flare during his side's 1-0 victory over Jewish rivals Beitar Jerusalem . There is a history of racist violence by some Beitar supporters who have clashed with Sakhnin fans in the past. But on Friday they rescinded the ban, saying that security had been 'significantly' improved at Bnei's Doha Stadium, which was built with millions of dollars in donations from Qatar. On Sunday night police deployed 700 officers in and around the stadium, including paramilitary border police and riot squads, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said in a statement. Another 200 private security guards patrolled the ground, where 5,000 spectators attended, he said. The game was initially called off over safety fears but went ahead after security was improved . Palestine flags can still be seen in the terraces despite 50 being confiscated on entry . Police had limited the number of tickets available to Beitar supporters and an AFP photographer at the scene said about 600 were admitted. He said that while Beitar supporters waved Israeli flags, about a dozen Sakhnin fans waved the Palestinian flag and others lit flares. No violence was reported, but police said they confiscated 50 Palestinian flags Sakhnin supporters tried to take into the ground 'contrary to terms of the licence' for the event. Violence was avoided with the presence of 500 policemen and 200 extra security staff . A Bnei Sakhnin supporter celebrates the goal that gives the Israeli Premier League's only Arab club victory . A Beitar fan was forced to remove a shirt supporting the banned anti-Arab Kach movement. Last month, Sakhnin were fined 15,000 shekels (£2,500) for paying tribute in an on-pitch ceremony to Azmi Bishara, an Arab-Israeli former MP who fled Israel in 2007 after being accused of collaborating with Lebanon's Shiite militant group Hezbollah. The Israel Football Association said the club had violated regulations and was guilty of 'unbecoming conduct' by getting involved in a political dispute.","Bnei Sakhnin defeated Beitar Jerusalem 1-0 in the Israeli Premier League .

"Whistleblowing website WikiLeaks today published more than 1.7million U.S. records covering diplomatic or intelligence reports on every country in the world. The data released today includes more than 1.7million U.S. diplomatic records from 1973 to 1976 - covering a traffic of cables, intelligence reports and congressional correspondence. WikiLeaks described the Public Library of US Diplomacy (PlusD) as the world's largest searchable collection of U.S. confidential, or formerly confidential, diplomatic communications. Collection: The data released today includes more than 1.7million US diplomatic records from 1973 to 1976 . Much of the work was carried out by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, 41, during his time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been staying since last summer. The Australian sought refuge at the embassy last June over fears that he would be sent to the U.S. if he was extradited to Sweden to face sexual offence claims by two women - charges he denies. The Ecuadorian Government has granted Mr Assange political asylum and has repeatedly offered Swedish prosecutors the chance to interview him at the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London. Mr Assange said the information showed the ‘vast range and scope’ of U.S. diplomatic and intelligence activity around the world. On the inside: Much of the work was carried out by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been staying since last summer . Records database: WikiLeaks described the Public Library of US Diplomacy (PlusD) as the world's largest searchable collection of U.S. confidential, or formerly confidential, diplomatic communications . Henry Kissinger was U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser during the period covered by the collection, and many of the reports were written by him or sent to him. Thousands of the documents are marked NODIS (no distribution) or Eyes Only, as well as cables originally classed as secret or confidential. Mr Assange said WikiLeaks had undertaken a detailed analysis of the communications, adding that the information eclipsed Cablegate, a set of more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks from November 2010 and over the following year. These documents were released after being anonymously leaked, detailing U.S. foreign policy over the last decade. Across Africa: Henry Kissinger was U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser during the period covered by the collection, and many of the reports were written by him or sent to him . The collection published today has not been leaked, but Mr Assange said WikiLeaks had been working for the past year to analyse and assess a vast amount of data held at the U.S. national archives before releasing it in a searchable form. Mr Assange said WikiLeaks had developed sophisticated technical systems to deal with ‘complex and voluminous’ data. Top secret documents were not available, while some others were lost or irreversibly corrupted for periods including December 1975 and March and June 1976, said Mr Assange. He added that his mother, who lives in Australia, had told him he was being kept at the embassy ‘with nothing to do but work on WikiLeaks material’.","Wikileaks releases database of U.S. diplomatic records from 1973 to 1976 .

"A group of residents furious at Christmas shoppers clogging up their street are issuing fake parking tickets to ward them off. They have even placed mock  permits in a number of car windscreens along Victoria Park, Cambridge, and put up signs warning drivers of the 'parking restrictions'. Motorists who park in the street illegally will be slapped with a 'ticket' which politely tells them it is against the law to park there. Families living in the access only road in West Chesterton became so fed up with the parking war that they were given yellow 'parking permits' to hand to visitors. A group of residents furious at Christmas shoppers clogging up their street are issuing fake parking tickets and putting up signs to ward them off . Motorists who park illegally in Victoria Park, Cambridge, will be slapped with a 'ticket' which politely tells them it is against the law to park there . But these were not sanctioned by any official parking authority. Both the police and the county council have confirmed that no such laws are in place and said they would not be enforcing any parking law in the area. But Simon Watkins, chairman of the local resident's association, has said 'something radical has to be done'. He said: 'We did make the permits up ourselves and we do put polite notices on cars illegally parked. They have even placed mock permits in a number of car windscreens along the only-access road . 'This is merely an attempt to discourage people from parking here. We did have a sign up by the green but the council said it was illegal and it was taken down. 'We do have other signs up. I think the wider issue is the lack of parking in Cambridge. Something radical has to be done. 'The council and the police are both right but it is illegal to park in an 'access only' area. It used to be enforced by the traffic wardens before the council took over and the wardens encouraged us to set up our own scheme. It worked for a few years then stopped. The police enforced it for a while and then got fed up. One resident, who did not wish to be named, has branded the parking 'permits' a 'joke' and was unhappy that it was pulling the wool over the public's eyes. He said: 'I came across the permit when I moved into the house – it had been left behind by the previous owner. As soon as I saw it I thought it couldn't be serious – it seemed like a bit of a joke. 'It's the attempt to mislead the general public that it's some form of 'official' document which bothers me as it's quite clearly a fabrication. 'What's the point of having the permits when they're completely meaningless anyway? It seems to me that it's a minority of busybodies trying to impose their will unlawfully on the rest of the community. Simon Watkins, chairman of the local resident's association, has said 'something radical has to be done' 'What also annoys me is the attempt to make it look pseudo-official, which means when a relative comes to stay they feel as though they can't even park near my home.'

"A Mister and Miss Gypsy competition has been launched in Spain - and claims it will be a 'helping hand' to young gypsies because it judges them on intelligence as well as just looks. The pageant, which is currently auditioning in the Spanish capital Madrid, includes elements of beauty contests but also judges contests on their education, interests and ambitions. According to organisers, the competition - particularly the female portion - is a response to the reduced opportunities which gypsies in Spain received, and hopes to persuade girls that there is more to life than marrying young and having babies. Scroll down for video . Contestants: Pictured are some of the hopefuls in the Miss and Mister Gypsy 2014 contest being held in Spain . Sign-ups: The young gypsy girls give details including their ambitions and education . Disadvantaged: Figures have showed that Gypsies in Spain are much less likely to find work . Maria . Jimenez of the Northern Flamenco Association is involved in organising the contest, which she hopes will encourages gypsy women to 'be a bit more independent'. She said: 'For a gypsy woman, the aim is always just to get married very young, at 14 or 15, and have children. I want the gypsy woman to study and . become independent so she doesn't depend on her husband to give her €10 so she can eat.' Figures have shown that a majority of . gypsies leave school by 16, and unemployment among Spain's 725,000 . gypsies is as high as 36 per cent - 10 per cent higher than the national . average. Photoshoot: Contestants flocked to the initial auditions in Madrid . Chances: One organiser of the contest said she wanted to encourage gypsy girls to be more independent . Measuring up: It is common for gypsy girls to marry aged 14 or 15, and spend life as housewives . Perched on high heels in tight, bright . dresses, crowds of girls line up hoping to become Spain's first 'Miss . Gypsy' in a new pageant aimed at empowering a neglected minority. The five judges of the competition will be non-gypsies, and are supposed to judge contestants on their minds and personality as much as their looks. Contestants will hope to make it to the final in October, before going on to win the crown. One hopeful, 17-year-old Libertad Barrull, said: 'I want to be a model. I love it.' Her mother Rosario said: 'It gives them a helping hand to become something in life, like our generation couldn't be'. Competitor: One entrant to the male competition introduces himself . Ready to go: A man is measured in an initial stage of the competition . Another attendee added: 'People have started to realize now that you can't get married so soon because you're tying yourself down to being a housewife when you're still a child.' The unemployment rate for the 725,000-strong minority is painfully high, however: 36 percent in 2011, according to the rights group. That was way above Spain's already high national rate of 26 percent. Jesus Heredia, a contestant for the male element of the competition, said: 'I'm in it to show that we gypsies are people, just like the rest.'","Competition is being organised Northern Flamenco Association in Madrid .

"British hate preacher Abu Hamza told his US terror trial Wednesday how he once jointly managed a London strip club in his quest to live a Western, movie-style life. Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, 56, better known in Britain as Abu Hamza al-Masri, has pleaded not guilty to 11 kidnapping and terror counts that pre-date the 9/11 attacks. Blind in one eye and with both hands blown off in an explosion in Afghanistan, he faces life in prison in a maximum security US prison if convicted by jury at the New York court. Scroll down for video . Terror: Islamic radical Mustafa Kamel Mustafa faces 11 terror-related charges for crimes that pre-date 9/11 . Taking the stand for the first time in his trial, wearing tracksuit bottoms, a blue T-shirt and orange socks, the Egyptian-born former civil engineer spoke softly. At one stage he elicited laughter from jury members by doling out marital advice, saying it would be 'silly' for a man to tell his wife he didn't love her. 'This is a silly kind of truth,' he said, explaining the man could easily change his mind multiple times. 'Maybe he loves her later' or 'maybe she is the best person for him,' he said in an almost scholarly voice. Strippers: Despite his current claim that he is a devout Muslim, Mustafa once worked at a strip club 'to enjoy myself' He also said his engineering studies included the World Trade Center, destroyed in the 9/11 attacks he has praised, and the effect of ""explosions"" and demolition -- which he said became 'useful' later in life. He is charged over the 1998 kidnapping in Yemen of 16 Westerners, conspiracy to set up a jihad training camp in Oregon in 1999, of providing material support to Al-Qaeda, of assisting the Taliban and of sending recruits for terror training in Afghanistan. The three-times married father of nine said he moved to England in 1979 aged 21 because he 'looked forward to a Western life, American-style.' Training: Federal authorities say Mustafa planned to setup a terrorist training camp in Oregon prior to his 2004 arrest . He testified that he wanted to 'pursue my dreams as we see in the films' after growing up in Egypt's Mediterranean city of Alexandria, which he described as 'very close to Italy' and used to foreigners. In London, he took odd jobs, working as a hotel receptionist, a bouncer in the Soho party district and said he was 'co-manager of a strip club.' He wanted to 'make money and enjoy myself' and only later saw his jobs as on the 'wrong side of morality.' Once he saved up enough money, he said he got a degree in civil engineering. As an engineer he worked as a contractor at Britain's prestigious military academy Sandhurst, which he quickly pointed out was where Prince Harry had trained. Testify: Mustafa denied in court on Wednesday that he had anything to do with a 1998 kidnapping in Yemen . He blamed his initial interest in Islam in 1982 on his English wife, who was 'pushing too hard' to convert as a means for the couple to spend more time together. They bought an English edition of the Koran and stopped smoking. During the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, he took time off from the clubs and found that he 'enjoyed' the break, he said. Despite saying lies were justified in Islam in certain cases, he denied he would lie on the stand. 'I'm no stranger to prison. If my freedom comes at the expense of my dignity, I don't want it,' he said. He was indicted in the US in 2004 and was arrested in Britain, where he served eight years in prison before losing his fight against extradition in 2012.","Mustafa Kamel Mustafa faces 11 terror-related charges for alleged crimes that pre-date 9/11 .

"Most New Yorkers don't even know it exists, but a million forgotten souls are buried in mass graves dug by convicts on a tiny, forbidden island east of the Bronx. Since 1869, still born babies, the homeless, the poor and the unclaimed have been stacked one upon the other, three coffins deep, on Hart Island. Corpses are interred in great, anonymous trenches. There are no tombstones. Small white posts in the ground mark each 150 adult bodies. A thousand children and infants are buried together per grave. It is one of the largest cemeteries in the United States. And the least visited. Forbidden: Access to Hart Island and its decaying abandoned prison workhouse is severely restricted. Each white plastic pipe near the building marks an infant mass gravesite, one plastic pipe per 1,000 babies . Mass grave: A sailboat passes behind an abandoned building on Hart Island, east of the Bronx . The men doing the digging are convicts from Rikers Island, petty offenders tasked with carrying bodies to their final resting place. Nearly 1,500 fresh corpses arrive each year, says visual artist Melinda Hunt, who heads the Hart Island Project, which campaigns to make the cemetery visible and accessible. The authorities say nearly a million people have been buried here since 1869. It is forbidden to film and photograph the uninhabited, windswept island. Visits must be authorized by the Department of Corrections, which runs the island. First used as a cemetery in the Civil War, Hart Island has variously served as a training camp, a prison for captured Confederates, a workhouse, a mental asylum and even a Cold War missile base. The only jetty is closed to the public, hemmed in by railings, barbed wire and spikes. Notice boards warn people to keep out. Locked out: Hart Island is run by the department of corrections and access is nearly impossible . Waiting game: Laurie Grant (pictured), doctor who gave birth to a still-born daughter in 1993, has been waiting for years to gain access to the restricted Hart Island . For years, records of who's been buried where have been patchy and negotiating access has proved challenging. Some have been lost, others burned. Families sometimes cannot even find out if their loved ones were buried by the city. 'You have a right to know where a person is. It's very important not to disappear people. It's not an acceptable thing to do in any culture,'Hunt said. The Department of Corrections says it doesn't have the infrastructure to welcome visitors on an island where the buildings are dilapidated and abandoned. Under pressure, however, the authorities have allowed a few visits since 2007, albeit within a gazebo far from the graves. City limits: Just within the boundaries of the Bronx, Hart Island is tucked away from the view of most people . 'You don't see anything,' said Elaine Joseph, a 59-year-old nurse whose baby daughter died at five days old in 1978. 'They check your ID, and ask you to hand over your cell phone, any electronic equipment and they put it in an envelope and lock it and then you get to the island, they ask for your ID again. They treat you as a visitor of an inmate.' In November, a small group of women who threatened to bring a complaint were given permission to visit specific grave sites. Joseph became the first to go on March 14. Once there, she broke down in tears. 'I . can't say I found closure. When you lose a child, there really is never . closure. There is a piece of you that is gone,' she said. 'I did find solace in that there was water surrounding it and there was a lovely view.' She was even allowed to take a photograph. Long history: Inmates of now-derelict Hart Island Prison bury bodies of people poisoned by wood alcohol . Trench: This photo from 1990 shows a mass burial trench for adults. Pine boxes used as coffins can be seen . Laurie Grant, a 61-year-old doctor who gave birth to a still-born daughter in 1993, hopes to be the next. But on March 28, she waited in vain in the rain on the jetty. Due to unwillingness or miscommunication, those who were supposed to ferry her across the water left before she even arrived. Over the years, Hunt said she has lost track of all the families she has tried to help, though estimates the number is at least 500. Most were Americans, but there have been others from France, the Netherlands and Poland, and one Irish woman looking for a grandfather. Not forgotten: Melinda Hunt of the Hart Island Project holds a large transparency of a photograph by Joel Sternfeld of infant coffins on Hart Island. In the background are pictures of the 'baby trench' Never forget: These displays by Melinda Hunt of the Hart Island Project and photographer Joel Sternfeld show a grave marker of the first child on the island to die of AIDS . Close up: This picture shows Vicki Pavina, whose baby was buried on Hart Island many years ago. The image is part of a collaborative work by Hart Island Project's Melinda Hunt and photographer Joel Sternfeld . The Hart Island Project has so far managed to list more than 60,000 burials in the database. A bill has been introduced to the city council seeking to transfer the island to the parks administration, but has not been taken up yet. Joseph dreams of being able to return as often as she wants to what she calls 'a public cemetery that the public is not allowed to visit'. She also dreams of flowers and a bench to honor her baby. 'If I can put a marker on a bench, I'll be happy,' she said. Heartbreaking: Blankets with names, cause of death and date of death, created by Melinda Hunt.

"Unequal: Former polygamist Marion Munn is unhappy with the new ruling that decriminalizes the practice in Utah . A former sister wife has spoken out against the polygamous lifestyle, following a new federal ruling that decriminalizes the practice in Utah. Marion Munn moved to Utah from Britain after converting to a fundamentalist Mormon faith, and says she was part of a plural marriage for 18 years . 'The only way that I can explain it is like living with adultery on a daily basis, and having the woman come home,' Munn said. 'On top of that you have to smile and pretend that everything's okay because that's part of the culture too.' The practice of polygamy has long been illegal in the United States, and especially persecuted in the state of Utah ever since the Mormon church decided to get rid of Joseph Smith's principal of plural marriage to become more mainstream. But fundamentalist Mormons have continued the practice, with an estimated 40,000 Utah residents currently living in plural marriages. Most of these families aren't polygamists in law, getting around the anti-polygamy statutes by legally marrying just one of their wives. In the past, the powerful Mormon church has worked through the state to shut down even these technically legal unions, forcibly breaking up the families using a law against cohabitation. In a big win for the polygamists, a federal judge struck down that cohabitation rule in December, saying it violated the constitutional right to freedom of religion. The ruling comes as bad news for Munn and other anti-polygamists who believe the marriages are inherently unequal, and often aren't entered into freely. 'Certainly . within Mormon-based polygamy, it's not really much of a choice, because . Mormon scriptures teach a woman that if she doesn't consent to living . in polygamy, God's going to destroy her,' Munn explained. 'So for me going into it, I didn't personally want to live it, but I felt compelled to as a matter of faith.' But polygamist families like the Dargers, who live just outside Salt Lake City, are excited they can now practice their lifestyle without the threat of arrest. Out in the open: Joe Darger (second right) sits with his three wives (from left to right) Alina, Valerie and Vicki Darger at their home in Salt Lake City, Utah. The family has been public about their lifestyle since 2011 . The Dargers have lived openly as a polygamist family ever since publishing a book about their lifestyle in 2011. For a long time after that, family patriarch Joe Darger says he worried he might be arrested under the anti-polygamy laws in the state. 'The fear when I went public four years ago, that fear was very real,' he said. Their brood: There are 25 children in the Darger family, and 17 of the kids still live at home . 'This . is a third degree felony... this is serious prison time. My . grandfathers were imprisoned, so that was a real impact that we felt.' Joe has three wives, with a total of 25 children - 17 of which still live at home. He married cousins Alina and Vicki in 1990, and ten years later married Vicki's twin sister Valerie when her first plural marriage broke down. She brought five children with her from that relationship. Twins: Two of Dargers' wives are twin sisters. He initially married cousins Alina and Vicki in 1990, and married Vicki's twin sister Valerie ten years later . Alina Darger, who herself works as a lawyer on cases involving polygamy, says the ruling was a relief. 'That's . been one of the great things about the ruling -- the decriminalization, . and the judge saying basically that the state needs to stay out of . people’s bedrooms,' she said. Bad name: Fundamentalist Mormon leader Warren Jeffs represents the dark side of polygamy. He is currently serving a life sentence for sexual assault, including crimes against children . 'As . long as it's adults freely choosing what they want, then I don't feel . it would be my place to tell somebody else you can't choose to love who . you love.' While the practice may work for the . Dargers, a 2011 University of British Columbia study found polygamy . causes greater levels of crime, violence, poverty and gender inequality . in communities that practice it. The . United Nations has called for a ban, while polygamy has been at the . center of notorious cases such as that of Warren Jeffs, the . fundamentalist Mormon leader sentenced to life in prison for child . sexual assault in 2011. The . main branch of the Mormon faith -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter . Day Saints -- renounced the practice of polygamy in the 1890s under . pressure from the US government. While . some offshoots of the religion continue the practice, exact numbers are . hard to come by. Some estimates say that around 40,000 Utah residents . live in plural marriages. Utah's Attorney General Sean Reyes has yet to say whether he will challenge the federal court ruling on polygamy. The . state is also currently fighting to enforce a ban on gay marriage, . which was ruled illegal in December by another federal judge.","In December, a federal judge ruled Utah's law against cohabitation was a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of religion .
Marion Munn was a polygamist sister wife for 18 years and says it's not a choice for many women in the fundamentalist sects .
But the decision comes as a big win for the estimated 40,000 Utah polygamists who can now live their lifestyle more openly ."

"A former North Korean prison worker today recalled the moment a group of schoolchildren were torn to pieces by a pack of guard dogs then buried alive by his colleagues. Ahn Myong-Chol, who worked as a guard for eight years until he fled the country in 1994, recalls the day he saw three dogs get away from their handler and attack children coming back from the camp school. 'There were three dogs and they killed five children,' the 45-year-old told AFP through a translator. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Life in the totalitarian North Korean camps has been laid bare by a former guard (not pictured) Hell on Earth: Former prison guards have spoken of horrifying scenes at camps like this one . 'They killed three of the children . right away. The two other children were barely breathing and the guards . buried them alive,' he said, speaking on the sidelines of a Geneva . conference for human rights activists. The . next day, instead of putting down the murderous dogs, the guards pet . them and fed them special food 'as some kind of award,' he added with . disgust. 'People in . the camps are not treated as human beings... they are like flies that . can be crushed,' said Ahn, his sad eyes framed by steel-rimmed glasses. The . former guard is one of many defectors who provided harrowing testimony . to a UN-mandated enquiry that last week issued a searing, 400-page . indictment of gross human rights abuses in North Korea. Horrendous: This drawing by another prison guard who defected comes with the description: 'In this position, called ""pigeon torture"" prisoners are reportedly beaten on the chest until the vomit blood' Menacing: North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un should face international justice for a catalogue of appalling crimes against humanity, UN investigators have. Above, a woman soldier at a camp in North Korea . After fleeing the country two decades . ago, Ahn worked for years at a bank in South Korea but gradually got . involved in work denouncing the expansive prison camp system in the . isolated nation. Three years ago, he quit his bank job to dedicate all his time to his non-governmental organisation, Free NK Gulag. 'It's my life's mission to spread awareness about what is happening in the camps,' he said. There are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in North Korea, a nation of 24 million people. Ahn, who today is married with two daughters, knows all too well the brutal mentality of the camp guards. Purged: Jang Song-Thaek, in the blue boiler suit, is escorted from the court to be executed for treachery. It was initially reported that he was killed by a pack of dogs, but a North Korea diplomat he was shot by firing squad . When he, as the son of a high-ranking . official, was ushered onto the prestigious path of becoming a guard in . 1987, he says he was heavily brainwashed to see all prisoners as 'evil'. At his first posting at camp 14, north of Pyongyang, he was encouraged to practice his Tae Kwon Do skills on prisoners. And he recalls how guards were urged to shoot any prisoner who might try to escape. 'We . were allowed to kill them, and if we brought back their body, they . would award us by letting us go study at college,' he said. Some guards would send prisoners outside the camp and kill them as escapees to gain access to a college education, he added. Ahn said he had beaten many prisoners but said that, to his knowledge, he had never killed any of them. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre) applauds during the 8th Conference of Ideological Officials of the Workers' Party of Korea in this undated photo released by North Korea's Central News Agency today . Ruthless: Kim Jong-Un had his uncle killed because he was guilty of 'tremendous crimes against the country', according to the North Korean ambassador to the UK . Although he witnessed numerous executions, starving children, and the effects of extreme torture, it was not until he was promoted to be a driver, transporting soldiers back and forth between camps, that he began to question the system. During his travels he sometimes struck up conversations with prisoners and was astonished to find that 'more than 90 percent' of them said they had no idea why they were in the camp. Ahn had stumbled across North Korea's system of throwing generations of the same family into prison camps under guilt-by-association rules. He got a taste of that rule himself. On leave in 1994, he returned home to find that his father had committed suicide after making some drunken, negative remarks about the country's leadership. Reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un had his uncle executed by throwing him to a pack of dogs spread like wild fire across the world last month. However, it later emerged the claims had apparently originated as a satirical post on Chinese microblogging website which was picked up by a Hong Kong-based newspaper. North Korea's ambassador to the UK, Hyun Hak-Bong, also denied the allegations, saying they had been put about by the hermit state's enemies. Hyun confirmed the dictator's former political confidant and close relative Jang Song Thaek had been executed for 'tremendous crimes against the country'. He said the 67-year-old had been killed by firing squad, a fate that media outlets said was normally reserved for 'traitors'. Ahn's mother, sister and brother were detained and likely sent into camps, although he is not sure what became of them. Though Ahn returned to work, he feared he too would be dragged off. So he drove his truck to the shores of the Du Man River and swam across to China, having to dump the heavy weapons he was carrying to avoid drowning. Once he got involved in the NGO work in South Korea, he was uneasy about meeting former prisoners who had also managed to defect, like Chol Hwan Kang. Kang was sent to Camp 15 -- where Ahn once served -- with his whole family when he was nine and spent 10 years there to repent for the suspected disloyalties of his grandfather. Ahn remembered him from his time as a guard there. But Kang, like most survivors, understood he had not chosen his job and had accepted his plea for forgiveness. 'He met me with a gentle handshake,' Ahn said. Last week's UN report was vital to spreading awareness about the reality of the camps, Ahn said, comparing what is happening there to the Soviet-era Gulags. 'The difference is that in North Korea we are still talking in the present tense. These horrors are still happening,' he said.","Ahn Myong-Chol said three dogs attacked five children from camp school .

The usual reaction from friends and colleagues when one . appears, bronzed after a foreign holiday, is to comment on 'how well' you look. Scroll down for video . Michelle in July after her cancer was removed (l) and recently wearing no makeup on her new nose (r) Consequently, most young women can't see the harm in . allowing a few rays of the gentle British summer sunshine to play over . their faces, and give them what they think is a 'healthy' glow. But - as I have discovered - there is no such thing as a healthy tan. And I have the scar on my face to prove it. Earlier . this year, I was treated for basal cell carcinoma. It left me with a . gaping hole on the side of my nose, which had to be reconstructed with . plastic surgery, and there is a possibility the cancer may return. Basal . cell carcinoma is the cancer actor Hugh Jackman was diagnosed with. Left untreated, it would have eaten away and damaged surrounding tissue. So, forgive me if I sound fanatical. My factor 50 sunscreen is just . about the most important thing in my bag. I carry it everywhere and . apply it religiously at least twice a day - more if I am sitting . directly in the sun. I have no doubt that, if I can get cancer, any . woman can. I'm 34 and I didn't go abroad until I was 18. Growing up in a . working-class family in Hull, foreign holidays were beyond us. The only . sunshine I encountered as a child was in England, and I never wore . sunscreen. Michelle pictured before the incident . My brush with cancer did not start with a mole - as most . people imagine - but with an innocent-looking pimple. I first noticed it . on the right side of my nose in spring last year. I haven't had spots . since I was a teenager. Irritated, I blamed my moisturiser and . swapped to another brand. When it still didn't clear up, I decided my . diet was to blame and tried to improve it. The pimple disappeared for a few weeks but then it came back. In desperation I invested in an expensive anti-spot cream. But . still it came and went. Sometimes it was raised, sometimes it was just a . red mark. I know now that this changeability is a classic sign of . cancer. The surgeon had to take skin from the cheek to fill in the hole where the cancer and surrounding tissue was . I'd associated skin cancer purely with moles - I have a few . and keep a close eye on them. And, as I later discovered, the medics I . consulted were just as ignorant. When I finally went to an NHS . walk-in centre near my home in South London, five months after I'd first . noticed the spot, my major concern was my appearance. I was embarrassed . about being so vain.After all, who gets medical help for a spot on . her nose? The nurse who examined me didn't take it seriously either. Telling me not to worry, she prescribed antibiotics to clear up the . 'infection'. So when the spot still didn't clear, it never occurred . to me to return. I didn't realise that the cancer was burrowing its way . into my skin. The longer it was left, the more damage it was doing. I . was lulled into such a false sense of security, the cancer would . probably still be growing today if I hadn't bumped into a dermatologist . at a Christmas party last December. Basal Cell Carcinomas are the most common form of skin cancer in the UK . BASAL cell carcinomas are the most common form of skin cancer in the UK, with more than 200,000 cases diagnosed every year. They normally look like an open sore, or a red irritated patch, and occur in the top layer of the skin (left). Justine . Hextall, a consultant dermatologist at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS . Trust, says: 'I see patients who have never been abroad - the UK sun is . strong enough to cause  basal cell carcinoma.' Basal cell carcinoma . rarely spreads, unlike malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin . cancer that kills 2,000 Britons each year. However, it can cause . disfigurement. Looking at me, he couldn't hide his concern. 'You really ought to have that spot looked at,' he said. I was dismissive. 'It's driving me nuts but I've been told not to worry about it,' I explained. But . he was so insistent that I booked an appointment with my GP. Just like . at the drop-in centre, she looked at the spot, which by now had a waxy . appearance, and told me not to fret. Even when I explained that the spot . changed appearance regularly, she treated me like a hypochondriac. But . this time I insisted she refer me to my local hospital, Guy's in London. Two weeks later, I went for a skin biopsy. Under local anaesthetic, . a tiny sliver of skin was removed from the spot. The whole procedure . took just ten minutes. As I posed for photos that Christmas with a plaster on my nose, I hoped I had seen the end of the spot and any worry about it. You . can imagine my terror when I received a letter a week after Christmas . telling me that I had cancer. It was the first time anyone had used the . word. I was so shocked, I started crying and shaking. I was booked in to . have the tumour removed two weeks later. Over the phone, a nurse at the . clinic explained the procedure and tried to calm my fears. Basal . cell carcinoma spreads in fewer than 0.5 per cent of cases, and . treatment is successful 90 per  cent of the time. The cause?  Sun . exposure. I went on my first sunshine holiday to Benidorm when I was . 18 and since then have been abroad frequently. I never burned badly, but . my goal was always a tan. But it never occurred to me to use suntan . lotion in Britain. Michelle, pictured after surgery, didn't burn badly on holiday but it never occurred to her to use lotion in Britain . I couldn't rest until the cancer was out. The . operation itself was straightforward. Under local anaesthetic, the . surgeon removed the spot and surrounding tissue. The sample was then . analysed.I was really lucky - all the cancer was gone. But when the . nurse took the dressing off, I burst into tears. I had a centimetre-deep . crater on my nose. The surgeon had to take skin from my cheek to fill . in the hole. She promised it would heal and there would barely be a . scar. But, as I left hospital, dosed up on painkillers, I felt like . Elephant Woman. And when the stitches came out two weeks later, all I . could see was a vicious red scar. The first time I went out socially, I . spent ages putting on heavy concealer. That's when it hit me that there . was no miracle cure. I still looked awful. I sat on the floor of . the bathroom and sobbed: 'What have they done to my face?' But it was a . release. I had to count my blessings. If I hadn't insisted on a biopsy, . the cancer would still be growing - eating away at my entire face. As . the months have passed, the scar has healed. I return for check-ups . every 12 weeks and am rigorous about checking for new marks. My attitude . to the sun has changed completely. I slather myself with factor 50 . every morning - reducing to factor 30 in the winter. I've persuaded . my friends to do the same - looking at my face, they didn't take much . convincing. But I am horrified to see young women dashing into the sun . at the first opportunity. I came so close to destroying my looks for ever - and all because I wanted a tan.

"She waited 36 years to visit her daughter's grave. Now Elaine Joseph has finally been able to pay her respects, by becoming one of the first people to visit a small, windswept island where a million souls are buried. Tonight her emotional story will feature in a documentary on Hart Island, the final resting place for New York's still-born babies, the homeless and the unclaimed where 1,500 fresh corpses arrive each year. Access is severely restricted, photos are banned and burials are performed en masse without tombstones by prison inmates. Scroll down for video .

Each white plastic pipe near the building marks an infant mass gravesite, one plastic pipe per 1,000 babies . Mass grave: A sailboat passes behind an abandoned building on Hart Island, east of the Bronx . In November, the 59-year-old nurse became one of eight women to be granted permission to visit after a fierce campaign to stop the dead being omitted from history. Her daughter Tomika was born two months prematurely in 1978 and lived for just five days, weighing a fragile 4lb 2oz. But she could not be there when Tomika suffered heart failure, because a snowstorm cut off her route to the hospital. By the time she got there, her daughter's body was already gone. Ms Joseph told ITV's John Ray, writing in the Daily Mirror: 'They said, ""The body’s already gone. You signed the forms so that the City will bury her but don’t worry because the City buries them with all of the other babies and stillborns."" 'Anyone who’s a parent, knows that you simply can’t let it go – it’s a part of you.' At first, she was told only that her baby was buried in Potter's Field. Later she would discover this was not the name of a real place, but a common term for a pauper's grave. It comes from Biblical times, in which clay fields would be useless for agriculture and used for burying people instead.

The island is run by the Department of Corrections and the men who do the digging are convicts from Rikers Island, petty offenders tasked with carrying bodies to their final resting place. But it lay largely forgotten until artist Melinda Hunt began a campaign to revive interest in its secrets. She began the Hart Island Project, mapping the 131-acre island's burial sites and collection stories from people whose relatives were buried there. By now she has helped around 500 people from as far afield as Poland, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, and listed more than 60,000 burials in the project's database. She told Mr Ray: 'They line them up sort of like UPS unloading boxes... A morgue truck arrives and it’s full of coffins. Especially if it’s baby coffins, where there are 50 or 60 at once.'

First used as a cemetery in the Civil War, Hart Island was used as a training camp, a prison for captured Confederates, a workhouse, a mental asylum and a Cold War missile base. It has just one jetty, which is closed to the public and surrounded by railings, barbed wire and spikes. Prison authorities long banned visits on the basis that the island's buildings were dilapidated, abandoned and potentially dangerous. Under pressure, they finally began allowing visits in 2007. But those attending would only be able to stand in a gazebo far from the graves themselves. Once Elaine Joseph arrived last month, she broke down in tears. 'I . can't say I found closure,' she said. 'When you lose a child, there really is never . closure. There is a piece of you that is gone.' 'I did find solace in that there was water surrounding it and there was a lovely view.' She was even allowed to take a photograph.

"There was a mixture of excitement and terror on Neil Davy’s face as he rolled the tiny olive around in his hand. And who could blame him? For this was no ordinary olive. It was an olive from the first harvest ever grown commercially in Britain. And 42-year-old Neil, a management consultant who grew the olives on a plot of land outside his kitchen window, was about to step into the history books. Inspired: Neil and Louise Davy (pictured with their daughters Kailas, 7, and Teagan, 4) have opened the UK's first olive farm after falling in love with the idea during their honeymoon on the Amalfi Coast in Italy in 2002 . Despite knowing very little about the industry, the couple bought 200 trees from a small farm in northern Italy . Yes, the Romans might possibly have done it — but it’s taken another 2,000 years and a man on a culinary crusade to make it happen in 2014 in a garden in Kent’s Isle of Oxney. It’s an achievement no one imagined possible. Not Neil’s curious neighbours. Not even his long-suffering wife, Louise, and daughters, Kailash, seven and four-year-old Teagan. But last week Neil fulfilled a decade-long dream to develop Britain’s first productive olive grove. It all started during the couple’s honeymoon in Italy. Having met in 1999 while both working in Shanghai — Neil for a market research company and Louise for Virgin Atlantic — they married in London in 2002 and left for a two-week honeymoon on the Amalfi coast.It was as they lay in a grove of olives to shelter from the afternoon sun that Neil had his epiphany. ‘We joked that if we won the Lottery, we would buy an olive grove in Italy,’ recalls Neil. ‘Louise, being the pragmatist of the two of us, thought I was mad.’ They never did win the Lottery, but Neil held onto his dream. Back in London, their careers and life continued in a familiar rhythm. Kailash was born in March 2006 and Teagan in September 2009. Then, in 2010, Neil and Louise decided to move away from the hubbub of the capital, and bought a four-bedroom Georgian farmhouse on Kent’s Isle of Oxney with a four-acre plot of land. Preparation: The couple bought 200 trees from a small farm in northern Italy and planted them in their four-acre back garden on the Isle of Oxney in Kent . The plan was that Neil would commute to work in London, while Louise would run an interiors business from home. Throughout those daily train journeys, Neil would constantly return to his dream. ‘Our land hadn’t been cultivated for 40 years and we were told it was only good for grazing,’ Neil explains. ‘But it seemed such a waste. ‘Then, one summer’s night, we were sitting on our terrace with a glass of wine and I looked out at the land and thought: Why buy an olive grove in Tuscany when we could do the same thing here? ‘The land is south-facing and free-draining, and we are in one of the warmest parts of the country. Olives can tolerate poor soil and exposure to wind. I just knew we had to give it a go. ‘I was on the computer the next day, researching olive varieties. It hadn’t been done before — but that only made it more exciting.’ Neil decided to start with a small-scale trial, choosing 12 trees of six different varieties from local garden centres. ‘I planted them in March 2011. The summer was hot and dry and the trees did brilliantly. I wasn’t expecting any fruit — the key was knowing whether the trees would survive. ‘And they did. Even Louise was surprised.’ It was all the encouragement that Neil needed. Three varieties — Frantoio, Leccino and Maurino — had done particularly well, although it was too early in their life for them to have borne fruit. After that, Neil contacted dozens of growers in Italy to see if they could supply him with trees. In March 2012, he found a traditional family-run nursery in northern Italy that seemed perfect. ‘They had the right trees — three years old, so not too expensive but still capable of giving a good yield.’ Tough: The Davy family's olives have endured frosts, snowfall and heavy rain, but have emerged unscathed . With his heart in his mouth, Neil ordered 200 trees. Each would cost upwards of £70 at a British garden centre — that’s at least £14,000 for the grove. Neil is reluctant to say exactly how much he paid, but admits the venture has cost him just shy of £5,000 so far. After researching how sites are prepared for a Tuscan olive grove, Neil got to work. He commissioned a neighbouring farmer to prepare the site, spraying off the surface vegetation with chemicals. ‘I worried he would think I’d gone nuts,’ he admits. ‘But I guess the idea of an olive grove is so romantic that everyone has got behind it.’ Neil hired more machinery to allow him to mole plough — which means ripping deep into the soil to create channels for the water to drain easily. Then the top soil needed to be prepared for planting with a rotivator. ‘I didn’t have the experience or machinery to do any of this myself,’ admits Neil. ‘I oversaw the work at weekends.’ Louise watched from the kitchen window as her meadow was ripped up. ‘It was a shock,’ she admits. ‘It’s one thing Neil having a pipe dream. Following through is another thing entirely.’ Just four weeks later, in April 2012, a container arrived in the Davys’ drive with 200 olive trees —  and on a decidedly windswept, soggy day, Neil began the nerve-racking job of planting them, marshalling Louise, the girls, his mother, stepfather and a collection of curious neighbours to help. It took them two days to get the plants in. ‘I’d researched planting schemes and opted to plant the trees seven metres apart, which gave us enough room to plant more in the future,’ says Neil. Ideal: Neil (right) contacted dozens of growers in Italy to see if they could supply him with trees. In March 2012, he found a traditional family-run nursery in northern Italy that seemed perfect . Peering out on the vulnerable-looking striplings over the following weeks and months, even Neil had to admit the whole project looked doomed. ‘It just kept raining,’ he recalls. ‘The trees were being drenched every single day. I was worried the roots wouldn’t cope and the plants would die. Yet somehow, thankfully, the trees survived.’ And so 2012 rolled into 2013 — but the weather remained terrible. ‘By the spring of 2013, it looked like an olive graveyard; a sea of brown twigs. I thought I’d failed and they’d all have to be dug up and thrown away. It was heartbreaking.’ ‘I went out every night to check on them. Every so often the trees would try to come to life — but then another cold snap would kill off the new growth.’ But then, as June edged into July and the sun at last began to shine, the sea of brown twigs began to sprout bright green leaves. And one exciting morning, Neil noticed some tiny yellow flowers. ‘I tried not to be too optimistic,’ he admits. But two weeks later there was no mistake. Out of each flower a tiny pinhead was emerging. Britain’s first olive grove was growing. Progress was slow until one magical morning in September, Neil woke to see a mass of olives on his trees. It may have taken him ten years, but Neil had done it. ‘I got Louise and the girls out of bed — it’s a day we’ll never forget.’ The next hurdle was harvesting them. ‘I couldn’t risk a frost getting to them,’ explains Neil. Land: The couple built their olive farm on a four-acre plot in their back garden on the Isle of Oxney in Kent . In the first week of November, Neil decided it was time — and the family proceeded to hand-pick each olive. Louise used her trusty mop bucket; the girls orange buckets left over from collecting Halloween treats. ‘Louise and I concentrated on the top branches and the girls took the lower ones,’ says Neil. ‘We were there all weekend and every day after school. It took a week and produced around 20 kilos.’ Neil was desperate to taste his first home-grown olive — but that was a delight that had to wait until last week. ‘Olives have to be cured in brine over many months to make them palatable,’ he explains. ‘I sent some of my harvest off to a wonderful local chef who promised to work his magic.’ So what do the olives taste like?  I joined Neil at The Swan, Chapel Down, Kent, where chef Paolo Rigolli has been curing the olives in salted water since November. The first surprise is the intense colour. Because of the shorter growing season, Neil’s olives are tiny - barely bigger than a raisin - but they are a brilliant olive green. And they taste, well, truly olivey. Yes, the skin is harder than a normal table olive and there’s less flesh, but the flavour is intense, each olive packing the flavour of four ordinary ones. Neil is thrilled. ‘I didn’t dare hope they would taste good,’ he says. Chef Paolo has already used some in flavoured butters and oils. His next move? ‘More olive trees. The land can support another 100 trees, so enough olives to produce Britain’s first homegrown olive oil. ‘Growing table olives is one thing. But producing a large enough crop to make oil is beyond my dreams.’","Neil Davy and his wife Louise have opened the first olive farm in the UK .

"From Poundland  to Poundstretcher, Poundworld and 99p Stores, they seem to be mushrooming. Poundland - the trailblazer - now has 460 stores in the UK. And where Poundland leads, it seems others follow. Each of the variously named discount stores offers its own unique combination of household goods, supermarket fare, beauty products, homeware, and car accessories. So, do they all sell the same products? And just how do they keep their prices so low? Bags of bargains: Tessa with her shopping from Poundland . The chain was founded in 1990 by Steve Smith and his father, Keith, in Burton-on-Trent. After changing hands numerous times, it's now the biggest bargain basement chain in Europe. A typical shop contains more than 3,000 different products with a wealth of brand names including Heinz, Pepsi, Nivea, Thorntons and Simple. Of its 4.5 million savvy shoppers, one in five is a middle-class professional. Poundland says it keeps its prices low by trading directly with major brands. It either shrinks the size of products or strikes a deal with suppliers to get knock-down prices because of the volume of stock it sells. TAT OR TREASURE? Huge aisles and clear signs make shopping easy, despite the fact that the Poundland I visit in upmarket Winchester really does sell everything from Horrid Henry children's books to Kellogg's Corn Flakes. It's bristling with helpful staff - you could almost be in John Lewis. There are students ogling the hairdye and nail varnishes, pensioners comparing the price of tinned soups and - over in the party section - I'm stunned to see the vicar's wife grabbing armloads of treats for her five-year-old's forthcoming party. A steal: Tessa picked up armloads of vitamins at bargain prices . BEST FOR: Health and beauty. Poundland is Britain's largest seller of batteries - no surprise when you think that an average four-pack of AAAs costs £2.35. Other top sellers include umbrellas (2.5 million were sold last year), and Toblerone (5.5 million bars in 2013). It's branching out into chilled food - you can buy a box of ten eggs or a 160g pack of Danish salami. But it's in the healthcare section that you'll find extraordinary bargains. I picked up armloads of vitamins at a steal. For example, 90 vitamin D tablets cost £5.10 at Boots. I bought 60 here for £1. They are exactly the same strength, with each tablet containing 200 per cent of my RDA (recommended daily amount.). Holland & Barrett charges £6.99 for 60 Evening Primrose Oil capsules - I bought 30 at the same strength (500mg per tablet) for just £1. I was also delighted with the spectacles. You'd be hard pushed to find a better selection of standard prescription glasses in an optician, although you'll pay a lot more. The same size bottle of Simple shampoo would cost £2.33 at Sainsbury's. Other brands available include Timotei, Wella, Pantene and Aussie. Verdict: I'd never been in a Poundland before, but I'll definitely be back!                      4/5 . The family-owned Poundworld was launched in Salford, Greater Manchester, in 2004 after rebranding from 'Everything's a £1'. It now has more than 180 stores in the UK, with plans to open a further 200 in the next five years. You will find cleaning products, toiletries, groceries, toys and party goods, and big names such as Cadbury, Coca-Cola and Johnson's. Canny boss Chris Edwards buys in bulk at discounted rates from household names, and commissions own-brand products from China. Cleaning products: Poundworld stocks incredibly cheap cleaners, but there wasn't much else Tessa wanted to buy there . TAT OR TREASURE? Full to bursting with everything from sparkly hair clips and shower curtains to Shredded Wheat and dog chews, this store was also heaving with customers. There were lots of pensioners with pull-along trolleys full of cat food, and young mums with piercings. I also spotted two Yummy Mummies loading up their Orla Kiely shopping bags with stationery and cleaning products. BEST FOR: Cleaning products. The same one-litre bottle of Cif floor cleaner is £1.50 at Sainsbury's, while the equivalent bottle of Domestos is £1.25 at Tesco. Zoflora disinfectant costs £1.33 at Tesco and Mr Muscle cleaners are £2 at most supermarkets. I counted 14 different shampoo brands including Sunsilk, Timotei, Pantene, L'Oreal and Herbal Essences (£1.94 at Boots) Verdict: My fellow shoppers seemed to disagree, but - cleaning products aside - there wasn't much here I'd want to buy.      3/5 . The UK's second largest chain of bargain basement stores, the first 99p Store was opened by shopkeeper Nadir Lalani in Holloway, North London, in 2001. Still a family-run business, there are now more than 200 stores. The company has a turnover of £269 million and attracts more than 1.5 million customers. You'll find a big range of branded products including Cadbury and Fairy Liquid. But as the Lalanis specialise in snapping up stock from small businesses that have gone bankrupt (20 per cent of their stock is bought this way) or surplus stock bought direct from large manufacturers, you could end up walking away with anything from a pair of slippers to a family-sized bag of Tyrrells crisps. Parallel universe: The 99p Store's interior looks like a conventional supermarket but the prices are mind-bogglingly low . TAT OR TREASURE? Walking through the doors of the 99p Store in Eastleigh, Hampshire, I felt I was stepping into a parallel universe. The aisles are wide and well signed like in a conventional supermarket but the prices are mind-bogglingly low. I spotted several customers in Barbour jackets - all looking as shocked as me at the bargains. BEST FOR: Stocking up the store cupboard. You couldn't do your weekly shop here - unless you're happy to risk scurvy - as everything comes in tins, jars or packets, but it's a fantastic starting point. I snapped up armfuls of posh Tyrrells crisps (normally £2.19 at Tesco). Although I suspect they were produced for the summer market - the flavour is Beach Barbecue - I have until February 7 to eat them. With my baby niece about to visit, I bought two packs of Organix Baby Meals, each containing two meals, for 99p. Admittedly, they only had a three-day shelf life, but the same packs cost £1.50 at Asda. That's three times as much. Why pay more? Tessa absolutely loved the 99p Store . Admittedly, some of the labels are new to me. I've never heard of Mowbray mayonnaise and it's so watery you wouldn't want a large dollop with your prawns, but it was perfectly serviceable in a ham sandwich. And at 99p for 750g it's a bargain. I wonder how a 250ml bottle of Morrisons white balsamic vinegar has ended up on the shelf. With a best-before-date of 2017, it's hardly reaching the end of its life. Verdict: I absolutely loved this place - why pay more for kitchen essentials?                                4.5/5 . Eclectic selection: Poundstretcher is like a cross between a jumble sale and an Arabian souk . The first Poundstretcher opened in 1981. Now there are more than 400 branches and the company is the UK's leading discount retailer of products for the home. You won't find many big names but you will find everything from baked beans to conditioner and cushions to bird tables. If you come here expecting everything for a pound though, you'll be disappointed. While there is plenty of stock on offer for under a quid, there's also a variety of bigger ticket items with incredible discounts - and free delivery on anything over £10. Much of the homeware is specially made for Poundstretcher in Asia, and other items are surplus stock from big-name companies. TAT OR TREASURE? A cross between a jumble sale and an Arabian souk, the shelves heave with a mish-mash of special buys and dreg ends. I found lamp shades in the bathroom section, stationery among the bedding, and shower gel where the dog food should be. My fellow shoppers seemed unfazed, though. BEST FOR: Half-price homeware.  A diamante embellished toilet brush for £6.99 may not be your thing, but how about bathroom scales for £3.99 or a double duvet with matching pillows for £9.99? Admittedly there are few brands, though a lot of the stock is from South Korean company Hyundai. But there's a good selection. The store I visited in Newbury had a selection of 14 different pillows starting at just £1.99. That's almost as many as you'd find in John Lewis. I snapped up a Silent Night Airflow pillow for just £6.99. With an RRP of £15.99, the cheapest I could find it elsewhere is £12.97 on Amazon. The pillow is a genuine Silent Night - complete with famous Sleeping Hippo logo. The catch? The label is misspelt: 'Breath Easy' instead of 'Breathe Easy', something most major retailers would be reluctant to accept. An expensive mistake for someone - but a bargain for me. Verdict: I'm thrilled with my bargain pillow, but wouldn't give house-room to much else.     3.5/5 .","Poundland is best for health and beauty, Poundworld for cleaning products .

"Atletico Madrid swept into the last 16 of the Champions League with a game to spare after Mario Mandzukic netted a hat-trick in a crushing 4-0 win at home to Olympiacos on Wednesday. Last season's beaten finalists secured a fourth straight victory since falling 3-2 to the Greek side in their opening game in September and have 12 points from five matches, three ahead of second-placed Juventus, who won 2-0 at Malmo. Atletico Madrid's Mario Mandzukic (centre) heads in a goal against Olympiacos . After a typically intense start from the Spanish champions, Raul Garcia struck in the ninth minute following a howler from Olympiacos goalkeeper Roberto and another defensive error, this time from Roberto's Spanish compatriot Alberto Botia, let in Mandzukic to tap home seven minutes before the break. The Croatia forward made it 3-0 in the 62nd minute when he nodded in an Arda Turan cross and he completed his treble with another header from Gabi's free kick three minutes later as Atletico progressed from the group stage of Europe's elite competition in two consecutive seasons for the first time. Atletico's Mario Mandzukic embraces coach Diego Simeone after scoring third goal . 'The most important thing is that we keep on winning and keep on playing well,' Garcia said. 'It is always more difficult at the start of the season but we have kept working hard and we are getting better and better with every game,' added the Spain midfielder. Forward Mandzukic celebrates after scoring for Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night . Atletico roared out of the blocks at the Calderon and Garcia and Mandzukic both went close before the opener, which came after Roberto, a former Atletico youth player, passed the ball straight to Juanfran on the right of the penalty area. The Spain fullback sent a low cross back into the danger area and Garcia was on hand at the near post to clip a shot high into the net. Mandzukic beats Olympiacos keeper Roberto Jimenez to score the second goal . Atletico doubled their lead in the 38th minute when Botia fluffed an attempted clearance and the ball ran through to an unmarked Mandzukic. Olympiacos, coached by former Spain midfielder Michel, created a rare chance in the 61st minute when Kostas Mitroglou headed over but Mandzukic made the game safe with the first Champions League hat-trick for an Atletico player. If Atletico win or draw at Juventus in their final game on December 9 they will be assured of top spot and avoid fellow group winners in the draw for the knockout stages.","Raul Garcia opened the scoring before Mario Mandzukic scored hat-trick .

"Builder's tea has long been Britain's favourite cuppa, but more of us are choosing herbal teas instead. Sales of fruit and herbal tea have shot up 15 per cent in the past year. But at 6p a bag, compared to 2p for PG Tips, they're not cheap. So, can you make your own herbal teas - and what do they taste like? Tessa Cunningham took the DIY brew challenge... Home brew: Tessa Cunningham with her DIY herbal teas . Why drink it? Recommended as a cleansing tonic, nettle tea is supposed to be especially beneficial to the liver and kidneys. It can help soothe eczema and irritated or inflamed rashes and skin conditions. Easy to source? I live in the countryside and can barely set foot outside without encountering nettles - but what mad fool would go anywhere near them? I don gardening gloves and set off brandishing a pair of shears. Cost: Nil . How to make it: Back home - and still wearing gardening gloves to protect my hands - I pick off ten of the youngest leaves and dunk them in a colander, washing them under running water to get rid of any dust and dirt. I transfer the leaves to the teapot, add boiling water and steep for ten minutes. Tea-licious? An unappetising green colour, the tea stinks of rotting vegetation. I have to hold my nose to take a sip, then throw the rest away. It tastes nothing like shop-bought nettle tea, which  is pleasantly earthy. To add insult to injury, I get stung by the nettles when cleaning the pot. So, nettle tea is good for the skin? Mine is covered in itchy stings. Rating: 0/10 . Go forage: The ingredients can all be found outdoors - but some taste better than others when brewed . Why drink it? Mint is reputed to soothe stomach cramps, spasms and bloating, calm nausea and headaches. Easy to source? The mint in my herb garden is well past its  best, so I buy a new pot plant from my local garden centre for £3. With a supermarket peppermint teabag costing around 8p, that's a big investment. Cost: £3 for ten cups. How to make it: Apparently, the leaves taste best if they're picked and dried for 24 hours beforehand, so I snip off two large handfuls, rip them to release the aroma and lay them on a tray in my kitchen. The smell is intense. When my leaves are dry and crunchy, I put them in my teapot, pour boiling water over and infuse for 20 minutes. Tea-licious? It smells like cheap mouthwash, but tastes pleasantly refreshing. At this price, though, it's cheaper to buy my mint tea at the supermarket - a box of 20 bags cost 80p in Tesco. Rating: 7/10 . Time for a cuppa: Tessa found the fennel tea the tastiest . Why drink it? Dandelion leaves and petals are supposed  to be good for treating fluid retention and urinary tract infections. Dandelion is rich in potassium - which is good for the heart, blood pressure and efficient energy conversion. It is also a liver tonic. Easy to source? One look at my lawn and it's obvious I could provide an entire street party with dandelion tea. I pull up two armfuls in no time. Cost? Nil. How to make it: I select ten of the youngest and freshest leaves, wash them in running water, then dunk in my teapot of boiled water and leave for 15 minutes. Tea-licious? Once I've got over the marshy smell, I'm impressed by the taste. It's slightly bitter, but refreshing. Rating: 6/10 . Why drink it? An infusion of lavender flowers is good for a hangover, while soothing the digestive system and assisting the liver. The blackberry leaves add sweetness. Easy to source? I have three lavender beds in my garden and snipping off the heads takes a matter of minutes. There are lots of blackberry leaves in nearby hedgerows, but removing them with my bare hands means my fingers look like a pin cushion. You can buy dried lavender and blackberry leaves online - but at £3.50 for 15g of dried lavender and £2.94 for 250g of blackberry leaves, these can be expensive. Cost? Nil from my garden. How to make it: I chop up 2tbsp of lavender florets and the beautiful smell fills the kitchen. I feel better already as I add a handful of the leaves, then steep in boiling water for ten minutes. Tea-licious? My tea is a pretty pink and smells sensational. The lavender smell is so intense it's like holding my head over neat lavender oil. Sadly, that's exactly what it tastes like. It's so sticky I want to gag. The blackberry leaves are horribly bitter. Rating: 0/10 . Sourced from nature: Save money on shop bought tea bags by picking your own nettles, mint and blackberries . Why drink it? Camomile is supposed to help hayfever and asthma sufferers. It is also useful for calming stomach spasms and easing indigestion, bloating and hiccups. A cup before bed is also said to help a good night's sleep. Easy to source? You can buy dried camomile flowers online (£1.80 for 50g), but I am keen to forage for my own. Sadly, I wouldn't know it if I fell over it, so I contact the Botanical Society of the British Isles. Their local expert tells me I need to head to the New Forest, 20 miles from my Hampshire home, where it still grows wild in patches. They provide me with an Ordnance Survey reference and tells me camomile looks like a tiny daisy. Two hours later, I'm wading through cow pats, night is falling and I'm exhausted. Eventually I spot a few clumps of what I assume is camomile. It's supposed to have a sweet, apple-like aroma - mine stinks of manure. Cost? Nil. How to make it: As with most flower teas, the taste is more intense if you dry the flowers. You can then store it for up to six months in an airtight container. Instead, I wash the flowers to remove any dirt, then pop 2tbsp into my teapot with boiling water. It infuses for 15 minutes. Tea-licious? This is so refreshing and pleasant that, as I take my first sip, I manage to banish all thought of the germs that might still be clinging to those dungy camomile flowers. I sleep like a baby - and I don't think that's just because of my march through the New Forest. Rating: 7/10 . Why drink it? A spicy tea recommended for relieving windy digestive systems, it is also a folk remedy for relieving the aches and pains of flu. Easy to source? I buy a jar of fennel seeds from my local supermarket for £1. Cost? £1 for 13 cups of tea. How to make it: I use a pestle and mortar to crush 1tsp seeds, then leave them to infuse in boiled water for ten minutes. Tea-licious? The tea smells and tastes every bit as good as a shop-bought version. It's a nice, dark colour with a liquorice-like aroma. I'll need to grow my own fennel to make the home-brew version cost effective. Rating: 8/10 .","More Britons are drinking herbal teas .

"Sony Corp does not plan to renew its sponsorship contract with FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, as the Japanese electronics maker needs to prioritise its restructuring efforts. Such a move would follow Emirates Airline's announcement this month that it was ending its sponsorship of FIFA, a blow to the governing body as it investigates whether there was corruption in the bidding process for the next two World Cup competitions. Sony has been a FIFA sponsor for the eight years to 2014 in a contract worth 33 billion yen (£178million). The FIFA logo is seen outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland . Sony on Tuesday said it was aiming to restructure its television and mobile divisions further, while targeting robust growth for its electronics devices division, which houses its growing image sensors business. An official for the electronics conglomerate said he could not comment on future contracts. The people familiar with the matter declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Hans-Joachim Eckert said there were no grounds to reopen the controversial bidding process . Sponsors have put pressure on FIFA to respond robustly to allegations of bribery to secure the 2018 World Cup for Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. Earlier this month, FIFA's ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert said in a statement there were no grounds to reopen the controversial bidding process, clearing Qatar and Russia of wrongdoing. But that announcement was immediately undermined when Michael Garcia, the former U.S. prosecutor that led FIFA's own investigation, said that he disputed its summary of his findings. Michael Garcia, Chairman of the Ethics Committee, speaks during the 64th FIFA Congress . A number of European officials have called on FIFA to publish Garcia's full report but the governing body said it could not release it to the public for legal reasons. Garcia and Eckert met face to face and decided that Garcia's report would be sent to the chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, who would in turn decide how much of the report should be sent to the FIFA executive committee. They also confirmed that the ethics committee had opened a number of formal cases against unidentified individuals and FIFA confirmed it had lodged a criminal complaint in Switzerland, but stood by its conclusion that any wrongdoing was not enough to jeopardise the winning bids.","Sony's move follows Emirates Airline's announcement this month that it was ending its sponsorship of FIFA .

"Do you know someone inspirational? The search for the 2013 winner is on . The Daily Mail is proudly running . its seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in association with . British Gas and the charity Shelter. Over . the coming weeks, we want you to nominate the special women who deserve . to be recognised. Here, we tell the story of one of our remarkable . nominees . . . Debby Walch had barely switched out the light when the phone on her bedside table started ringing. A few hurried words and minutes later Debby, accompanied by husband Michael, was zooming off in her car on another mercy mission. This time, the crisis call came from  73-year-old Gladys, who had been frightened by a mysterious banging sound on her door. 'Michael and I toured the property and couldn't see anything,' Debby smiles, recalling last week's late-night outing. 'It was probably simply a tree branch brushing against her door. But there was no way I could have just turned over and gone to sleep without checking. 'I know Gladys would have sat up in her chair all night scared out of her wits. And I couldn't have that. After giving her a cuddle and making her a nice hot cup of cocoa, I helped her back into bed and knew she'd sleep soundly. 'Isn't that what everyone would do?' Always on call: Debby Walch is available, day and night, for the elderly residents of Old Ben Homes . If only. This selfless approach is how Debby, 53, came to be nominated for the Daily Mail's Inspirational Women of the Year competition, run in association with British Gas and the charity Shelter. She was put forward for the award by the residents of Old Ben Homes, a complex of sheltered housing for the elderly based in Seaford, East Sussex. As manager of the complex, which is home to 47 residents aged from 60 to 103, who all live in their own self-contained bungalows, Debby is paid to work only from 9am to 5pm, five days a week. However, the elderly residents in Debby's care say that they can contact her any time on her landline or mobile phone and she will leave her home half a mile away at a moment's notice if they need her.If they use an emergency panic button, the plea for help is directed to a call centre, but the call centre is under strict instructions to alert Debby immediately. 'My residents trust me to be there for them,' says Debby, who lives in Seaford with Michael, 52, who posts billboards for companies. 'Can you imagine how frightened they would be having paramedics turn up without me being there to comfort and reassure them? 'If they have to go to hospital, I can pack a little bag for them and check they've got all their medicine.' Christmas come early: Debby with residents Gina and Rita (left to right) and granddaughter Caitlin, posing with a collection for Romanian children . And when any of her residents has a long spell in hospital, Debby is sure to turn up at their bedside with a hug and a cheery smile. 'Most managers sign off at 5pm every day, but that's not good enough for Debby,' explains Rita Jones, 79, one of the residents who has benefited many times from her kindness. 'Although she doesn't live on site but a few minutes away, she gets in her car and comes rushing round if any of us has a problem. 'She's outstanding and we honestly don't know what we would do without her. Take me. I've got two replacement hips and knees. When I fell a few weeks ago and couldn't get up again, I called Debby. Even though it was a Saturday morning - her day off - she was here within ten minutes. 'She stayed with me until the paramedics came and even accompanied me to hospital for a check-up because she knew I was scared. Nothing's too much trouble for her.' Debby, who worked as a childminder for 20 years before taking her job at Old Ben's in February 2010, shrugs off the praise. 'I genuinely love looking after my elderly people,' she says. 'And the fact I can make their lives more enjoyable makes me so happy. 'I see it as my chance to give back a little. I treat my residents the way I'd treat my own mum. I was very close to Mum - who lived at the complex herself for six years until she died of cancer in May 2007 aged 73. Loyalty: 'My residents trust me to be there for them', says Debby, who is the manager of the complex . 'We spoke every day and, when she died, there was a huge hole in my life. I'd already lost my father, who died, also of cancer, when he was in his early 50s. 'It may sound as though I do a lot, but I get back much more than I give. 'Looking after my lovely elderly ladies and gentlemen is like  having a huge extended family. We laugh and we cry together - just like in a family. When someone dies, we are all down. And when someone has a birthday or a new grandchild, we all join in the celebrating. 'Of course, some have their own families and get regular visitors, but many don't. When I say goodbye to them on Friday evening, many won't see a soul until I come back on Monday morning and that's so sad.' Debby, who's mum to Ricky, 33, Jamie, 31 and Mitchell, 22 and grandma to Caitlin, 12 and Gracie, three, starts every day with a roll call. 'I pop around to each house with my register. It's like checking who's in class today, and we always have a good laugh about it. It's a chance to chat about anything my ladies and gentlemen are worried about. I help them with everything from organising eye tests to helping with tricky knitting patterns. And with Debby around there's absolutely no chance of the residents getting bored. The communal hall - which used to be deserted under the old manager - is now a hive of activity. There are 'knit and natter' and craft mornings, Scrabble and bingo afternoons, and fish and chip suppers. Going for gold: Debby holding the Seaford in Bloom floral competetition winners trophy . Residents enjoy an Easter  Bonnet Parade, a Christmas Party and regular cream teas just for the fun of it. Money for treats is raised by the residents. 'We do our own version of the National Lottery every week and there's always a winner,' explains Debby. 'Michael came up with the idea of each resident paying £1 and choosing their favourite  numbers. They then have their house number tagged on. 'It means someone wins every week. We all get excited for the winner, who gets to keep £40, and we put money left over - £9 a week - into the kitty.' At weekends there are often trips out. Recently, Debby piled 25 residents into a minibus and, with husband Michael bringing up the rear in his car, they all set off for a day at the dog races in Brighton, followed by lunch and a drive along the seafront. 'All the wheelchairs and Zimmer frames take some managing,' Debby grins. 'But getting out and having fun is a tonic for everyone - me included.' Debby makes a point of remembering all her residents' birthdays and she buys them all Christmas presents - diaries for the ladies and liqueur chocolates for the men. Needless to say she's inundated with cards and gifts when it comes to her own birthday. Dedication: Debby helping to clean out the fish pond in the residents' complex . 'I try to keep the date secret, but they always find out somehow. Last year I got 40 cards and more boxes of chocolates than I could possibly eat,' she laughs. But while the residents love Debby for her unstinting energy and good humour, it's her willingness to step in day or night that is truly exceptional. Take Rodney and Ethel. When Ethel, 85, was diagnosed with  terminal cancer she wanted to stay at home as long as possible. With Ethel's children living too far away to help their mother, her GP was reluctant to let her stay at home, and it was only when Debby offered to help Ethel's 90-year-old husband Rodney care for her that she was allowed to remain in the home she loved. With the help of the Macmillan nurses who called in regularly, Debby was able to fulfil Ethel's wishes. 'I was on call 24/7. I don't think I got an undisturbed night for two weeks. But I honestly didn't mind,' says Debby. 'Ethel only went into hospital at the very end. 'When the hospital rang me at 6am to say she was dying, I got Rodney up and dressed and we drove over there together. Although we arrived just too late and cried in each other's arms, the comfort Rodney got from knowing he had done all his wife wanted was enormous. 'I was so pleased that I was able to help it happen. My residents have cared for others all their lives. Now it's their turn to be cared for.'

"Two women who say they were sexually abused as teenagers by financial guru and former Clinton confidante Jeffrey Epstein in his Palm Beach mansion are hoping a trove of newly released documents will get the case reopened. Epstein was suspected nearly a decade ago of paying for sex with dozens of underage girls. The FBI ultimately dropped its investigation, and Epstein pleaded guilty to a single offense and served more than a year in jail. Cutting a deal: Jeffrey Epstein, seen here in 2008, pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution but a host of other accusers had their cases dropped . Recently, though, Epstein's accusers won a precedent-setting ruling that will let them see the documents regarding the deal Epstein made with the government. The women say they were left in the dark about the agreement, only learning about it after Epstein pleaded guilty to the single solicitation charge. The women are hoping to undo the agreement and subject Epstein to more charges. The women's lawyers say Epstein got a sweetheart deal because of his wealth and connections. Among those connections were his ties to then-President Bill Clinton who flew on Epstein's private jet more than 10 times. Flight logs from 2002 to 2005 that were only disclosed in March show that Clinton, who was only recently out of the White House at that point, travelled around the world courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein while his wife, Hillary, was a senator in New York. After jail: Former President Clinton cut ties to Epstein after the prostitution scandal (Epstein at left in 2011) Staying close: Prince Andrew visited Epstein in New York in 2011 (pictured) just shortly after he was released from jail for the prostitution charge . Among the stops were Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St James, where young girls were supposedly kept as sex slaves. Clinton was deemed to be so close to Epstein he was nearly forced to give a statement during the investigation into the latter’s paedophilic tendencies, legal documents revealed in March. Epstein, who is now 61, is considered to be one of the most well-connected men in America caused acute embarrassment to Prince Andrew, who was at one point photographed with Virginia Roberts, one of  the girls Epstein is said to have used as a sex slave. The Duke of York also stayed at Epstein’s home in Florida and flew with him in his private jet. Mansion: The teenage girls accused Epstein of sexually abusing them in his Palm Beach mansion (pictured) The investigation into Epstein's exploits came when a woman in Palm Beach contacted police saying that her 14-year-old daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex. The claim prompted a nearly year-long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and remains a registered sex offender. Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's mansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail.","Epstein served time after pleasing guilty to one count of soliciting a prostitute but accusations from teen girls of sex abuse were dropped .

"The Sudanese woman who was sentenced to death for being a Christian has been released from her latest detention but has been charged with new crimes, MailOnline can reveal. Meriam Ibrahim has been accused of falsifying travel documents as she tried to leave the African country hours after the death penalty was dropped against her. It is understood that the authorities told her she should have used the Muslim name she had when she was born, not the Christian name she uses after choosing to worship that faith. Safety fears: Rights groups are concerned for Meriam Ibrahim and her family, pictured after her release Monday, after they were arrested at an airport in Sudan by the National Intelligence and Security Services . It is not clear if her husband Daniel Wani, who is from Manchester in New Hampshire, has also been charged with any offenses. The new allegations are a huge setback to Meriam's hopes of leaving Sudan and a further sign that the Sudanese government is playing twisted games over her release. Meriam, a doctor, is on bail which was put up by a friend. She cannot leave Sudan until this matter is resolved as part of her bail conditions. It came as campaigners working to free the mother-of-two attacked the U.S. Department of State for its ‘shameful’ response to helping her. Tina Ramirez, founder of religious freedom organization Hardwired, called for Congress to investigate the 'incredibly negligent' handling of Meriam Ibrahim’s case. Meriam and her husband were detained at the airport of the Sudanese capital Khartoum when they tried to leave the country with their son Martin, 21 months, and daughter Maya, one month. Arrest: Meriam's New Hampshire husband Daniel Wani, pictured with their baby girl, has also been detained . Criticism: Daniel and Meriam on their wedding day. Freedom group Hardwired has called the U.S. embassy's handling of the couple's case 'shameful' Meriam was only freed on Monday after nine months in jail, during which she was shackled to the floor while she gave birth to Maya. 2011 . - Meriam Ibrahim, who was raised Christian by a Christian mother, . marries Daniel Wani, a Catholic from South Sudan who is a U.S. citizen .

The following day, Tuesday, on what should have been her first full day of freedom, she instead found herself back in custody. In an interview with MailOnline, Ramirez said that the State Department had been aware of Daniel and Meriam’s case since 2011 when they first married. In September last year, when Meriam, 27, was first arrested, Daniel went to the U.S. embassy in Sudan three times but was told that the ambassador was too busy to see him. Ramirez said: ‘The US government should have coordinated with the government of Sudan to get them out of the country. This is sloppy. ‘They have had three years to sort this out and whenever Daniel has gone to the U.S. embassy in Sudan for help they have refused. ‘I think that Congress should be investigating what happened here. ‘The US says that it cares about human rights issues and this is something they should be caring about. It’s a total failure, it’s shameful.’ Ramirez said it was a ‘good question’ as to why U.S. officials on the ground did not put Meriam and Daniel on their plane and make sure they were able to leave. She likened it to the fiasco over the Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, who sparked a tense diplomatic row when America granted him asylum after he took refuge in the American embassy in Beijing, and said that America ‘should have learned its lesson’. Ramirez said: ‘The State Department have been so incredibly negligent over this.’ When they got to the airport in Khartoum, a confrontation ensued between the group, their lawyers and about 40 members of the feared Sudanese security police. At her daily press briefing on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf confirmed that Meriam, Daniel and their children were detained due to ‘issues related to their travel’. She said that they had not been arrested and that the Sudanese government ‘has assured us of their safety’. She said: ‘The State Department is engaging directly with Sudanese officials to secure their safe and swift departure from Sudan.’ Plight: Meriam, pictured with her two young children, was sentenced to death and 100 lashes but was later released . In a worrying twist, Meriam and Daniel were taken into custody by the feared National Intelligence and Security Services, MailOnline has confirmed. NISS does not operate through the courts if it claims to be working on a matter of national security and can detain people indefinitely, Hardwired said. The organisation was described as ‘Agents of Fear’ in a damning report by human rights campaigners Amnesty which outlined a catalogue of abuses they had carried out. NISS is also notorious for taking prisoners to secret 'ghost houses' where they are tortured. Daniel’s brother Gabriel, a naturalized American citizen who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, told MailOnline: ‘This is very concerning. It’s bad news. 'They should be let go as soon as possible. My brother wanted to get out of Sudan as fast as he could, and now this has happened’.","Meriam Ibrahim was due to be executed for converting to Christianity .

"A leading academic was today told the allegations that she stalked one of the world's top economists would be dismissed - as she vowed to sue him in revenge. Heleen Mees said that she wanted compensation from Willem Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, for the loss of her professional reputation and the stress she had endured. Her lawyers also vowed to sue Citigroup to demand emails relating to ‘dates’ between them both to see if Mr Buiter may have lied to police. Citigroup declined to comment on the case. Dropped: Heleen Mees was told in court today that the stalking charges against her will be dropped . Sentence:  Miss Mees was told her case would be dismissed in a year if she attends 14 therapy sessions and stays out of trouble . Not quite the end: Miss Mees said that she wanted compensation from Willem Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, for the loss of her professional reputation and the stress she had endured . Today at Manhattan’s Criminal Court Miss Mees was told her case would be dismissed in a year if she attends 14 therapy sessions and stays out of trouble. Under the deal she does not admit guilt to the five charges of stalking and harassment. Speaking after the case her lawyer Olav Haazen said that since her arrest, Miss Mees was sacked from her job as Adjunct Associate Professor at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Policy. Mss Mees was seen with a black leather Chanel purse emblazoned with the fashion house's distinctive label. The exact model of the bag is not clear, but this year's version retails for $3,700. Compensation: Mees, seen holding a Chanel bag which normally retails for upwards of $3,000, said she will sue Citigroup to demand emails relating to ¿dates¿ between them both to see if Mr Buiter may have lied to police . Subject: The ruling brings an end to a messy case that exposed the personal lives of Miss Mees, 44, and Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, 64, who used to be on the Bank of England¿s Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates . She has also lost her consulting business and is no longer writing for a number of prestigious newspapers in Holland. Mr Haazen said: ‘All that was taken away from her on the basis of accusations which turned out to be not viable for a criminal case. 'You can imagine when all that is taken away...the damages both financially and emotionally are significant.’ Mr Haazen added that the lawsuit against Citigroup he would file in the Manhattan Federal Court would force the company to hand over emails relating to meetings between Miss Mees and Mr Buiter. There was a ‘significant likelihood’ a lawsuit against Mr Buiter himself would follow, he said. The . ruling brings an end to a messy case that exposed the personal lives of . Miss Mees, 44, and Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, 64, who used to be on . the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest . rates. Dutch-born Miss Mees . was accused of sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and . threatening emails and Facebook messages over a four-year period. She also allegedly followed him to China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his hotel. Positive outcome: Mees, seen entering court on Monday, maintained that she was not stalking him but their messages and explicit emails went both ways . Thankful: Mees took to Twitter to thank her family, legal team and supporters after the ruling . Among the messages were some relating to sex acts and naked pictures of herself. Papers filed with the Manhattan court brings to light more details about the intimate relationship that Mees and Buiter shared, revealing that he called himself 'ELB' which stood for Enema Loving Brit. He also apparently told Mees that he would leave his wife to be with her. His wife, Anne, is said to have learned about the affair in 2009- prompting them to break it off. The court documents reveal that Buiter told his wife that it was over but began seeing Mees again shortly after. Along with their more explicit emails, they also had lighter moments at Anne's expense. 'Can't you send Anne shopping with your Citi credit card so we can have some time alone? Imagine what we can do in under an hour,' Mees wrote in one email. Looking ahead: Mees is seeking compensation because the court drama resulted in the loss of her consulting business and is no longer writing for a number of prestigious newspapers in Holland . Moving on: Dutch-born Miss Mees was accused of sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and threatening emails and Facebook messages over a four-year period . But there were also more sinister messages too such as one which read: ‘I hope you die (read this to your wife)’. Another was a picture of some dead birds next to which she wrote: 'I hope your plane falls out the sky'. Threatened: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children . Miss Mees claimed all along that she and . Mr Buiter, who is married to his second wife, economics professor Anne . Sibert, were having an affair and that it was a 'bilateral' arrangement. Her lawyers argued that the relationship was ‘encouraged on social media and in person' as well by Mr Buiter, who was born in Holland but has British and American citizenship. During one hearing Mr Buiter was even scolded by a judge for contacting Miss Mees on business networking website LinkedIn weeks after she was arrested . Mr Buiter is based in London but has a $4million flat on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Mr Buiter, who was not in court, said in the criminal complaint: ‘The defendant's actions have caused me severe annoyance and alarm, and to fear for my physical safety and for the safety of my wife and my children.’ Speaking outside court Miss Mees' lawyer Ira London said she was 'delighted' with the verdict. He said: 'We were always confident that her innocence would prevail and it has. 'The 14 weeks of therapy are mutually agreed upon because of the stress this case has caused Miss Mees.'

"The tech entrepreneur dubbed ‘The Third Winklevoss’ could be in line for a multimillion dollar payout after a breakthrough in his lawsuit against the founder of Snapchat. Frank Reginald Brown ‘may deserve something’ for his role in setting up up the photo-sharing app, chief executive Evan Spiegel has admitted. During a deposition in the case Spiegel added that Brown made ‘contributions’ that helped make the firm so successful it recently rejected a $3 billion buyout deal from Facebook. Frank Reginald Brown 'may deserve something' for his role in setting up up the photo-sharing app, chief executive Evan Spiegel (pictured, left, with fellow co-founder Bobby Murphy) has admitted . Brown has sued Spiegel and former friend Bobby Murphy because he claims they stole the idea for Snapchat from him when they were all students at Stanford. He alleges that things suddenly turned sour so they changed the passwords to the servers and shut him out. Brown wants one-third of Snapchat even though he previously agreed to 20 per cent, the lawsuit states. Currently he owns nothing. Observers have said that the case has echoes of the case brought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which ended with a $65 million settlement. In a video deposition obtained by Business Insider, Spiegel admitted that Brown came up with the idea for photos that disappeared after a few seconds, the main feature of Snapchat. The most compelling exchange was when Spiegel was asked: ‘Do you think Reggie deserves anything for the contributions he made on the project?’ The suit mirrors the Winklevoss twins (pictured) who claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook that made him a multi-billionaire . Snapchat is a photo messaging app for iOS and Android devices, developed by Stanford University students. Using the app, users can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent photographs and videos are known as 'Snaps'. Users set a time limit for how long recipients can view their Snaps (from one to 10 seconds) after which they will be hidden from the recipient's device and deleted from the Snapchat server. The social app is currently delivering more than 350 million photos every day. Snapchat hasn't made any money yet as it doesn't sell adverts or charge people to download or use its app, but it has attracted a lot of investment. It has just added Snapchat stories, which lets users link photos and videos together, where they exist for 24 hours. The app has come under fire from people worried about sexting and cyber bullying. After a pause lasting seven seconds, he replied: ‘Reggie may deserve something for some of his contributions.’ Murphy also gave a deposition during which time he was asked about a Facebook status update he wrote in which he calls Brown his ‘employer’. Looking uncomfortable as he replied, Murphy said: ‘Uh ...Well it looks like here that I did something to that effect. ‘I don't have a specific recollection of this happening ... although I would say that it would have been unclear to me what ... tagging someone as an 'employer' under Facebook would mean.’ Snapchat is one of the most popular photo sharing apps in the world, especially among young people. According to research by Pew Internet, 26 per cent of under 30s use it, though the number of over 30s was tiny. In November it reported that users sent 400 million messages every day, which is more than Facebook and Instagram combined. Critics claim that Snapchat encourages ‘sexting’ among teenagers who don’t have to fear being embarrassed by images lingering around. Spiegel's legal team said in a statement: ‘We are aware of the allegations, believe them to be utterly devoid of merit, and will vigorously defend ourselves against this frivolous suit’.","Frank Reginald Brown ‘may deserve something’ for his role in setting up up the photo-sharing app, chief executive Evan Spiegel has admitted .

"Traditionally Apple launches are like Marmite - the fanboys love them while everyone else slams the  firm for over-hyped devices, yet yesterday's event was met initially by something that could be considered worse: indifference. Immediately after the event, many described the announcement on Twitter as underwhelming and since the unveiling opinion on social networks remains mixed but predominantly muted. Surprisingly though, one of the most influential people to criticise the devices has been Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak who, during the Apps World conference in London, said the iPads didn't meet his needs. With Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak slamming the new iPad Air, left, and iPad mini, right, for concentrating on style over substance, other experts are torn as to whether customer expectation is really the problem . Wozniak, pictured, told the BBC he 'wishes to God' Apple and Google will be partners in the future . Wozniak said: 'Yes it's thinner but I wanted storage' adding he was tempted, but in the end emailed his wife saying he wouldn't be getting one. He has been outspoken in the past when it comes to Apple and recently said the film biopic of Job’s life was ‘fiction’. He also accused Ashton Kutcher, who played Jobs, of being ‘disingenuous’ and claimed a key scene was ‘totally wrong’. Apple chose to stick with an almost identical design for its new iPad mini, aside from adding the faster A7 chip first seen on the iPhone 5S and a Retina display, which in fact makes the device thicker and heavier. The same A7 chip has been added to the fifth-generation iPad, now known as iPad Air, and the 9.7-inch model has been made thinner and lighter but lacks many more original features. Tim Ryan, a partner at Davenport Lyons told MailOnline the lack of fanfare around Apple's event may be more about customer expectation than about Apple's ability to innovate: 'The . fact is consumers are more and more sophisticated and their . expectation levels regarding new products and product launches have . risen stratospherically over the last five years or so. 'It does take . something pretty special nowadays, from whichever manufacturer is . concerned, to generate a buzz in the market.' How customers are evolving and responding to new technology is also a point raised by Matthew Knight, head of innovation at media agency Carat. Apple claims the tablet market is now split between high-end products and budget devices, yet Knight believes 'the audience is not splitting, but rather spreading . across the whole price spectrum.' Apple chose to stick with an almost identical design for its new iPad mini, right, aside from adding a faster A7 chip and Retina display. The same A7 chip has been added to the fifth-generation iPad, now known as iPad Air, left, and the 9.7-inch model has been made thinner and lighter but lacks many more original features . Because the majority of the market sits below Apple's price points, Knight continues Apple needs to 'do a great deal of work' to excite the mid-market and persuade them to switch up to Apple products. Commenting on the new devices, including the iPad Air, pictured, mobile agency Fetch said: 'Long gone are the days where Apple would capture the audiences' imaginations. Apple is continuing to ride the wave of success that Steve Jobs established' Apple was heavily criticised for not releasing the budget iPhone many had expected with the iPhone 5C last month, and some claimed Apple would ultimately suffer if it failed to attract emerging markets, yet Wired.co.uk editor Nate Lanxon believes Apple may see things a little differently: 'Apple's cheaper tablet continues to . be its older models, not new models created at cheaper price points. 'The . iPad 2, for example, remains on sale even though it's now years old; . the non-Retina Display iPad mini also will be sold still, and it is . these models Apple will use to encourage more price-conscious shoppers.' Ben Wood, director of devices at CCS Insight agreed: 'By . continuing to manufacture [older models] . Apple is extending its product portfolio's reach. This is critical . given increasing competition, particularly from players such as Amazon and Google.' Yet Robert Sharl, lecturer in Visual Communication at Birmingham City University doesn't think Apple should be concerned because it 'doesn’t . see the iPad as a commodity tablet, competing for Christmas . stocking-filler sales with the likes of Tesco’s Hudl and Amazon’s Kindle . Fire'. Instead it’s building out the range. 'It’s a smart strategy, . because it lets Apple build devices that create real value.' Despite this, the Apple launch did ruffle a few people's feathers. Moin Maniar, chief technology officer . at mobile agency Fetch slammed the launch as an 'over publicised and under . delivering performance' from the California-based firm. 'Long gone are the days when Apple . would capture the audiences' imaginations and turn them into reality on . stage with groundbreaking products. 'Apple is continuing to ride the wave of success that Steve Jobs established. Alongside the new products, Apple vice president Eddy Cue, pictured, also announced the firm was making a number of its software programs available for free, including the Mac operating system, iWork and iLife. Experts claim this is a direct swipe at competitors including Microsoft . Apple is rumoured to be working on a range of high-definition TVs with 55- and 65-inch screens. The claims were made by Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Advanced Research in Japan. Although he didn't identify his source, he told the Wall Street Journal the models are expected to have a 'frameless design.' Apple . could release the giant television by the end of 2014 and Ishino would . expect them to sell for around $1,500 and $2,500 respectively. 'Now all we are left with are newly . named existing products. 'No wonder Apple is now giving away, what they . refer to as a ‘new’ operating system, for free. Any paying user would be . furious with the lack of improvements.' Alongside the new products, Apple also announced it was making a number of its software programs available for free, including the Mac operating system plus iWork, the Mac equivalent to Microsoft's Office software. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline Apple's move into free software is directly aimed 'at wresting Microsoft's control of the market.' 'Tim . Cook's potshots at Office and Windows underpinned this as a clear . attempt to disrupt the Microsoft model of historically charging . for OS upgrades and attempting to charge subscription fees for software. 'Making . iWorks, iLife and Mavericks free will ensure they're the Apple of tech . fans' eyes, while pipping Microsoft to the post in bringing productivity . software to iPad owners closes the door on a huge opportunity for its . rival.'","Apple co-founder Wozniak slammed devices for not offering more storage .

"Bethenny Frankel's new boyfriend was expelled . from an exclusive college after being accused of raping a fellow student, it . can be revealed today. Financier Michael Cerussi III - who at 34 is . nine years younger than his new girlfriend - was kicked out of Union College in . Schenectady, NY, in 2000 after a freshman accused him and a fraternity brother . of having sex with her against her will. He fought the case until 2003. MailOnline is not naming the alleged victim . out of respect for her privacy and due to the nature of the allegations. She . declined to comment. Splashing around: Bethenny folllowed Michael Cerussi III in the sea while on vacation in Miami . Controversial past: Cerussi was kicked out of Union College in Schenectady, NY, in 2001 after a freshman accused him and a fraternity brother of having sex with her against her will . Denial: Cerussi challenged the claims and sued the college for defamation and discriminating against him because he was a man. His two year legal battle saw his case dismissed . Close: Bethenny and Michael Cerussi III - nicknamed 'Mac' - enjoyed New Year's Eve together at the Mondrian in South Beach, Miami . Cerussi, 34, the son of a prominent New York . lawyer, was seen this week frolicking on the beach with Real Housewives of New . York star Bethenny, 43, on a sun-soaked New Year's Eve trip to Miami. The couple were seen sharing a tender kiss on New . Year’s Eve at the Mondrian Hotel in South Beach in Miami and have been staying . together at the Delano Hotel. Cerussi goes by the nickname 'Mac' and works . in financial services, but back in 2000 he was a student at the prestigious UC, . which dates back to 1795. The school charges $58,000 a year - meaning it . ranks among the most expensive colleges in America. According to court documents filed at the . Southern District of New York court in Westchester County - and seen by MailOnline -  Cerussi was a 22-year-old senior . at the time when he and fraternity brother Frederik Bailey met the victim on . November 11 2000, a Friday night, at a bar near campus. The documents allege: ‘(The alleged victim) accompanied them back to their fraternity house and had sexual intercourse with . both men.’ The following night the victim got a call . from John Gregory, another of Cerussi’s fraternity brothers, inferring he knew . what she had done. The alleged victim then went to a nearby hospital and . told a nurse she had been raped. Cerussi and Bailey were suspended whilst . Kathleen Schurick, an associate dean of students at UC, carried out her own . internal investigation and found them both guilty, the court documents state. A second hearing was held during which, . surprisingly, Cerussi was allowed to personally question two of the victim’s . roommate and close friend, but he was found guilty again. Both he and . Bailey were expelled in December 2000. Court case: Michael Cerussi III sued Union College after being expelled in 2001 following a rape accusation .

Skinnygirl: The cocktail brand founder lived up to her name in this tiny bikini in Miami on Wednesday . The case only came to light because Cerussi sued UC and alleged that ‘because he is male, Schurick and (associated dean Patricia) Williams discriminated against him and pre-determined his guilt, thereby violating both UC's Disciplinary Procedural Guidelines’. After numerous legal issues the case was dismissed in January 2003 with the approval of UC, Cerussi and the alleged victim. The case was dismissed ‘with prejudice’ meaning it can never be reopened. There are not details of a settlement, if one was reached. Today, a source close to Cerussi told MailOnline: 'Michael was expelled after a girl accused him of sexually assaulting her and the school expelled him. 'However, she never made a claim to police, she never got a rape kit and she never filed a police report. 'Michael actually sued her and the school for defamation of character.' In the end, the source claimed that Michael was invited back to the college, but chose to enroll at the University of Connecticut, from where he eventually graduated. The Schenectady Police Department records office said that there was no record of any incident with Cerussi’s name on it dating back to the start of 2000, the year the alleged rape took place. Union College declined to comment. And relax: The cosy twosome later stretched out on a beachside bed as they soaked up the sun . Keeping close: Bethenny and new love Michael Cerussi III got comfortable in a beach cabana . Cerussi’s aunt Nancy Mcenaney . dismissed her nephew’s past behaviour and said Bethenny was lucky to . have him because he was a ‘great guy’ who loved older women. Mrs Mcenaney, 58, told MailOnline: ‘He’s got a good heart. Everything about him is great. ‘He . treats me like a sister. I don’t think the age gap (with Frankel) is a . problem - Mac is like a brother to me...he likes to go on holiday with . his mum’. She added that . Cerussi’s father Michael - a feted corporate lawyer who died in 2011 - . was ‘tough’ on him and that he wanted him to go to law school after . Union College. However, Michael made his own way in the world and entered into finance. Speaking about the alleged rape, Mrs Mcenaney said that ‘nothing came of it’ and that ‘it was all dropped’. She said: ‘All college kids get into some sort of trouble’. The good life: The couple orders snacks and drinks as the staff hover over them . Ceruissi’s . friend added: ‘Michael’s not looking for fame, or to be a celebrity. He’s just a guy Bethenny met and they’re hanging out – he’s a great guy. Meanwhile, Bethenny - who is going through a bitter divorce from husband Jason Hoppy with wholm she has daughter Brynn - has ben clearly enjoying her time in .

"The U.S. military has begun testing troops to see if using low level shocks of electricity keeps them alert when they are in combat. The Pentagon reportedly feels coffee and energy drinks are not enough to keep soldiers' minds from drifting. Early experiments are underway using 'noninvasive' brain stimulation on dozens of volunteers - who seemed to perform better as a result. The U.S. military has begun testing troops to see if using low level shocks of electricity keep them alert during combat. Early experiments are underway using 'noninvasive' treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, stock image pictured, on volunteers who reported increased performance as a result . The research carried out by the U.S military focused on two transcranial . techniques. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves passing an electric current to the brain via a magnetic field. Transcranial direct . current stimulation is where the current is passed directly into the brain using sensors attached to the head. In each case, a very small dose - approximately one milliampere - was used on each participant for 10 minutes at a time. The . tests were designed to check for alertness and general performance; one . involved participants following instructions on a screen to spot . an aircraft as it came into friendly airspace. The Boston Globe reported that Lindsey McIntire, one of the researchers, said the response was better than caffeine and without the side effects like jitters or palpitations. This appeared to be the case when subjects were kept awake for 30 hours, or longer than a full day. There was also no ‘crash’ after a few hours, unlike when the effects of caffeine wear off. The study has been carried out at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. The team behind it hope that in the near future soldiers will carry a pair of electrodes with them that they can easily apply to themselves to carry the electric current. They were commissioned due to the changing nature of warfare; troops on the front line have adrenalin to keep them going but those sifting through reams of intelligence data need something to keep them sharp too. Researchers claim the response to brain stimulation was better than that experienced through caffeine in coffee, pictured, and energy drinks - yet without the side effects like jitters or palpitations. There was also no 'crash' after a few hours when the effects of the caffeine wore off . The U.S. military has a long and . chequered history when it comes to altering the minds of soldiers in a . bid to make them more effective killing machines . In the 1960s men were given LSD at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland to see if could be used as a weapon of war. Other test subjects were exposed to mustard gas, nerve agent VX and other potentially fatal chemicals. In . 1994 the Wright Laboratory in Ohio, another U.S. Air Force facility, drew . up a paper proposing the idea of a ‘gay bomb’ which would flood an . area with hormones and turn enemy soldiers into homosexuals with an . increased libido. The research focused on two techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation, in which a magnetic field passes an electric current to the brain, and transcranial direct current stimulation, where it is passed directly into the brain. A very small dose - around one milliampere - was used on each participant for 10 minutes at a time. The tests were designed to check for alertness and general performance; one involved participants following instructions on a screen to spot an aircraft as it came into friendly airspace. Staff Sergeant William Raybon, who took part, said he felt a ‘tingling’ when he was first hooked up to the electrodes but was ‘refreshed’ afterwards. The Boston Globe reported that overall, those who did not get any brain stimulation, including coffee, 'performed significantly worse than any of the stimulation groups.' As to the difference between caffeine and the electricity, the latter seemed to be more effective. R. Andy McKinley, a biomedical engineer who oversees the research, said: 'We found that people who receive the stimulation are performing consistently.' Dr William Killgore, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, added: ‘There is some evidence that it does seem to work. There have been a few studies that if you use it in the right place it can help mathematical calculations when people are sleep-deprived.’","The Pentagon reportedly feels coffee and energy drinks are not enough to keep soldiers’ minds from drifting .

"Paul Walker's ex and best friend has said she's devastated about losing the 'Fast & Furious' star just five days after her father passed away from cancer. 'These were the two loves of my life and the most important men in my life,' model-turned Las Vegas real estate broker Aubrianna Atwell said Sunday. Atwell met Walker through friends at the Hollywood Canteen a dozen years ago. The two began dating and though the romance ended, they have been in each other's lives ever since, chatting on the phone at least every week. Walker had promised to be with Atwell at her father's memorial service December 8. Devastated: Paul Walker's ex and best friend Aubrianna Atwell, pictured with the star in 2004, says she's devastated about losing the 'Fast & Furious' star, just six days after her father passed away from cancer . But on Saturday, as she toasted her father's memory with friends, she received a text message from Walker's friend. 'Call me please,' it read. 'In my gut, I knew something was wrong,' the 28-year-old told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. When she called, she was asked 'Are you driving?' The news left her crushed. Atwell's father, prominent real estate broker David Atwell, died last Monday of complications associated with his throat and lung cancer. He was 63 and had recently penned an email to Walker, thanking him for the supportive role he held in his daughter's life. Double blow: Atwell's father, prominent real estate broker David Atwell, pictured left, died last Monday of complications associated with his throat and lung cancer . 'My dad told him how much he loved him and how much he appreciated him protecting me,' she told the Las Vegas Sun. 'It was an overdue expression of gratitude.' The pair had 'traveled the world together,' Atwell said, explaining she regularly accompanied him on international trips. For . her birthday in April, the 40-year-old actor took her to San Francisco . to see a Giants game. She said she rushed home to be by her dad's side . for his last months. 'Paul was going to be with me on the day of my dad's service,' Atwell told The Sun. 'He . was the most generous, unconditionally loving person I've known. He . gave everything. I will live my life to the fullest extent for my father . and Paul.' Atwell said she and Walker talked a lot about his 15-year-old daughter Meadow who 'was everything to him.' Scene: A police officer walks past the car where actor Paul Walker was killed in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, November 30, 2013. Atwell said 'I'm sure a bit of speed was involved' Walker had been at a charity event on . behalf of his organization Reach Out Worldwide, helping victims of . Typhoon Haiyan. He left Meadow at the event as he went on what was . intended to be a quick ride with a friend. 'My heart is aching for Meadow. Paul was so committed to her,' Atwell told the Review-Journal. 'That's what's so hard about this. All he wanted to do was protect his daughter.' But his other love was perhaps what killed him. Walker was 'a huge exotic car enthusiast and not just because of the ""Fast & Furious"" influence,' Atwell said. 'He raced all over the world.' Porsches, like the one he ultimately died in, were his favorite, she explained, adding 'I'm sure a bit of speed was involved.'

She is being comforted by her mother as she struggles to cope with the 'horrible' news of his untimely dead . Former flame: Rebecca Soteros, pictured is the mother of Walker's daughter Meadow, 15 . Atwell's heartbreaking words come as Walker's girlfriend, Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, 23, is being comforted by her mother Julie following the devastating accident. She . has reportedly been dating Walker since 2006 when she was just 16 and . he was 33 - but the 17-year age gap has been no barrier to them both . finding love. Jasmine's uncle Barton Bruner told MailOnline Sunday: 'Paul was a really good guy and Jasmine is broken up by this. I went to . Thanksgiving with him, played golf with him. 'They had their ups and downs but they were together and looking to spend a bright future together. 'This is horrible news and unexpected. Her mother is with her and she is comforting her.'

'Broken up': Student Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, 23, is devastated after her boyfriend, actor Paul Walker, was killed in a horrific car accident on Saturday afternoon . Jasmine's . presence in Walker's life may have been one of the reasons why Meadow . decided to move in with him earlier this year, having spent her entire . childhood with her mother Rebecca Soteros who lives in Hawaii. Meanwhile, a fake Facebook page purporting to belong to Meadow Walker has been shut down. Walker's reps contacted Facebook directly. On the page, the imposter paid tribute to Walker, calling him her 'real life hero'. The teenager has not been seen since her terrible loss on Saturday. Walker was raised a Mormon in a working class California family, but his good looks - he was once described as a 'young Steve McQueen' - meant he was never lacking female attention. He also strayed from the family values his parents instilled in him and when he was 18 faced a felony charge though he has never revealed what it was. The case was reduced to a misdemeanor. When Rebecca got pregnant Walker was 25 but he refused to marry her, claiming that he was not mature enough even though it left him feeling like an 'evil SOB.' Walker met his girlfriend, Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, when he was 33 and she was just 16 . Fans place flowers at the scene of the car crash where actor Paul Walker was killed in the Santa Clarita area of Los Angeles on Sunday . In one interview Walker said: 'I knew . where I was at with chicks and having fun. I mean, I was sleeping with . her (Rebecca's) friends, for crying out loud. You know what I mean? 'I was an animal, and so I want to be there and my heart wants to be in it, but the mind just isn't following it.' Walker shared custody of Meadow and has claimed that things were good between him and Rebecca. He has said: 'I love my daughter so much, and I love her mom too. We get along so well as a result of me playing it the way that I did.' Walker had spent Thanksgiving with Meadow and friends and was scheduled to return to Atlanta to continue filming the seventh Fast and the Furious film when he died.","Model-turned Las Vegas real estate broker Aubrianna Atwell, 28, had been best friends with Walker since they met and briefly dated more than a decade ago .

"A British accountant and internationally-known marathon runner was . battered with a brick during a mugging in New York that was a throwback to the . city’s violent past.

"The father of the jihadi from Alabama believed killed in Somalia by Al Qaeda fighters who turned against him today said that the family are still desperately hoping he is still alive. Speaking from his Daphne, Alabama home, . Shafik Hammami said that claims by al-Shabab's leaders that they had his . son Omar executed in an ambush were 'ominous' - but he and wife Debra . are still holding on to hope. Reports on Thursday said that 29-year-old Omar, who had been on the FBI's Most Wanted terrorist list and was known for rap videos he posted to YouTube, was killed following several months on the run after falling out with the leader of al-Shabab. But Shafik said that, as of this morning, . he had not been notified by the Department of State that Omar had died. And when contacted by MailOnline, he said that he did not have any . official confirmation yet. 'Dead': Militants in Somalia have claimed that . American jihadist Omar Hammami has been killed. In April, he tweeted . this pictured, right, following what he called an assassination attempt . as he was in a tea shop . 'It looks very ominous this time as opposed to the last one, but we are still hopeful that it is untrue,' Shafik, 61, told MailOnline. Omar had been active on Twitter but his last post was on September 5 in which he said: 'I'm still a terrorist.' A more prophetic Tweet came in April in which he said: 'May not find another chance to tweet but just remember what we said and what we stood for. God kept me alive to deliver the mssg 2 the umah'. Reports of Hammami's death crop up every few months in Somalia, only for him to resurface alive and well a short while later. But a U.S. terrorism expert who closely follows the inner workings of Somalia's al-Qaida-linked terror group says he thinks that the current reports of the death are accurate. 'I think it's very likely true based on the sources I am seeing,' said J.M. Berger, who runs the website Intelwire.com. Killed: Hammami, right, joined al-Shabab in 2006. He is pictured with deputy leader of al-Shabab. Sheik Mukhtar Abu Mansur Robow, left, in 2011 but he went on the run after falling out with the group . Militants did not immediately present proof of the death of Hammami, who grew up in Daphne, Alabama and was also known as Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki or 'the American'. A . member of al-Shabab who gave his name as Sheik Abu Mohammed told The . Associated Press that Hammami was killed in an ambush in Somalia's . southern Bay region. Mohammed said some of his associates carried out . the killing. 'There was a gun battle between . Amriki and his men and other fighters, the reports are that Amriki is . among those killed,' Moalim Ali, a resident in Bardhere, in southern . Somalia, told AFP. Two other extremists were also killed in the battle, including one other foreigner. The . U.S. put Hammami on its Most Wanted terrorist list in March and offered . a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. Hammami, one of the two most notorious Americans in overseas jihadi groups, grew up in Daphne, Alabama, a community of 20,000 outside Mobile. Family: Hammami was born to a Christian mother, Debra, and a Syrian-born Muslim father, Shafik. His sister Dena is pictured as a baby a few years before he was born . Growing up: Hammami, pictured getting his first birthday cake in 1985, was brought up as a southern Baptist . All-American: Hammami was brought up Christian but became conflicted about his religion in his teen years . He . is the son of a Christian mother and a Syrian-born Muslim father. He . attended university before quitting and moving to Toronto, where he . married and had a daughter. But . wanting to pursue his dream of becoming a jihadi, he moved to Somalia . and joined al-Shabab in about 2006. His wife did not agree with his . beliefs and they divorced. He once called himself 'a walking contradiction from massively different . backgrounds who is seriously passionate about what he believes in, but . feels he has to go about doing it while laughing at almost everything . along the way'. He fought alongside the group for years . while gaining fame for posting YouTube videos of jihadi rap songs in the . hope of attracting young American Muslims. He posted the English-spoken . songs even though music is forbidden in Al-Qaeda's strict . interpretation of Islam. Talented: Hammami, sitting far right, was extremely bright at school and entered the gifted program . Stand out: Hammami's friends said he seemed like a natural leader from a young age . Popular: Hammami was voted president of his Sophomore class and dated one of the most popular girls in school . Other videos showed him promoting the Shebab's battle to overthrow the internationally-backed government. But Hammami had a falling out with . al-Shabab and engaged in a long public fight with the group over the . last year amid signs of increasing tension between Somali and foreign . fighters in the group. He was a thorn in the group's side . after accusing its leaders of living extravagant lifestyles with the . taxes fighters collect from Somali residents. He . also complained that Somali militant leaders sidelined foreign . militants inside al-Shabab and were concerned only about fighting in . Somalia, not globally. Al . Shabab criticized Hammami publicly in an Internet statement last . December, saying his video releases were the result of personal . grievances that stem from a 'narcissistic pursuit of fame'. In April this year, Hammami shared a photograph showing him with a blood-covered neck and shirt . and claimed there had been an assassination attempt against him while . he sat in a tea shop. Wanted: He ascended the ranks of Somalia's al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab high enough to attract a $5 million U.S. government bounty. This FBI listing shows their description of Hammami . 'Just been shot in neck by shabab assassin. not critical yet,' Hammami tweeted in April. He had first expressed fear for his life in a . web video in March 2012 that publicized his rift with al-Shabab. He later wrote on Twitter that the leader of al-Shabab was sending in forces from multiple directions. 'We are few but we might get back up. abu zubayr has gone mad. he's starting a civil war,' Hammami posted. U.S. officials said that al-Shabaab, which has been in existence since 2006, counts several hundred foreign fighters among its ranks, including scores of Somali-Americans from Minnesota. In July, UN Monitoring Group reports . estimated al-Shebab has around 5,000 members and remain the 'principal . threat to peace and security to Somalia'. Younger years: Hammami seemed like the all-American teen in his native Daphne, Alabama . Omar Hammami was once a gifted student in . Daphne, Alabama and the president of his Sophomore class who was dated . the most sought-after girl in school. But within years, he was a key . figure in one of the world's most ruthless Islamist insurgencies. He . was brought up as a southern Baptist who went to Bible camp and his . mother was a typical Southern Belle who taught at an elementary school. His father came to America from Syria and became an engineer, though he was said to keep a strict household. Hammami's . upbringing was immersed in American culture yet still remained . culturally Muslim: Shoes were left at the door, Koranic inscriptions . decorated the walls, pork was forbidden. As . a teenager, his passions fluctuated between Shakespeare and Kurt . Cobain, soccer and Nintendo, friends have recalled. He had dreams of . being a surgeon. Friends in his class said he was a natural leader and saw him become more overt about Islam after his Syrian-born father returned to the religion. But . after returning from a trip to Damascus the summer before his sophomore . year, he said he was torn between Christianity and Islam. In . an online memoir he released last year, he explained that a religious awakening . in his teenage years led him to don a 'turban in the Bible Belt . post-9/11'. He attended the University of South Alabama, where he became president of the Muslim Students' Association. In 2002, his father asked him to leave home because of arguments over religion and he quit his university studies and moved to Toronto . to read 'blacklisted' Islamic books. He . was welcomed into Toronto’s Somali community after marrying a young . woman from it, but he decided to pursue his dream of becoming a jihadist . and moved to Egypt, where he met a fellow fundamentalist from America . who paved the road to Somalia for him. His wife and the mother of his daughter . refused to follow him and asked for a divorce and he eventually married a . Somali woman, with whom he had another daughter. As he trained, he caught the attention of his superiors with his computer knowledge, attention to detail and eloquent language skills. He quickly rose to power, eventually commanding troops, managing money and plotting strategy.","Reports: Omar Hammami was killed on Thursday in an ambush which was ordered by the leader of al-Shabab after he fell out with the group .

"Turning a corner: Oprah Winfrey said that she realized the content on OWN was too serious . Oprah Winfrey has admitted that her TV network failed when it launched because she put programs on air that were too serious. The chat show queen said that OWN needed more humor and that she was to blame for things being too 'stoic'. She also told New York magazine that when things were at their worst she got through it by saying to herself: 'Maybe I won't feel this bad forever'. Winfrey herself has admitted that OWN was not what she expected at its January 2011 debut and said in one interview that she might not have even bothered had she known how tough it would be. She nearly had a nervous breakdown and . worked cripplingly long days whilst at the same time wrapping up the . 25-year run of The Oprah Winfrey show. But things are finally turning a corner: In July OWN finally became profitable and the ratings are improving. For . August it drew a channel-high 536,000 prime-time viewers but that is . still a long way off rivals like Bravo which regularly gets 900,000 . viewers, or Lifetime which draws in one million. Reflecting . on those early mistakes, Winfrey told New York magazine: ‘I have a . tendency to look at everything from the point of view of: What is going . to be meaningful, and uplift people? 'That can become too stoic and too . serious - which is the same issue I suffered with at the magazine . (Oprah, her own magazine) in the beginning. It needed more humor. So we (began) looking for lighter fare.’ She added that the 'biggest mistake' was not involving TV network Discovery from an earlier stage. Instead she decided to 'set out on our own' which she found impossible to do because she did not have enough hours in the day. What's next? Winfrey said she is eying Broadway after her successful role in 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' with Forest Whitaker, pictured. Winfrey said that for her Broadway is a 'big wide-open door right now' Winfrey also found it heartbreaking to fire 150 members of staff, and personally cancel Rosie O'Donnell's nightly talk show, The Rosie Show, because of poor viewing figures. Winfrey said: 'I never imagined that, because I've done the opposite. I'm the person that's taken everybody on the world cruise with their families. I'm not the person who's laying people off.' Winfrey has taken time to adjust to having a smaller budget but has found enough money to keep Tyler Perry on the channel, and he has been a huge hit. Speaking to the magazine, she also revealed the bizarre moment she knew she had to leave the Oprah show and start the new project. 'I knew it was time to go when I sat in a pitch meeting for the Oprah show and somebody said, ""Maybe we could take you and an audience to outer space"",' she said. After the move to the network and with things settling down, she told New York magazine that she might consider doing more acting - or even Broadway. She said that after her well received role in The Butler she had been talking to Scott Sanders, the producer of the hit show The Colour Purple. She said Broadway is a 'big wide-open door right now'. Regrets: She said it was heartbreaking firing 150 people from the struggling network, including Rosie O'Donnell (pictured with Russell Brand) whose show on the network was cancelled . Her confidence is the first sign that Winfrey is feeling positive since OWN launched. After its blockbuster opening week which saw one million people tune in, ratings tumbled and sank to 300,000 in prime time and 150,000 in the day. Among those who jumped ship was chief executive Christina Norman and another senior boss. In an interview in August 2011 Oprah admitted OWN, which stands for the Oprah Winfrey Network, was ‘not where I want it to be’. She also begged audiences to wait before making their minds up and asked for a grace period - of three whole years. Since then a string of exclusives have followed including Lance Armstrong after he confessed to being a drug cheat, helping OWN to get back on its feet.","Oprah Winfrey admits OWN initially failed because it was too serious .

"Stepping out for the first time since Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro's suicide last week, victim Michelle Knight beamed broadly for the cameras as she attended at Cleveland Browns football game today. Attending the opening game of the NFL season with family and friends, Knight, 32, has so far declined to comment on the death of her captor one month into his 1,000-year prison sentence for holding her, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry as sex slaves for almost a decade. While Knight did not change that stance, her appearance at the game along with her family indicated her recovery is coming along, despite reports that all three girls have mixed feelings about Castro's death. Scroll down for videos . Stepping out for the first time since Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro's suicide last week, victim Michelle Knight beamed broadly for the cameras as she attended at Cleveland Browns football game today. Dead: Ariel Castro's body is set to be claimed by his family today after he hanged himself in his prison cell on Tuesday . The women have made a handful of public appearances since they were freed and Miss Knight spoke at Castro's sentencing last month. MailOnline revealed on Tuesday has Castro's . victims have mixed feelings about the suicide of the man they spent ten . years of their life with due to the warped bond they shared with him. Relatives . of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight said the girls are happy they can . finally put the traumatic episode beside them but also experienced some . confusion when they heard the news. Jackie Figaro Roman, an aunt of Gina DeJesus, told MailOnline that both girls were going through a ‘mixture of emotions’. She . said: ‘There’s so many mixed feelings about it. Gina is a little . confused. We are trying to protect her because we have to remember, she . was a 14-year-old girl (when she was kidnapped). 'But Gina and Michelle won’t have to think about him because he’s not around any more.’ Freed: Amanda Berry, left, Gina DeJesus, center, and Michelle Knight, . right, have all spoken out about recovering from their horrific ordeal . being kidnapped, raped and tortured by Castro. They have declined to comment on his suicide . She also revealed that Gina’s mother Nancy has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying Castro. 'Nancy probably feels bad for him. We . have a very strong, spiritual family and so does Ariel Castro. She . doesn’t care about him, she’s just happy her daughter is home. She . doesn’t feel any anger.' Amanda Berry - whose daughter is fathered by Castro - has also not commented on his death. Though . Castro serially abused the women physically, emotionally, and sexually . on a daily basis, they were also so badly manipulated they developed . 'Stockholm syndrome' - slowly 'bonding' with their captor in gratitude . for rare small favors he would grant them. His suicide will have come as a slap in . the face to his victims and their families, robbing them of . the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten-year . nightmare. Lonely death: This is an isolation cell at Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, like the one where Castro hanged himself on September 3 . Castro . was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection, where . he would be checked every 30 minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged . himself with a sheet during a break between inspections. Initially, . Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June . after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide . watch. An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging. Castro's attorneys tried . unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53-year-old . done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over to state . authorities following his conviction. A full investigation is underway as . to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of . prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them. While . his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client . would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term, . Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty issued a scathing . statement. 'These degenerate molesters are cowards. They con and capture vulnerable . children,' he said. 'This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of . what he had dished out for more than a decade. 'Let . this be a message to other child kidnappers: There will be a heavy . price to pay when you are caught. You won't enjoy the captive side of . the bars.' House of horrors: This is the four-bedroom home where Castro kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors . Restraints: A rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight shared . Basement: The pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured . As well as his four elder children, . Castro fathered a young girl to victim Amanda Berry. It is unclear if . the child knows her father is dead. Castro . was jailed after keeping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight . captive in unimaginable conditions in his house for ten years. When prison guards found Castro hanging in his 8x12 foot cell on Tuesday, they immediately began trying to resuscitate him. He . was taken to Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was . pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm. It . costs nearly $25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in . Ohio. The cost to house Castro, who was kept in high security, would . likely have been much higher. Castro's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am. A . spokeswoman for the the Ohio Department of Corrections said the agency . will make a full investigation of Castro's suicide to determine whether . regulations were followed and if anything could have been done to . prevent his death.

On the page, the imposter paid tribute to Walker, calling him her 'real life hero'. The teenager has not been seen since her terrible loss on Saturday. Walker, now 40, was raised a Mormon in a working class California family, but his good looks - he was once described as a ‘young Steve McQueen’ - meant he was never lacking female attention. He also strayed from the family values his parents instilled in him and when he was 18 faced a felony charge though he has never revealed what it was. The case was reduced to a misdemeanor.

"Ariel Castro taunted the mother of one of his victims by calling her up on the girl’s cell phone - and saying she was his ‘wife’ now. The Today Show aired FBI interview tapes from his first interrogation which reveal that the Cleveland kidnapper phoned Amanda Berry’s mom Louwana Miller - who died in 2006 of a broken heart - but hung up before she could ask any questions. Castro also revealed how he was once nearly caught by a girlfriend in 2002 at the start of his kidnapping when she saw a TV on upstairs in his House of Horrors in Ohio. Confession: Police released footage of their interrogation with Cleveland Kidnapper Ariel Castro today. Castro committed suicide earlier this week by hanging himself with a bed sheet in his prison cell . Breakdown: In the interrogation, Castro shows no remorse for his crimes but does start to cry a few times . Taunting: Castro says he called the mother of Amanda Berry to tell her that Amanda was now his 'wife' After claiming that his three victims were to blame for their own abduction he curses himself for ‘letting my guard down’ by leaving a bedroom door open which allowed them to escape. Castro, 53, hanged himself with a bed sheet on Tuesday night in his cell at the Corrections Reception Center in Orient, near Columbus. He had served just 33 days of a 1,000 year sentence for keeping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight captive for a decade. 'I let my guard down': Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry escaped Castro's imprisonment when he accidentally left a bedroom door unlocked this past May . The former school bus driver starved his victims and got Michelle pregnant at least five times weeks before punching her stomach until she miscarried. He also fathered a child with Amanda, a girl of six who has now lost her father, and brainwashed them by pretending to leave the house and battering them if they tried to escape. The interview took place soon after his arrest in May and lasts for four hours during which time he expresses no remorse but sometimes breaks down in tears. Wearing handcuffs and a long sleeved black top, he is questioned by two police agents who take notes throughout. Castro does not say exactly when he phoned Louwana but his recollection of the call is chilling. He says: ‘I think I said something...that I have her daughter and that she's okay and that she's my wife now - something like that, you know, probably not the exact words’. The call would have been before 2006 - he abducted Amanda in 2003 - because that year Louwana died at the age of 43. Strange: On the day he was sentenced, Castro gave an odd speech saying most of the sex he had with the three women was consensual . She had been in hospital for pancreatitis but relatives have said she never recovered from her daughter’s abduction. On the tapes Castro reveals how as the years went by his daughter born by Amanda asked him not to lock the doors in his house - something he did obsessively to keep them captive. There were however near misses, such as when he abducted Gina in April 2004. Castro says that there were surveillance cameras at her school that should have captured him 15 minutes before he grabbed her and that detectives ‘could have broke the case right then and there’. Another near miss happened in 2002 when he invited a girlfriend back to his house. By then he had abducted Michelle, his first victim. Castro says on the interrogation video that the girlfriend had ‘seen that I had a TV on in the upstairs room’. He said: ‘And she says: ‘What is that? You have a TV on up there?’ And my heart started beating, and I was like, ‘Okay, she's probably catching onto something.’ Almost caught: Castro says he was almost caught in 2002 when he brought a girlfriend over to the house and she noticed a TV on upstairs in a bedroom where Michelle Knight was locked. His house has since been demolished . Taste of his own medicine: Michelle got the opportunity to confront her captor in court on the day he was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison - saying his hell was just beginning . At the time of their disappearances Amanda was 16, Gina was 14 and Michelle was 21. They are now 27, 23 and 32 respectively. Their ordeal came to an end on May 6 when Miss Berry banged on the front door of their captivity house and a neighbor pulled it open. The police tapes reveal that Castro was angry at himself for allowing it to happen by accidentally leaving a bedroom door open. He tells investigators: ‘I know I let my guard down’. The police tapes include sections in which Castro talks about how he kidnapped his victims, but NBC has chosen not to air these out of respect for the girls. They have also not aired parts in which he says how they should not have got into his car and that what happened to them should be a lesson to other children. Whilst in jail Castro wrote a Father’s Day letter to his own children in which he says: ‘I still can’t believe what I did to put me in the situation that I’m in now’. In 2004 he also wrote a separate note in which he talked of committing suicide and says: ‘I want to put an end to my life and let the devil deal with me. 'Let the devil deal with me': According to notes found in Castro's home, he  had previously written about committing suicide. He followed through with that thought on Tuesday when he hanged himself in his prison cell . ‘I just want to crash through the window’. An investigation is now underway into how Castro was able to kill himself in prison. His lawyers have claimed the prison refused a suicide evaluation even though he was obviously disturbed.","New tapes of Cleveland Kidnapper Ariel Castro's police interrogation shed light on how he was able to keep three women captive for a decade .

Scroll down for videos . Dead: Ariel Castro's body is set to be claimed by his family today after he hanged himself in his prison cell on Tuesday . 'It is all going to be private, the service and the burial,' he added. Franklin County coroner Dr Jan Gorniak said that she did not know where the body was going after being released from the coroner's office. Pedro . Castro, the brother of Ariel who was briefly detained by police in May . but released and cleared of any wrongdoing in Ariel's crimes, said he . did not want to comment when reached by telephone on Thursday. 'Like any regular family they are mourning the loss of a loved one, even in light of his horrific crimes,' Weintraub said. Three women held captive for a decade by Castro are also declining to comment on his suicide. The Jones Day law firm said in a statement on Wednesday that neither the women - Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight - nor their attorneys would be granting interviews. Kathryn Joseph, an attorney representing victim Miss Knight, confirmed all three women were aware of the death. The women have made a handful of public appearances since they were freed and Miss Knight spoke at Castro's sentencing last month. MailOnline revealed on Tuesday has Castro's . victims have mixed feelings about the suicide of the man they spent ten . years of their life with due to the warped bond they shared with him. Freed: Amanda Berry, left, Gina DeJesus, center, and Michelle Knight, . right, have all spoken out about recovering from their horrific ordeal . being kidnapped, raped and tortured by Castro. They have declined to comment on his suicide . Relatives . of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight said the girls are happy they can . finally put the traumatic episode beside them but also experienced some . confusion when they heard the news. Jackie Figaro Roman, an aunt of Gina DeJesus, told MailOnline that both girls were going through a ‘mixture of emotions’. She . said: ‘There’s so many mixed feelings about it. Gina is a little . confused. We are trying to protect her because we have to remember, she . was a 14-year-old girl (when she was kidnapped). 'But Gina and Michelle won’t have to think about him because he’s not around any more.’ She also revealed that Gina’s mother Nancy has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying Castro. 'Nancy probably feels bad for him. We . have a very strong, spiritual family and so does Ariel Castro. She . doesn’t care about him, she’s just happy her daughter is home. She . doesn’t feel any anger.' Amanda Berry - whose daughter is fathered by Castro - has also not commented on his death. Though . Castro serially abused the women physically, emotionally, and sexually . on a daily basis, they were also so badly manipulated they developed . 'Stockholm syndrome' - slowly 'bonding' with their captor in gratitude . for rare small favors he would grant them. His suicide will have come as a slap in . the face to his victims and their families, robbing them of . the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten-year . nightmare. Lonely death: This is an isolation cell at Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, like the one where Castro hanged himself on September 3 . Castro . was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection, where . he would be checked every 30 minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged . himself with a sheet during a break between inspections. Initially, . Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June . after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide . watch. An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging. Castro's attorneys tried . unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53-year-old . done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over to state . authorities following his conviction. A full investigation is underway as . to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of . prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them. While . his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client . would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term, . Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty issued a scathing . statement. 'These degenerate molesters are cowards. They con and capture vulnerable . children,' he said. 'This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of . what he had dished out for more than a decade. 'Let . this be a message to other child kidnappers: There will be a heavy . price to pay when you are caught. You won't enjoy the captive side of . the bars.' House of horrors: This is the four-bedroom home where Castro kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors . Restraints: A rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight shared . Basement: The pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured . As well as his four elder children, . Castro fathered a young girl to victim Amanda Berry. It is unclear if . the child knows her father is dead.

When prison guards found Castro hanging in his 8x12 foot cell on Tuesday, they immediately began trying to resuscitate him. He . was taken to Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was . pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm. It . costs nearly $25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in . Ohio. The cost to house Castro, who was kept in high security, would . likely have been much higher. Castro's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am.

"Hundreds of thousands of pensioners will dip into their savings next year . More than 200,000 pensioners are likely cash in their entire retirement savings next year when new pension reforms are introduced, pollsters revealed last night. Research by Ipsos Mori for The Times has found that one in five OAPs will use part of the windfall to pay for a holiday. The study is the first detailed examination of Chancellor George Osborne’s reforms, in which those aged over 55 can dip into their retirement savings for the first time without having to pay punitive tax rates. Mr Osborne announced he was scrapping the current rules next April. When the measures were first announced in March, the Treasury did not give estimates as to how many would take advantage of the reforms or how their money would be spent. The 200,000 figure is calculated from the latest research, which suggests 12 per cent are planning to cash in their entire pension pot. And when pensioners spend their cash, it could mean a windfall of up to £1.6billion in tax for the Treasury, according to financial company Hargreaves Lansdown. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the broker, said this revealed many were significantly underestimating the amount of tax they would pay despite the reforms. A quarter of each lump sum taken out will be tax-free – with the remaining amount taxed at the marginal rate. The poll found the most popular choice (23 per cent) would be to save the money. But 21 per cent would choose to put it towards a holiday, 8 per cent said they would spend the cash on cars, and 12 per cent said some would go towards DIY. Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb has previously shot down the idea pensioners would blow their savings. Chancellor George Osborne announced he was scrapping the current pension rules next April . When Mr Osborne’s announcement was made, he said: ‘If people do get a Lamborghini and end up on the state pension, the state is much less concerned about that and that is their choice.’ Other popular choices were spending pension money on the family (14 per cent) and paying off debts (13 per cent). Meanwhile 16 per cent said they would reinvest in property – fuelling fears of another buy-to-let boom. Mr Osborne confirmed earlier this month that the changes would mean people could withdraw as little or as much as they wanted. He said: ‘People who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money, and that freedom is central to our long-term economic plan.’ Mr McPhail said: ‘Whilst we support the basic principles behind the Government’s reforms, the speed and complexity of these changes mean a lot of investors are going to be paying unnecessarily large amounts of tax. Of the hundreds of thousands of pensioners expected to dip into their savings, many say they plan to go on holiday (file image) 'The Chancellor has effectively engineered a tax windfall from unsuspecting pension investors.’ Some economists have warned allowing folk to withdraw cash from their pension pots rather than buying an annuity, providing an income for life, was risky. They argue that most people aged 60 or 65 underestimate their life expectancy and could overspend early in retirement. But Mr Osborne insists 13million savers in defined contribution pension schemes are ‘responsible people’ who had saved throughout their lives and quite capable of making decisions for themselves.","Research is first detailed look at effects of Chancellor's pension reforms .

"An adulterous husband who underwent an exorcism to save his marriage attacked his wife when she accused him of still being possessed by Satan. Anthony Berry 'snapped' after he was covered in holy water and threatened with a crucifix after he came home from a drinking session. A court heard the 52-year-old sweet factory worker had for years endured his wife Claire’s belief that he was possessed after he admitted an affair and she joined an ultra-conservative Catholic sect. But earlier this year Berry turned violent and grabbed his wife of 22 years by the neck. Scroll down for video . Anthony Berry 'snapped' after he was covered in holy water and threatened with a crucifix by his wife after he came home from a drinking session . High Peak Magistrates in Buxton, Derbyshire heard that his wife screamed at him: ‘You’re not Tony' He replied: ‘No, I’m Satan, Prince of Darkness.' Weeks later he lashed out again repeatedly punching her in the face in a 'brutal' assault that saw her flee their home. Berry was convicted of two separate assaults following a trial last month, but he has been spared an immediate jail term after magistrates accepted he’d suffered 'a degree of provocation'. The mother-of-two said the first attack took place at their home in New Mills, Derbyshire, on February 5 after Berry returned home from work just after 9.30pm. After hours of arguing about him being with another woman he grabbed his 54-year-old wife by the throat and threw her across the room. Prosecuting Jennifer Fitzgerald told High Peak Magistrates in Buxton, Derbys, Berry shouted: 'I’m going to kill you. I’m going to have your neck.' The was said to have continued for four hours. Berry, who admitted having drunk up to eight pints, admitted grabbing her on three more occasions. His wife then called for her sister who held rosary beads and threw holy water over Berry to subdue him while she thrust a crucifix in his face. The court heard the second attack took place the following month after he returned home at 1am. He had been drinking and playing snooker with his brother. She too had been drinking. Ms Fitzgerald said: 'An argument began. Mrs Berry holds some unusual beliefs. She believes he is possessed by demons and has a conviction that he may well be possessed by Satan himself.' He went to bed, but she followed him upstairs to continue the row. He grabbed her by the neck and threw her onto the bed then held her down and repeatedly punched her on the side of her head. A court heard the 52-year-old sweet factory worker had for years endured his wife Claire's belief that he was possessed after he admitted an affair and she joined an ultra-conservative Catholic sect . He grabbed and twisted her ankle and when she managed to free herself Berry threw her onto the floor. She said she was 'too afraid' to stay in the house and slept in the garden under some carpets. The next morning after he let her back into the house Mrs Berry telephoned her sister in Ireland who told her to call an ambulance which took her to hospital. She suffered a swelling to the side of her face, bruising to her arms and legs, and damaged her back which caused her 'excruciating pain' for some time after and had to walk on crutches. When questioned the battered wife told police she believed her husband’s violent behaviour was because he was Satan. She said that in the past she had arranged for her husband to see an exorcist in France because 'he had signed a pact with the devil'. At his trial Mrs Berry claimed her husband had been 'possessed' for more than two years. But under cross-examination she admitted his comments about Satan could have been 'ironical'. Yesterday Ms Fitzgerald told the court Berry had received a caution for assaulting his wife in November 2010, but despite the latest violence she was still unsure if she wanted to save the marriage. John Bunting, defending, told the court that to some degree Berry acted in self-defence after his wife had started the arguments. Not for the first time she brought up the affair her husband had back in 2011 and both had been drinking. He spoke of the 'extraordinary provocation' his client, who up until recent events had no criminal record, had suffered over a number of years related to his wife’s 'unusual religious beliefs'. Mr Bunting said the victim had acknowledged 'holding a crucifix in his face' and 'throwing holy water on him' during the first assault. His wife claimed a blurred 'selfie' Berry had taken on a camera was photographic proof that he was possessed. She also claims he attracts evil spirits into the house and has seen a small dragon flying across the house when he’s there. 'Can you imagine living with someone who says you are possessed by Satan?' asked Mr Bunting. 'He even agreed to see an exorcist in France. This is not unusual behaviour, it’s extraordinary.' But Chairman of the bench Bob Graham told Berry: 'Both of these assaults were prolonged and quite brutal and I have to say nasty. Drink was also involved and you also issued threats to kill. 'But we have taken into account there was a degree of provocation.' Magistrates sentenced Berry to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. They also ordered him to pay £620 costs and £80 victim surcharge. Outside court Berry, who was raised in the Church of England, said he was 'sorry' for the violence and injuries inflicted on his wife, but said he had 'snapped'. He said he had agreed to the exorcism last year in a bid to 'keep the peace' and save his marriage. 'But it has had it now,' he added.

Attendees said he told the audience that the Conservatives would be the first political party to have a British Asian Prime Minister, before quipping ‘but not immediately’. At the event, Mr Cameron also launched the new Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, an 11-volume project about the religion involving 1000 contributors. For Hindus, Diwali is one of the most important events in the year, with fireworks and lamps used to create a riot of colour to celebrate the victory of good over evil, sweets are traded and new clothes bought. Lamps are lit and kept on during the night and families come together to carry out traditional tasks such as cleaning the house to honour the goddess Lakshmi.

"She has no doubt already gone up a few dress sizes. But that’s not the only change pregnant Martine McCutcheon, 38, has gone through as she waits to give birth to her baby next year. Yesterday, the actress revealed she can no longer stand the smell and taste of meat now she’s pregnant - and is instead going vegetarian. Scroll down for video . The McCutcheon family are looking forward to the new edition on St Valentine's Day 2015 . Tweeting to her 85,000 followers, she said: ‘Morning folks! How are we all today? I’m going to meet my friend for brunch/lunch - I fancy a veggie fry up! #goneoffmeat #pregnant’ Her sudden distaste for sausages and bacon is not uncommon for a mother-to-be, according to experts. Many find their senses dramatically change as their body accounts for another person inside. Pregnancy expert Clare Byam-Cook said: ‘As soon as you get pregnant, your senses are hugely heightened. It’s totally normal to be repulsed by smells that you previously enjoyed and to crave things that you never ever thought of craving. It’s just the way the body works.’ McCutcheon has talked about her cravings for certain foods over the past month on Twitter, including ‘garlic bread and lots of butter’ The former midwife added: ‘It normally kicks in almost as soon as you get pregnant – that’s how a lot of people know they’re pregnant – and it usually remains throughout your pregnancy. Only for it to disappear the second you have the baby.’ The change in diet will only be a minor sacrifice though for the former EastEnders star, who recently said she had longed for nothing more than to start a family with her husband, musician Jay McManus, 30. She admitted she had almost resigned herself to being childless – until she finally became pregnant in May. Last month, she told a magazine: ‘We’d always said that if we were fortunate to be blessed with a child, that would be wonderful, but we were very aware that it’s not a given. McCutcheon had longed for nothing more than to start a family with her husband, musician Jay McManus, 30 . ‘As a woman in her late 30s who’s experienced health problems, I thought I might have to accept that it wasn’t a path my life was going to take, but it would have been a great sadness in our lives if that had been the case.’ McCutcheon has talked about her cravings for certain foods over the past month on Twitter, including ‘garlic bread and lots of butter’ The baby - due on St Valentine’s Day next year - is welcome news after McCutcheon’s seven year fight against chronic fatigue syndrome and depression. She did not appear in any film or television productions from Echo Beach in 2008 to Let’s Get Gold in 2012 – leading to her being declared bankrupt last year – after her poor health became so severe that she was unable to work. She said: ‘It was a terrible time in our lives but you discover who your friends are and we found amazing support from people who really came through for us. ‘It’s like finally the tides have turned. Great things are starting to happen on the work front, but more than anything, expecting our baby boy has given us clarity about what matters.’ The NHS advises mums-to-be to avoid rare meat and to be cautious with cold cured meats, though pre-packed meat is safe to eat. It adds that most fish is particularly good for the health of the unborn baby. However, the health body also warns that pregnant mothers should avoid liver because it contains a lot of vitamin A, which can harm the baby. The strong smell of coffee is one of the most common foodstuffs for pregnant mothers to go off, according to Mrs Byam-Cook. But mums-to-be can also crave bizarre flavours – such as charcoal or grass – because their bodies are low in certain vitamins and minerals.","McCutcheon, 38, has become a vegetarian while pregnant .

"Myles Bradbury, pictured, admitted sexually abusing 18 desperately ill boys under his care . Hundreds of child cancer patients may have been molested by a paedophile doctor facing jail last night. Myles Bradbury, 41, yesterday admitted sexually abusing 18 desperately ill boys under his care at a specialist unit. But 800 more families have been told their children could have been at risk during the five years he worked for Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. The shocking total includes patients he saw at two other hospitals – in Colchester and Ipswich – where he held outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2013. Police found more than 16,000 indecent images of children on a disc in Bradbury’s home. In one case he filmed the vile abuse. Addenbrooke’s has now launched a helpline and is contacting the families of all patients he is thought to have dealt with. A mother whose child was treated by Bradbury said last night she was tormented by the idea that he may have been abused. Claire Yeoman’s son Declan was seen by the consultant for leukaemia before his death in November 2012 aged three. ‘It made me feel physically ill,’ said the 39-year-old from Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. ‘You think: Was your child involved? Could you have noticed anything? Was there anything you missed? ‘You go through every single day of his treatment and basically relive the whole memory of 18 months.’ As Bradbury was warned by a judge he faces a long jail term, it also emerged that: . Police believe Bradbury targeted the boys – all of whom were ‘really poorly’ and vulnerable – in his private consulting room. He would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed, before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a ‘legitimate examination’. As he left court, Bradbury said: ‘I’m so sorry’ and refused to answer further questions. Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: ‘This man very cleverly and determinedly created an environment where he not only abused young people, but almost groomed colleagues and parents by being helpful – for example, seeing people outside normal consultancy hours. Up to 800 more families have been told their children could have been at risk during the five years Myles Bradbury worked for Addenbrooke’s Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge . ‘He would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them. ‘What makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination. I wasn’t a case of “Don’t tell your parents”. He was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination.’ Mr Ridgway said there could be many other victims – including some who don’t even realise they were abused. ‘He had extensive experience in the health world at a number of institutions and we are working with them to make sure examinations he conducted were appropriate,’ he added. Has a member of your family been treated by Dr Myles Bradbury? Please contact the Daily Mail via doctor@dailymail.co.uk . Bradbury, from Herringswell, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, and who has separated from his wife, was suspended from Addenbrooke’s last November after a victim’s parents raised concerns with staff. He was arrested the following month and other families whose children had been abused came forward. The offences he admitted yesterday were carried out on 18 boys aged eight to 17 between 2009 and 2013. Dr Keith McNeil, chief executive of Addenbrooke’s, said: ‘Our most abject and sincere apologies go out to any and all of our patients and their families who are affected by this in any way. ‘I am so deeply sorry these incidents have happened and I am also deeply saddened, as a doctor, that one of my own profession has placed himself and his patients in this position. ‘There is a very ancient and sacred trust that exists between a doctor and his patients and, quite frankly, it sickens me to think that trust has been breached.’ Chief nurse Ann-Marie Ingle said: ‘His cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all, including staff who worked alongside him to care for these vulnerable and sick children. Claire Yeoman is among the many parents who are terrified that their children may have been abused by Myles Bradbury. Her son Declan was treated by the disgraced doctor from May 2011, when he was diagnosed with leukaemia, until his death in November 2012, when he was three. Miss Yeoman, 39, from Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, knew nothing about the police investigation until Addenbrooke’s Hospital contacted her days before his first court appearance. Claire Yeoman's son Declan, pictured, was treated by Myles Bradbury from May 2011, when he was diagnosed with leukaemia until his death in November 2012, when he was three . Declan did not feature in the investigation or prosecution in the end, but Miss Yeoman said last night: ‘I would see Myles on a regular basis, almost every day. He had almost become part of the family. ‘We had every bit of trust in him. Myles, we thought, was a good doctor. But he had a very dark secret he was hiding from the parents. ‘I think that makes it even harder to swallow – the fact he was hiding it from all of us who trusted him.’ The parents of one of the doctor’s alleged victims, who has leukaemia, told the Daily Mail they felt ‘betrayed and numb’. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘I’m kicking myself because I never thought to say why is there no one else in the room? But we never queried it because of his position.’ ‘As soon as we were alerted, we took immediate action to suspend him from clinical practice.’ Bradbury admitted 25 offences against 18 victims and pleaded guilty to making the 16,000 indecent images. He was released on bail and will be sentenced at a later date. Bradbury has been suspended by the General Medical Council and will face a fitness to practise hearing at which he is expected to be struck off. The consultant specialised in treating childhood cancers of the blood including leukaemia and lymphoma as well as rare blood disorders. Patients were referred to him from across East Anglia. Before taking up this post he spent four years working his way up from a middle ranking doctor to consultant at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, from 2004 to 2007. He has helped train young doctors as well.","Dr Myles Bradbury admits abusing 18 desperately ill boys under his care .

"Suspected IRA terrorists will today be warned that controversial letters giving them immunity from criminal prosecution are no longer valid. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers is due to announce that assurances in so-called ‘comfort letters’ sent to those suspected of offences before the Good Friday Agreement of 1988 are being withdrawn . Some 200 suspects had previously been told they were unlikely to face prosecution unless new evidence against them came to light. John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA’s Hyde Park bombing in 1982, walked free from court after the existence of a so-called 'comfort letter' emerged this year . Downey was accused of involvement in 1982 bombing, which killed four soldiers and seven horses . But it is understood that new letters are being sent out explaining that police will now mount a prosecution if it is felt there is enough evidence to do so. In July, a review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police discovered two other cases where similar errors were apparently made. Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run. Critics claimed they amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA’s Hyde Park bombing in 1982. David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers is due to announce that assurances in so-called ‘comfort letters’ are being withdrawn . Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court. The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year. Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters. Now the Historical Enquiries branch of the Police Service of Northern Ireland will conduct a review of all the cases as part of the process of issuing of the letters. The letters had been introduced to deal with on-the-run suspects who had not been imprisoned for terrorist offences and released as part of the Good Friday Agreement. But the secret process only came to light earlier this year when it was revealed the suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downey had been sent one of the letters. A review by senior judge Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way ‘comfort letters’ were sent out . The 62-year-old from Donegal was arrested at Gatwick airport in May last year, charged with murdering four British soldiers in the 1982 bombing. But the case was thrown out in February because he had received one of the letters by mistake. Mrs Villiers will appear before the Commons Northern Ireland Committee today and it is understood she will explain that the original letters never meant the suspects would be exempt from prosecution. A government source told the Telegraph: ‘What the Government is determined to do is make sure that nobody in receipt of one of the original letters should be in any doubt that they cannot rely on those letters to protect them from prosecution should new evidence emerge or a reassessment of existing evidence leads the PSNI and prosecuting authorities to a different conclusion from their original one.’","Suspects  told they were unlikely to face court after Good Friday Agreement .

"‘Serious flaw’: According to experts at the Centre for Policy Studies the national accounts will leave the Government short of funds to pay pensioners (picture posed by model) State pensions handed out to future generations will be ‘derisory’, with cash reserves set to run out as soon as next year, a report has warned. A ‘serious flaw’ in the national accounts will leave the Government short of funds to pay pensioners within the next year, according to the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank. As a result, the Treasury will soon be forced to raid income tax receipts in order to keep up the payments, it said. An academic at the CPS warned that the research shows the current level of state pension is ‘unsustainable’. Michael Johnson called for urgent government action to prevent pensions being ‘watered down to a basic subsistence’. He said the research suggested that the millions of taxpayers who are currently aged under 45 would face sharp tax increases and would have to wait longer to receive their state retirement income. Those aged under 35 should prepare for state pensions to be scrapped altogether by the time they retire, he claimed. An ageing population will see the state pension bill quadruple to £420billion over the next 60 years, official figures released this week show. Mr Johnson told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It doesn’t matter which government is elected next year, the state pension age will have to go up much faster and sooner than anyone expects to cover the funding deficit. For Generation Y, aged between 25 and 34, the message from the Government ought to be that the state pension is not viable full stop. But of course, no politician can say this publicly.’ Last night, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘Older people have worked hard and paid into the system all their lives. That is why our reforms are securing the long-term future of the state pension – so it remains strong and keeps pace with increasing life expectancy.’ Mr Johnson said he had shown the figures to senior Westminster sources, who had admitted privately that pension funding was in a perilous state. Funds for the old-age payments – worth a basic £113.10 a week to each pensioner – come from national insurance contributions paid by people working today. But the report warns that the money in the National Insurance Fund is quickly running out because not enough is coming in – with the surplus falling from £53billion in 2009 to only £29.1billion last year. If that figure fell to zero, the Treasury would have to resort to taking money from general income tax, Mr Johnson claimed. The UK’s ageing population is likely to have a dramatic effect on public services, with 65 per cent of the DWP’s spending on benefit currently going to elderly people. There are ten million people in the UK aged over 65. The latest estimates suggest this will rise by 5.5million in 20 years and will nearly double to around 19million by 2050. Bleak Future: Michael Johnson, an academic at the CPS, said those aged under 35 should prepare for state pensions to be scrapped altogether by the time they retire (picture posed by model) Although the retirement age is set to rise, easing the burden on the state pension fund, the number of older people is outpacing the changes. There are three million people aged over 80 – and this is set to almost double by 2030 and reach eight million by 2050. The taxman faces fresh embarrassment after it emerged thousands more workers had been sent incorrect tax statements. The blunder comes as HM Revenue and Customs is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from bank accounts. Every year, five million workers pay too much or too little via the Pay As You Earn system and receive a new statement telling them how to pay or reclaim their cash. Now HMRC has admitted ‘thousands’ of these were miscalculated in 2013-14. HMRC advised employees to tell anyone who questioned their bills ‘not to repay any underpayment’ – and not to cash any cheques until the error was fixed. The miscalculations are said to have been caused by incomplete information from employers – something the Government had hoped to limit through its £270million ‘Real Time Information’ programme, in which employers must report amounts paid to staff on a weekly or monthly basis. While HMRC did not yet know how many people had been affected, it would be fewer than 100,000, a spokesman said.

"Asking prices for houses have dropped steeply this August as the property market has its 'summer sale'. Lower demand caused by the holiday season has seen the price tag for an average British property fall this month by 2.9 per cent to £262,401. The dip was particularly noticeable in London, where the average asking price was 5.9 per cent lower at £552,783 than in July. Property website Rightmove said it was the largest drop in asking prices for the month of August in more than a decade. House prices have dropped steeply this August as the property market has its 'summer sale'. Pictured here, a couple looking in estate agents window in Bath, Somerset . Company director Miles Shipside said the figures reflect sellers adopting a 'summer sales attitude to pricing', in the knowledge that potential buyers tend to be thinner on the ground during the holiday season, before activity lifts again in the autumn. Despite the drop, asking prices in the capital are still 10.3 per cent higher than they were a year ago. The North was the only region to see asking prices increase month-on-month, with a 0.5 per cent uplift pushing them to £149,354 typically. In Wales, prices edged down by 2.0 per cent month-on-month to reach £173,176 on average. Alongside these seasonal factors, Rightmove also said that recent speculation about the prospect of interest rates rising, more properties coming up for sale and toughened mortgage lending rules are likely to be having an impact on the market. At the end of April, new rules came into force under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) which mean lenders have to ask mortgage applicants more detailed questions to check whether they can afford their home loan. Mr Shipside said: 'New seller asking prices are good lead indicators of the current mood of the market, and those who have put their property up for sale in the last month are obviously aware that potential buyers are thinner on the ground at this time of year and need to be tempted to act by cheaper prices. Despite the drop, asking prices in the capital are still 10.3% higher than they were a year ago . 'A drop in August is typical but it's steeper than expected this year for two reasons. Firstly, both buyers and sellers are becoming increasingly aware about personal finances, given that the cost of mortgages are going up and regulators are trying to bring availability down. 'This limits what buyers are willing or able to pay, and helps moderate sellers' price expectations. 'The second factor is the turnaround in London. Having forced national average prices up for the last two years, it's now pushing them down with three falls in a row, and a real biggie this month. 'Holidays always cause a big price reverse in the capital, but there is also a massive year-on-year jump in the number of newly-marketed properties, up 20 per cent compared to August last year, and double the figure seen in any other region. More sellers and fewer buyers mean price falls.' London-based estate agent Simon Gerrard, who is president of the National Association of Estate Agents, said: 'Comments from the Bank of England mean that potential buyers are concerned about the rise in interest rates and don't want to find themselves in a position where they are hamstrung by rates going up.' He said the MMR rules also mean mortgage applications are taking longer to process. Mr Gerrard said: 'In London where prices are much higher than the national average anyway, we are beginning to see the impact of these factors.'","Dip particularly noticeable in London, where price was 5.9 per cent lower .

"Facelifts for bulldogs and pugs have surged, it was reported last night. The Royal Veterinary College has revealed the number of operations on dogs to remove excess skin has risen by more than 80 per cent in the past four years. Without facelifts, some pets can be at risk of going blind or dying because their airways are blocked - but the surgery can set owners back up to £2,000. The Royal Veterinary College has said facelifts for bulldogs and pugs have surged (file picture shows a pug) It was reported last night that the rise in celebrity ownership of the animals was behind the rise in the number of operations. The number of procedures has increased from an average of 30 five years ago to more than 260 a year, according to Dr Gert ter Haar, senior lecturer at the Royal Veterinary College. Celebrity owners such as Jonathan Ross, Kelly Brook, and Kelly Osborne have fuelled the rise in popularity of owning pedigree pooches. Dr Haar told The Daily Telegraph: 'We are treating a lot of pugs but it is because they are very popular due to celebrities. 'People like the way they look. We are treating eight times more pugs than we were five years ago.' 'People have been breeding dogs for centuries and they are doing nothing wrong – this is about education.' Pugs Lillifee (right) and Knoedel look at each other at a beer garden in Munich, Germany (file picture) Without facelifts, some pets can be at risk of going blind or dying because their airways are blocked (file picture shows a bulldog) Dr Haar said he handles four to five of pet facelifts every week – but only do so if there is a medical reason. He said: 'Breeding has led to shortening of muscles in their faces. Most are fine, but we see the ones that have problems because of their breeding.' Senior vet Paul Manktelow at the PDSA animal charity said that the operation was 'in no way a vanity or cosmetic exercise', despite being referred to as a facelift. He added that it was an important veterinary procedure carried out purely for dogs health and well-being. Chantelle Meloy's dog Bentley, a Shar Pei, had to undergo a facelift at a clinic in London because the huge folds were covering its eyes, she told the BBC Two programme Young Vets. Shar Peis, also known as the Chinese wrinkle dog, can be traced back to the Guangdong province of China.","Royal Veterinary College says doggy facelifts have soared .

"Victim: Volunteer William Pooley is believed to have contracted virus from one-year-old boy . The British nurse infected with Ebola may have caught the deadly virus after playing with a one-year-old boy whose mother had died from the disease. William Pooley, the first Briton to contract the virus, had spent his free time keeping little Sellu Borbor occupied at the remote treatment centre in Sierra Leone where he was a volunteer after the toddler had initially tested negative. But a colleague said the boy had in fact caught the virus from his mother’s breast milk and died last Sunday – the same day that the 29-year-old Briton was diagnosed. Mr Pooley was flown back from Sierra Leone at the weekend and is receiving the experimental drug ZMapp in a London hospital. Last night, a leading health official warned that the outbreak sweeping West Africa would get worse after it was reported that a third top doctor in Sierra Leone had died from ebola. Close to 1,500 people have so far died across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago. During his time at the clinic in eastern Sierra Leone, Mr Pooley developed a bond with Sellu, according to his supervisor Finda Josephine Sellu. Like other health workers, Mr Pooley initially took precautions handling the infant since the boy’s mother was diagnosed with the virus and later died. But he played with him freely after the baby tested negative for the disease, she said. ‘Pooley and some other nurses fell in love with the boy and would play with him in their free time,’ she said. Sellu was tested again after he developed a fever and tested positive for ebola the second time around. He died on August 24. It is not clear why the initial test result came out negative, although experts say the virus can sometimes go undetected and they recommend several tests. Another nurse known to have played with the boy has also tested positive for the disease. The Kenema clinic where Mr Pooley worked is known to be understaffed and several staff there have succumbed to the illness. A government official announced yesterday that another doctor, Sahr Rogers, who was working alongside Mr Pooley, had contracted ebola and died. Last night, a spokesman for the Royal Free Hospital in London said the Briton’s condition had not changed since Tuesday, when doctors said he was in ‘good spirits’ and was sitting up and talking in his isolation chamber.

Despite the situation in Sierra Leone, the outbreak is worse in Liberia, which has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths. After visiting the country, Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said the situation was dire. He said treatment centres were struggling to deal with the influx of patients and added: ‘I wish I didn’t have to say this, but it is going get worse before it gets better.’ France is recommending that its citizens leave Sierra Leone and Liberia following the ebola outbreak, while Air France has temporarily suspended flights to Sierra Leone at the request of its government. It will maintain flights to Conakry in Guinea, with measures in place to guarantee that no passengers ‘presenting symptoms’ can board. The United Nations says the lack of flights to the affected area is making it increasingly difficult to bring in much-needed supplies.","William Pooley was first Briton to contract the virus and flown back to UK .

"Lidl has come under fire for offering a ‘ten-minute free stay’ parking policy which fines visitors £90 if they stay a second over the limit. A branch of the budget supermarket in Kent has installed the system in its camera-controlled car park to sting those who do not buy anything at the store. Signs, under control of firm Athena ANPR, warn that by entering the ‘private land’ drivers automatically agree to a contract, meaning they must pay the fine if they overrun – or face debt collectors and even court action. Lidl has come under fire for offering a ‘ten-minute free stay’ parking policy which fines visitors £90 if they stay a second over the limit (file picture of a Lidl supermarket) Those who do not make a purchase get hit with a £90 fine if they stay longer than ten minutes. The timing starts from the moment they enter the car park to the second they leave. It means they are expected to park, read the sign, get a trolley, go into the shop and exit all within the ten-minute limit. Customers are expected to finish in just 60 minutes or face a £90 fine. The recently refurbished Lidl, in Ashford, put up the signs earlier this month but the scheme only went live last weekend. Local resident Deidre Mewse, 51, called the new system ‘extortionate’. ‘The camera takes the time from entering the car park, so if you’re disabled and in a wheelchair, you would almost certainly fall foul of this,’ she said. ‘Also even if you were a customer, it would mean significantly less time than an hour to do your shopping, as you need time to pack the car, return the coin-operated trolley, get to your car and exit the car park.’ Lidl, which employs Athena ANPR to manage all its UK car parks, defended the system which it said ‘ensures that spaces are available for Lidl customers to use’ in ‘exceptionally busy’ locations. A spokesman at the store said ‘previous misuse of the car park’ had meant customers not always being able to park, adding: ‘The vast majority of our customers are pleased with the implementation of these systems as … they are now able to access parking spaces when carrying out their shopping.’ AA president Edmund King has denounced the ‘cowboy tactics, scaremongering and bullying’ used by many private parking firms. ‘Often motorists know that they are in the right but when they get a letter that looks like an official fixed penalty notice, followed by a letter that looks like an official bailiff’s letter, they pay up because they are scared,’ he said. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘Private parking companies … making an industry of penalising people without good reason or for their simple human mistakes. ‘Big brands don’t seem to appreciate how this new industry operates or the sense of anger and injustice that it produces in its victims and who are also their own customers.’","Branch of Lidl in Ashford, Kent offers a 'ten-minute free stay' parking policy .

"Girls in England are among the unhappiest in the world, a charity report has revealed. Despite having some of the highest living standards in the world, they are less satisfied with life than youngsters in developing countries such as Algeria, Brazil and South Africa, it found. The main concern was body image, with one in five pre-adolescent English girls beset with anxiety about their appearance. English girls are among unhappiest in the world according to report by The Good Childhood (picture by model) Children from Romania, Spain and Israel were the most content. The Good Childhood report, published today by the Children’s Society, analysed responses to questions about happiness and stress from an ongoing study involving 16,000 children aged ten to 13 across 11 countries in five continents. England ranked ninth on the international league table – with only South Korea and Uganda scoring lower. The top concern for children in England was their image, with only higher levels recorded in South Korea. Girls were found to be twice as likely to be worried about their appearance than boys in England. Only nine per cent of ten- to 13-year-old boys were worried about how they looked, compared with 18 per cent of girls. ‘People are judged on looks. Sometimes you feel like you can’t enjoy yourself unless you are pretty,’ researchers recorded one 12-year-old saying. Youngsters in developing countries such as Algeria, Brazil (pictured) and South Africa were happier in life . English youngsters were at their unhappiest during their teenage years, the report found. Only four per cent of eight-year-olds reported low life satisfaction, but this rose to 14 per cent for 15-year-olds. The main concern was body image, with one in five pre- adolescent English girls beset with anxiety about their appearance . While it found English children were less anxious about housing, money, and friendship than their counterparts in other countries, they were more likely to be anxious about their future and appearance. The Children’s Society chief executive Matthew Reed said: ‘Childhood is a happy time for the vast majority of this country. But we can’t shut our eyes and ears to the half a million children who say they are unhappy.’ The report is the first analysis of findings from the Children’s Worlds Survey. The global cross-section ranked the countries in the following order in terms of well-being: Romania, Spain, Israel, Brazil, US, Algeria, South Africa, Chile, England, South Korea, and Uganda. The report, titled Good Childhood, also found that English children came 30th out of 19 countries in Europe and North America in terms of their ‘subjective well-being’, which was determined by how they rated their own happiness and life satisfaction. In the UK, Northern Irish children emerged as the happiest with just 6.9 per cent having low life satisfaction – in contrast to 10.1 per cent of children in England, 9.2 per cent in Scotland and 8.8 per cent in Wales. Mr Reed said: ‘That is a statistic none of us can afford to ignore. ‘In a period where austerity measures are disproportionately affecting low-income families, it is critical to keep focused on how young people are faring.’","English girls less satisfied in life than youngsters in developing countries .

"White working-class pupils need the same English language support as foreign classmates, a study suggests (stock pic) White working-class pupils should be given the same English language support as foreign classmates to stop them falling behind, according to a report. It found some working-class pupils cannot even recognise their own name when they start school – and there is not enough money to help them. It comes a week after a government report found white working-class pupils had the worst exam results of any ethnic group. The study, in the South London borough of Lambeth, found those children from ethnic minorities with English as a second language were articulate by the time they reached year six because of the level of support they had. They are also given a thorough induction to help with their English skills when they first arrive. White working-class pupils, on the other hand, who had language skills so bad they struggle to communicate with their peers had a severe lack of support. The report also found that social deprivation and the low aspirations of parents have fuelled low achievement among white, working-class pupils in England. The paper, which is being presented at a conference at London University’s Institute for Education today, concludes: ‘Members of staff felt school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white working-class community.’ One co-ordinator told researchers that pupils who had English as an additional language could recognise the difference between ‘bigger’ and ‘biggest’ – but ‘the white children did not have the vocabulary’. The authors, Dr Feyisa Demie, of Lambeth Council, and Dr Kirstin Lewis, from Goldsmith’s College, warn that the failure of government statistics to distinguish the white British ethnic group by social background has also masked  the problem. The study, drawing on statistical analysis, evidence from parents, focus groups and schools, confirms that one of the biggest groups of underachievers is the white working class and their performance, at both Key Stage two and Key Stage four, are considerably below those of all other major ethnic groups at national level. The study in the South London borough of Lambeth found children from . ethnic minorities with English as a second language were articulate by . the time they reached year six because of the level of support they had (stock pic) The national data shows that 32 per cent . of White British pupils eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) achieved . 5+A*- C grades at GCSE, compared with 65 per cent who are not eligible . for FSM. The gap is 33% compared to smaller gaps for all other ethnic . groups. The report also found that social deprivation and the low aspirations of parents have fuelled low achievement among white, working-class pupils in England. It found that the low achievement of many white working-class pupils has been obscured by middle-class success in the English school system.","Study found pupils with English as second language were articulate by year six .

"Fresh potatoes have suffered a slump in popularity - because people prefer rice. Sales fell by more than eight per cent over the past year – and they are now facing a 'fight for relevance' in Britain, according to the Potato Council. The disappointing performance mirrors the overall decline in sales of fruit and vegetables across the country, with Britons buying 130,000 tonnes less of fruit and veg in 2013. Fresh potatoes are facing a 'fight for relevance' in Britain, according to the Potato Council . Caroline Evans, of the Potato Council, blamed the poor sales of spuds on the national drive to reduce food waste and the growing popularity of curry and fajitas. She told the Grocer magazine: 'It's good that people are not actively rejecting the category. People still like potatoes, but the challenge is that we need different approaches for the whole supply chain. 'Shoppers need distractions and better signposting. A lot of shoppers make an emotional connection when they see a potato in its prepared form, rather than as a raw vegetable.' As well as switching to other staples, shoppers are also opting for smaller retail packs and salad potatoes. Britons are buying 130,000 tonnes less of fruit and veg in 2013, research has found . Data from Kantar Worldpanel revealed the volume of fresh potatoes sold had fallen by eight per cent over the year to May. Despite seeing a recovery in 2013, sales of fresh organic potatoes declined again and in the last quarter reached their lowest volume recorded since 2010. Fresh spuds account for £1.4billion of annual potato sales, which are worth £2.3billion a year. Earlier this month, potato growers in Jersey were reportedly struggling to shift a bumper crop of spuds. A combination of rain, sun and mild temperatures created perfect growing conditions - but many were too large as a result. It was claimed Supermarkets were refusing to buy the potatoes - which were twice as big as the ideal size between 2.5cm to 5cm - leaving farmers having to either give tons of cast-offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields.","Fresh potatoes are facing a 'fight for relevance' in Britain .

"So far, 103 victims have come forward to describe the abuse they suffered at Jimmy Savile’s hands while in the care of the National Health Service. Below are the stories of just four of the vulnerable people he targeted. One victim said nurses laughed when she told them she had been sexually assaulted by Savile in a hospital basement. So far, 103 victims have come forward to describe the abuse they suffered at Jimmy Savile¿s hands while in the care of the National Health Service . The woman, who was then a 16-year-old patient at Leeds General Infirmary, said Savile made her feel like the ‘chosen one’, taking her to the local shop and buying her sweets and magazines. But she claimed that later, a hospital porter led her to an area where Savile was waiting behind a closed door. ‘He pulled me in immediately and started to kiss me with his tongue,’ she told the BBC. One victim said nurses laughed when she told them she had been sexually assaulted by Savile in a hospital basement . ‘At the same time his left hand went on to my right thigh under my dress. ‘There wasn’t time to draw breath, there wasn’t time to analyse even what’s happening here because it was seamless. . . And then he said you’ve got to go.’ The assault lasted no more than five or six minutes, she said. The incident made her feel ‘dirty and ridiculously stupid’, but when she tried to tell nurses they started laughing, making her feel she couldn’t finish. Only her mother took her claims seriously. But, she added, ‘everybody knew’ what was going on – yet staff, porters and patients at the hospital all accepted it. The victim said that when she discovered the full extent of Savile’s abuse, she wished she had reported the harrowing encounter to police. A Broadmoor patient revealed how Savile repeatedly targeted his victims at the psychiatric hospital in the 1990s. Staff often allowed him to sit unaccompanied in the day room, she said. On one occasion, while talking to her with his back to other patients, he put his hand on her leg and sexually assaulted her, speaking all the time. She said she froze and felt guilty – but a member of staff later insisted she must have imagined the abuse. Savile was able to assault her in the . same way several times over a number of weeks. The cycle caused her . ‘significant distress’, she told investigators. Savile had a long association with Broadmoor hospital, having worked there as a volunteer in the 1970s and 1980s. A Broadmoor patient revealed how Savile repeatedly targeted his victims at the psychiatric hospital in the 1990s . He was later given a central position in the administration and was allowed to personally select managers, it has been claimed. He had a set of keys and even living quarters on site. Another victim told of the ‘major and lasting impact’ of Savile’s abuse in the late 1970s, when she was less than ten years old. The first time he attacked her, he picked her up from her house in a two-seater car – meaning that her family were forced to travel  in a separate car rather than accompany the pair to Leeds General Infirmary, she said. As they arrived at the hospital, Savile took her into a room with no windows. When her parents left, he kissed her several times. Savile's coffin drives past The Leeds General Infirmary in 2011. According to the report his victims at the hospital ranged in age from five to 75 . She was targeted again six months later, when he picked her up in the same car to take her alone to another appointment. By the third appointment, she was terrified of the entertainer. To avoid the abuse, she said she deliberately hurt herself so badly that she needed to be treated at a different hospital. But she couldn’t escape – for while she was recovering there, Savile visited her again. The traumatic experience when she was just a child has left her scarred for life, the report found. It states that she was only one of many victims at the Leeds  hospital, including men, women, boys and girls, who ranged in age from five to 75. A female patient at Broadmoor revealed how Savile assaulted her in the early 1970s as she watched Top of the Pops . A female patient at Broadmoor revealed how Savile assaulted her in the early 1970s as she watched Top of the Pops. The presenter used to sit with patients to watch himself appear on the popular music show, which was pre-recorded. The victim, known in the report as Ms B, told investigators how on one occasion, he was watching the show with patients in front of a large sofa in the day room. Staff were standing behind the sofa, with their view blocked by the furniture. The paedophile sat on the floor next to the victim. Effectively hidden from sight, he placed his hand between her legs before assaulting her. The attack lasted for two to three minutes, she said. But like many others, she felt unable to complain because staff were unsympathetic. She said she did not feel able to tell her story then or later, for fear of being  punished as a troublemaker. Savile presented the BBC show Top of the Pops, which had a largely teenage audience, from 1964 to 1984. Throughout this period, he escaped punishment for the  horrific abuse of young stars and fans. Singer Coleen Nolan has previously claimed that Savile invited her to come to a hotel when she was just 14 after she had recorded at the Top of the Pops studio.","So far, 103 victims have come forward to describe the abuse they suffered .

"Children spend nearly a year slumped in front of the TV or staring at computer screens by the time they are seven, a former children’s minister has warned. Tim Loughton said this screen addiction in youngsters could cause changes in the brain similar to those seen in cocaine addicts and alcoholics. In a report titled ‘The state our children are in’ for the charity 4Children, the Tory MP cited research by a psychologist suggesting today’s children were at risk of a lifelong dependency on TV and computer screens. Telly addicts: Children spend nearly a year slumped in front of the TV or staring at computer screens by the time they are seven, a former children's minister has warned . The research by Dr Aric Sigman warned that a generation of kids could suffer damage to the body as well as the brain as a result. In the essay, Mr Loughton called for a crackdown on the ‘health and safety’ mentality that stopped children taking part in rough and tumble activities. He cited NHS statistics that showed half as many children are being admitted to hospital after falling out of a tree than they were ten years ago. Fear: MP Tim Loughton said screen addiction in youngsters could cause changes in the brain similar to those seen in cocaine addicts and alcoholics . In contrast, kids are twice as likely to . go to casualty for injuries caused by repetitive strain movements, such . as playing computer games for too long, than a decade ago. He said: ‘Should the state be intervening to rebalance the average child’s day, when they’re spending - on average - ten times as long on the computer or watching TV as playing outside? The research by Dr Sigman showed 12 to 15-year olds spend on average more than six hours a day staring at screens. At the time, he called for a ban for toddlers and severely rationed for other youngsters and will warn that parents who use technology as a ‘babysitter’ could be setting up their children for a lifetime of ill health. His work and studies by other researchers link time spent in front of screens with health problems including obesity, high cholesterol and blood pressure, inattentiveness and declines in maths and reading, as well as sleep disorders and autism. In the report, Mr Loughton called for the relationship between the state and families to be rebalanced. Noting that there had been 100 Acts of Parliament in the last 25 years affecting children, he questioned whether these had ‘strengthened families’. He said: ‘The approach I have always favoured [is] where the State is there to serve, to enable, to promote the family, not to stifle it, nor to direct or supplant, other than in those severe cases where neglect or cruelty harms the children . The MP for East Worthing and Shoreham also said that a toxic concoction of 24 hour social media, the sexualisation of childhood and pressures to ‘fit in’ and achieve were fuelling a ‘quarter life crisis’ among today’s young people.","Children spend nearly a year watching TV before they are seven, MP warns .

"A winemaker from Cornwall has become the first English vintner to be shortlisted in the world’s top sparkling wine award - competing against some of France’s most famous champagne houses. Sam Lindo, from Camel Valley Wines, is one of only three winemakers in the world to be nominated for the International Sparkling Winemaker of the Year. The 37-year-old, is the first English winemaker to make the shortlist in the history of English wine. Sam Lindo from the Camel Valley Vineyard in Nanstallon, Cornwall, tends to one his harvest . It is so prestigious, his wife is even allowing him to leave the county to attend the award ceremony next month despite being due to give birth around the time of the ceremony next month. Mr Lindo told The Telegraph: ‘This award is like the Oscars. Just to be shortlisted is fantastic. It will put our vineyard on the map. 'One of the two champagne makers shortlisted for the award, Charles Heidsieck has already won it a few times. ‘To knock him off his perch would be quite a coup. For an English wine to beat French champagne houses would definitely cause quite a stir. It feels slightly ridiculous.’ Sam Lindo, from Camel Valley Wines, is one of only three winemakers in the world to be nominated . The award will be announced at the International Wine Challenge 2014 Awards Dinner on 16 July at the Grosvenor House Hotel. The other two contenders are Régis Camus from Champagne Charles Heidsieck and Laurent Fresnet from Champagne Henriot. Mr Lindo is a three-times UK Winemaker of the Year and Camel Valley has won several awards over the years. He said: ‘Everyone loves a David and Goliath story. But we’re very French in the way we make our wine. ‘We’re not interested in being better than other. We just want to make the best wine we can. ‘Like many winemakers in France we don’t really feel like we make wine. Nature and the weather make wine. ‘We believe we couldn’t make our wine anywhere else in the world. We make the wine that is suitable for our region and we respect that. We’re not trying to be something else.’ It is no mean feat for the West Country winemakers as the International Wine Challenge awards have been running for over 30 years are competed for and recognised globally. A spokesperson for the International Wine Challenge awards said: ‘Just for a vineyard to be nominated is a massive coup and any wine producer who wins the International Sparkling Winemaker of the Year can expect their sales to go through the roof. The award has worldwide recognition.’ Both types of wine from Camel Valley Wines are available from selected Waitrose branches as well as Fortnum and Masons and Berry Bros. The 2012 Pinot Noir Rose is around £27 a bottle while the 2009 Chardonnay Brut costs £24.95.

"Think your commute is bad? Spare a thought for the small band of dedicated workers who live in Cornwall but work... in Shetland. Their gruelling 900-mile journey from one end of the UK to the other is revealed in analysis by the Office for National Statistics – which has found the most exhausting trips made by Britain’s 11.3million commuters. Some 175 Shetlanders work in other parts of Britain, with a further 494 journeying to their office in the remote northern isles from other parts of the country. A study into commutes by the Office for National Statistics found some people travel from their homes in Cornwall (pictured) to the Shetland Islands on a regular basis for work . This includes three people who regularly head to the islands from Cornwall – which is 700 miles as the crow flies and about 900 miles by the shortest commute. A handful travel to there from the South coast and London, with a further 195 people from across Britain regularly commuting to their workplace in Orkney. The lure of jobs in London also pulls in commuters from far and wide. Of the 867,630 who travel to the capital for work, 285 come from Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Dozens even make the journey to London from the Highlands and Northern Ireland – plus two people from Orkney and one Shetlander. The distance from Cornwall to the Shetland Islands (pictured) is 700 miles as the crow flies but 900 miles for the shortest commute. The lengthy journey takes at least 24 hours by car . Previous analysis found that the average commute in England and Wales increased from 8.3 miles in 2001 to 9.3 miles in 2011. On average, workers in the East of England had the longest commute at 10.6 miles, while Londoners had the shortest commute at 6.8 miles. In both 2001 and 2011, men travelled further to work than women. This map shows the number of working residents in each local authority commuting to work in Greater London .

"A prehistoric type of elephant had a second pair of tusks that they used to cut tough vegetation. Platybelodon's bizarre jaw was used as an in-built 'scythe' to saw off their food. They were originally believed to be water-living creatures that used their incisors to shovel and dig up food from swamps. Platybelodon used their bizarre second tusks to cut tough vegetation after grabbing it with their trunk . But further investigations into the fossilised tusks have changed the minds of scientists. Vertebrate palaeontologist William Sanders, from the University of Michigan, told Wired: 'Recent analysis of tusk wear surfaces show that they were used more as scythes to cut tough vegetation.' Cross-sections of tusks show in-built strength and resistance to abrasion, Wired reported. Platybelodon lived between 8million and 20million years ago, in what is now Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. They were successful and thrived at the time but died out during the Miocene Epoch. Like the modern day elephant, it is . believed the platybelodon grabbed tough vegetation with its trunk and . sliced it off with its remarkable tusks. Analysis of the tusks (left) of the Platybelodon (model, right) had an in-built strength to resist abrasion . Platybelodon were slightly smaller than an African elephant and like their descendants had few predators because of their size. Mr Sanders told the website: 'The trunk is a very separate entity from the mouth. You have to be able to get food into your mouth, and if your front limbs are occupied in posture, and you have upper and lower tusks that would make it difficult to have a long projecting tongue or mobile lips, then you need a proboscis.' Because they spent much of their time around water there are examples of platybelodon fossils.","Platybelodon lived between eight and 20millions years ago .

"The shocking moment when a cicada breaks through its creepy larva shell to emerge as a fully-grown vivid green adult, has been captured by a photographer. The stunning shots show the creature making its strange journey through its own former shell before unfurling its new wings to dry them out. Photographer Thomas Marent was lucky enough to witness the strange process, which took around 30 minutes. The shocking moment (pictured) when a cicada breaks through its creepy larva shell to emerge as a fully-grown vivid green adult, has been captured by a photographer . The bugs spend most of their lives beneath the Earth and can lie there for 17 years. They only venture above ground level to shed their ugly larva shells and sprout wings to become adults. Once matured, they sing for a mate. Mr Marent saw the cicada, still within its larva shell, clamber up a plant close to an exit tunnel in the ground where it had previously lived, and choose a leaf strong enough to support its weight - suitable for the creature's transformation. Cicadas spend most of their lives beneath the Earth and can lie there for 17 years. They only venture above ground level to shed their ugly larva shells (pictured) and sprout wings to become an adults. Once matured, they sing for a mate . As the cicada begins to emerge, the amazing photographs show the stages at which the insect's wings begin to unfurl. However, they are still soft and wet and need to be aired out, so the cicada stretches them out so they are able to dry. The whole process from 'birth' to developing its fully grown wings took 30 minutes. Mr Marent, 47, captured the transformation at Palmerston National Park in Queensland, Australia. The professional nature photographer from Neuenhof, Switzerland, said: 'I was at the camping ground of the park and there were hundreds of horseflies around me, the car and the tent. When the cicada has wriggled out of its restrictive shell, it gradually unfurls its delicate wings, which are soft and wet (pictured left) and then spreads them fully to they can dry out (pictured right) It is hanging on to its discarded former 'nymphal case'  or shell . 'The horseflies disappeared when it got dark at 6pm so I decided to explore the forest area at night. 'Equipped with cameras, flashes and a torch I walked along a small trail and after seeing a few katydids and spiders, I found a cicada larva crawling on the forest floor. 'I watched and waited for an hour until it found a decent spot to rest and start the metamorphosis on a twig. 'After two hours nothing happened so I lost my patience and went back to my tent to sleep - but all I could think about was the cicada larva.' Kept awake by the thought of missing a great photographic opportunity, Mr Marent left his tent at around midnight and walked back to the spot where he had seen the cicada. 'Right on time the cicada larva started . its metamorphosis and I grabbed my camera and took all the pictures of . the different stages,' he said. Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives, at depths ranging from about 30 centimetres to 2.5 metres. The nymphs feed on root juice and have strong front legs for digging. They construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge to molt (pictured) on a nearby plant for the last time to emerge as adults . 'I was so lucky. After about 30 minutes the metamorphosis was done and I could calmly go back with a good conscience for a nice sleep.' Mr Marent fulfilled a lifetime ambition of photographing a cicada emergence from start to finish. He said: 'I've wanted to photograph a cicada larva for many years so I could get all the different stages from their birth. 'In the past I've seen loads of empty nymphal cases hanging on twigs or tree trunks but I finally managed to see the whole process this time.'","Professional photographer Thomas Marent took the pictures in Palmerston National Park in Queensland, Australia .

"Becky Beaumont, 22 suffered her first stroke in October 2011. She was making a good recovery until a second one struck this August . A brave young woman who fought back from a stroke at the age of 21 has suffered another setback less than a year later. Becky Beaumont was 21 when she suffered her first stroke last October and was left completely paralysed down her left side. She was making a good recovery until she suffered a second stroke in August this year, this time affecting her right arm. Fortunately it was not as serious as the first - but Miss Beaumont is having to undergo further rehabilitation. She has refused to let her ill-health get her down and has launched a moving blog, where she writes about her recovery. Miss Beaumont's ordeal began when she woke up one morning last year and was unable to reach for her phone next to her bed. Miss Beaumont, who had been training to be a hairdresser, at first thought she had 'pins and needles from sleeping funny'. But when she reached with her right hand to touch the left side of her face, she realised it had drooped. 'I just knew I'd had a stroke,' she said. She explains this terrifying moment in more detail on her blog, www.luckygirlbec.blogspot.co.uk. She writes: 'In my whole life and in my years to come I don't think I'll ever feel as lonely, vulnerable and helpless as I did in those silent minutes that I lay, motionless in my bed. 'Looking back, the seconds that went by seemed like decades, and the panic was escalating. My body wasn't working, and all I could think was, ""Please God, let my voice work."" With all my might and will, I screamed for my mum. Her mother Julie, 50, rang for an ambulance and she was taken to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport where doctors diagnosed the condition. Miss Beaumont, with fiance Chris Coe, has refused to let her ill-health get her down and has launched a moving blog, where she writes about her recovery . A stroke is an attack which happens when the blood supply to the brain is cut off. Around 150,000 people a year are affected. The average age people have a stroke is 75 so when Miss Beaumont arrived at hospital, doctors at first thought she must have an infection. However, scans confirmed it had been a stroke due to a blood clot on her brain that had been caused by a previously undetected hole in her heart. She was given clot-busting drugs, as well as intensive physiotherapy, and felt she was over the worst of it. But in August she suffered a setback when she was hit by another stroke, this time affecting her right arm. She said: 'It was a massive shock when I had my first stroke - I just thought it affected old or physically unfit people. 'I was absolutely fine before my stroke but then I woke up early and found I couldn’t move my left arm or leg. I thought it was just pins and needles but then realised it was more serious. It’s been a tough year and I’m still in recovery. 'I can walk but I’ve been left with a limp and my arms and legs still don’t work properly. It has completely changed my life.' Miss Beaumont is also helping Stroke Association raise awareness of the condition - and the fact it can affect young people . Miss Beaumont, who is engaged to Chris Coe, 22, added: 'I haven’t let the strokes dampen my fighting spirit. I am determined to make a full recovery in time, and with the support of my family, friends and fiance I know I’ll get there. Her blog has already had almost 500,000 hits. 'The response to my blog has been incredible. It has allowed me to connect with other young stroke survivors, and made me realise that I am not alone. Hopefully it will change people’s idea about strokes. I had no idea that it could happen at any age, until it happened to me.' She is also raising awareness of the condition - and the fact it can affect young people - with the Stroke Association charity, helping to launch Style for Stroke - a designer collection of eight black dresses, sold in aid of the Stroke Association. Celebrity style expert Nick Ede founded the campaign, working with fashion label Little Mistress. Louise Kay, fundraising manager for the Stroke Association, added: 'We are delighted that Nick and Little Mistress have launched this initiative in support of the Stroke Association. The money raised will go a long way in helping us to support people to make the best recovery they can.'

"The Ghost River Valley in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta is a Mecca for experienced climbers, providing some of the longest, most  beautifully ethereal and lethal climbing spots in the world. Temperatures can drop to as low as minus seven degrees centigrade in the glacier-sliced valley and  frozen waterfalls stretch from 100 to 1,000 feet for brave climbers to try and scale. This series of incredible photographs show experienced mountaineers Larry Shiu, 30, and Jonathan Fox, 30, scaling a monstrous 300 foot frozen waterfall called the 'Rainbow Serpent'. Keeping cool: One of the climbers gets a foot hold on the 300ft frozen slab of ice called  'Rainbow Serpent' Perspective: The frozen water structures make a dramatic climb for brave and experienced climbers . The slippery nature of the natural ice structure means both men know that one foot wrong could mean the difference between life and death. Adventure photographer John, from Canberra, Australia, said: 'The conditions at Ghost River Valley are always challenging, ice climbing is exposed, cold and often wet. 'It can be very hard at times, there is suffering no doubt.' The team used basic climbing gear including ice axes, ice screws, head torches and harnesses and managed to complete their expedition safely reaching the summit. John used a Canon 6D camera to take the stomach churning aerial shots of the climbers digging their toes and axes in along the way. Don't look down: Both men know that one foot wrong could mean the difference between life and death . Where's Wally? The waterfalls in the Canadian Alberta region are so colossal that it can be hard to pick out climbers from afar . The Ghost River Valley, part of the Canadian Rockies, consists of 60 square miles of raw wilderness bordering Banff National Park to the east and north. The glacier carved valley contains several sites where steep water runoffs from its peaks produce some of the best waterfall ice climbs in Canada. The Rainbow Serpent, which is approximately 300 feet tall, is widely considered to be the most challenging frozen waterfall to climb in Ghost Valley. Only the most experienced climbers are advised to attempt it. These structures  form when snow accumulating above  settles, then slowly melts and refreezes while dripping down the wall . John says, 'The climbs are not there year round, only in the winter. They are formed by what is called a 'melt freeze cycle' where snow accumulating above will settle, then slowly melt and refreeze while dripping down the wall. 'That is how these giant ice climbs are formed. They are not all necessarily flowing waterfalls in summertime and some of these climbs never form and will go years without appearing.' A long way to the bottom: A birds eye view of the slab of ice as one of the climbers nears a summit . Bare necessities: The group used basic climbing gear including ice axes, ice screws, head torches and harnesses . Surely a cumbersome camera adds to a precious load? 'It  takes motivation, sometimes you just want to climb and leave the camera at home, switch off and just enjoy the day but I love photographing climbing, it is my strongest passion in life after climbing,' says John. 'Combining these two passions inspires me deeply and I love capturing the greatest moments of my life and telling stories of both the unique places and the climbers.' Ice climbing can be a risky activity, with dangerous climbs often resulting in fatality. Last month, Australian Michael Taylor, 29, plummeted more than 300m to his death while climbing a glacier in Canada. It is believed the mountaineer was using minimal climbing equipment when attempting to scale the Stadium Glacier on Sky Pilot Mountain in Squamish, Vancouver.

"Some of the most expensive cities in the world to visit may actually be the most affordable to inhabit if you're between the ages of 15 and 29. A study from Toronto-based Youthful Cities, a global social initiative that ranks the world's top cities from a youth perspective, has found that Paris, Toronto and Los Angeles are the 'most affordable' for young adults. London ranked tenth as the study analysed the cost of everyday items in 25 of the world's biggest cities. According to new data compiled by Youthful Cities, Paris ranks as 'most affordable' for young people . Paris has a high standard minimum wage, as well as discounted municipal transit rates for youths . Cities that usually rank as some of the toughest on the wallet are also some of the more attractive ones once the cost of food, housing and public transport is factored in along with basic entertainment costs that make a city a liveable, youthful place. 'More than half the world's population lives in cities and more than half the world's population is under 30,' Research Director, Matthew Cosgrove, told MailOnline Travel. Source: Youthful Cities Affordability Index . 'Young people are mobile and drawn to places that are inclusive.' This survey also takes into consideration the current minimum wage rate in each city. The report said: 'Since youth rely on entry level jobs when they enter the workforce, we feel tying costs to an hour of minimum wage labour is the best way to measure a city's affordability from a youth perspective.' And Paris takes top marks, coming in with a standard wage of approximately £8.10. Paris was followed by Berlin (approximately £7.50) and Rome (£7). Berlin also offers significantly cheaper rent than its cosmopolitan counterparts, largely because the rental market is strongly regulated. Tokyo (£6.45) and Toronto (£6.38) rounded out the top five. The report ranked London in sixth place. The UK's current minimum wage rates are £6.50 for those 21 and over, £5.13 for people aged 18 to 20, and £3.79 for people under 18. Nairobi finished last in the ranking of 25 cities with a standard wage of just 8p. In second place was Toronto, where an affordable apartment rental market is just one of its offerings . In Los Angeles, cheap transit options and affordable eats are readily available to residents . For those looking for affordable nightlife, the European capitals of Berlin, Paris, and Rome were found to offer high-quality, cheap entertainment, including low-cost live gigs. Istanbul can't be beat when it comes to quick, affordable getaways. According to the survey, the ability to take a city break is a top urban priority. Several cities included in the study are undertaking even more initiatives to make themselves more appealing to youth. In Bogota, discounted transit is the norm for students while many students in Tel Aviv are privy to a housing subsidy. Paris offers both. Young people are eligible for discounted rates on the city's bike-share programme and cheaper municipal public transit fares on weekends, as well as the APL housing subsidy, which is available to all students. The top-ranking City of Lights offers both discounted travel options and an APL housing subsidy to students .","Youthful Cities Affordability Index ranks liveability of world's largest cities .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are . preparing to move into their new country bolthole with baby son Prince . George in a matter of months, MailOnline can reveal. It is understood that the Queen has . asked the current tenant of Anmer Hall in Norfolk to vacate the property . as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up. The 10-bedroom Georgian property is . situated on the monarch’s private estate at Sandringham and has been . lived in by company director James Everett and his family for 13 years. He also runs his bespoke timber company, Norfolk Oak, from its stables. New home: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are preparing to move into their new country bolthole with baby son Prince George in a matter of months . However the magnificent mansion has now been earmarked by William and Kate as second home for their family. The couple are already renovating . another 20-room home in Kensington Palace to serve as their primary . London residence, which has so far cost taxpayers £1.1 million in . building costs. Last night it was confirmed to the . Mail that the family business had already started moving out of Anmer . Hall ahead of the lease, which had not been due to end until March . 2017. The business is in the process of relocating to new premises at nearby RAF West Raynham. But reports that he is receiving compensation from his landlord, the Queen, to leave were denied. The news coincides not just with the . birth of William and Kate’s first baby on Monday, but also the end of . William’s current job as a Search and Rescue pilot based at RAF Valley . in Anglesey. One possibility is that he could . transfer to fly with 22 Squadron B Flight at nearby RAF Wattisham in . Suffolk, where his brother Prince Harry is also based with the Army Air . Corps, using the new Norfolk home as a base. But it is more likely he will transfer back to London for a new office-based role with the Household Cavalry. Idyllic: The house, which has a swimming pool and tennis court, will provide a place where the young family will be able to entertain and host guests . Country home: The 10-bedroom Georgian property, Anmer Hall, is situated on the monarch's private estate at Sandringham . Either way, dozens of specially . trained armed police officers are now being recruited to guard Anmer . Hall on a rolling 24 hour, seven day a week basis, in line with other . royal properties. Norfolk Police confirmed to the Mail . this week that they are looking to beef up the security capability . around the Queen’s Sandringham Estate, on which the house is situated. It is understood that around forty to . fifty police officers will be involved in the operation, with extra . personnel being sought from both within existing Norfolk police ranks . and outside. It costs at least £100,000 to train and arm each firearms . officer and the cost will be met by taxpayers. A spokesman for Norfolk police . confirmed: ‘Recruitment for additional Authorised Firearms Officers . (AFOs) in Norfolk remains open at this time, to both internal and . external candidates, as we seek to address a current shortfall in . numbers. ‘Our AFOs are required both for normal . policing duties and to support our on-going commitment to the Royal . Estate at Sandringham in the west of the county.’ An insider added: ‘The force needs to train more armed cops as the couple are going to live there sooner rather than later.’ New chapter: The news coincides not just with the birth of William and Kate's first baby, but also the end of William's current job as a Search and Rescue pilot based at RAF Valley in Anglesey . A raft of new security measures have . also been approved by the local council, including the planting of . dozens of trees to shield the stunning property from public view. According to a planning application . lodged with King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council, an existing . wood store will be converted into extra accommodation – mostly likely . for police officers guarding the property – while a garage block will be . transformed into an equipment room. Moving out: It is understood that the Queen has asked the current tenant of Anmer Hall ito vacate the property as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up . Other plans involve moving the main . gates to the property further down the access lane so members of the . public will not be able to get so close to the house. Royal aides have also been given . planning permission to begin extensive improvements including a new . garden room and a pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for . plants to trail through, providing both shade and privacy on the patio . area. These will be designed by architect . Charles Morris, who was behind a controversial extension for Prince . Charles at his own country home. Council officers have approved the . plans under delegated powers, which means they did not have to go . through the usual council planning process. Anmer Hall is one of 150 situated on . the monarch’s 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and is only two . miles east of Sandringham House, one of her favourite private . residences. The hall, which largely dates back to . 1802, was used as an illicit bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then . Camilla Parker-Bowles during their long-running affair when it was . rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van Cutsem. Prince William, who is close to the . van Cutsems’ children, is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to . the hall as a child. It also has something of a royal . pedigree having been leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their . country house from 1972 until 1990. Location location: Anmer Hall is one of 150 situated on the monarch's 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and is only two miles east of Sandringham House, one of her favourite private residences .

The house, which has a swimming pool . and tennis court, will provide a place where the young family will be . able to entertain and host guests. It is also close to Holkham beach where Prince George will be able to play as his father and grandfather both did. The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862. Although much of the land is open to . the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal . family relaxing there, making it even more attractive to the Duke and . Duchess.

"Raymond Morris was convicted of the 1967 murder of seven-year-old Christine Darby and was the prime suspect in the deaths of two other girls . A prison watchdog has complained why a paedophile killer was chained to a hospital bed before his death - despite no complaints being made. Raymond Morris - dubbed the Monster of Cannock Chase - spent 45 years in prison until his death in March. Morris was convicted of the 1967 murder of Christine Darby, seven, and was the prime suspect in the 1965 murders of Diane Tift, five, and six-year-old Margaret Reynolds. Prison watchdog Nigel Newcomen launched an investigation into Morris's death as he died in custody. He expressed concern over the use of restraints while Morris was receiving medical treatment. In 2011, Morris began receiving treatment for leukaemia and kidney failure. When removed from his cell at HMP Preston, the killer was handcuffed and escorted by a pair of prison officers. Morris, 84, was being treated for leukaemia at HMP Preston in Lancashire after being diagnosed with the condition three years ago. On March 1, 2014 Morris signed a disclaimer refusing active medical treatment and on March 10, he was transferred to the prison's medical unit. He died the following day. Morris was jailed in February 1969 for the seven-year-old's rape and murder. The bodies of all three girls were discovered within a few miles of each other beside the A34 on Cannock Chase. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Nigel Newcomen launched an investigation into Morris's death. According to the report, as well as having chronic myeloid leukaemia he was suffering for kidney failure and required regular dialysis. Morris had earlier signed a document asking medical staff not to resuscitate him in the event of cardiac or respiratory failure. Describing Morris's final few hours, Mr Newcomen said: 'Later, the man's breathing was shallow and his pulse weak. His eyes were closed and he shook his head when asked if he was in pain. At 4.45pm, he became unresponsive, but did not appear to be in pain or agitated. 'At 7.15pm, he became agitated and he was given a sedative. He died peacefully at 7.40pm.' Mr Newcomnen noted that throughout his medical treatment in 2013 and 2014, Morris was handcuffed, placed in chains and accompanied by a pair of prison officers each time he left his cell. Mr Newcomen added: 'The clinical reviewer concludes that the overall standard of clinical care the man received was equal to that he could have expected in the community. Morris was convicted of the murder of Christine Darby, seven, left, and was the prime suspect in the murders of Margaret Reynolds, six, centre, and Diane Tift, right whose bodies were all found near the same spot . Morris, 84, remained handcuffed as he received medical treatment at HMP Preston, pictured . 'While there were some examples of good practice in the support provided at both prisons, there were no formal care places at Wymott. I am also concerned that he appears to have been restrained for hospital visits, including while undergoing dialysis, despite being elderly, frail and in very poor health. 'This is a matter I have raised with the prison before and the Governor needs to ensure that staff fully understand their legal obligation in relation to the use of restraints for seriously ill prisoners undergoing life-saving treatment.' The report reveals that Morris made a final bid for freedom in June 2012 when he instructed a solicitor to make an application for release on compassionate grounds, however the papers were never filed. Raymond Morris was hidden from public view as he was taken to Cannock Police Station for questioning . Morris initially convinced his wife to give him an alibi for the day Christine Darby had been murdered . September 8, 1965: Six-year-old Margaret Reynolds goes missing on her way to school in Aston, Birmingham. December 30: Five-year-old Diane Tift goes missing on her way to her grandmother's house in Bloxwich, West Midlands. January 12, 1966: The bodies of Margaret Reynolds and Diane Tift are found at Cannock Chase. August 14: 10-year-old Jane Taylor disappears near Cannock Chase and is never seen again. August 19, 1967: Seven-year-old Christine Darby is lured into a car by a man near with a local accent. August 22: Christine's body is found on Cannock Chase. November 4, 1968: A failed attempt to abduct 10-year-old Margaret Aulton is witnessed and police are called. They arrest Raymond Morris, but his wife gives him an alibi for the day Christine was murdered. November 15: Carol Morris is shown pornographic pictures that her husband took of her five-year-old niece and retracts her statement. November 16: Morris is charged with the murder of Christine Darby and is remanded in custody. February 18, 1969: A seven-day trial ends with Morris found guilty of murder. He is sentenced to life imprisonment. August 2010: Morris begins an appeal. November: Morris is granted a judicial review in the case of the murder of Christine Darby. The review is overturned. May 2011: Morris breaks a 40-year silence, claims his innocence and says he may go to the European Court of Human Rights. March 11, 2014: Morris confirmed dead at 8pm at health facility in HMP Preston. Morris was dubbed 'The Monster of Cannock Chase' and prompted one of the largest ever UK murder hunts . The bodies of Margaret Reynolds and Diane Tift were found in a field off Mansty Gulley on January 13, 1966 .

"That Manchester City continue to make the concept of a striker seem wholly unnecessary is why we cannot pack away this title race along with the Christmas decorations. It is six goals and six points since Manuel Pellegrini had a recognised centre-forward on the pitch. And that was an 18-year-old called up in emergency.

Again the Argentine’s absence through injury was not felt due to the intelligence and industry of City’s outfield Englishman. Not missed either were Edin Dzeko or Stevan Jovetic, who was at least fit enough for a place on the bench. In a quick-fire start that stunned West Bromwich Albion, Fernando scored his first goal for City, Yaya Toure hammered home a penalty and David Silva stroked in a sumptuous finish to give City a 3-0 advantage by the 34th minute. The closest that lead looked to disappearing came when the pitch was blanketed with snow in the second half and the ball was at times barely visible.

As the white stuff fell, Joe Hart horribly mistimed a punch to Chris Brunt’s corner with three minutes left to hand West Bromwich Albion a consolation. The ball hit Bacary Sagna then brushed the back of Brown Ideye’s head to cross the line. A priceless gift for a striker without a Premier League goal since his £9million move – but worthless in the context of this game. The real story was that Pellegrini could enjoy a seventh straight league win by taking off Silva and Toure with more than 20 minutes left in preparation for the visit of Burnley on Sunday. City will go into that buoyed by their performance in this opening period. Their attacks were clinical and fluid, too fast for Albion’s defence to deal with. Milner, Silva, Samir Nasri and Jesus Navas worked as a carousel, interchanging positions and exchanging passes. That is not to deny the hosts offered far too much seasonal good will. The first two goals were defensive errors gobbled up with glee. Ben Foster was guilty of a worse mistake than Hart – with bad weather not yet a mitigating factor – and Joleon Lescott conceded a spot-kick with a lunge that was not really necessary. Lescott, captaining West Brom, failed to have the kind of game he would have hoped for against the manager who jettisoned him last season. By half-time, Pellegrini knew the points were won and City relaxed to conserve energy for this busy period.

Manchester City players defend a free-kick taken by Craig Gardner of West Brom during the match at the Hawthornes . They were ahead in the eighth minute. Albion had already looked susceptible to the speed with which City attacked but how they actually went behind was entirely avoidable. Navas fired a cross that looped off Craig Gardner into the area. Foster reached to claim instead of leave but succeeded only in palming the ball down to the spot Fernando had walked into. The Brazilian hooked a finish back over his head past Gareth McAuley on the line. Five minutes later the lead was doubled. Silva advanced and tried to slip in Navas but Lescott placed a foot in the way. As the ball bounced loose, Silva nipped in and Lescott’s challenge brought down the Spaniard just inside the area. Mark Clattenburg instantly pointed to the spot, dismissing Lescott’s claims he got the ball. Replays showed he had but only ever so slightly, as gently as those flakes falling from the sky touched the grass. The award was fair. Toure ran up and belted his penalty into the corner, his sixth goal in an increasingly productive campaign. The manner he played this game suggested City had handed him an especially large Christmas cake. Defender Martin Demichelis of Manchester City signals as snow falls during the Premier League match . Things looking festive as snow falls at West Brom's stadium The Hawthorns on Boxing Day . Silva runs through the snow at The Hawthornes during Manchester City's comfortable victory over West Brom . By this stage, those in the home stands sensed a drubbing. On the half-hour mark a slick attack saw Navas feed Silva who lifted badly over. He made no mistake 11 minutes before the interval. Fernando pounced on a loose ball in front of James Morrison, advancing and giving possession to Navas, who cut back for Silva. There was a shimmy and caressed left-foot finish, more pass than shot. Wrong-footed Foster had no chance. 3-0, job done. Only the conditions and energy conservation limited City’s scoring here. Albion did threaten intermittently. Before the break Saido Berahino, on his first start since December 2, should have done better than hook two finishes wide when played in by Morrison and in the second half Silvestre Varela miscued from close range from a good Stephane Sessegnon cross. Although Eliaquim Mangala was largely composed, he did err to hand grant Morrison a chance from distance that Hart had to save. Later, Lescott could have atoned with a goal but headed over inside the six-yard box. Pellegrini revealed Vincent Kompany could be fit to return for the Burnley game. City failed to keep a fifth successive clean sheet due to Hart’s late lapse but recorded a ninth straight win in all competitions to equal a club record. Milner celebrated by stripping of his shirt and flinging it to the away crowd, a brave call given the temperature. But just as brave as his performance the previous 90 minutes. Those City supporters sung of their status as champions with great gusto, in full belief they can retain their title yet.","Fernando, Yaya Toure and David Silva strike in the first half as Manchester City beat West Brom .

"A father has poignantly recorded the lonely terror of having a baby born prematurely in a photo series taken as he waited nervously for news about both his wife and son. Stranded in the hospital waiting room, Sao Paulo photographer Diego Saldiva started taking images for his moving series Break of Day. The photos record his isolation and fears from the silent hospital telephone to his canteen dinner as well as images of his wife’s scars, intimidating medical equipment and a lonely unused pram and children’s toys. Tiny: Little Emilio was born weighing around two pounds at seven months . Fighter: The four-year-old now undergoes regular tests but has come on leaps and bounds and suffers no major complications . Saldiva’s son Emilio was born at seven months to his mother, Saldiva’s wife, Noemie in summer 2010. He weighed just a kilo. His baby went on to suffer further health complications as his powerless father watched and waited. It was those feelings of despair that prompted Saldiva to pick up a camera. ‘I worked on this project from when I got the news I was going to be a father, the beginning of 2010. Of course I had no idea of what would happen next: urgent c-section, premature baby, and all the process of getting to know the he was sick, which was probably the most difficult part,’ he told dailymail.com. Tension: Diego Saldiva's series documenting the birth of his son captures the tension and the long wait for news . Isolated: The Sao Paulo photographer captures the boredom and loneliness of the hospital . Sadness: The photo series shows strewn toys and other items Saldiva and his wife had bought in excited anticipation for the birth of their son . Hospitalized: Diego Saldiva was left fearing the worst as his wife was rushed to hospital at seven months pregnant to undergo a C-Section . ‘We didn't know what was coming next. I was compelled to take pictures because it was a situation that started some contradictory feelings in me, as being a father for the first time and not being able to hold my child, or to see it isolated from the world you were supposed to offer. The chaos of the world kinds of push some human beings to create, and I think it was my case.’ ‘There was mostly moments of waiting. Which created a lot of expectations on me and us. I think using the flash was a way to release some kind of tension.’ Thankfully Emilio, now aged four, is a flourishing little boy although the family still have to make regular hospital visits due to health issues from his prematurity. Alone: Saldiva said the uncertainty of the situation was one of the hardest things he had to cope with and pushed him to create images . Emergency: Saldiva took intimate photos of his wife Noemie for the series as she waited for news about her child . Reminders: The series documents the everyday objects which served as a haunting reminder of what the photographer was waiting to hear about . Clinical: Saldiva's images show a cold, sterile world which echo of the experience inside the hospital . Clinical: The photographer wandered the halls of the hospital and outside the building for the series .","Diego Saldiva, of Sao Paulo, took photos as he waited for news about his wife Noemie and son Emilio who was born at seven months .

"Prince Harry's decision to quit flying . military attack helicopters to take an Army desk job in London was . spurred by a desire to spend more time with girlfriend Cressida Bonas, a . friend has said. The . 29-year-old, who co-piloted Apache gunships on the Afghan front line, is . to begin a new role helping to co-ordinate ‘significant projects and . commemorative events’ for the Army in London. Captain . Harry Wales, as he is known in the Army, will also lead a bid to bring . the Warrior Games, an ‘Olympics’ for wounded service personnel, to the . UK. It must be love: Prince Harry, left, has quit his job as an Apache helicopter pilot to take a desk job helping to co-ordinate 'significant projects' - as well as to spend more time with girlfriend Cressida Bonas, right . And the move means that . he can further develop his 18-month relationship with 24-year-old Miss . Bonas, a dancer - although friends insist an engagement is not imminent. A . friend of the couple told The Sun: 'The distance made it difficult for . Harry to see Cressie as often as he would have liked. Moving to London . full time will no doubt make them even closer. 'It shows he is serious and Cressie is thrilled.' But . the fourth in line to the throne risks criticism for ditching the Army . Air Corps after defence chiefs spent £2.5million training him to fly the . helicopters. Despite his . undoubted aptitude as a pilot – the prince was one of the two best young . airmen on his course – his decision raises questions that his place . could have been given to a soldier intending to spend their whole career . with the elite unit. Harry, . who remains a commissioned officer in the Household Cavalry, will take . up the staff officer role in HQ London District, based at Horse Guards. The move will allow him to take on more royal duties on behalf of his 87-year-old grandmother, the Queen. Scroll down for video . Project: The Prince at the Warrior Games in Colorado Springs, U.S., which he hopes to bring to the UK . The fourth in line to the throne, who has twice served on the frontline in Afghanistan, will take up a staff officer role in HQ London District, based from Horse Guards . The move will allow the prince to take on more royal duties on behalf of his ageing grandmother, the Queen, 87, who has long signalled she wishes younger members of her family to take the strain . Ceremonial events Harry will help organise will include Trooping the Colour, the First World War centenary commemorations and state visits. But sources said his desire to expand the Warrior Games into a global contest was ‘very much tied up’ with his decision to quit the Army Air Corps. The prince attended the event near Aspen, Colorado, last year, and was ‘blown away’ by the inspirational tournament in which more than 300 injured troops competed. A senior insider said: ‘Prince Harry is passionate about this project. He believes it will be an amazing event that will bring the focus of attention on the problems facing those injured on the frontline.’ Last year Harry said: ‘I don’t see how it wouldn’t be possible to fill a stadium with 80,000 people, not to watch Olympics, not to watch Paralympics, but to watch wounded servicemen fight it out amongst each other – not on a battlefield but in a stadium.' It is understood plans to bring the Warrior Games to London next year are ‘90 per cent in the bag’ and that Harry will play a central role in organising them. The young royal began the 18-month Apache training course in July 2010, qualifying as a co-pilot gunner in February 2012. Officers were so impressed with his aptitude for flying the £46million helicopter that he was handed the prize of top co-pilot gunner on his course. Harry flew to America last year to support competitors taking part in the Warrior Games, a paralympic style event for injured servicemen and women, and he hopes to help bring the event to the UK . Prince Harry gives a high five to Lcpl Maurillia Simpson as he meets British soldiers competing in the Warrior Games and plays sitting volleyball with them in Colorado Springs in May last year . The prince was an Apache helicopter commander and co-pilot gunner and flew missions in Helmand Province during his last deployment to Afghanistan completed in January last year . One of two crew in an Apache, the co-pilot gunner commands the mission, fires the weapons, navigates and sometimes takes over the controls. The prince’s first tour of duty – a secret deployment with the Household Cavalry – was cut short in 2008 when news of his presence was leaked on foreign websites and he was brought back to Britain. Prince Harry, pictured during a visit to the Royal Marines Tamar centre at the HM Naval Base, Plymouth, became a fully operational Apache Attack Helicopter Pilot in February 2012 . However, Harry was so determined to do another tour of duty that he retrained as an Apache pilot to increase his chances of being redeployed. In September 2012 he returned to Afghanistan to fly the attack helicopters in the battle against the Taliban. He served a four-month deployment at Camp Bastion and later admitted he had killed an insurgent in a missile strike. Asked yesterday about the royal’s sudden change of job, a senior source said: ‘Prince Harry wants a career in the military and it is not unusual for an officer to change his career path after this length of time.’ Lieutenant Colonel Tom de la Rue, who commanded Prince Harry in the Army Air Corps, said the prince had ‘reached the pinnacle of flying excellence as an Apache pilot’ and had been a ‘real inspiration’ to  his colleagues. A senior Army source said that Harry had not prevented anyone else from flying Apaches, adding: ‘There are not queues and queues of people able to do it, and Harry got there on merit.’ Lieutenant Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said: ‘This is normal procedure for all officers … It is necessary to have people with operational experience making decisions in headquarters which is one of the reasons why this happens. ‘It is likely that an officer like Prince Harry will return to a front line position after completing his staff role.'","Prince Harry is to take a desk job organising ceremonial events in London .

"Blood oozed from the cut beneath his right eye. The wound was so deep that the bright red claret streamed down his protruding right cheek. As Bastian Schweinsteiger lay sprawled on the touchline receiving treatment after a blow from Sergio Aguero, his leg twitched impatiently, eager to return to the battle as if a few wires had been short-circuited on impact. Perhaps the most surprising thing when the blood had been wiped away was that raw pink flesh lay beneath the split skin, that it had not uncovered the glinting metal interior of a robot, programmed and primed for combat.

Like Terminator, when half of Arnold Schwarzenegger's face has been blown away and the menacing machine is exposed beneath. Against . Argentina – against all opponents at this World Cup – Schweinsteiger's . six-foot frame stalked about the pitch mechanically, eyes squinted, . trained on his next target; a goal to aim at, an opponent to tackle, a . ball to intercept. Yet . once that final whistle blows in a match, Schweinsteiger is . transformed. He was the first to console opponents in their defeat . throughout the World Cup. When . the Germans crushed Portugal in their first game he embraced Cristiano . Ronaldo. When they knocked out France and Brazil in the later stages he . shared a hug with Karim Benzema and David Luiz. In the aftermath of the . final, late into Sunday night, he lay an arm around the shoulders of an . exhausted Lionel Messi. His off-field persona is surely why he is such an influence, an inspiration, to his team-mates on it. In . 2011 team-mate Mario Gomez scored a 25-minute hat-trick in a Champions . League win against Napoli, but in testament to the effect Schweinsteiger . has on the team his biggest concern post-match was that the central . midfielder had gone off with a broken collar bone.

Up . until then, Schweinsteiger was primarily a winger on the right or left, . having played full-back as a youngster, and was used as a utility . player. But . Van Gaal had Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery to play on either flank and . spotted traits in him of a powerful force in the middle of the park; . strong, not afraid to get stuck in, good in the air, an eye for a pass, . with potential for the spectacular at any moment. It is no wonder that reports have emerged that Van Gaal is keen on bringing him to Manchester United.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has no interest in records as he bids to maintain the champions’ winning momentum. City equalled a long-standing club best as they chalked up a ninth successive win in all competitions by beating West Brom 3-1 on Boxing Day. Their feat matches one first recorded by the club in 1910 and last achieved during their hot streak of autumn 2011, which memorably included a 6-1 thrashing of Manchester United. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini watches on during their 3-1 win over West Brom on Boxing Day . Fernando opened the scoring as he pounced on a Ben Foster error and Yaya Toure doubled the lead with a penalty after David Silva was fouled by former team-mate Joleon Lescott. Silva made it 3-0 with a well-taken third 11 minutes before half-time after Lescott gave away possession. City played a more conservative game in the second half as the rain and sleet developed into a heavy blizzard. That gave West Brom some encouragement and they claimed a deserved consolation three minutes from time as Joe Hart missed a corner and the ball ricocheted in off Brown Ideye. The victory kept City within three points of Chelsea at the top of the table but there is little time to reflect before Sunday’s game. Manchester City midfielder Fernando netted an acrobatic opener after eight minutes at The Hawthornes . Yaya Toure then converted a penalty to make it 2-0  just five minutes later . David Silva slotted in a third from inside the area just after half an hour . They now have a good chance to go one better as they host relegation battlers Burnley in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday, but Pellegrini is taking no notice of statistics. The Chilean said: 'Really I am not aware of the records. We just want to continue adding points because it will be a very close fight for the title this year and we want to keep our title.' City have played some superb football in recent weeks, making light of the absence of all their recognised strikers through injury. Stevan Jovetic did make the bench at The Hawthorns after recovering from a hamstring injury but was not required as City raced into a 2-0 lead within 13 minutes. James Milner has been playing as a makeshift striker as Manchester City have suffered injury problems . Stevan Jovetic could play against Burnley after recovering from injury . Captain Vincent Kompany could be set to return from injury to play on Sunday . Pellegrini said: 'This is very rare for me. Before 72 hours it is not good to play (again) but we know how it is here, in the Premier League. It is difficult for all the teams. 'The important thing is not to have an advantage for any one team.' Jovetic could come back into contention for City, who have operated in their last two games with midfielder James Milner as a makeshift centre-forward. Captain Vincent Kompany, the team’s talismanic central defender, could also return after hamstring and calf problems but the other two injured strikers, Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko, are still out. Pellegrini is taking nothing for granted against a Burnley side which have shown plenty of fighting spirit of late. He said: 'I have watched some games that they have played and I think they are playing well. I watched their game against Tottenham away. 'They are an offensive team, they play with two strikers and I think they have good players. If you think it is an easy game, you can have great problems. 'So we hope we will play against Burnley the same way we play against any other team.'","Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini says he has no interest in records .

Eric, 60, tragically lost the left side of his face four years ago after being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs when small growths called polyps grow into tumours. Unfortunately Eric didn’t discover the lump until it was too late and underwent dramatic surgery to have his left eye removed in order to save his life. Scroll down for video . It's back: Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies is back and in a new episode we meet Karen and Eric, who lost half of his face to a vicious cancer .

'It doesn't bother me, who I fell in love with is in here, this bit is just the outside. ‘Eric is now completely cured of the cancer so you have to take some things to gain others.’ Eric and 48-year-old Karen decided to visit Dr Christian Jessen on the TV show to see what could be done to help Eric. ‘We want to tell our story and show others that life isn’t all doom and gloom and that there are ways of curing these things; there is a light at the end of the tunnel,’ said Karen. The couple, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, can be seen on the show meeting with Dr Andrew Dawood of Dawood & Tanner, who is an expert in dental implant surgery and has been working on a bespoke procedure for Eric.

CCTV footage showed him buying the woman drinks and swigging from a champagne bottle at the nightclub, where guests have included Kate Moss, Kim Kardashian and Coldplay singer Chris Martin. Trial: Mohammed Aneizi, 26 (left) is accused of raping a drunken woman in a five-star hotel suite's bathroom after plying her with drinks at a London celebrity haunt. Gurkhan Suleyman (right) denies attempted rape . Isleworth Crown Court, west London, heard the drunk woman then returned with him and his friend Gurkhan Suleyman to a suite at the five-star hotel. There Aneizi is accused of raping her twice in the bathroom before leaving her for an hour without checking on her. Suleyman, 28, is also accused of attempted rape. The former director of mail-order cosmetics firm Verity Skincare took the stand today in his defence, saying the woman had insisted on coming home with him. He was shown the footage of himself buying the woman drinks in the early hours of May 24 last year. The footage showed him swigging champagne from the bottle and kissing the woman, then lying on a couch together before a friend of the woman tried to lift her up and encourage her to leave. Prosecutor Mark Seymour told Aneizi: ‘The problem here is that she [the victim] is completely drunk'. Aneizi, wearing a smart navy suit, replied: ‘Yes, she is very drunk and looks quite tired. ‘At this point she expressed feelings to her friend that she did not want to go home with her, but with me. Bathroom: The woman was allegedly attacked in a suite at Kensington's Royal Garden Hotel, pictured. She remained in the bathroom for an hour and was found in the foetal position by Aneizi, the court heard . ‘Her friend wasn’t very happy about this decision, and tried forcing her to go home against her will. ‘She kept saying she wanted to go home with me. ‘When she did decide to leave she got up unaided - so she can’t have been too drunk. ‘I told her friend that I would take care of her but she was not in agreement, and then the two girls had an argument.’ Aneizi and Suleyman then returned with the woman to the Royal Garden Hotel where the alleged attack took place in the suite’s bathroom while friends socialised in the lounge. Aneizi joined his friends at 4.15am but the woman remained in the bathroom for more than an hour. He told jurors he thought she was freshening up, but heard a loud commotion outside the bathroom an hour later and rushed to help. On finding her in the foetal position, Aneizi said he noticed £20 notes strewn over the floor. Mr Seymour told him: ‘During the course of the evening there had been quite a considerable amount of interest from your group about what you were doing... videos and photographs. Celebrity haunt: The pair met at Movida nightclub, where guests have included Kate Moss and Chris Martin . ‘You knew this lady wasn’t in a perfect condition, because she had slept all the way in the back of the car to the hotel. She was out of it. ‘You made a point in your police interview that she had been following you around, as if she didn’t want to be left alone. ‘You even go so far to say that she was stuck to you like glue. ‘You have just had sex in the bathroom, and you leave her freshening up and expect to see her quite soon after this point. ‘But you leave her in the bathroom for a whole hour. ‘During that time you make no effort whatsoever to check up on her, despite the state she was in.’ Aneizi, of Ealing, west London, maintained that the woman consented to sex throughout. Aneizi denies two counts of rape and Suleyman, of Beaminster, Dorset, denies one count of attempted rape. The trial continues. Following publication of this article, Mr Aneizi was aquitted of one count of rape.

"Facebook users could unwittingly reveal intimate details about their personal lives by declaring seemingly unrelated information, researchers have warned. Sexuality, drug use, political views and religious beliefs are all areas that can be accurately predicted by complete strangers monitoring online ‘inferences’, they said. The threat to privacy has been created by the social network’s ‘likes’ - the hugely popular system used to show approval of a range of subjects ranging from pop stars to chocolate bars, films, pastimes and interests. Giving too much away: University of Cambridge researchers found they could predict the sexuality and race of Facebook users with high levels of accuracy by looking at what they 'liked' (picture posed by model) Although seemingly innocuous, the information can be pieced together like a jigsaw to build up profiles. Declaring support for human rights, Wicked the Musical, Nike Basketball and Bruce Lee can be linked to provide a strong indicator of male homosexuality, for example. Drug use is suggested by ‘liking’ Big Mommas movies, milkshakes and swimming, while high IQs are indicated by showing a taste for curly fries, Godfather movies and Morgan Freeman’s voice. Researchers predicted male sexuality with 88 per cent accuracy and correctly predicted race 95 per cent of the time. They also had an 85 per cent success rate with political leanings and 82 per cent with religion. Campaigning organisation Privacy International said the technology threatened all aspects of people’s lives. Executive director Dr Gus Hosein said: ‘It’s a nightmare scenario that Facebook are entirely responsible for setting up. ‘This information can be used to pre-categorise people. Banks could use it to decide who gets a loan. Privacy issue: Facebook refused to comment on claims that users' privacy is not being protected . ‘It also creates the perfect surveillance state for governments, who will know what people are reading and their exact political persuasion. It is more invasive than CCTV.’ The study - Private Traits and Attributes Are Predictable from Digital Records of Human Behaviour - was carried out by the University of Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre and based on the Facebook profiles of 58,000 people in the US. Their ‘likes’ were fed into a computer algorithm which was used to predict a range of personality traits. Accuracy was checked by comparing results with personal information provided by the volunteers, who were mostly aged between 16 and 30. Few had clicked on ‘likes’ which explicitly revealed personal information about themselves. For example, just five per cent of homosexuals had clicked on links such as ‘gay marriage’. Psychometrics Centre operations director Michal Kosinski said: ‘We believe that our results, while based on Facebook likes, apply to a wider range of online behaviours. ‘Similar predications would be made from all manner of digital data, with this kind of secondary ‘inference’ made with remarkable accuracy - statistically predicting sensitive information people might not want revealed. ‘Given the variety of digital traces people leave behind, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for individuals to control.’ The findings will be of interest to the burgeoning online direct personalised marketing industry, which already uses ‘cookies’ to send tailored adverts to people surfing the net. But Mr Kosinski added: ‘I can imagine situations in which the same data and technology is used to predict political views or sexual orientation, posing threats to freedom or even life.’ Fears about threats to the privacy of Facebook users have increased since it was floated on Wall Street in a $100 billion share issue last year. Analysts warned it would need to find ways of generating more income from its 901 million monthly users, including 30 million in Britain. In December the company announced users of the Instagram photo-sharing website it owns no longer had the rights to their pictures, meaning images of people as young as 13 could be sold to advertisers. Facebook users can set privacy settings to protect their personal information - although many fail to do so. The company declined to comment.","The information can be pieced together like a jigsaw to build up profiles .

"Jenson Button’s future will finally be revealed by McLaren at a press conference on Thursday morning. The driver has widely been expected to end his 15-year career in Formula One, with chairman Ron Dennis and racing director Eric Boullier both at least initially preferring to partner the incoming Fernando Alonso with their other driver, Dane Kevin Magnussen. But McLaren’s perplexing delay in confirming their driver line-up for 2015 has given rise to speculation that Button, 34, could be saved. Jenson Button will find out if he has been retained by McLaren for the 2015 season on Friday . Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will re-join McLaren from Ferrari having left in 2007 . Button’s irritation with the windy process has been felt keenly by others within the team. One mechanic was overheard saying: ‘When will Ron make up his f****** mind?’ Dennis refused to be chivvied to a decision – a bloody-mindedness that cost the team ill-will with some of the public. Thursday’s unveiling at the McLaren’s Woking factory will trumpet their new associations with both Honda and double world champion Fernando Alonso, 33, who returns from Ferrari to the team where he spent a turbulent year in 2007. Mika Hakkinen, a double world champion with McLaren, told Swiss newspaper Blick that 'what is happening at McLaren is unworthy of such a team'. British Racing Drivers' Club president Derek Warwick claimed to the BBC McLaren's treatment of Button has been 'disgusting'. Button's 2014 team-mate Kevin Magnussen is also waiting to hear his fate on Thursday . Dennis held a board meeting last Thursday with two other primary shareholders in TAG co-owner Mansour Ojjeh and Mahmood Hashim Al Kooheji, CEO of Mumtalakat, Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund. It has since taken Dennis the last few days to finally arrive at a conclusion, ending the agonising wait for Button and Magnussen. Only last week Button said: 'I just want to get it done. I want to hear the decision as we all do so we can all move on in whatever direction.' At stake is Button's 15-season F1 career, although it is understood he has irons in the fire should Dennis opt for  Magnussen. Button won the world title with Brawn back in 2009 and has been at McLaren since 2010 . The 34-year-old Briton is lined up for a seat in the World Endurance Championship, with Toyota understood to be leading the pursuers. Button said: 'I'm now really comfortable, and whatever happens I will have a great year next year. 'New challenges are exciting, whether it's in Formula One with McLaren alongside an exciting team-mate, or whether it's elsewhere.'","McLaren will announce their 2015 line-up in press conference on Thursday .

"Racegoers at Kempton Park on Boxing Day will not only see five-time King George VI Chase winner Kauto Star paraded but also the unveiling of a specially commissioned statue to mark his remarkable record in the race. The sculpture, by Charlie Langton, is sited in the Parade Ring and is the culmination of eight months work. Langton said: ‘The over life-size sculpture took around three and half months to sculpt. I used over a ton of clay over the top of a steel framework. Five-time King George VI Chase winner Kauto Star (right) will have a statue unveiled at Kempton . ‘I also sought the advice of John Francome, who very kindly spared his time to come and see the sculpture developing. ‘Once we were happy with the clay version, it was moulded over the course of 10 days and then cast in bronze. ‘The casting took about four months, so combined with the sculpting time, the piece took about eight months to complete (or about 900 hours).’ The horse (centre) will also be present at Kempton on Boxing Day as the statue is unveiled . Kauto Star had a career spanning nine years and is widely heralded as one of the finest steeplechasers of all time. His five King Georges is one more than the great Desert Orchid, whose statue stands just outside the Kempton parade ring.

"Eddie Lacy ran for a touchdown and caught one of Aaron Rodgers' three TD passes as the Green Bay Packers built a 24-point lead before holding on for a 43-37 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on Monday. The Packers (10-3) earned their fifth consecutive victory to stay a game up on Detroit in the NFC North. Atlanta dropped to 5-8, but remained in a first-place tie with New Orleans in the woeful NFC South.

"Uncapped batsman Rilee Rossouw has been called up to replace the injured Quinton de Kock for South Africa's final two Tests against West Indies. Rossouw has played nine one-day internationals and three T20 matches for his country and could make his debut at St George's Park on Boxing Day. De Kock sustained an ankle ligament injury during the first Test, which the home side won by an innings and 220 runs, and is a doubt for the World Cup, which begins in February.

"It says everything about Eoin Morgan that England had to delay announcing him as one-day captain until Saturday because they could not contact him in Sydney. ‘When I got up there were about 20 missed calls from James Whitaker,’ said the man currently on Big Bash business in Australia. ‘So I thought I’d better give him a ring. He said, “We’d like to offer you the captaincy” and I was delighted. Being offered the captaincy is awesome. It’s a huge honour.’ Note that Morgan was paying little attention to what was going on in England without him. He must have known that Friday was World Cup squad decision day and surely he knew that Alastair Cook was under increasing pressure. Eoin Morgan has an excellent batting average when captaining England, and will hope to keep that up . The new captain, currently playing in Australia, wasn't checking his phone when the decision was made . Morgan is a calm, shrewd operator, who must have known he was likely to replace the sacked Cook . Yet the cool, calm, singular Irishman remained detached, not exactly waiting by his phone or scouring Twitter for news of the biggest development of his career. He is shrewd enough to know that he was the obvious alternative to Cook but his apparent indifference suggests that he will take his promotion in his stride. Eoin Morgan is truly his own man. It was fascinating to read the assessment of Ed Smith, who captained Morgan during his days at Middlesex, of the man who will try to make England credible World Cup challengers. ‘Gifted but calculating, affable but wary, engaging but hard to read, Eoin Morgan has played his hand well en route to the England captaincy,’ said Smith in The Sunday Times. ‘He is highly rated but not clearly understood. Just as he likes things.’ It sums up Morgan perfectly. Morgan can be hard to read, but he will bring a new energy, and a new outlook, to England's one-day game . Cook paid the price for poor performances with the bat and a slow scoring rate in Sri Lanka . Morgan is ambitious and talented, and has shown his talent both at home and in the global T20 leagues . England’s resolve to move on without Kevin Pietersen remains as strong as ever despite his desperate Twitter pleas and the appointment of his friend Eoin Morgan to the one-day captaincy. National selector James Whitaker was irritated when Pietersen’s name came up at Lord’s on Saturday and said: ‘No, no, no’ when asked if there was a way back for the sacked star. He added: ‘The ECB management made this decision in January and it is the same decision now. There is no way that Kevin Pietersen will ever get back into an England team. He’s no longer part of England cricket.’ So unless everybody at the ECB is sacked and replaced by a selection panel of Shane Warne, Michael Vaughan and Piers Morgan there is no way back for Pietersen. The Dubliner is nothing if not ambitious, as he showed when he threw in his lot with England in 2009 three years after making his one-day debut with Ireland. This is a significant change of policy by England, an admission that they have to think of 50-over cricket as an extension of Twenty20 rather than a reduced form of Test cricket. They need a different approach and largely different personnel. Sportsmail understands their original intention was to replace Cook as one-day captain after the World Cup with Joe Root. But a change of plan has been necessary now. For the first time, England will have different captains for different formats, with Morgan almost certain to replace Stuart Broad as Twenty20 captain to unite the limited-overs formats. ‘To have two captains gives us the chance to develop a one-day side in a slightly different way,’ said managing director Paul Downton. ‘It may well be that we will look to evolve slightly different teams.’ So what sort of captain will Morgan be? Well, he will lead England in his own, calm image. The ECB had intended to make Joe Root captain after the World Cup, but had to make the decision earlier . Replacing Cook with Morgan indicates that England have decided to treat ODIs more like T20s than Tests . ‘I really enjoy being captain,’ said Morgan. ‘It puts a lot more onus on your performance, your contribution to the team and your tactics as the game unfolds. Those are things I really enjoy. As captain I want to keep things simple and honest. 'I don’t have a huge amount of time to influence the side but my main aspirations for the group are to take advantage of them being naturally hard-working and skilful.’ There are the makings of a decent England one-day side here. The question, in the short term, is whether they will have any better chance of causing an upset at the World Cup with Morgan rather than Cook in charge. We will soon discover the answer.","Eoin Morgan will be England's ODI captain for upcoming World Cup .

"Gary Anderson is ready to compete with the big boys again at the World Darts Championship after a traumatic last few years affected his performances on the big stage. Having reached the final in 2011, the world No 4 hasn’t produced his best at Alexandra Palace in the last three years after losing his brother Stewart to a heart attack in September of that year and seeing his dad pass away six months later. But Anderson, who plays his first-round match on Saturday night, has enjoyed a good year on the tour and is now hoping to recapture the form that took him to the brink of the world title four years ago. After a few tough years Gary Anderson is finding his best form at the right time for this year's championships . The Alexandra Palace crowds haven't drawn the best from Anderson since his appearance in the 2011 final . He told Sportsmail: ‘I’ve always said that family come first and it was hard. People were talking about my finishing but I couldn’t give two damns what they thought or said. ‘If anyone in the world says “that’s just the way it goes” then they’re idiots. ‘I’ve only ever played darts for me and when it’s going well I’m enjoying it and I’m happy. For me, darts is just a game that I’ve played since I was 24 and it has turned out to be my job. ‘I’ve had too much on in the past few years, but now everything has settled it has been a good year.’ Anderson changed his darts after his narrow 4-3 defeat by eventual champion Michael van Gerwen in the third round last year in a bid to rediscover his form. He has also welcomed a new addition to the family - his eight-month-old son Tai. Anderson will face one of Mike McGrath or Scott Kirchner in his first round match on Saturday . Anderson was knocked out by eventual champion Michael van Gerwen last year, leading to a change of darts . And the lift in his spirits have seen his results improve this year, so much so that he enters the tournament as the No 4 seed when last year he was as low as No 18. On the birth of his son Tai, Anderson said: ‘It was a huge weight off my shoulders and I’m enjoying things just now which makes my darts a lot easier for me. The last couple of years I wasn’t enjoying my darts, but I have this year.’ Anderson will face either Mike McGrath or Scott Kirchner in the first round at Alexandra Palace, and he admitted that he doesn’t know too much about his potential opponents. ‘It’s always a bad thing because I like to know who I’m playing against,’ the world No 4 said. ‘You can’t keep a tab on every player in the world and in the last few years I have had really tough games in the first round. But that is the way it is now because there are so many good players these days.’","Gary Anderson hasn't performed on biggest stage since 2011 final .

"As England's leading wicket taker, you would expect James Anderson's childhood sporting hero to be a fellow fast bowler such as Darren Gough, or perhaps Sir Ian Botham. But the Burnley-born pace ace says the person he most admired when he was younger was, in fact, former Arsenal striker Ian Wright. Anderson told Sport magazine: 'When I played football at school, I liked to be up front and score goals - so Ian Wright was an obvious one'. Unlikely hero: James Anderson has revealed his childhood sporting idol was Ian Wright (below) The 32-year-old, who is expected to play for England in their final one-day international against India at Headingley on Friday, has taken 653 wickets for his country and needs just four more to overtake Botham and get to the top of the nation's Test list. Wright, meanwhile, scored just nine goals in 33 matches for England but was a legend at Arsenal, where he hit 185, which was a club record until it was overtaken by Thierry Henry. Anderson also revealed that his other sporting hero was another non-cricketer, the former tennis player Boris Becker, because, 'I just liked how he threw himself around the court, especially at Wimbledon'.

"Perhaps not surprisingly considering his name, Burnley striker Lukas Jutkiewicz has been mistaken for a foreigner on occasion. ‘When people meet me, they seem to speak a little bit slower and then they realise I’m as English as they come,’ says Southampton-born Jutkiewicz, who has never set foot in Poland despite his heritage.

In the last three games, Burnley have become the first Premier League club since Blackpool in 2011 to field a starting XI made up entirely of players born in Britain. Until now, Belfast-born defender Michael Duff and Republic of Ireland international Stephen Ward were the only exceptions. That will be music to the ears of FA chairman Greg Dyke who has made it his mission to increase the number of home-grown players in a league that has thrived from attracting some of the top talent in world football. The feeling around Burnley is that it might even be the key to Sean Dyche’s team surviving in the top flight this season.

Burnley's Lukas Jutkiewicz looks to shoot during the Premier League match against Aston Villa last month . ‘We love it,’ said midfielder George Boyd. ‘You get that grit from the British players, they all want to work hard. It’s a big factor for us as a club, we all put a shift in. ‘It’s that working-class attitude. It’s instilled in you, especially being from Britain, that you need to work hard to get anything in life. We’re highest on the work-rate stats and distance covered, and that’s something we pride ourselves on . . . you don’t always need to go foreign to do well in the Premier League.’ Burnley’s track record of signing foreign players down the years is patchy at best. For every Brian Jensen, Christian Kalvenes or Joey Gudjonsson, there are more than a few who didn’t work out. Supporters still wince at the mere mention of Frederic Nimani, Besart Berisha and Fernando Guerrero. Marco Gentile, the nephew of Italy’s World Cup winner Claudio, also disappeared after his only game in 1997. Burnley's George Boyd advances with the ball during the match against Spurs at White Hart Lane .

Dane Richards, Burnley’s last foreigner who was signed by Eddie Howe in 2012, made his league debut under Dyche as a substitute against Huddersfield and was then substituted himself 45 minutes later. The Jamaica international did not play for the club again. Despite Burnley’s reliance on British-born players, Dyche insists there is no club policy against buying foreigners. He argues that the lack of a European scouting network has made it difficult for Burnley to compete with the bigger clubs, although that could change after former Manchester United and Everton scout Robbie Cooke was appointed last month to oversee the international operation.

Dyche (left) and Danny Ings celebrate after Burnley win promotion from the Championship last season . ‘There’s a lot made about it but, as a manager, you’re not really bothered where players come from,’ said Dyche. ‘You see beyond all the cultures, colours, and creeds. You want good footballers and I’m no different. ‘Plenty of teams are doing well without a core of British players, and if players become available who are not from these shores then we’ll certainly look at that.’ He added: ‘There are a lot of fans out there who like our journey. Loads of people say, “We think it’s great and we want you to stay up”. There’s a story beyond the story, which is a smaller club developing players without major resources, British or not. The thing is, they like the story.’","Burnley have become the first Premier League club since Blackpool in 2011 to field a starting XI made up entirely of players born in Britain .
