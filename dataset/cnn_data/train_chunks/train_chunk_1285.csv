"One of the most fascinating aspects of Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room. It’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey-dovey as people might presume. Players are always getting on each other’s nerves or having issues to resolve. You hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a World Cup but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen say a good coach would have managed the situation . Kevin Pietersen has lifted the lid on all the frailties and insecurities in the dressing room . There will always be tensions, particularly when you consider the highly-pressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed. The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn’t get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments, but that doesn’t really matter. As I said in these pages the other day, Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didn’t get on. Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team. But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team. I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week, and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam. It is why there will always be niggles between team-mates and why they won’t always get on. Team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn't get on at Manchester United . I’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be. There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other. When you are away for three months, you can’t expect everyone to go out together every night. You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates. There was plenty of banter and mickey-taking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick, perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young, was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line. Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton, for one, would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot. It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so. Darren Gough (left) and Andy Caddick had their moments when Nasser Hussain was England captain . That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickey-taking in any England team I have played in — or watched — to be bullying. Yes, the England team is a tough school but if you can’t cope with a few tough words from your team-mates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin? But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said. I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue. Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition. They will look at that and say: ‘We’ve got this lot on the run. They are at each other.’ It just wasn’t a good look and I’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now. Nasser Hussain tried to embrace ‘difficult characters' like Phil Tufnell when he was England captain . And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful. That really is school yard stuff. The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability, and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging. For me, it would hit a lot harder if one of my team-mates, rather than the coach or captain, had a word with me after something and said: ‘Come on Nas, you can do better than that.’ Clearly, this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didn’t like to be treated in that way. It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings. The admonishing of players in the field is one example. Another is their reliance on statistics when, at times, they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more. When I was captain I would try to embrace the so-called ‘difficult characters’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldn’t. If people like Phil Tufnell, Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me. Andy Flower (right) tried to keep KP onside so England would benefit from his considerable talent . You have to treat everyone differently. Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had, but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such. The key with KP, clearly, was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved. But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years, he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the match-winning innings of which he was capable. It’s all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldn’t he? He was a young player finding his way and there’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior. Pietersen's lucrative contract with Indian Premier League had repercussions for England team . Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League. It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team, and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making. The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed. Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen. When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was, England decided enough was enough. As I have said, there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work. Everybody can’t be wrong. So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England. He might have to look back and say: ‘Was it me?’","Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography has lifted the lid of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room .

"'Pointless': Many signs on the roads duplicate information or serve no obvious purpose . Fed up of road signs warning of obvious speed bumps and lane closures, or just informing you that the sign isn’t in use? Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has called for an end to ‘pointless’ signs – saying they confuse drivers and make the roads more dangerous. Regulations are set to be tightened up, as it is revealed the number of signs cluttering Britain’s roads has more than doubled in 20 years to 4.5million. This is around one sign for every seven cars on the roads. Patrick McLoughlin said councils could clamp down on the constant alerts to motorists about loading restrictions, clearways, humps and speed limits, which are distracting and state the obvious. ‘Over the past two decades we’ve seen a huge rise in the number of unnecessary signs blotting the landscapes of our towns and cities’, he said. ‘Many of the signs that go up are simply not needed and it has got to stop. As well as spoiling otherwise beautiful areas of the country, pointless signs just confuse drivers and make the roads less safe.’ A survey last year by an insurance company found one in three drivers admitted having a crash or a near miss because of baffling road signs. The Department for Transport admitted at the time that Britain has around 9,000 signs which are redundant or misleading and need to be revised. It was also revealed by the survey that most people have no idea what many road signs mean. The number of clearaway signs, in yellow and black which mean no stopping between certain times, has soared in the past 20 years, yet the survey suggested 83pc of people do not understand them. Nearly 7 in 10 people did not understand the red and blue circle which means no waiting, and half of drivers could not decipher a sign pointing out the correct lanes at a junction ahead. Crackdown: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said unnecessary signs make the roads less safe . A Transport department source said: ‘We’re pushing for councils to stop pointlessly putting up loads of road signs where fewer would do the job fine. ‘It has become an issue as councils appear to have designated people whose job it is to handle what signs go up, some of whom are probably overzealous. It can end up looking hideous and all it does is confuse drivers.’ The department issued new guidance to councils about cutting pointless road signs last year. Now they are going further by consulting on implementing central regulations. Drivers will be asked whether they want to get rid of the requirement for speed limit repeater signs, and also axe signs when there are already road markings which provide adequate guidance. Research published today shows the number of signs for speed bumps has soared by 2,000 per cent in 20 years. There were under 5,000 in 1993, and nearly 100,000 today. The number of signs for clearways has risen from 3,444 to more than 110,000, priority restrictions from 1,572 to 23,000 and speed limit signs doubled from around 225,000 to 442,000. The problem was symbolised two years ago by the village of Feock in Cornwall, which took on the council when the number of road signs reached a staggering 900 - one for every three residents. It was given the dubious honour of Britain’s most over-signed place, with its quaint country lanes and stunning views blighted by hundreds of duplicate direction sign posts and give way signs. But after a battle with the council, it agreed to remove nearly 200 pointless signs.","Patrick McLoughlin has called for an end to 'pointless' road signs .

"They had names like Thorfinn Skull-splitter, Erik Bloodaxe and Ragnar Hairy Pants. No wonder the Vikings have a rough and bloody reputation. A new exhibition at the British Museum strives to make people think again about the Scandinavian pillagers whose name means 'pirate' in Old Norse. Through their ships, weapons, crafts, words and even skeletons, 'Vikings: Life and Legend' aims to show how Viking energy and ideas redrew the map of the world. 'They were a global phenomenon,' exhibition curator Gareth Williams said of the bearded buccaneers who sailed forth in the 9th century to descend on terrified English monks, Irish villagers and Russian peasants. 'They were raiders and they were traders and they were craftsmen and they were explorers.' Scroll down for video .

A . 1,000-year-old book called the 'Havamal,' a trove of Viking folk wisdom, . advises that 'the best thing in life is to be alive and happy' and says . people should leave nothing behind after death but their good names.

"For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In his new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - Redknapp reveals the ways in which the Premier League radically changed English football. When we first heard about the Premier League, we all thought it was just a change of name. Division One was now going to be called the Premier League - but what a load of rubbish that turned out to be. Once the new league started in 1992, everything about our game changed. It became about foreign players, foreign coaches and foreign wages to keep up with the biggest clubs in Europe. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Redknapp say record signings used to get the bus to games .

Redknapp, pictured as Queens Park Rangers boss in 2013, believes the Premier League was revolutionary . The former West Ham United boss, taking training at Chadwell Heath, was forced to change his methods . An influx of foreigners, like Paolo di Canio (right), ensured that British managers changed their ways . The days of walking in, shouting and screaming and throwing teacups at players were gone. There is no point effing and blinding at a player who can hardly speak English. You had to talk to them, slowly, reasonably. An awful lot of British coaches ruled by fear and bullying, and the foreign players wouldn’t accept that. They weren’t used to being talked to like that, being embarrassed or humiliated in front of their team-mates. The whole dynamic of English football has altered. During one of their rows, Roy Keane accused Sir Alex Ferguson of having changed. Alex’s response was: ‘Of course I’ve changed. How could I have survived this long if I hadn’t changed?’ He’s right, of course. We’ve all had to change to deal with the demands of modern football.

Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . It’s not just that players have agents, it’s that those agents sometimes have a better line of communication to the chairman than the manager. And it’s not just that the players know who the chairman is - it is that they are on first-name terms and think nothing of putting in a call if they are unhappy with anything from team selection to training. What certainly altered was the way you tried to build team spirit. The old methods were very simple - bonding sessions, getting the lads to go out for a drink or have a day at the races. Everybody laughs, falls about, gets into a few scrapes. A typical jolly boys’ outing, but the foreign players didn’t want to know about that. I can remember during my time at Tottenham I took the lads to the Cheltenham races. I thought we’d have some fun, relax together, come back a bit tighter as a unit - but you would have thought I’d taken them on a prison visit. About eight of them were looking at their watches after half an hour. What are we doing here? Why have you brought us here? Tottenham's foreign players, who included Rafael van der Vaart, Emmanuel Adebayor and Younes Kaboul, pictured here in 2011, were not impressed when Redknapp took them to the Cheltenham races .

Redknapp realised taking players out for a bit of fun during his time at Tottenham was no longer possible . The Queens Park Rangers manager selects his best XI from the early era of the Premier League . Roman Pavlyuchenko never moved out of his seat all day. Just sat there, waiting for the time to get on the coach and go home. Wouldn’t watch a race, wouldn’t have a bet, just not interested in joining in. In the end, it has been the English footballers who have had to change because at most clubs now they are isolated. It is a different life for them now. I remember Paolo Di Canio brought his fitness coach to West Ham. The food at the training ground changed, too. Lunches at Chadwell Heath had barely altered since my day - steak and kidney pie, loads of potatoes, anything you could get. By the end of that first season with Paolo’s man, everyone had their own tailored, balanced food intake and a special dietician supervised that regime. Paolo Di Canio (left), pictured being tackled by Steven Gerrard, helped change dietary conditions at West Ham . My best team for this period includes possibly the most controversial selection of my whole book: Matt Le Tissier instead of David Beckham. I know some people will think I’ve gone mad. But David was a fantastic player in a fantastic team, whereas Matt was performing heroics that built a football club. Without him, Southampton couldn’t have stayed in the top division for so long, and without that they would not have been able to build their new stadium and its fabulous academy that saw players like Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott come through the ranks. Le Tissier’s 10 greatest goals would stand alongside those by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo -even Diego Maradona or Pele. He was a one-man band there for a lot of the time, like Sir Tom Finney had been at Preston. Matt Le Tissier, pictured playing for Southampton, could have starred for a bigger club says Redknapp . The former Saints star was happy to remain at the club as it was close to his family in the Channel Islands . Redknapp believes Le Tissier's best goals are comparable to those of Diego Maradona (left) and Pele (right) People would ask ‘Why isn’t he playing for Manchester United then?’ He was just happy to be at a club he had known since he was 16, happy to be 30 minutes away from his family in the Channel Islands. I think he would have been brilliant at a club like Arsenal, but just because he didn’t make that jump doesn’t mean he’s not smart. Patrick Vieira was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now. He almost came to me at Tottenham from Inter Milan. I thought it was an incredible decision by him, after he’d been such a hero at Arsenal. Patrick Vieira, pictured struggling with Frank Lampard, helped to introduce physicality into English football . Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side, who were champions in 2003-04, are up with the best teams ever, says Redknapp . The Invincibles are comparable with Manchester United's 'Busby Babes', pictured here in 1957 . The front cover of Harry Redknapp's new book . I met him at his house in Hampstead and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get. He had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away. I remember talking to Daniel Levy, our chairman, about him. He said the crowd would be hostile. I knew that - but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before, I thought it said something about the man. In the end, his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in Italy. By the time he did become available - the following January - our needs had changed and Manchester City snapped him up. Patrick is the player Arsenal have never really replaced, but I still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at Manchester City. Shouldn’t he be at Arsenal? It is ironic that so many associate Arsene Wenger with the beautiful game, yet his Arsenal teams, with Vieira - the ultimate box-to-box midfielder - did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern Premier League. Teams got bigger to compete with Arsenal because they were so strong. They were up there with any of the great post-War teams - the Busby Babes, Tottenham’s Double winners, Revie’s Leeds United, the great Liverpool teams, Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson - they deserve to be mentioned with any of them.

Land Rover says this system could be used on and off-road, from coupling a trailer to spotting obstacles during extreme off-road driving. The off-road remote operation function has been dubbed All-Terrain Progress Control and the company claims that it will be ‘semi-autonomous.’ Off-road exploring is further helped by something known as ‘Wade Aid’ which measures depth in patches of water to prevent the vehicle from getting stuck. The car has a huge boot and seating for up to seven, and doors that open with just the swipe of your hand . Laser positioning sensors, gesture-controlled technology and an 'invisible' bonnet that that allows the driver to see through the metal to the ground beneath their vehicles . The off-road remote operation function has been dubbed All-Terrain Progress Control . The system acts like an electronic periscope to project image from below the car onto the windscreen in front of the driver. Cameras in the vehicle’s grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead. This video image is then transmitted digitally to a Head-Up Display of the type already used on many luxury and executive cars to project sat-nav and speed  details onto the windscreen. The virtual image of the ground is superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet. This allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently ‘see-through’ the front of the car. The ‘see through’ bonnet meanwhile combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen. Although designed principally for those who want to better spot rocky terrain or deep crevices  when they take their 4X4s seriously off-road, it could even have some use in the urban jungle by allowing drivers to spot and avoid potholes lurking just out of sight. The car will also be practical with a huge boot and seating for up to seven, with the arrangement operated by touchscreen. Visibility is boosted with the use of day-like light of the laser headlamps which feature smart object tracking and beam-dipping to improve driver safety. Land Rover is set to showcase the Discovery Vision at this week's New York Motor Show, with the car going on sale later next year. The first car will be based on the current Range Rover Evoque and has an estimated starting price of around £30,000 ($50,100). The car will go sale later next year with a starting price of around £30,000 (US$50,100) A fleet of Range Rover vehicles at the exclusive event to globally unveil the Discovery Vision Concept at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York . Remote control drive was seen in the 1997 James Bond film 'Tomorrow Never Dies' in which Bond operates his car (right) from the backseat with a remote control that doubles as a mobile (left) Gerry McGovern, design director and chief creative officer at Land Rover, said: ‘The Discovery Concept vehicle represents a Vision of our future family of leisure SUVs. ‘Its modern, relevant and compelling design is a significant shift from Discovery as we know it, while well considered practicality, configurability and Land Rover's capability seamlessly blend to create a highly desirable vehicle that connects on an emotional level.’ The new Discovery is the latest model announced by prolific Jaguar Land Rover, which is experiencing its greatest ever period. Sales and profits are increasing thanks to models like the Range Rover Evoque and Jaguar F-Type. The company is also investing billions in research and development and the hard work is paying off. Last year it delivered 425,000 vehicles, an increase of 19 per cent. The new Discovery is the latest model announced by prolific Jaguar Land Rover, which is experiencing its greatest ever period.

"A police officer was paid £9,000 for tripping over a pothole in his station's car park thanks to a compensation culture which campaigners say will 'make people's blood boil'. The unnamed female officer settled out-of-court after hurting her ankle when she fell over in Eastbourne, East Sussex, three years ago. Another officer was given £500 by Sussex Police because he was bitten on the behind by his police dog. Compensation culture: The claims were revealed under Freedom of Information laws . A policeman who hurt his tooth after using a riot shield upside-down, another who was singed during firearms training and a third who opened a window only for it to fall on him also feature in a catalogue of claims brought by officers against their own police force. Other cases which the force are still disputing could end up costing far more - with some pending claims already expected to exceed £100,000. Bitten: One policeman was handed £500 after his rear was bitten by a police dog . Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws show that an officer claimed after slipping on a wet floor in the custody suite of Crawley, East Sussex, in March 2011. He twisted his knee despite warnings that the floor was slippery, and is now pursuing his force for a payout. The TaxPayers' Alliance today claimed the cases will 'make people's blood boil' and infuriate other officers who do not make such claims. The officer with the hurt tooth, who is left-handed, sought damages after being given a right-handed shield, which he said led to injury as he had to use it 'the wrong way up'. However, in this case, in Midhurst in February 2011, the force did not accept liability. Meanwhile, another officer received money after a window fell on him as he opened it. He received £1,588 in March 2013 following the incident in Worthing because he suffered an injury to his left hand. An officer received £500 after being injured during firearms training at Gatwick in January 2013. On this occasion the police officer suffered 'significant burns to the neck' from a shell casing which was ejected from a gun. In total Sussex Police paid out £21,088 in out-of-court settlements between January 2011 and December 2013. July 2011: Hastings, claimant walked through a door and shutter fell and hit him, paid £2,000 out-of-court . July 2011: Lewes HQ, a colleague used too much force and bent an officer's thumb back towards his wrist paid £6,000 out-of-court . May 2012: Brighton, claimant bitten by dog. Received £500 out-of-court . February 2011: Eastbourne claimant slips on pothole, paid £9,000 out-of-court . August 2012: Hassocks, claimant bitten by dog, paid £1,200 out-of-court . January 2013: Gatwick, shell casing from gun ejected and injured claimant, paid £500 out-of-court . March 2013: Worthing, claimant opened window which then fell on him, paid £1,588 out-of-court . September 2012: Seaford, claimant bitten by dog, paid £500 out-of-court. Cases which are still open: . December 2011: Sussex House, Brighton, claimant slipped on ice in car park . No date: Brighton, bullying and harassment . June 2012: Brighton, bitten by police dog . November 2011: Hove, Claimant trapped between moving police vehicle and crowd at riot . November 1998: force-wide, claimant suffers PTSD from undercover work. A number of cases are still open although 'reserve values' - how much has been set aside to potentially payout - have been agreed. Three of these values are set at £100,000. One involves an incident in December 2011 in Brighton, after a police officer slipped on ice in a police station car park at Sussex House. A second £100,000 pounds value has been set for an incident in Brighton in June 2012 when a police officer, acting as a 'stooge' in dog training was bitten. The third dates from 1998 and relates to an officer carrying out undercover work who reportedly suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. A Sussex Police statement said: 'Our Civil Claims Unit looks to make sure that any claims are dealt with fairly, professionally and in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules and Protocols. 'The nature of police work means it is unpredictable and officers and staff can, unfortunately, occasionally get injured during operations, daily duty or training exercises. 'All the claims are assessed on the severity of the injuries, the circumstances in which they were received and the question of liability is always fully investigated objectively. 'Where liability exists, compensation is paid to minimise the impact of the injury and feedback is given to ensure that any lessons that can be learnt.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'These claims will make people's blood boil, and wind up officers on the front line who don't make such ludicrous claims. 'The police do a difficult job and those hurt in the line of duty deserve support, but clearly some of these cases and the amounts involved are spurious to the extreme. 'Its time police chiefs stamped out the compensation culture that has crept into parts of the police station.'","Officer tripped in Eastbourne and claimed the payout against Sussex Police .

"Smiling: McKinlay, who boasted her two favourite things were 'money and sex', was cleared of running a £500,000 prostitution racket yesterday . As a woman whose career has long . revolved around her two favourite things – money and sex – Marie . McKinlay knows the value of appearance. During her two-week stint at . Southwark Crown Court, where she was accused of controlling a . £500,000-a-year high-class prostitution ring, the 40-year-old . established something of a routine. Each morning, she would walk up the . court steps dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a loose jumper, make-up . free face largely hidden beneath a pair of over-sized sunglasses. Once inside, the seven-months . pregnant mother-of-two would head to the lavatories where she would slip . into a sophisticated black dress and apply her make up. ‘I don’t need . to impress them [the photographers waiting outside],’ she declared as . she sat outside the courtroom one morning. The meaning of this pronouncement was . clear – the only people Marie McKinlay wanted to make a positive . impression on were judge and jury. It must have worked, for yesterday . McKinlay was cleared of controlling prostitution for gain and of . converting criminal property (more commonly known as money laundering) between December 2008 and July 2011. She raised her trembling hands to her . mouth and burst into tears as the verdict was read out. It leaves her . free, if she chooses, to resume business. Prostitution is not illegal, but . controlling prostitutes is and there is no doubt that McKinlay has . reaped the benefits of a lucrative trade, albeit working within the law. She was cleared after the jury heard . that she did not control the girls who worked at Agency Allure with an . iron fist, but instead acted as their agent, taking only a commission . payment. The girls, she said, were her . friends. One is godmother to her children – she has two daughters aged . eight and nine – and she is about to be maid of honour to another. So who is Marie McKinlay, and what . took a West End wardrobe assistant from backstage at Miss Saigon to the . top of a lucrative, but decidedly less salubrious industry, earning . enough money to put her daughters through private school in Hampshire? McKinlay – or Claudia as she was . known to Allure’s clients – was born in Stoke Newington, North London, . in 1972. Her mother Ruth, 56, was an insurance clerk. No father’s name . was listed on her birth certificate. At her home in Lewisham yesterday, Mrs McKinlay said only that she was ‘embarrassed’ by her daughter’s predicament. The young McKinlay spent her . formative years in Scotland with grandparents James and Wilma, only . returning to London at the age of 12. After leaving school, she began . work as a wardrobe assistant. Voyeurism: At Southwark Crown Court (pictured), Parsons also admitted to making or possessing 61 indecent photographs and distributing one image of children between four and ten-years-old . This, however, was not enough for a young woman with pound signs in her eyes. Her ‘hostess skills’ were honed at . the Stork Club, in Piccadilly, a venue owned by vice king Oscar Owide – . once described as Britain’s biggest pimp – who served a prison sentence . for VAT fraud. McKinlay claims she left the club because she ‘got . sick of the drinking’, telling jurors she had to ‘drink champagne and . only champagne’ from 9pm to 2am every day. The enterprising McKinlay used her . ‘experience’ as a stepping stone, working independently as an escort . before setting up Allure. The picture she painted in court . could not have been further removed from the gritty underbelly of the . vice industry. Agency Allure, she said, was a group enterprise, formed . with five other women over a bottle of Chardonnay at the upmarket . department store Selfridges. It was, apparently, to be a business where . ‘women were in control’. Asked why she began in the trade, she . declared: ‘I’ve been asked this question many times and the way I . answer it is, my two favourite things in the world are money and sex. I . absolutely love both of them, and a job that allows me to put them both . together, why wouldn’t I?’ The glamorous brunette was once a wardrobe assistant backstage at Miss Saigon . Listening to McKinlay, the world of . sex for sale appears to be one long merry-go-round of worldwide travel – . Dubai, Paris, Geneva – high-class hotels and money. As for the clients, . McKinlay declared them ‘a class of gentlemen I had never met before’. Exactly what class of gentlemen is . drawn to an agency offering ‘busty London escorts’ who provide . everything from ‘girlfriend experience to porn star experience’? Well, ones that can afford up to £500 for an hour or £2,500 for a 14-hour overnight stay with the girl of their choice. By 2003 McKinlay’s involvement with . the trade appears to have been more administrative. She was pregnant . with her first girl, now nine, and began running the agency from her new . home in Southampton. She had a second daughter a year . later and by 2008 she was the sole founding member of Allure – and . presumably the sole beneficiary of whatever was left, after advertising . costs, of the 30 per cent commission each girl handed over. In court it . was said McKinlay earned £90,000 in the first six months of 2011 alone. Her business acumen, if one can call it that, appears to come from the most unlikely source. ‘Let’s just say that I have a lot of . respect for John Lewis’s ethos of “Never Knowingly Undersold”,’ she . declared when being quizzed about her pricing policy on an internet . forum last year. ‘I think that it’s a good way for ANY business to . behave.’ Quite what solidly respectable John Lewis would make of her use of its phrase is open to conjecture. So . what of McKinlay’s daughters? Their birth certificates, like their . mother’s, have a blank space where a  father’s name should be. McKinlay did marry, in 1998 at . Chelsea Register Office to a 25-year-old English student. Curiously, . however, friends knew nothing of the marriage and say he is gay. It . ended in divorce last year, on the basis that they had lived apart for . more than five years. He says only ‘it was a long time ago’. McKinlay was arrested by British . Transport Police, who had been investigating sex trafficking. She did . not, it should be made clear, take part in trafficking, but the . investigation led to her because she is believed to have unknowingly . acted as agent for someone who had been trafficked. Until then, she had rented the  £1,500-a-month home in a wealthy suburb of Southampton. A neighbour said: ‘Everybody in the . square was gossiping about what she did for a living. She always walked . very tall and proud, was well-spoken and smartly dressed – but never . extravagantly. Her fashion sense certainly never gave any indication of . what she did for a living.’ Since her arrest, McKinlay has been . living in a modern four-bedroom property, complete with solar panels, . perched on a hilltop in a village near Frome, Somerset, with her . 29-year-old former next-door neighbour Adrian Noakes. A local said: ‘We thought there was . something a bit odd about the pair of them. They never seemed to go . anywhere and hardly anyone ever seemed to visit them. They had two . children with them. ‘Marie claimed to be running a firm which can push a firm up the internet search listings. ‘We hadn’t seen Marie for a few days and now we know why.’","Marie McKinlay, who boasted her two favourite .

"It's well-known that elephants are intelligent and graceful creatures - but these animals have taken that reputation a step further by becoming professional painters. The group of seven Asian elephants  hold specially-designed brushed in their trunks, which they use to create beautiful floral scenes. And the clever mammals, who live in Thailand have even developed a skill that humans can't match - the ability to suck up paint in their trunks to spray it over a canvas like an aerosol can. Scroll down for video . Artist at work: An Asian elephant puts his trunk into it as he works on a huge canvas . Art attack: This elephant, with the help of his minder, takes aim at a canvas at Maesa Elephant Camp in Thailand . Careful and not so careful: Sometimes the elephants wield specially-designed brushed with their trunks (left) - while other times they take the less subtle approach of painting with their feet . For slightly less precise images, the elephants can also use their huge feet - which they dip in paint then use to daub large canvasses on the floor. The amazing fruits of their labour are then sold on by the sanctuary - for as much as £1,300 each - and the money used to support the Maesa Elephant Camp, where the seven live. Teaching elephants to paint was a technique pioneer at Maesa, and is now used in several other sanctuaries to help raise money for the animals. Art teacher: The elephants are guided in their work by trainers, who can direct their trunks by rubbing their ears . Beginners and advanced: Some images are simply abstract collections of colour, (left) while more skilled elephant painters can produce realistic images like  bunches of flowers (right) Earning their keep: The sanctuary sells the paintings, which gives them extra revenue to care for the elephants . The most sophisticated elephant artists - who were trained by a Chinese painter nine years ago - are now skilled enough to paint realistic-looking bunches of flowers, rather than the more impressionistic work favour by the others. When creating the works, the elephants are guided by a trainer, who gives them instructions by rubbing their ears in a particular way. The . elephants use a special non-toxic paint, and adapted paint brushes that . make it comfortable for them to hold with their trunks. The . paintings mostly feature primary colours, as elephants' ability to distinguish between different shades is limited. Buyers: The elephant paintings, some of which are shown on the wall here, can fetch as much as £1,300 at auction . Landscape: THe elephants at Maesa Elephant Camp, in Thailand, have been painting for 13 years . 'Perfect tool': Elephants' trunks have been described as an ideal implement for painting . The elephants at work were captured French photographer Olivier Blaise. Mr Blaise, 48, said: 'The agility and sensitivity of an elephant's trunk means that it's a perfect tool for painting. The gesture is both sweeping and very precise!' 'The trunk is also used like an aerosol spray, as the paint is diluted with water it is a fun and natural way for the elephants to paint.' The paintings, which are around 120cm in width, and vary in length, are sold on site at Maesa and also in auctions, with typical prices ranges from £205 to £1,300.","Seven artistic elephants live in Maesa Elephant Camp, Chiang Mai, Thailand .

"Dutch photographer Niki Feijen has criss-crossed the world looking for crumbling beauty lurking beneath a thick layer of dust inside long-forgotten buildings. Feijen, who made headlines last year with his first self-published book of photographs titled Disciple of Decay, is now preparing to unveil to the world his latest project titled Frozen. The new book, which is due to be released on September 17 at the Berliner Liste art fair in Berlin, features 184 pages of stunning interiors of abandoned mansions, mental institutions and churches from around the world. Exploring decay: Dutch photographer Niki Feijen has traversed the world looking for crumbling beauty lurking beneath a thick layer of dust inside private bedrooms and public buildings . Globe-trotter: For years, the Dutchman has been traveling the world looking for boarded up buildings . Sequel: Feijen is now preparing to unveil to the world his latest project titled Frozen as a follow-up on his self-published book Disciple of Decay . Hallowed ground: Feijen has always been interested in religious spaces, such as deserted chapels and small churches that haven't been in use in years . Time lapse: This image shows what appears to be a deserted old movie theater with rows of folded chairs still in place . Phantom music: The keys on this dusty old piano clearly have not been touched for many years . In an email exchange with MailOnline Friday, Feijen revealed that it took him more than a year to scout and photograph scores of different locations in eight European countries, including Poland, France and Italy. Feijen explained that most abandoned properties, especially those that are the worse for wear, are open, but walking around crumbling homes can be very dangerous, which is why the photographer always travels with an entourage of no fewer than three people. ‘If I would fall through a floor and get seriously injured I would not be able to alert anybody,’ he wrote. The Dutch native also shed light on the hard work that goes into selecting the perfect location for a photo shoot, explaining that he relies heavily on Google Earth to pick out potential spots focusing on large properties that show signs of abandonment. ‘After that it’s just trial and error,’ he wrote. ‘Jump in your car and go check it out. About 20% of the places you find this way are indeed abandoned.’ While many of Feijen’s haunting photos of decayed ballrooms and hotel suites look almost staged, the photographer has insisted that he never brings any props or rearranges anything before taking pictures on location. ‘Trust me, my backpack with camera gear is heavy enough!’ he noted. In all his travels, Feijen said that a certain abandoned hotel in Germany has made an enormous impression on him. The inn had been ravaged by fire a few years ago, leaving it exposed to the elements. In one room, Feijen found a bed covered in a blanket of moss, while in another the intense flames had melted the light fixture on the ceiling all the way down to the floor. ‘As a result, the rooms turned into scenes which could come from a Tim Burton movie,’ Feijen said, adding that the hotel was demolished a few weeks ago. Delusions of grandeur: This colonnaded ball room decked out in marble looks like it could be the site of a grand reception, if it weren't for the gaping hole in the roof . Just push play: The feeling one gets from looking at Feijen's images is that someone had pressed the pause button on life . Sacred spaces: Feijen's ideal shooting locations are ghost towns, insane asylums, dilapidated churches and castles frozen in time . Mr . Feijen explained that his fascination with deserted buildings first . started when, as a child, he became obsessed with a creepy abandoned house not far from his home. ‘I . passed it a zillion times until finally I had the guts to have a peek . inside,’ he recalled. ‘The adrenaline, the excitement. It was amazing.’ Years . later Feijen was photographing rally races and rocks concerts when he . came across pictures of decaying buildings that reignited his childhood . passion for beautiful ruins. Asked . about any paranormal encounters on his adventures, Mr Feijen explained . that while he is a ‘down to earthy’ guy and does not believe in ghosts, a . memorable photo shoot inside a grand old hotel has left him shaken. Feijen . said he had encountered so many strange things inside the building – . from doors slamming shut on their to inexplicable problems with his . camera equipment - that he was glad when he finally emerged from the . hotel. The most . poignant and unnerving images in the Frozen series depict rooms that look as if . their inhabitants had just left, with pillows thrown carelessly on the . bed and bath towels still hanging from a railing over a tub. Besides . derelict old mansions ravaged by time and debris-strewn hallways, . Feijen documented some more unusual spaces for his second book. One . image shows what appears to be a deserted old movie theater with rows . of chairs still in place and vegetation peeking through open . windows. Another . image shows a weathered roller coaster covered in a thick layer of grime in . an abandoned amusement park, where the photographer also stumbled upon a . water slide overflowing with plants and draining into a chipped . blue-tile pool filled with standing rainwater. Feijen has made a name for himself in the art world as a photographer specializing in Urban Exploration, or Urbex for short. Journey into the past: Looking at these image, one cannot help but think that the owners of these personal items have just stepped out for a minute and will be right back . Water world: In his travels, Feijen has come upon this abandoned water park with a slide draining into an empty pool overgrown with vegetation . Ghosts of the past: A water park that was once crowded with happy children and parents has been reconquered by nature . Last stop: This roller coaster covered in a thick layer of grime has not heard children's terrified and joyful squeals in many years . For . years, the Dutchman has been traveling the globe looking for boarded up . buildings, decrepit chapels and family homes where everything is still . in place. In . Frozen, one particularly unsettling and thought-provoking image shows . dusty old jackets and a woman's black leather purse hanging from hooks . in a foyer, and a pair of dirty slippers left next to a rusty bicycle waiting for their owner to come home. The feeling one gets from looking at Feijen’s images is that someone had pressed the pause button on life. His . ideal shooting locations are ghost towns, long-shuttered insane . asylums, dilapidated hotels and castles frozen in time and looking like . at any moment their inhabitants will walk through the door and . reclaim their personal space. Crumbling beauty: Even though Feijen's interiors are being eaten away by time itself, much architectural and aesthetic beauty remains . Bleak: Some of the shooting locations look especially gloomy, like this image . of what appears to be a deserted jail or a mental institution . Eerie: This vast bedroom still bears the marks of its previous inhabitants, with white pillows resting on the two single beds joint together . Cavernous: This dizzying image shows a view from the top overlooking multiple flights of concrete stairs . Worse for wear: Time has not been kind to this humble hotel room where everything is covered in moss and debris . Attention to detail: In this badly damaged bathroom towels are still hanging from a railing over a tub . While some of the interiors in Feijen’s photos have retained an air of grandeur, like the airy colonnaded ballroom adorned with marble, everything in sight has been touched by decay. In 2010, Feijen ventured into the ultimate deserted location, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in the Ukraine, where time stopped in 1986 after a deadly nuclear accident that resulted in a rapid mass evacuation.","Niki Feijen visited eight countries in Europe over the course of a year and a half to complete his new book titled Frozen .

"An elephant, angered by its failed attempts to break a stick in half takes its frustration out on it by flinging it at a log with its trunk. The footage, recorded at Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, shows two elephants in an enclosure – one clutching a stick in its trunk while swinging it about. Propping it up against a large log on the ground, the elephant lifts its leg and slowly begins to apply its weight to the centre point, hoping it will snap in two. Stopping to reposition the stick, the elephant once against tramples down upon it, but despite the mammal's best efforts it merely slips from the log and onto the floor. Looking slightly bent although still intact, the stick is once again picked up by the elephant's trunk and after twirling it around the mammal slams it down onto the log in a fit of rage. Meanwhile the other elephant, who appears to be eating, looks on nonchalantly. The elephant picks up the stick, skillfully props it up against the log on the ground and begins applying its weight to the centre point in the hope of snapping it in two . As the elephant tramples on the centre point of the stick it begins to bend but then slips down from the log . Frustrated at its failed attempts to break the stick in two the elephant picks it up in its trunk, twirls it around and throws it against the log . Youtube user johnbod, who uploaded the clip, noted that the other elephant appeared to be chewing on a piece of stick and believes that this was the reason for the elephant’s behaviour. Fort Worth Zoo was founded in 1909 with one lion, an alligator,  a peacock, a coyote, two bear cubs and some rabbits. Today the zoo is home to 5000 native and exotic animals and features Elephants in a section entitled Asian Falls, which was opened in 1992.","Elephant props stick up against log and attempts to break it .

"Convicted Bali 9 heroin smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize from his jail cell in Bali - but his painting won't be considered because he's been locked up abroad. He had hoped to compete for the prestigious art prize, that includes $75,000 in cash, and this week flew a self-portrait of himself to the Art Gallery of NSW for consideration. Sydney man Sukumaran has turned to art while serving a death row sentence in Bali. He is currently waiting to find out if he will face execution after a clemency plea was lodged in 2012. However, the competition rules mean Sukumaran's painting can not be considered, the gallery confirmed to MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Hopeful: Australian prisoner Myuran Sukumaran, one of the Bali Nine drug smugglers sentenced to death, seen here from the guard outpost of the Kerobokan prison in Indonesia's Bali island on February 24, 2012, hoped his art would be considered for the Archibald Prize . The rules state that the artist must have been 'resident in Australasia during the 12 months preceding the date fixed by the Trustees for sending in the pictures'. The 33-year-old has been on death row in Indonesia now since 2005 and turned to art in 2010. The gallery said: 'The prize will be awarded, in the terms of the will of the late JF Archibald dated 15 March 1916, to the best portrait ‘preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in art, letters, science or politics, painted by any artist resident in Australasia during the 12 months preceding the date fixed by the Trustees for sending in the pictures.' Passionate: Sukumaran took up painting 2010. He now runs an art studio at the jail. Here he is seen painting on a canvas at the prisoners studio . Sukumaran has been mentored and encouraged to enter the competition by 2011 Archibald Prize winner Ben Quilty. The prisoner has also set up an art workshop inside Kerobokan Prison and in 2013 also started to plan new courses for inmates. A post on a Facebook page run by his friends and family said: 'Myu is determined to improve the lives of his fellow inmates. He has now started planning for new courses, including music and permaculture. Music has the ability to lift spirits and the permaculture garden will provide organic vegetables for the inmates.' Sukumaran was convicted in Indonesia for drug trafficking in 2005 after being arrested in a room at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta with three others. Sukumaran (R) and James Norman (L-back to camera) from the 'Bali Nine' walk inside the riot damaged Kerobokan prison on February 25, 2012 . Police found 334 g (11.8 oz) of heroin in a suitcase in the room which was allegedly going to be smuggled to Australia. After a criminal trial, Sukumaran was sentenced to execution by firing squad on 14 February 2006 by the Denpasar District Court. Unless granted clemency by outgoing Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Sukumaran is expected to face execution. He is currently waiting in Kerobokan Prison to find out the decision. Meanwhile, other Archibald Prize entries began to arrive at the Art Gallery of NSW in trucks, vans and on car roofs on Monday morning. Almost 870 portraits were entered in the competition last year - a number expected to be matched before this year's entry cut-off on Friday. Last year's finalist Guy Morgan is back with a portrait of astronomer Fred Watson painted with an eye dropper. 'I do paintings of stars ... and Fred being an astronomer I thought ""why not paint the astronomer who has inspired a lot of my interest in the night sky"",' he told AAP. The Archibald, first awarded in 1921, is Australia's best-known art prize. Artists entering the Wynne Prize, for the best Australian landscape or figure sculpture and the Sulman Prize for the best subject or genre painting or mural also began dropping off their entries from Monday. A selection of artworks from all three prizes will be displayed from July 19 to September 28, 2014.","Rules for Australia's best-known art prize state that entrants must have been living in Australasia for the past year .

"An artist has taken camouflage to the next level with her incredible body illustrations that see her models blend into beautiful murals. Emma Hack, famed for her work on Gotye's music video, paints the skin of nude bodies and has amassed over 500 million Youtube hits with her mesmerizing work on the famous music video. Now the Australian artist will take her work to an exciting new level as she prepares to paint a model live for the first time in a UK gallery. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Emma Hack's amazing artwork sees nude bodies blend seamlessly into wallpaper backgrounds . The 41-year-old will spend up to 15-hours illustrating the nude's skin to make her blend into the background of an artwork. The exhibition that will be shown at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery in London is made up of Emma's latest collections. The collection, entitle Blossom, features four wallpaper artworks by the later interior designer Florence Broadhurst that Emma uses as a backdrop for her models. Emma who . will be creating the live installation at the gallery on the preview . day  says that she is not nervous to be doing her work in front of an . audience but she is worried about becoming distracted. 'I . don't find it daunting, but it is exhausting and time-consuming, also . chatting to viewers distracts me so I do plan to create as much as . possible prior to the public viewing.' Birds of a feather: Emma often includes live birds in her pieces . The Australian (left) artist will paint a nude live in front of an audience at a London Gallery . Painstaking: The process can take the artist up to 15 hours to complete . Emma is most famous for painting Gotye, in music video Somebody That I Used To Know . For Emma the process of creating her work can be a lengthily one as she says she has many things to consider when coming up with the design. 'Generally I research the idea and look at photos I have taken from my travels. I consider what I want the viewer to feel, how the flow of composition appears for the viewer. 'I . then either paint a background or choose some wallpaper from an . archive, before heading into the studio with my model, slowly painting . her outer edges, then filling in the detail on centre of the form.' Feathered friend: A nude model wears nothing more than a glove to protect herself from the bird of prey she poses with . Barely there: A model is hardly visible as she poses with a peacock, Emma says she is often inspired by her travels when coming up with design ideas . Emma (left) says she used to feel quite uncomfortable painting nudes as she was self-conscious herself . In an exciting twist several pieces . called Birds of a Feather feature live birds that are held by the naked . models, who wear nothing more than a glove to protect their hands. Emma says that having live animals in the piece can add complications so she doesn't involve them until completion. 'If there is a bird in the work, they arrive towards the end of the process and are positioned. I then photograph the results.' A live owl does its best still-life impression in one of Emma's bird scenes . Emma makes it her aim to make her models feel as comfortable as possible when painting them . Although Emma seems completely at ease with the nudes that she works with she admits that she wasn't always so comfortable with the naked body. 'In the beginning I found the nude models daunting as I have always been quite shy about my own body. 'I think this is why I was trusted by my first models as I always make sure they are comfortable with what I am doing.' Despite each piece taking between eight and 15 hours to complete Emma is not yet jaded by the process and says that working with animals makes her job entirely unpredictable. 'You never know what to expect working with birds and animals. The owl is very cute, but also very naughty and it is hard getting him to look at me. 'We tend to throw things on the ground or play phone sounds to make noise to get his attention. 'It's very hard for the model to hold a straight face while this is happening and quite often they get the giggles.'

"Forget fresh ingredients, expensive wine or quality spices, culinary masterpieces have to look the part to taste delicious. It’s a concept that gourmet chefs have long exploited, and now scientists in Oxford have provided evidence to back up the claim. In a recent study, psychologists found that a salad tastes better when arranged to resemble a work by the Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky. An example of 'edible art' is proof of what top chefs already know - a culinary masterpiece has to look the part as well as taste delicious. Psychologists found that a salad (left) tasted better when arranged to resemble Painting Number 201 (right) by the Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky . So much so, that diners are willing to pay twice the price they would for a more rustic salad, thrown together with the same ingredients. Franco-Columbian chef and one of the authors of the study, Charles Michel, designed the salad resembling the abstract artwork, Painting Number 201, to explore how the look of food affects how it tastes. The 'relatively complex' salad consisted of a total of 30 ingredients, including Portobello and shimeji mushrooms, broccoli sprouts, endive, raw red and yellow peppers, cauliflower, and mange-tout. It also featured a variety of sauces, such as beetroot and carrot puree, cauliflower and lemongrass creme, and mushroom essence with squid ink. Diners are willing to pay twice the price for a salad (left) that looks like a Portrait of Dora Maar by Pablo Picasso (right) than for a more rustic salad, thrown together with the same ingredients . Pictured is a salad version of Decalcomania by Rene Magritte as psychologists found that a salad tasted better when arranged to resemble famous art works . An image of Decalcomania by Rene Magritte, on which on of the salads was based.  In tests, volunteers preferred the flavour of the artistic dish over the same ingredients tossed together or placed neatly, but uncreatively, on the plate . It is said that there’s no such thing as a free lunch, but even if you manage to bag a bargain meal, it will not taste as good as a more expensive options, according to scientists. A new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price. The experts believe that people tend to associate cost with quality, and this changes their perception of how food tastes. Scientists at Cornell University in New York studied the eating habits of 139 people enjoying an Italian buffet. The experiment revealed that the people who paid $8 (£4.70) for the food enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the ‘cheaper’ buffet. Before participants sampled their plateful, the Kandinsky-inspired dish was rated higher for complexity, artistic presentation and general liking. Participants were prepared to pay twice as much for the meal as for either the regular or 'neat arrangements'. In tests, volunteers preferred the flavour of the artistic dish over the same ingredients tossed together or placed neatly, but uncreatively, on the plate. The 60 volunteers, aged 18 to 58, also said they would be willing to pay more for the Kandinsky salad. ‘Eating the food led to an increase in ratings of the tastiness of the food in the case of the art-inspired dish, likely showing that the aesthetic value of this visual arrangement made the food more enjoyable to eat,’ said the team led by Professor Charles Spence, from Oxford University. ‘The results of the study provide evidence . for the idea that there are differences in the expectations and . consumption experience of a dish as a result of the various elements . having been artistically arranged on the plate. The 'relatively complex' salad consisted of a total of 30 ingredients, including Portobello and shimeji mushrooms, broccoli sprouts, endive, raw red and yellow peppers, cauliflower, and mange-tout. Pictured are the different types of salad the participants were presented with - all using the same ingredients . A salad version (left) of Danseuse en Robe Rose by Edgar Degas (right) was found to be more delicious due to its creative design, according to research by Oxford University . Rhythm by Robert Delauney (right) was created in salad form (left). ‘Diners intuitively attribute an artistic value to the food, find it more complex, and like it more when the culinary elements are arranged to look like an abstract-art painting,' said Professor Charles Spence, from Oxford University . ‘Diners intuitively attribute an artistic value to the food, find it more complex, and like it more when the culinary elements are arranged to look like an abstract-art painting.' Chef and food scientist Jozef Youssef, founder of the experimental gastronomy project Kitchen Theory, contributed his culinary skill to the experiment. Inspired by the results, he and staff from the scientific publishing house BioMed Central, which owns the journal Flavour, went on to create a range of other dishes inspired by famous works from the likes of Picasso, Magritte and Rothko. Freelance chef and researcher Charles Michel, a member of the Oxford team, said: 'Using artistic inspiration in the design of the culinary experience, even when used implicitly, can indeed enhance the enjoyment of food.'

"A London mother-of-two has the ability to transform herself into practically any person or creature using purely make-up. In support of England’s first match at the world cup, Maria Malone-Guerbaa even turned herself into Wayne Rooney and World Cup goal-scoring footballer Daniel Sturridge. Maria used only make-up and face paints to create the illusion of Sturridge and Rooney on her face. In support of England’s debut at the world cup, Maria turned herself into Wayne Rooney (left) and World Cup goal-scoring footballer Daniel Sturridge (right) Creating the image of Nelson Mandela (top left) on her own face (bottom right) requires painstaking layering and shading, as seen in these pictures . Maria (left) often uses herself as a model, managing to transform her face and even her body (right) She is also able to give herself a picture-perfect likeness of other famous faces including A-list stars Angeline Jolie, Morgan Freeman and The Queen. After putting her passion on hold when she had her family, the 40-year-old’s work has become a hit after she put it online. Maria, who lives with husband Billy and children Sophia, 12, and Adam, 10, has since been invited to teach at a prestigious make-up event in Miami in 2015. What makes her face painting technique so unusual, is that unlike other special effects make up artists, she does not rely on any prosthetic materials to create her ‘faces’. Maria only uses paint and her natural talent to create celebrity faces, footballers, zombies, 3D effects and even gory cuts. Maria as Angelina Jolie's Maleficent from the cent hit film. She creates all her looks without using any prosthetics . The Monarch is recreated in incredible detail by the mother-of-two using just face paint and make-up . Unsurprisingly once Maria had posted her transformations into famous celebrity like Bob Marley, they soon went viral . As soon as she set up her make up page, her lifelike face painting went viral on Facebook. Maria’s transformations, which have become known as ‘famous faces’ to her fans, also caught the eye of the International Make Up Artist Trade Show- commonly known as IMATS, who have invited her to be a guest speaker this summer. The make up artist, who is originally from Limerick, has always had a talent and passion for art, and particularly enjoyed pencil drawing and charcoal sketches as a child. After finishing school she applied to Limerick Art College, however Maria ended up turning down her place. What makes Maria's face painting technique so unusual, is that unlike other special effects make up artists, she does not rely on any prosthetic materials to create her 'faces' She explains: 'I felt at the time that there wasn’t anywhere for me to go with what I wanted to do, I didn’t want to be a standard artist. I loved special effects, particularly body and face art. 'I went to find out about it but there was literally nowhere in Limerick or Ireland that specialised in that kind up of make up art.' Feeling frustrated she decided to move to London. Within three weeks she met her husband and together they have opened a line of cafe’s in the city. Focusing on business and having two young children, Maria wasn’t left with much time to focus on her art. When she turned 33, she decided that it was time she invested in her talents. She enrolled in Christine Blundell’s make up academy, which is based in Camden. Maria, who lives with husband Billy and children Sophia, 12, and Adam, 10, has been invited to teach at a prestigious make-up event in Miami in 2015 . Each transformation, like this one of  Jack Nickleson in The Shining, takes up to four hours to create and requires tiny brushes to do the intricate lines . It wasn’t long before word of Maria’s skills spread and she was working at the Barbican on a play called The City Of Angels. Soon after, she began working on BBC’s Switch and Channel Four production Horrible Histories. 'I had to do the make up for one of Henry VIII’s wives, Katherine Howard. It was after she was beheaded so I had to make her look like she was dead, and as though she has been decapitated.' The budding make up artist had not really explored face painting at this stage, until she was approached by a mother at one of her children’s school. She had heard that Maria was a make up artist and asked her to help out at the school’s summer fete. 'I was practicing on the children at home but they used to get bored so that’s why I started painting my own face. 'I would go up to the kitchen and start painting, it developed over the years, going from this level to the next and now people asking how did I learn to paint like this? 'The famous faces are my favourite because they’ve made me very popular they went viral on Facebook which was a shock. People were messaging me from around the world, it was mad. 'Then the make up world and face painting world started talking to me, and people in Miami called the World Face and Body Painting Association,' says Maria. Maria says that although she would love to work behind the scenes in Hollywood productions, she will wait a few years as she is very dedicated to being close to her children as they grow up . The association got in touch with Maria at the end of last summer, after seeing her famous faces creations on Facebook and invited her to this year’s event. Maria and her husband Billy flew for over a week. So that really spurred me on thinking I am doing something different, because to me I just thought I was clowning around. Morgan Freeman and Elvis went viral and then I decided to do more and more famous faces. They take me about four hours to do as they are very detailed, and I literally use the smallest brush - an eyeliner brush,' says Maria. The Fabiac Face & Body Art International Event was held in May this year and the organisation asked her to be a special guest and teach some classes at the event in 2015. Maria, here transforming herself into Freddie Mercury, hopes to arrange to teach classes in the UK and Holland, and prepare for her classes at the Fabiac Face and Body Art International Event in Miami next year . She is currently sponsored by Superstar face paints who are based in Holland and Face Paint UK. They provide her with the paints she needs and both have asked her to teach classes to their students. Maria decided to wait until she had visited Miami and watched how others teach, before leading her own classes. Maria says: 'It’s a different ballgame and I want to do it the right way. Superstar said just be yourself, and I did see that in Miami. Everybody was very relaxed and doing demos and asking questions.' 'My aim right now is to teach there next year in 2015. But I might start this year at some workshops in Holland and the UK. I just have to fit it in with the children. It’s doable.' Maria says that although she would love to work behind the scenes in Hollywood productions, she will wait a few years before applying for those roles as she is very dedicated to being close to her children as they grow up. Maria's skill have led to work for the Barbican on a play called The City Of Angels and the BBC's Switch and Channel Four production Horrible Histories (left: Marylin Monroe skull look, right: Morgan Freeman) 'I don’t feel comfortable about leaving them for months -which is how long it would be if I was working on a film. 'I would also love to work in England or London, which is why I tried the West End shows. I thought I could do something while I’m still near home.' The talented artist is extremely excited to present her work at the International Make Up Artist Trade Show (IMATS) in London this June. IMATS is renowned for inviting the best make up artists in the world. 'It’s a huge compliment; they even said they will put my Superstar paints out while they develop theirs. So they asked if I can bring some of my own- that’s in a few weeks time.' However most of the FX make up artists they work with mainly use prosthetics to create their looks, in contrast to Maria who only relies on face paints. It is not just faces that Maria is skilled at creating, with creatures, mystical beasts and even animals like this cat being within her artistic range . 'I wanted to see how far I could get being an illusionist without using prosthetics, so I got a kick when I went to do face painting and someone asked if the nose was glued on. 'And I could say no it’s all paint, and then people asked for tutorial so then I started doing those. That made it even more popular because people could see that I was just drawing it on,” adds the artist. After IMATS, Maria hopes to arrange to teach classes in the UK and Holland, and prepare for her classes at the Fabiac Face & Body Art International Event in Miami next year. Maria is currently sponsored by The Face Painting shop and Superstar face paints. She says they have both been extremely supportive of her work and of all their artists. She explains that The Face Painting shop introduced her to the world of body painting and helped her put her video tutorials on Youtube. The make up artist explains: 'What I would like to do at the moment is teach, I think that would make me happy. 'I thought about one day working as a teacher in a make up academy, but when you are freelance you get to do a lot of different things, which suits me because I bore easily. 'If I became better known then I would love to give back more to London, but I wouldn’t say no to anything.'

"An art fan who unwittingly bought two paintings by street artist Banksy in Central Park for just $60 each is expected to receive a $160,000 windfall when the prints go up for auction. As part of his month-long New York City residency last October, the elusive graffiti artist foxed even his most ardent fans by secretly selling authentic artworks one Saturday afternoon. The art fan, who hasn’t been named, purchased two of the signed spray-painted prints entitled Pooh Bear and Kids With Guns. Scroll down for video . An art fan who unwittingly bought two paintings by street artist Banksy in Central Park for just $60 each last October is expected to receive a $160,000 windfall when the prints go up for auction . Kids With Guns, left, was purchased for just $60 but is expected to fetch $95,000 at auction, while Pooh Bear is set to go for $65,000 . The buyer recently approached auction house Bonham’s in London with the intention of selling the prints to the highest bidder. A representative for the auction house told The Guardian that they are expected to fetch roughly $65,000 and $95,000, respectively. During his month-long residency in New York City last October, Banksy vowed to produce one piece of street art each day. On the 13th day of his residency, the UK-based artist displayed dozens of original, signed canvases at a pop-up stall attended by an unknown man. Surprising: For his 13th day in New York, Banksy pulled a fantastic prank by setting up an unannounced art stall with dozens of 100% original signed canvases for $60 each . The stand wasn’t a huge success and after seven hours just three people had bought eight canvases - a total haul of $420. The . first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her . children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount. Half an hour later, a New Zealand woman purchased some art. Video shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek. At . 5.30pm, a Chicago man rocked up seeking art for his new house: 'I just . need something for the walls.' He left with four original Banksys. The day after the sale, Banksy revealed what has happened via his website. Bemused: The stand was manned by an unknown man who seemed completely uninterested in what he was doing . First customer: The store made its first sale at 3.30pm on Saturday. A woman bought two canvases for her children but negotiated a 50 per cent discount . Sale no. 2:  At 4pm, a woman from New Zealand bought two artworks, to the delight of the merchant . ‘Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100 percent authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each,’ he wrote. The paintings have since been 'authenticated' by Bansky, a rep from the auction house said. The art was first thought to be worth $250,000 but that estimate was too high, the rep said. One of the paintings features an image of Winnie the Pooh sitting under a tree next to a tossed-out honey pot. The other depicts two kids standing on a hillock of guns and bombs. The art house has not yet set a date for the auction. Final sale: The last sale of the day was at 6.30pm when a Chicago man rocked up looking for art to decorate his new house. Judging by the big man hug, it must have been an emotional sale . Dismal: The merchant shut up shop at 6.30pm, taking in just $420 after more than six hours on the job .","An art fan who got lucky when they unwittingly purchased two original Banksys for $60 each is auctioning them and is expected to raise $160,000 .

"Sky Sports open as favourites to secure the British broadcasting rights for the richest fight of all time, at roughly the same 1-3 odds at which the Las Vegas casinos are quoting Floyd Mayweather Jnr to win it. But when you are talking hundreds of millions of dollars and the two best pound-for-pound boxers in the world there are no foregone conclusions. And when it comes to a bidding war for Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao, nothing will come cheap for UK viewers. Floyd Mayweather tucks into a bag of popcorn and a hotdog during a basketball match in LA on Sunday . Mayweather announced that he would fight Pacquiao last week to end weeks of speculation . BT have become a Premier League thorn in Sky's side. They have been fidgeting for some time about adding live boxing to their portfolio and there could be no more spectacular way than this of throwing their hat in the ring. Certainly, they can afford it. The cost frame for screening rights in this country on the red-hot Saturday night of May 2 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena is expected to be £5million-£10m, with Sky likely to start pitching at £6m. But the fiercer the competition the higher it could go, even though Money and the PacMan will not enter the ring much before 4am Sunday morning UK time. BT possess untold riches and have not blinked at £10m per Premier League match. They also kept significant cash in hand by shrewdly under-bidding Sky while still expanding their package in that new deal. With all due respect, if West Bromwich Albion vs Hull City is worth that kind of money then what price this fight so big that Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum describes it as ‘three Super Bowls rolled into one'? Manny Pacquiao stretches before a training session the Philippines as he prepares for Mayweather . Pacqauio plays chess with friends in General Santos City as he trains at home before moving to Los Angeles . Pacquiao has been in training for Mayweather in anticipation that the fight would be made for May . Twenty million, thirty million, given that American television will generate $300m? And BT are not the only potential rivals to Sky. ITV are bringing world championship boxing back to mainstream terrestrial television for the first time in almost a decade with this Saturday’s defence by Carl Frampton of his super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos in Belfast. Mayweather-Pacquiao – not only live on the night but with replays airing Sunday lunchtime and on prime evening slots the following week – will bring with it expensive advertising opportunities. Nor – unlike BBC – are ITV prohibited by their constitution from charging pay-per-view. They have not gone down this road before but what better way for them to take a first big step back into the big-time sports market? Also, Frank Warren’s dedicated BoxNation channel is believed to be considering adding a comparatively modest one-off pay-per-view supplement to its £12-a-month subscription rates for this event of such magnitude. Warren - like BT - can calculate a bid based on that charge plus a substantial surge in subscribers. He has also built up much goodwill with the US promoters by buying many of their big fights even when British boxers are not involved – Mayweather vs Maidana and Pacquiao vs Algieri significantly among them. Mayweather talked to Pacquiao at a basketball match (left) before meeting him at his hotel suite later (right) Mayweather posted an photograph of the signed contract for his fight against Pacquiao . And what may the cost be to you, dear reader, boxing lover or member of the wider audience which this will attract? Sky, conscious of the scale of their monthly fees, are deeply reluctant to raise any pay-per-view charge above their historic £20 thresh-hold. If they stick to that, their critics may become their friends. But they will be desperate not to lose out on this one and the more they have to pay, the greater the pressure to charge more. But however much you end up being asked to cough up, it will be peanuts compared with America. Showtime, who have Mayweather under contract, and HBO, who are Pacquiao’s paymasters, are sharing the broadcast there – at an expected $99.95 a buy. What they have to assess is that while Mayweather and Pacquiao are guaranteed $150m (£96) and $100m (£64) respectively, the local stations who take their satellite feeds get their share. That is normally 50 per cent, although there is talk of a lower percentage being agreed this time given the size of the pay-per-view charge. The US pay-per-view sales record is 2.4million buyers for Mayweather vs Oscar De La Hoya in 2007. That is predicted to be broken now. Mayweather's victory over Oscar De La Hoya in 2007 set the pay-per-view sales record of 2.4million buyers . Even I can do the arithmetic that at a hundred bucks a shot three million buys equals $300m. At that rate, if the local stations take a third that leaves $200m in the promotion pot. Then come the overseas TV rights in some 200 countries, including Britain where sales should exceed the 1.2m record set for Mayweather vs Ricky Hatton, which was also an early-hours production. Seats at the arena will be priced up to $5,000 (£3,300) or more at ringside – and are already selling on an advance promise on the black market for more than $25,000 (£16,500). The MGM, whose group of hotels on that famous Strip will be the principle beneficiaries of a gaming bonanza that weekend worth anything up to a billion dollars to Las Vegas, will pay a substantial site fee. It will cost $150 or more to watch closed-circuit transmission on large screens in their hotels. A movie chain in America is negotiating to show the fight live in several hundred theatres – and it could be coming to a cinema near you, as did events such as this in years gone by. The feeding frenzy has begun. Tickets for the fight at the MGM Grand are already selling on the black market for more than £16,500 . Floyd Mayweather tells Manny Pacquiao: ‘You’re moving up into a different league where you’ve never been and that’s why I’m 1-3 in the betting.’ The PacMan tells the Money Man: ‘I love being the underdog and you can’t cope with my speed.’ Manny: 'I signed the contract first.' Floyd: 'I made it happen.' There won’t be many rounds this even on May 2. Gennady Golovkin has accepted not only Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr’s challenge to a fight but also a $1m (£650,000) side stake. Golovkin smiled and said ‘sure’ when Chavez said he wanted to bet him that he will knock out the Kazakh at super-middleweight. That requires Golovkin to move up from middleweight, where he is world champion following 29 stoppages in 32 unbeaten fights, including the last 19 in succession. As the biggest pound-for-pound puncher in the world Golovkin has trouble finding big-name opponents and says he will gladly rise to the 12 stone limit to face Chavez and that bet ‘assuming he signs the contract this time.’ Chavez is committed to an interim fight in April and is Carl Froch’s target for his much-wanted fight in Las Vegas, perhaps this summer. Golovkin, ever the gentleman, took time out to pose for a morning-after photograph in Monte Carlo with his latest victim, our own Martin Murray who courageously took him as far the 11th round for the first time in his career before suffering a brutal stoppage on Saturday night. Gennady Golovkin (left) invited Martin Murray for a drink the morning after he stopped the St Helens man .

"We've seen in the past week with Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao that the big fights can be made in this sport. That gives me hope that we finally might succeed in getting Amir Khan and Kell Brook in a ring. They are two great fighters at the top of their game – it is a fight the people of Britain would love to see. I can reveal here that I had a good conversation with Khan’s people just over a week ago and they told me this fight will happen one day. My thought is why wait? Let’s get this done in the summer. The date of June 13 would work – let’s make it. Eddie Hearn spoke to Amir Khan's people a week ago and is hopeful a fight with Kell Brook will happen . Brook returns to the ring in March after his horrific injury last year . I know that Amir would love to fight the winner of Mayweather and Pacquiao – who wouldn’t? That’s the fight Kell would love as well. Assuming Mayweather-Pacquiao is not a draw, there will be only two world champions in the welterweight division – the winner and Kell Brook. The dream for Kell would be a unification fight against the winner, but make no mistake, he is desperate to fight Khan once he has fought Jo Jo Dan on March 28. From Khan’s perspective, it makes sense to fight Kell. I’ve spoken here before about the money involved – he won’t get more against anyone else. And if he thinks he can beat Kell he should take the fight because his chances of fighting Mayweather or Pacquiao will be much greater with a world title behind him. Watch this space. Speaking of Mayweather-Pacquiao, like everyone else I cannot wait to see it. I’m not sure yet whether I will make the trip – for travelling fans, the tickets will be like gold dust but more expensive. I am not part of the promotion and yet I have still had hundreds of calls from people asking for tickets. I have heard some interesting rumours on this one. Some people are saying tickets could trade for as much as £100,000 for ringside. I have also heard rumours that no tickets will go on general release to the public. I desperately hope that is not the case. Boxing needs to stay accessible even though this is an extraordinary fight with an unmatched ability to make money. It will generate hundreds of millions whichever way they sell it. Floyd Mayweather takes time out to enjoy a night watching the LA Clippers basketball team . Manny Pacquiao training in the ring in General Santos City ahead of his fight with Floyd Mayweather . The signed contract confirming that Mayweather and Pacquiao will fight on May 2 in Las Vegas . On the fight itself, I think it will be compelling. People will say it should have happened years ago but I still think it is a great match-up. The general feeling is that Floyd will win by a wide unanimous decision. I’m not totally convinced by that. I think Floyd will win, but it could be close. The one thing that Floyd won’t like is Manny’s speed. He will put Floyd under tremendous pressure and in those circumstances anything can happen. It might even lead Floyd to let go of his punches more frequently and perhaps even force a stoppage. I can see that happening, though my instinct tells me he will win on points. The star of Gennady Golovkin continues to rise. Martin Murray was incredibly brave and underlined his status as one of the world’s very best middleweights by taking him to the 11th round. But what a talent he was up against. Golovkin is special. The question is where does Golovkin go from here. People simply do not want to fight him and he has to pay a lot of money to get anyone in the ring. Is there much potential for him to stay at middleweight? I am not sure the names are out there for him to have a mega-fight. I don’t think Miguel Cotto would want it. I can see him stepping up to super-middleweight and the three big names there are Carl Froch, Julio Cesar Chavez and Andre Ward. Gennady Golovkin looked impressive in his 11th-round stoppage of Martin Murray in Monte Carlo . Despite his defeat, Murray underlined his status as one of the best middleweights around . If he can bring enough money to the table I’m sure every one of those would be interested. I know Carl would be. But it will need to the television companies to come up with the money. They should because this guy is spectacular. As for Murray, I have nothing but respect for the guy. He fought Felix Sturm in Germany, Sergio Martinez in Argentina and Golovkin in Monte Carlo. He never gets the advantage and yet he always performs. I think he has the potential to win a world title but I would like to see him get more backing at home. I think he ought to be built up properly in the UK because with some home support he could be a real player in the division. I felt for Paul Smith at the weekend. He put up a great fight against Arthur Abraham but lost against a great champion. I am very proud of what Paul has done in the last few fights. I have delivered two world title shots for him and am confident that even at this stage in his career he can come again. He has shown that he belongs at that level. Special props should go to Joe Gallagher for all his hard work in those two fights. Arthur Abraham (left) beat Paul Smith on points in their rematch in Berlin . Smith has to decide what he wants to do next as the BBBoC have ordered he fights Rocky Fielding . What happens next for him will be interesting. The British Boxing Board of Control have made Rocky Fielding mandatory for his British title so he has to decide whether he wants to defend that in the summer or stay in the hunt for a world title shot. If he vacates, his younger brother Callum will fight Fielding. That would be a huge fight for Liverpool. He is also an important member of Sky’s broadcasting team. Either way the future looks bright for Smigga.","I have held good talks with Amir Khan's people over Kell Brook fight .

"A Chicago artist has come up with a novel way of fixing the city's pothole problem by turning them into mosaic works of art. Jim Bachor has transformed the holes in the road starting within his own neighbourhood in Mayfair by not only filling them in but making them a work of art. He began his project in the summer of last year and uses the flag of the city of Chicago as the inspiration for his creations. Jim Bachor scrapes away the cement to reveal his finished mosaic on a filled pothole in a Chicago street . Mr Bachor cones off the areas he works at using cones belonging to his sons, which they use for soccer practice . The artist puts fake serial numbers on the mosaics as a way of highlighting the severity of Chicago's pothole problem . He also leaves a fake serial number on the mosaic as a humorous way of pointing out the severity of the pothole problem in the city. The artist told Hyperallegenic.com: 'It's a way to say, ""This is a Chicago pothole!” 'The fake serial numbers are a joke, a comment on the number of potholes there actually are in Chicago,' Mr Bachor added. He sections off the pothole he wants to work on using his sons' bright orange cones they use to practice soccer and wears a bright reflective vest. Mr Bachor uses the same materials for all his mosaics, roughly costing $50 and tries to keep them all the same size . But even though he could be mistaken for a city construction worker, he is actually creating his art. He has now been awarded a commission by the Chicago Transit Authority to expand his artwork. And next he is planning to create the mosaics in Chicago's downtown area. Mr Bachor says that mosaics are one of the few artistic techniques that survive . Mr Bachor uses the same materials for all his mosaics, roughly costing $50 and tries to keep them all the same size. According to his website, he says he creates the mosaics that 'speak of modern things but in an ancient voice'. Mr Bachor added: 'It’s hard to make your mark in this world. Mosaics are one of the few techniques that can really survive.'","Jim Bachor not only fills the holes but creates a mosaic work of art on them .

"A man that had been accused of committing numerous sex crimes against his nine-year-old son allegedly killed himself this week. Defense attorney Adam Bollaert told Al.com that on Monday evening his client Carl Herold was found hanged inside a cell at Clay County jail. At the time of his death, Herold had been in the middle of an extradition for federal child pornography charges in New York state, the website reported. Last year, authorities arrested Herold and his partner Charles Dunnavant in November and December, respectively, and in 2014 indicted them with 30 counts, according to Al.com. Dead: Carl Herold, pictured, was found hanged inside a cell at Clay County jail, his attorney has said . Partner: The indictment counts for Charles Dunnavant, Herold's partner, are for conspiracy to commit child sex abuse, sodomy and sexual abuse of a child under 12, aggravated child abuse, and conspiracy to commit sodomy . Herold faced 18 counts for several alleged crimes: conspiracy to commit sodomy, conspiracy to commit sexual abuse, complicity, sodomy, sexual abuse of a child under 12, as well as aggravated child abuse, the outlet reported. It noted that both his child pornography production as well as distribution charges had been dropped. WHNT reported last December that a motion to increase bond said 'The victim in this was kept in Defendant’s home, without schooling or interaction with others outside the supervision on Defendant or his co-defendants, for eight months.' The federal New York indictment from December 2013 'alleges that from August 2011 to about March 2013, Herold compelled a male child to ""engage in sexually explicit conduct"" to produce images and videos that were produced and transmitted via computer and other means,' AL.com reported. Herold offered 'Computer Science for Everyone' tutorials and had reddit and YouTube pages also meant for teaching, the media outlet earlier found. Dunnavant's counts were for conspiracy to commit child sex abuse, sodomy and sexual abuse of a child under 12, aggravated child abuse, and conspiracy to commit sodomy, the news outlet reported. Multiple investigations: At the time of his death Herold was in the middle of an extradition to New York state for federal child pornography charges . 'Prisoner': Herold's son was allegedly held under extremely close supervision for eight months in this Huntsville, Alabama residence . This past June, Al.com reported Dunnavant did not want the alleged victim's testimony heard -- and that defense attorney Brian White cited the boy's mental health and possible sway from authorities he spoke with. An excerpt of a court filing about the boy - who is a psychiatric hospital patient - from the defense that was published by the website said 'There is a real likelihood that (the child) suffers from a mental condition severe enough to interfere with his ability to have observed events and to now remember and be able to relate those events and to appreciate the grave importance of telling the complete truth.' Bollaert told the news outlet of his client's alleged suicide 'It's really shocking to me, when I met with Mr. Herold last week, in Cullman County, he had great spirits, he seemed up and was ready to continue fighting this case. So, we don't understand what happened.' Speaking to AL.com on Tuesday, Madison County Assistant District Attorney Jason Scully-Clemons said 'My reaction to it, ultimately, is I wish that Carl Herold had been brave enough to face justice in Madison County rather than doing what he did. 'Today above all else, I'm sad for the victim in this case, as I have been all along.' Update November 6, 2014 . A previous version of this article mistakenly stated in the fourth paragraph that Defense Attorney Adam Bollaert had been arrested and indicted in connection with this case. In fact Mr Bollaert has not been arrested or indicted. It is his client Carl Herold who was arrested and indicted, together with his partner Charles Dunnavant. We apologise to Mr Bollaert.","Carl Herold was found hanged inside a cell at Clay County jail on Monday evening, his attorney said .

"These are exciting times for James DeGale. I can tell you that I am deep in negotiations with Andre Dirrell’s people right now to make their fight for the IBF world title, which was recently vacated by Carl Froch. My hope is to stage it on April 25 at the O2 Arena in London, but currently we are both pushing for home advantage. I am confident that with the backing of Sky Sports and James's profile in London, we can deliver him a home fight and a great deal for Dirrell. Whichever way it works, this is going to be a huge fight between two elite super-middleweights. It’s an extremely tough fight to call. James DeGale was at his impressive best last November when he stopped Marco Antonio Periban . George Groves beat Dennis Douglin but has struggled to show his best since losing twice to Carl Froch . DeGale is set to face Andre Dirrell (left) while Groves is the mandatory challenger to Anthony (right) DeGale lost a close decision to bitter rival Groves when they fought at the O2 Arena in 2011 . Andre has been beaten only once and that was on a split decision to Froch in Nottingham. He has come back very strong and now has 24 wins in 25 fights - he really is a massive threat to James. But I believe our man can win this fight and go on to make history as the first British Olympic champion to win a world title. When he does, it will be interesting to hear George Groves's thoughts. Plenty of people will have noticed my recent Twitter argument with him on the subject of James. I must be honest and say I can’t understand the way George thinks sometimes. He was offered this chance of a fight with James but wants unacceptable terms. The money that we were offering would have amounted to the biggest payday both fighters had ever landed, but Groves is pushing for a fight with WBC champion Athony Dirrell (Andre's brother). Everyone knew that Dirrell was going to be given an extension by the WBC and now George looks set to have to wait till the autumn/winter for that shot. I understood Groves’ most recent offer from them was $150,000 (£98,000) – please can someone explain to me why George is going down that route when he could have had a massive fight with James for potentially TWENTY times the money? This game can drive you crazy sometimes. I woke up earlier this week to a whole bunch of tweets from people asking me about Bernard Hopkins, who has made a few comments about Carl Froch. Froch has described a fight with Hopkins as ‘lose-lose’ and Hopkins has taken that to mean he is running scared. I can assure Bernard that is not the case. I am still in talks to make that fight between two legends of the sport. Hopkins has such an awkward style, but I can’t see any way how Froch would lose a fight in Nottingham supported by 40,000 of his home fans. I would say in that environment that he would be virtually unbeatable. Froch vacated his IBF super-middleweight title (left) rather than face his mandatory challenger DeGale . Froch has not fought since he knocked out Groves in their Wembley rematch in front of 80,000 last May . Froch could face ring legend Bernard Hopkins (left) who lost his most recent fight to Sergey Kovalev . That Hopkins fight and one against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas remain the only fights that have Carl interested. I am in talks on both. If they don’t happen, then we might have to say goodbye to one of the greatest fighters this country has produced. Fingers crossed that doesn't happen. I have a few irons in the fire at the moment for April 25, when I hope to stage DeGale’s world title fight at the O2 Arena. I am also hopeful that the bill will include the fight between IBF featherweight world champion Evgeny Gradovich and Lee Selby, his mandatory challenger. Selby, the Welsh Mayweather, is a tremendous fighter and he is ready for this test. Anthony Joshua will also have his rescheduled fight with Kevin Johnson. I can’t wait to see the big man fighting again. The delays and haggling and saga of Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao shows you how complex the business of this sport can be. A big part of it will be mind games. Who can call the shots on what? Believe it or not, mind games come into it a lot. It makes me think of the forgettable world-title fight between David Haye and Audley Harrison in 2010 and an issue that became a big deal behind the scenes. Haye's people were insistent that both men had to wear a certain type of glove for the fight, even though Audley was contracted to wear a different brand. When we got to the rules meeting, Audley tried on this new glove and didn’t like it – the thumb in the right hand didn't feel right. On top of that the British Boxing Board of Control agreed with Audley. Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are still negotiating their £200million mega-fight for later this year . David Haye played mind games before his fight with Audley Harrison - but then knocked out his British rival . To compromise, Haye's people said Audley could wear one brand of glove on his right hand and another on his left. I'm telling you, it was a big fuss. Ridiculous, really. But after all that, on fight night Haye’s trainer, Adam Booth, comes in the dressing room around an hour before the fight and finally concedes and says it's fine for Audley to wear both of the gloves he wanted to wear at the start. Anything for the smallest advantage in this sport. Mayweather and Pacquiao won't want to give an inch to the other in the build up to this fight. I caught up with Anthony Crolla in Bolton this week. All I can say is I am absolutely staggered to see him bouncing around his gym and training just a few weeks after fracturing his ankle and skull while tackling two burglars. He was devastated to miss out on his lightweight world title shot against Richar Abril but it is strange how things work out. That fight would have been in front of 7,000 or 8,000 people. Now I am fairly certain I can make a world title fight for him in the summer and there will probably be a crowd of 20,000. Anthony Crolla (left) is back in the gym just two months after he was attacked when interupting a burglary . I was joking with him about the lengths he will evidently go to in order to become a household name. In terms of the summer, I'm confident we could make a fight with the winner of Abril or Derry Mathews. I am also waiting to see what happens with Terence Crawford. If he steps up and vacates his WBO belt then I am sure I will deliver a fight with top contender Juan Diaz. Prizefighter goes to Blackpool for the first time on Valentine’s Day and I really can’t call who is going to walk away with the £32,000 prize. Luke Keeler and Jack Arnfield, a local fighter, are the favourites but this format always throws up a surprise. On the same bill we welcome back America’s Carson Jones, who had two cracking fights with Kell Brook. He is fighting Brian Rose, who has a point to prove after losing his own world title shot last year. This is a massive fight for both men. It should be a cracker and a win for Brian should put him right back in the frame for another title fight.","This will be a huge year for James DeGale as he bids to win a world title .

"Kell Brook insists he feels unbreakable like a lion, as he looks ahead to his first world title defence next month. In a promotional film commissioned by Matchroom Sport, Brook talked about his upcoming fight against Jo Jo Dan, his career to date, mentality and his horrific stabbing attack in Tenerife. The 28-year-old, who is unbeaten in his 33 career fights to date, has successfully recovered from the vicious leg-wound he suffered on holiday in September, following his IBF world welterweight title win against America's Shawn Porter. Kell Brook shoots a short promotion video ahead of his world title defence against Jo Jo Dan next month . The 28-year-old says he feels 'unbreakable like a lion' ahead of the fight against Dan . The Sheffield-born fighter is captured in action at his training camp in his home city . When speaking about the terrifying ordeal he said: 'I could remember with the knife attack just blood squirting out of my leg and right then my life flashing in front of me. 'And then I lay in hospital for four or five days and nobody could speak English - no-one was telling us what was going on, I didn't know if I'd ever walk again.' Brook saw off the challenge of 27-year-old Porter by virtue of a majority decision back in August, subsequently earning his first world title in just his second fight outside of Britain. He will now face Canadian-based Romanian Dan on March 28 at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield, and Brook, speaking at his training camp in his home city, says he is relishing the opportunity to be back in the ring again. He said: 'I got the eye of the tiger as soon as I walked into the gym. I'm like a lion you know, and I feed blood if I get my prey injured. In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail back in September, Brook revealed the severity of the leg wounds . The 28-year-old needed 34 staples in his left thigh after being stabbed while on holiday in Tenerife .

'On March 28 you're going to see me secure my first world title defence - nothing is going to stop me. 'I'm going to be walking out of the tunnel and just standing there looking round at all the fans. 'And once I get through them ropes and look at my opponent, I will feel like a lion, unbreakable, ready to rock and roll. 'When I feel a little wobble I'm going to finish him - no matter what.

Despite that the Sheffield-born fighter admits the thought of losing does enter his mind at times - but that only inspires him to become a better fighter. He added: 'Being undefeated in 33 fights and being world champion makes me frightened of losing something. It makes me train even harder.

"Harrowing new details have emerged in the alleged June rape of a female Vanderbilt University student involving four college football players. Vanderbilt tight end Brandon Vandenburg, safety Cory Batey, defensive Brandon Banks, and receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie were suspended and indicted last month for allegedly raping a 21-year-old co-ed June 23 and videotaping the assault. On Saturday, the site BuzzFeed revealed information about the night of the sex assault, during which . the players linked to the case allegedly smashed through a security door . before one of the suspects covered a surveillance camera in the hallway . with a towel. Tight end Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, . California (left) and safety Cory Batey, (right) 19 of Nashville, . Tennessee, are among the four Vanderbilt football players charged with . rape . Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland . (left) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, (right) of Woodville, . Mississippi are also charged in the crime . Another explosive allegation that has emerged since the August indictments is that Coach James Franklin may have instructed one of the football players to erase the video recording depicting the rape of an unconscious woman. Mr Franklin has vehemently denied that claim. On June 23, Brandon Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, went on a date with a 21-year-old Oklahoma native. The two went to a bar called Tin Roof, and on the ride back Vandenburg's date reportedly passed out in the car. According to accounts of several Vanderbilt students, the 21-year-old was then carried to Vandenburg's room on the second floor of Gillette House. Date night: On June 23, Brandon Vandenburg took a 21-year-year woman out on a date to the Tin Roof bar, after which she passed out . Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her . Several students later recalled hearing a loud bang that night, which turned out to be the sound of a door being knocked off the hinges in the second-floor hallway. The force with which the door was broken would eventually lead authorities to suspect that football players may have been involved. Investigators working on the case believe that Mr Vandenburg brought his passed-out date to his room and had sex with her without consent, with three of his teammates present at one point or another in the course of the night. According to BuzzFeed sources, unnamed objects were also employed to sexually penetrate the unconscious student, and Vandenburg used his cell phone to allegedly take graphic photos and record video, which he later sent to four people. It remains unclear whether the alleged rape victim remained in Vandenburg’s room until the next morning, or whether she was carried to another room in the dormitory. Another arrest: Wide-receiver Chris Boyd is being charged with accessory after the fact for allegedly trying to help the four accused rapists cover up the sexual assault . Sex crime: Four Vanderbilt University football players were indicted earlier this month in connection with the June 23 rape of an unconscious 21-year-old girl in a dorm room . However, multiple sources agree that a . towel was placed over a security camera so that the 21-year-old could . be discreetly moved through the hallway. According . to the website’s sources, the young woman - described by friends as . fun-loving but hard-working – only found out about what had happened to . her on the night of June 23 when she was made aware of the existence of . photos and video recorded inside Vandenburg’s room. In . the aftermath of the rape scandal, Coach Franklin, who has been . credited with revitalizing Vanderbilt’s football program, told reporters . that the allegations break his heart both professionally and . personally. However, it has . been suggested by a BuzzFeed source close to one of the defendants that . Franklin may have encouraged a player to delete a video of the incident . after the player showed it to him. Franklin’s . attorney, Hal Hardin, has said that his client strongly denies it and . has been cooperating fully with the investigation. All seven men linked to the rape case have posted bail and are now free. Vandenburg was released Wednesday on $350,000 bond. Accomplices: 19-year-old Miles Joseph Finley, left and 20-year-old Joseph Dominick Quinzio, right, are acquaintances of Vandenburg's accused of tampering with evidence . Cory Batey, 19 of Nashville, Tennessee; Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland; Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, of Woodville, Mississippi; and Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, California, were charged with two counts of aggravated sexual battery in early August. Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. Freed: Brandon Vandenburg was released from jail this week on $350,000 bond . Wide receiver Chris Boyd, 21, was indicted August 16 as accessory after the fact for allegedly giving the suspects advice on how to cover up the sexual assault. Two acquaintances of Vandenburg, Miles Joseph Finley, 19, and Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, have been charged with tampering with evidence. Vanderbilt dismissed the players June 29 and barred them from the campus pending the investigation. At the time, Ms Fortune said that their first thoughts are for the victim, a Vanderbilt student, and that the university will continue to offer her all of its services and support. 'We are shocked and saddened by the allegations that such an assault has taken place on our campus and that they include members of our football team,' she said in a statement. According to Nashville police, the four men are charged with raping the unconscious woman inside Vandenburg's room at Gillette House dormitory early June 23. University officials checking the dorm's surveillance in the hallways on an unrelated matter noticed the four's behavior and notified the Vanderbilt University Police Department the night of June 25. Campus police contacted Nashville's sex crimes unit June 26. Vanderbilt did not identify the four players until July 15 before the Commodores headed to Alabama for Southeastern Conference media days. Grave allegation: It has been suggested that Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin may have instructed a player to erase the video of the June rape - but he denies it . None of the four played a snap for Vanderbilt last season. Batey came in last season as a receiver and redshirted behind Jordan Matthews and Chris Boyd before switching to safety this spring. Banks also redshirted as a freshman last season. His attorney Grover Collins declined to comment on the indictment but said last month that Banks is innocent and fully cooperating with police. McKenzie redshirted in 2012, but the 5-foot-8 receiver had four catches for 83 yards in the Commodores' spring game -- the most yards receiving in the game. His attorney, Jodie Bell, did not immediately return a message by the AP. The 6-foot-5 Vandenburg was considered one of the top junior college tight ends nationally coming out of Xavier College Prep, and he became the first junior college transfer at Vanderbilt since Jordan Rodgers in 2010.","Vanderbilt head football coach James Franklin suspected of instructing player to erase video of the rape .

"Carl Froch is in line to meet Bernard Hopkins in the legendary American’s landmark first fight at the age of 50. The hold up in plans for the Nottingham Cobra to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas has raised the lucrative alternative of a summer world title fight between Froch and Hopkins. Froch, already frustrated by legal issues repeatedly delaying the finalising of contracts with Chavez, has sustained a minor elbow injury which would have affected his preparations for the scheduled date of March 28. Carl Froch is in line to take on 50-year-old American legend Bernard Hopkins this year . Froch wants to fulfil one of his dreams by fighting either at the City Ground or in Las Vegas . That comes just as Hopkins has confirmed his intention of ‘at least one more fight’ following his 50th birthday last Thursday. The recently dethroned world light-heavyweight champion has also advised Golden Boy Promotions, in whom he is a shareholder, that he is ‘ready to come down to super-middleweight’ for what he calls ‘a massive, hugely exciting fight with Froch.’ The options under Froch’s consideration are Nottingham Forest’s City Ground in June or the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Vegas in middle to late April. Either would fulfil one of Froch’s long-standing ambitions – boxing before a huge crowd in his beloved Forest’s City Ground or bringing his career to a climax in the fight capital of the world. The choice would probably rest upon whether it would go on late enough at night in Nottingham – like 3 or 4am – to meet the schedule of the pay-per-view TV networks in America. Hopkins has passed 50 but is showing no signs of slowing down and wants 'at least one more fight' Froch is coming off the back of two wins over English rival George Groves . The Vegas dream was the motivation for seeking the fight with Chavez. However, negotiations with the same-name son of the iconic Mexican fighter have been deeply complicated by his contractual dispute with Bob Arum, his Hall of Fame promoter. Arum is highly likely to take legal action in defence of his conviction that Chavez owes him one more fight. He told me: ‘If Julio wants to fight Froch he will have to bite the bullet of Top Rank (Arum’s company) being the promoter.’ It is by no means certain that even Al Haymon, the secretive Svengali now representing so many fighters in America including Chavez, can guarantee the Froch fight actually happening. Hopkins was dominated by Sergey Kovalev in their world title fight in Atlantic City in November . Hopkins with American heavyweight Deontay Wilder before his win over Bermane Stiverne . Froch is not closing the Chavez door completely but is now very alert to the chance of joining Hopkins in a history-making event. It was confirmed on Tuesday, too, that Chavez will take on light heavyweight former world title challenger Andrezj Fonfara on April 18. He says: ‘The elbow would have affected my training for Chavez. I am also aware of the situation regarding Hopkins and I am very interested in that fight.’ To say that Hopkins is interested would be a substantial understatement. He told me recently: ‘This would be a great fight wherever it happens. If it’s in England I’d happily take a boat to get over there.’ One possible venue for a fight between Froch and Hopkins is Nottingham Forest's City Ground . Froch has grown frustrated of negotiations with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr over a fight in Las Vegas . Chavez Jnr has a dispute with Bob Arum . Now, despite losing his belt to Sergey ‘Krusher’ Kovalev over 12 hard rounds in December, this astonishingly fit veteran is telling various sources in the US: ‘I will fight at 50 so that people can fully understand why I call myself 'The Alien'. Nor do I want a ‘soft’ win over a nobody. It needs to be a significant championship fight.’ Hopkins has been sounding out Kovalev’s rival light-heavy champion Adonis Stevenson and middleweight knock-out sensation Gennady Golovkin. But Stevenson is thought to be reluctant to follow in Kovalev’s footsteps. And the wide disparity in poundage between Hopkins and Golovkin is a significant obstacle and there would be no title on the line if they met at a catch-weight. Froch at super-middleweight would give Hopkins a shot at two world title belts. The IBF have ordered Froch to open negotiations for a mandatory defence against fellow Englishman James DeGale by the end of this month. However, that elbow injury also opens the door for Froch to seek a stay of execution. Questions were already being asked as to why another mandatory defence is being demanded of Froch immediately following two such fights with George Groves. Conscious also that Hopkins, too, has been a distinguished champion for their organisation, the IBF are now inviting Froch to request an exemption. Their Championship Committee chairman Lindsey E Tucker says: ‘If Carl makes such an application we will give it full consideration in the next 15 days.’ Froch has been ordered by the IBF to begin negotiations with mandatory challenger James DeGale . Even if such a plea was rejected Froch would still bring to the table his ‘regular’ WBA world title. Not that any governing body would want to miss out on a fight for which global fascination would be further excited by the possibility of it providing the grand finale of not one but two phenomenal careers. Be it in Forest’s penalty area or along that desert strip, a crock of gold is awaiting these two gentlemen of the prize-ring. The powers of recovery which have helped keep Kell Brook undefeated through more than 30 professional fights on his climb to world champion status have been revealed as even more special by the announcement that he will return to the ring on March 28. Brook needed 34 staples in a deep, vicious leg-wound after being stabbed on holiday following his winning of the IBF world welterweight belt from America’s Shawn Porter. Kell Brook will return to the ring on March 28 after he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife . Brook won the IBF world welterweight title when he beat Shawn Porter in Los Angeles in August . There were fears that the injury might be career-threatening, but Brook will be ready in just nine weeks to defend that title in his home town of Sheffield - Special K indeed. His challenger will be named this Thursday and is expected to one of two Canadian-based boxers, No 1 contender Jo Jo Dan or the more lowly ranked Andonin Decarie. Kell Brook’s first world title defence will be televised live on Sky Sports on March 28.","Carl Froch is in line to meet American legend Bernard Hopkins .

"A Confederate heritage group planning to install a large rebel battle flag near one of Virginia's busiest highways has been accused of racism. Virginia Flaggers has leased private land alongside the Interstate 95 in Chesterfield County near Richmond from which to fly the flag on a 50-foot flagpole on September 28. While the group says the flag is not racist and will honor . Confederate soldiers, critics say it is an inherent symbol of slavery and segregation. Controversial: Virginia Flaggers, a group promoting the public display of the battle flag, has leased private land along Interstate 95 in Virginia with plans to raise the flag on September 28 . Flaggers spokeswoman Susan Hathaway said the flag 'will serve to welcome visitors and commuters to Richmond, and remind them of our honorable Confederate history and heritage', according to Mother Jones. Member Grayson Jennings told wtvr.com the group has raised more than the $3000 target for security fencing, lighting and a camera. However he refused to disclose the exact location of the property, fearing vandalism from the plan's vocal opponents. More than 3,000 people have signed a petition to stop the flag flying, according to wtvr.com. Taking a stand: The Virginia Flaggers say they have leased private land near the Interstate 95, just south of Richmond, in which to install the Confederate flag . Local politicians and the National . Association for the Advancement of Colored People are protesting the . plan to place the flag near Richmond, a former capitol of the . Confederate States of America, according to The Wall Street Journal. 'I honor my ancestors but I'm not going . to do that by flying a Confederate flag 150 years later,' Jon . Baliles, a Richmond city councilor, said. 'I would like people going up and down . [Interstate] 95 to know Richmond is a lot different than it used to be.' L.J. McCoy Jr., president of the Chesterfield County branch of the NAACP, . said erecting the flag would incite violence. 'If you want to honor . your heritage and your ancestors, you need to do it in a more . conservative way,' he said. McCoy is among a number of opponents who say they are considering erecting a billboard near the flag with . an alternative viewpoint. Fundraising: Virginia Flaggers member Grayson Jennings said the group has raised enough money for security fencing, lighting and a camera . More than 150 years after the Civil War began, the flag remains divisive. Confederate forces, fighting in part to preserve the institution of slavery, carried the banner into battle. During the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s, many supporters of segregation, including the Ku Klux Klan, flew the flag to represent their cause. Many groups now consider the flag a symbol of racial intolerance. However its checkered history hasn't stopped Confederate advocates from placing similar flags in places including the Interstate 75 in Tampa, Florida, and around South . Georgia. 'We're not offending anybody,' Flaggers member Barry Isenhour said. 'My hope is people start revering people's rights to honor their ancestors.' wtvr.com reports work on the installation has not commenced.","Confederate heritage group Virginia Flaggers plans to install battle flag alongside Virginia highway .

"Jason Palmer tells a fun story about the day earlier this year when he took his extraordinary brand of golf to a tournament in Germany and a spectator felt compelled to confront him. It was the sort of conversation many on-lookers have considered but not entered. Palmer had just missed the 18th green in the second-tier event, which would once have meant a neurotic panic for a man whose problems with chipping moved him to tears in the past. Worse than that, the thought of taking those delicate little shots used to make him want to quit the game altogether. Jason Palmer is nicknamed the 'One-Armed Bandit' by the European Tour for playing chip shots one handed . But those were the days before he devised the unique technique that made the German chap take notice. The man the European Tour calls the 'One-Armed Bandit' put a single hand on his club and took a little swing. 'I was chipping one-handed and it was actually one of the rare times these days when I messed it up,' he says. 'I had a bad lie and it was a hard shot. But this German guy has seen me playing with one hand and obviously thought I was messing around or joking or something. 'I was walking off the green and he actually confronted me and asked, 'Is this for real?' and motioned one-handed. 'In golf, walking up and criticising a pro's technique just doesn't really happen. 'I guess he was a bit taken aback by it. But believe me, if I was playing two-handed the shot would have probably been worse and certainly I would not be out there.' These days, 'out there' means the European Tour. Palmer recently won full playing privileges to play on the big stage, a charming and unconventional triumph for a 30-year-old from Leicester who was an England international in his early twenties as an amateur and a 'quivering wreck' with the yips a couple of years later. Palmer came across the technique while going through struggles with his short game . Now, whenever he finds himself within 40 yards of the pin but off the green, he will pitch or chip one-handed, be it from a bunker, rough or fairway. Many golfers have their kinks, but none quite like this. He is the first player in the Tour's history to play in such a way. The titters and sniggers have followed him for four years since his 'eureka moment'. But as Palmer, who turned professional in 2009, says, 'people can laugh yet this is a results business and this has saved me'. The cruel irony is that as a young international with two hands on the club, his short game was his strong point. 'I was a late starter and only picked up a club for the first time at 14,' he says. 'Within a year my handicap went from 26 to 15 and then in another year it went to five. 'I was improving so fast. My short game was definitely the best bit. I was such a weedy kid I could do nothing off the tee but my chipping and pitching was so precise. 'When I first got in the England squad, in 2007, it was my forte. Then, possibly because I put so much attention on my long game, it all went horribly, horribly wrong. Before he had the yips, Palmer's short game was his strongest attribute as a young golfer . 'It would start with one duffed chip. And then another. Before long it was getting in my head. Golf is one of those games you play best with a clear head and here I was thinking about technique. 'The more I thought the worse it got. In time, I had the yips — I was practically terrified every time I missed the green because I knew I'd mess up the chip. I remember going to Australia with the England squad. I was two or three under par and missed a green. 'What followed was like watching a tennis match with me going hitting through the green, walking across and then hitting it back through to the other side. 'I just could not get it to stop and ended up with eight or nine for the hole. I can also remember the club championships here (at Kirby Muxloe Golf Club) in 2008. I was cruising with a three-shot lead with five to play. 'I had a 350-yard hole, my drive left me 70 and then I hit two yards with my wedge. That's annoying. Then I did the same again. I barely dragged myself over the line. 'When I'd go away with the England squad, I'd have to do these skills competitions against brilliant players who are excellent professionals now like Chris Wood. 'He would knock them stiff from 70 yards and I'd miss the green. They were dark days. 'In 2009, I was so low. I was upstairs at home and tears were welling in my eyes. 'I was saying to my dad, 'I can't do this anymore'. We quite often didn't see eye to eye because he pushed me so hard but he put his arm around my shoulder and said, 'I do believe you can do it. Don't give up'.' Chris Wood, who palmer played with for England, pictured celebrating 2013 Qatar Masters victory . Palmer pictured in action at the Scottish Hydro Challenge during the 2014 Challenge Tour season . A year later, at a tournament in Spain, frustration finally got the better of him. He approached a chip shot he simply felt unable to play and instead hit it one-handed. It went within an inch of the hole. 'I was playing a week later on the Alps Tour in Austria,' he says, 'and was having a pitching contest with my friend, Neil Chaudhuri, and I was doing it one-handed. 'I was going over all my problems with him and saying how I could do it just fine one-handed. It was a bit of a eureka moment — he just said, ""This is a results game. If one-handed works for you, who cares if you feel stupid doing it."" The next few weeks I played the golf of my life.' By the start of this year, Palmer had reached the Challenge Tour. More than £85,000 in winnings and a tournament victory has landed him on the European Tour. 'People give me some double-takes,' he says. 'You get some strange looks and there was that German guy. I guess it does look crazy. 'But would I be playing on the European Tour with two hands on the club? No chance. People can laugh if they want but I'm pinching myself.'","Jason Palmer has qualified for the European Tour from the Challenge Tour .

"Monday night saw the latest development in Tiger Woods's extraordinary career: the 14-time major winner played caddie to Jimmy Fallon in a chipping contest with Rory McIlroy. The sight of Woods laughing and joking with Fallon and McIlroy on The Tonight Show will stun those used to seeing the steely-eyed, sometimes surly and often foul-mouthed Woods who prowls golf courses. After McIlroy's recent wins at The Open and the US PGA Championship, the Northern Irishman and world No 1 is becoming a true rival to Woods as the biggest name in golf, and the two superstars joined funnyman Fallon to promote Nike's new Vapor irons. All smiles: Rory McIlroy (let) and Tiger Woods (right) on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon . Game on: Fallon challenged McIlroy ro a chipping contest, with Woods playing caddie for the TV host . One-nil: Fallon and McIlroy share a joke after the first pane of glass is shattered . Aim of the game: The pair attempted to break images of each other painted onto glass . Game for a laugh: Woods sat out the competition but joined in the fun and cracked a few jokes . Fallon managed to convince the pair to engage in a game of 'facebreakers', in which the aim was to chip golf balls in order to smash glass windows stained with images of Fallon and McIlroy's faces. The first to smash all the faces of their rival was the winner. Woods, who has suffered a miserable year through injury, culminating in a miserable performance in missing the cut two weeks ago at Valhalla, sat out the competition. All of which was probably wise - who knows what US captain Tom Watson would have made of Woods chipping the ball after the 38-year-old pulled out of the Ryder Cup last week. Instead, a beaming Woods played caddie for Fallon, setting up balls for the TV host to chip. He even cracked a few good jokes: 'Just getting the balls lined up for you, sir,' he obsequiously told Fallon, drawing a laugh from the audience. Fallon couldn't hide his delight at having arguably the greatest golfer in history as his caddie. But, as McIlroy took charge of the contest, Fallon screamed: 'Tiger, help me!' But the four-time major winner took the trophy. Meanwhile, Woods revealed he pulled out of the Ryder Cup because he did not feel he could have won a point for the United States. Woods withdrew himself from contention for the competition, which gets under way at Gleneagles in Scotland on September 23, and has ruled himself out of any further action until December as he attempts to get to the root cause of persistent back problems. 'Physically, I couldn't do it,' Woods told Sky Sports News of his decision to inform United States captain Tom Watson he was unavailable. 'I wouldn't be ready, and not being able to be there for my team-mates, the captain, assistant captain and everyone that's involved in the event, I just wouldn't be ready and I just couldn't help the team. 'When your name is called you have to be able to go out there and get a point and I just didn't feel like I could be ready enough to get a point. Year to remember: McIlroy won The Open in July (left) and the US PGA Championship in August (right) Back problems: Woods has endured a miserable year as he battles to overcome serious injury . 'With that being said it was time to shut it down, get stronger, get more explosive again and get back for next year.' The former world No 1 said he is working in the gym and does not plan to pick up a golf club for a month with nothing on his agenda until his own tournament, the World Challenge tournament at Isleworth in Orlando, Florida, in the first week of December. 'I've got to be physically fit when I come back so I'll be explosive again and stable,' he said. 'Obviously this year was frustrating in that I didn't really feel that I gave myself much of a chance. 'I first had that pain in my back and it would go away, and then it would come back, go away, come back, until eventually it never went away... It got fixed, but I took that fall on No 2 at the (WGC-Bridgestone Invitational) and I hadn't done any agility training yet so my hip got misaligned and everything went into spasm again. 'We got that all calmed down again but then I had to play. Now I need to keep it calm, then strengthen it and then I'll be back. That's one of the reasons I've shut it down. I'll come back in December and be ready for next year.' VIDEO Arnie's surgery & Tiger and Rory appear on Fallon .","Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods appeared on The Tonight Show on Monday .

"From Rory McIlroy's wins at Wentworth and Hoylake to Henrik Stenson's flying finish in Dubai via a Ryder Cup victory for Europe at Gleneagles, it's been quite a year on the European Tour. That's not even mentioning Justin Rose claiming victory in Scotland, Pablo Larrazabal beating McIlroy in Abu Dhabi or Oliver Wilson beating, yes McIlroy again, on the Old Course to win the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. But amid all those great achievements, who was the one player to hit the best single shot of the year? The European Tour have selected their top shots from each month in which tournaments were played in 2014 for you to decide. Jamie Donaldson hit the shot that clinched the Ryder Cup for Europe . These are the contenders and you can watch each shot in the video below... January - Charl Schwartzel's incredible recovery from a cart path at the Volvo Golf Champions. The South African hit his iron off the tarmac to just two feet. February - Victor Dubuisson's chip from desert scrub to five feet for a remarkable up-and-down in the final of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final at Dove Mountain. Victor Dubuisson somehow escaped from this horrid spot at Dove Mountain . March - Miguel Angel Jimenez's holed bunker shot at the Eurasia Cup in Malaysia. April - Danny Willett's hole-in-one at the Volvo China Open - the holed five-iron was the first ace of the Englishman's career. May - Rory McIlroy's holed approach to the 7th hole at Wentworth's West Course during his victorious march towards the BMW PGA Championship. Rory McIlroy hits his approach to the 7th at Wentworth, which spun back on the green and into the hole . June - Robert Rock's stunning escape out of knee-high rough during the Irish Open at Fota Island - he hacked out but set up a certain birdie from eight inches. July - Sergio Garcia's holed approach to the 2nd hole at Hoylake during The Open. August - Jamie Donaldson's laser-guided approach to the 8th hole at the D+D Real Czech Masters. The Welshman's shot from nearly 200 yards stopped six inches from the pin. September - Donaldson's Ryder-Cup-winning wedge. He struck the shot to just 18 inches on the 15th at Gleneagles' Centenary Course to see off Keegan Bradley in the Sunday Singles and clinch Europe's victory over the United States. October - Henrik Stenson's holed wedge at the Volvo World Match Play Championship that saw off Thongchai Jaidee on the 17th at The London Club's International Course. Henrik Stenson holed his wedge approach into the 17th green at the London Club in October . November - Henrik Stenson's darevdevil tee shot on the 195-yard 17th at the DP World Tour Championship, which ended a foot from the hole. P.S. For a bit more fun, here's an alternative look at the European Tour season, featuring McIlroy's glamourous blonde admirer, a hornet attack and that baboon...","Rory McIlroy features on list of top European Tour shots of 2014 .

"Luke Donald may have been looking for a few birdies in the Nedbank Golf Challenge on Friday but he would never have expected to come across a baboon. The former world No 1 was stood over his approach to the green in South Africa when he was alerted to the presence of the primate by caddie John McLaren. Understandably surprised by the animal's appearance, the 36-year-old scarpered away from his ball as the muscular baboon skipped past Donald and onto the green.

Donald watches as the baboon runs past his ball and onto the green in South Africa . The baboon strolls past Donald and onto the green for the former world number one to relax . Donald finds the funny side of the event, laughing as he approaches the green . After the round, Donald explained: 'We were walking up 13, saw one hiding in the tree, and got to my ball and suddenly Shane (Lowry, playing partner) said, 'Watch out!'"". 'And I turned around and the thing is galloping towards me. I jumped out of the way. 'My facial expression I'm sure was caught on camera and probably on the internet already by now. It gave me a little bit of a fright as he strolled right by me.' Donald hit nine birdies during his second round to lead at the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa . Donald tweeted after the incident (both above) and saw the funny side to his reaction after a fine round . Donald found the funny side when he tweeted: 'Couple of things happened to me that haven't happened in a while....one I shot 63, and two I let a baboon play thru on the course' 'The fact that my caddy Johnnie didn't even flinch, makes my reaction look even more pathetic!! #HeWasaBigBoyTho' The incident didn't sway Donald's form, though, as he finished the round ten over par, extending his lead over Ross Fisher into the weekend. The muscular baboon which scared Donald walks along the course in South Africa . The Englishman had an average opening day on Thursday, shooting a one-under par round of 71, but showed the class which saw him top the world rankings in 2011, carding a nine-under par 63. Donald, 34, made six birdies on the front nine and added three on the back without dropping a shot throughout. That was enough to see him move clear of compatriot Ross Fisher, who had held the overnight lead heading into Friday's play at at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City. 'It's been a while since I've gone really low,' said Donald on the European Tour website. The baboon takes his moment in the spotlight posing for the camera after the incident with Donald . 'I've been seeing some signs of a lot of improvement in the last few weeks and some lower rounds in the mid to high 60s, but obviously nine birdies around this place is a great round and something I was very pleased with. 'I felt very in control. It's been a while since I felt like that. Everything starts for me when I can feel like I can drive it in the fairway and then give myself some opportunities, and obviously when the putter is warm it's always one of my best weapons in the bag.' Despite losing the lead, Fisher stayed in contention with a round of 70 and now sits two behind Donald - with the same gap back to Frenchman Alexander Levy. Donald keeps a look out for the baboon before finishing the round ten under par and leading the Challenge . 'I don't feel I played as solidly as yesterday,' Fisher said of his second-round effort. 'I didn't hit it as well off the tee. It would have been nice to have picked up a couple coming in, but six under yesterday and two under today, it's moving in the right direction and I'm only two shots behind with two rounds to go. 'Yesterday we read the greens really well but today we over-read them. I had seven or eight putts that I hit exactly where I wanted to, but I over-read the borrow. Hopefully tomorrow they will go in again.' Ross Fisher, teeing off in South Africa, hopes to catch Donald over the weekend from two shots behind .","Luke Donald was chased by a baboon during the Nedbank Golf Challenge .

"Ian Poulter became the latest brave (or mad) star to take up the craze sweeping - and freezing - professional golf right now: the Ice Bucket Challenge. The flaymboyant Englishman shared a video of himself pouring a huge bin full of ice and water over his own head in his garden in England on Tuesday, mimicking many of the game's biggest names who have already taken up the gauntlet.

"Remember Tiger Woods' incredible chip-in at the Masters in 2005 and the will-it-or-won't-it pause before his ball dropped into the cup? Time seemed to stand still as Tiger's Nike ball made its final revolution, and one of golf's legendary moments was born. But if you thought that was a dramatic pause, it has nothing on Scott Langley's putt at Muirfield Village last week. While Woods's ball hovered on the lip for a second or so, the 25-year-old American had to wait a full 24 seconds for his ball to drop. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Scott Langley's remarkable putt . Birdie chance: Scott Langley putts on the 16th green at Muirfield during the Memorial Tournament . Unfortunate: Langley looked like he had just missed his chance with the ball coming to a rest behind the hole . Hang on a second (or 24): But the ball was still in motion and moving very slowly towards the hole . How about that? Langley shrugs after his ball finally relent to gravity and drops in the hole . OK, so Woods was chasing the Masters title at Augusta on a Sunday while Langley was on his way to finishing 28th in the Memorial Tournament, so the 14-time major champion's chip was just a little more important in the grand scheme of things. But Langley's putt was quite remarkable. His 12-foot birdie effort curled around the back of the cup on the 16th green at Muirfield Village before seemingly coming to a stop just millimetres from its intended target. But the ball wasn't quite done yet. Although it is hard to see on the TV footage, his ball was fractionally moving towards the cup all the time. The most dramatic of pauses: Tiger Woods holed an incredible chip-in at the Masters in 2005 . The rules of golf state that a moving ball must not be hit and so Langley, after a conversation with playing partner Bubba Watson, waited and urged his ball to complete its final roll. Finally, it relented to gravity and fell in for a birdie two. With no need for jumping up and down or blowing on it either. Eat your heart out, Tiger.","American Scott Langley hit a putt which stayed on edge of the hole for 24 seconds before falling into the cup .

"Rory McIlroy's booming drives helped him birdie both the 17th and 18th holes on Wentworth's West Course to win the BMW PGA Championship last Sunday. But if you thought the Northern Irishman hit the ball a long way you've seen nothing yet. Former world long drive champion Joe Miller has starred in a remarkable video produced by the European Tour which shows just how easy those two holes can be (providing you blast the ball around 450 yards off the tee). Yes, that's right: 450 yards. McIlroy is one of the game's biggest hitters but in the cold English air he could perhaps expect to send his best drives 320 yards down the fairway. Miller shows in this video how he can blast his tee shots well over 100 yards longer than arguably the best player in the world. Scroll down to watch Joe Miller's incredible drives... and exploding watermelon trick . Big swing: Joe Miller fires off a drive on the 18th tee at Wentworth's West Course . I've got the power: Miller also demonstrated his huge hitting ability by destroying a watermelon . Take splat: Miller's golf ball annihilates the fruit after his driver (left) makes contact with the ball . The real Happy Gilmore: Miller is a former world long drive champion and can hit the ball prodigious distances . Miller can be seen playing both the 17th and 18th holes - the signature par-five, par-five finish at Wentworth - and setting up eagle chances with monstrous drives followed by easy wedge shots into the greens. Such skills would have come in handy for the likes of Luke Donald, who needed an eagle on the final hole on Sunday to match McIlroy's eventual winning score. Miller's colossal power is also demonstrated as he drives his golf ball clean through a watermelon placed in front of the tee, exploding the fruit into smithereens. Champion: Rory McIlroy poses with the trophy after winning the BMW PGA Championship last week . Big bash: The Northern Irishman is a long hitter but even he needed to take a long iron into the 18th green . You beau-tee: McIlroy hits his drive on the 17th hole - Wentworth's signature par-five - last Sunday . All of which begs the question: why is Miller not a tour player if he can make things looks so easy? Well, thankfully for McIlroy and Co, golf is about more than just blasting the ball into oblivion. There's also the small matter of iron play, chipping and putting to think about - not to mention bunkers - as well as being able to perform in front of a huge audience. But while Miller is not a good enough all-round player to match the likes of McIlroy, he can still have fun smashing his ball around the globe. Long drive is a growing element of golf, earning popularity in the United States in particular. At 6ft 4in and 19 stone, the 30-year-old Miller is one of its highest profile names. It's just a shame we don't get to see his putts...","Wentworth hosted BMW PGA Championship last week .

"McLaren's running on the third day of pre-season testing stopped just before lunch because of a problem with Fernando Alonso’s Honda engine. Testing can be an event for sitting around drinking coffee and the like. And McLaren’s drivers have had more time to do that than they would care for this week. Fernando Alonso encountered problems with his McLaren Honda during day three of pre-season testing . Alonso (left) and Jenson Button (right) have been restricted to just six laps each on the first two days . But the mechanics have had a busy time. A night-shift worked hard on Monday to rectify the problems that limited Alonso and Jenson Button to just six laps each on the first two days in Jerez. It seemed as if they had turned a corner on Tuesday, as Alonso put in 32 laps before the gremlins struck. ‘He had just begun a timed run when he felt something awry with the car,’ said a McLaren spokesman. ‘He returned the car to the garage, where we discovered a loss of cooling water pressure. Fixing the issue required the removal of the power unit — a lengthy change that we couldn’t have completed in time for the car to return to the track today. ‘Nevertheless, it’s a fixable problem, and we’ll get things replaced ahead of Jenson’s final run in the car tomorrow.’ Nico Rosberg drives his Mercedes around the track during day three of the testing in Jerez . McLaren were 14 seconds off the pace set by Felipe Nasr of Sauber. But the British team remain optimistic of being strong by the first race in Melbourne on March 15, despite Honda only returning to the sport this year, 12 months after all their rival engine manufacturers began to compete under the new regulations. While Mercedes continued to clock up more miles than anyone else, Ferrari are happy with their progress. Driver Kimi Raikkonen said the car was a ‘completely different story’ from last year’s. He added: ‘There are a lot of good points in the areas where we had difficulties last time. Rosberg talks to the media after day three of the 2015 Formula One pre-season testing . ‘It’s early days and the circuit mostly stayed damp today, but we had good running and got some mileage.’ Mercedes’ Nico Rosberg, who was third fastest behind Nasr and Raikkonen, added his voice to the positive noises, saying the Ferrari’s pace was an ‘eye-opener’. Raikkonen’s contract is due to expire at the end of the season, with Lewis Hamilton a possible candidate to replace him. Raikkonen, a placid Finn, merely said: ‘If it goes badly and I don’t sign it, then I don’t sign it. It’s not the end of the world.’","McLaren's third day of pre-season testing was interrupted significantly .

In an interview with Le Parisien, Philippe Streiff, another former F1 driver, said Schumacher ‘had yet to recover the power of speech’ but was ‘nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him’. Streiff, described by the newspaper as a long-time friend, said he had gleaned the information from contact with the German-born driver’s wife, Corinne, and with his surgeon, Gerard Saillant, whom he knows as a result of his own racing accident in 1989.

"Two tries from prolific centre Matt Williams powered Wellington to a victory over arch-rivals Tonbridge which clinched the Daily Mail Schools Trophy. A 22-18 win capped Wellington’s season which has featured some brilliant back play led by Williams, a member of the England Under 17 squad, who contributed 17 tries to be the school’s top scorer. Williams has been part of a squad who have won 11 out of 13 matches in which the only blemishes were a defeat against Sedbergh and a draw at home to Dulwich. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Daily Mail Schools Trophy: Wellington 22-18 Tonbridge . Wellington centre Matt Williams dive over for one of his two tries against Tonbridge . Wellington celebrate their Daily Mail Schools Trophy victory over arch-rivals Tonbridge . A tough fixture list – including the majority of the top rugby-playing schools in the country – proved no burden and Wellington managed to fend off Sedbergh, Kirkham and Monmouth at the top of this merit table-based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk over the autumn term. Nearly 100 schools entered for a second season following the inaugural success of Woodhouse Grove, the Bradford school, last December. Grove, who put together an unbeaten run of games last season, had to rebuild this campaign while Wellington, who had suffered a number of injuries in 2013, produced sustained excellence and scored 476 points in all. Coach Kevin Brennan rates Wellington’s win over Millfield, in which Williams scored three tries, as about the best performance. ‘There’s a terrific sense of achievement among the squad because we set out to play well and to push ourselves,’ he said. Wellington make a break during their 22-18 victory at Tonbridge School . A Tonbridge forward carries the ball up towards the Wellington fly half . ‘The most pleasing aspect were the wins on the Saturdays after two very hard midweek games against Millfield and Sedbergh. ‘We managed to back up our performances immediately after those very testing games. After we beat Millfield at Ilffley Road, we went on the next weekend to beat Eton and after losing to Sedbergh we then beat Epsom College.’ Williams, a member of the London Irish academy, will be chasing England honours after Christmas alongside five other Wellington players in flanker Jack Ingall, full-back Tom Parton, centre Conor Dolan, wing Sam Aspland-Robinson and scrum-half Rory Brand. If the backs enjoyed the glory, there were some heroes among the hard working forwards in a goal-kicking captain Will Wilson and lock Josh Basham, a fifth former, who played every minute of every match. Wellington played their best rugby on the dry pitches of the autumn to overhaul to early Trophy leaders in Grammar School At Leeds. Wellington celebrate their 11th victory in 13 matches after their latest Daily Mail Schools Trophy success . A drone camera is used to capture the action at Tonbridge School in Kent . But a narrow defeat to Sedbergh, in a mid-week game at Broadstreet, saw the Cumbrians snatch the leadership until they were toppled by unbeaten Kirkham. That defeat gave Wellington the opportunity to retake the lead following their win at Epsom College backed up by wins over Cranleigh and Tonbridge to seal the title.

"Schools rugby Leaders Wellington start a hectic week in the Daily Mail Schools Trophy at Hampton on Saturday following the half-term break. Three games in seven days will test a strong squad who have six players in the England under 18 and 17 training squads. This all-round strength has powered Wellington to the top of the merit-table based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. Reed’s (White) have put together an unbeaten run of six games in the Trophy . Wellington also face third-placed Sedbergh at Broadstreet (kick off 6pm) on Tuesday followed by a trip to fifth-placed Epsom College on Saturday week. Hampton, who have had an injury-hit autumn, have the squad to test Wellington. They raised confidence by defeating St Benedict’s, in a curtain-raiser to the Ealing-Hartpury National League clash, last Saturday. A try from flanker Chris Penton proved the difference for Hampton in an 11-8 victory. Full-back Will Attfield also kicked two penalties. Sedbergh, who have five players in national training squads, are putting together a strong pack led by the consistency of back-rower Freddie Renwick. Reed’s the latest coming on Wednesday, 46-31, against Caterham (Yellow and black) A 33-17 win at Barnard Castle featured two tries from hooker Jack Solman. If the Cumbrians, who lost 14-10 to Wellington last season, win this latest heavyweight tussle next Tuesday they will then be in line to push to for the title with fixtures against Kirkham, Warwick and Millfield to come. A group of unbeaten teams are also in pursuit of Wellington including Kirkham, the Lancastrians who face Sedbergh on Saturday week, Reed’s, the Cobham-based school, and Stamford. Reed’s have put together an unbeaten run of six games in the Trophy, the latest coming on Wednesday, 46-31, against Caterham. This follows other good scalps against Brighton College, 16-8, and Oratory, 22-10. Brighton, who host Epsom tomorrow (Nov 8), needed last-ditch scores to gain a 19-19 draw against Eton. The crucial points came from lock Saasha Agureev and a conversion by Elliot Hall. Reed's are in pursuit of Daily Mail Schools Trophy leaders Wellington .","Wellington face three games in seven days .

"It's back! The Daily Mail Schools Trophy returns! With more than 80 top schools vying for the Daily Mail Schools Rugby Trophy, we think you’ll agree it is by far the best schools competition in the country. And unlike a knockout, which tests the better team on any given day, our winners will have proved themselves over four tough months of rugby. In more than 350 Trophy matches last year, 110 ended in wins by seven points or less. Judging by more than four million hits on schoolsrugby.co.uk, the competition was followed avidly by players, fellow pupils, parents, staff and all fans of schools rugby. For 2014 we have have made the competition even stronger. The biggest change is to the bonus points system, which rewards schools who play higher-ranked teams. Last year's winners: Woodhouse Grove School from Bradford lifted the inaugural Daily Mail Schools Trophy . It was always going to be very difficult to arrive at the perfect formula for the first year and we are excited about the continued evolution of the competition. We can’t wait for the new season to start and believe firmly the drama will match that of 2013. Let battle commence. 4 PTS - WIN . 2 PTS - DRAW . 1 PT - SCORE 4 OR MORE TRIES . 1 PT - LOSE BY 7 PTS OR LESS . 0.3 PTS - 1 TO 25 . 0.2 PTS - 26 TO 50 . 0.1 PTS - 51 TO 75 .

"Ferrari have recruited Jock Clear, the Mercedes engineer who helped Lewis Hamilton win this year's Formula One world championship, as the last key element in the Italian team's rebuilding after a dismal year. Ferrari failed to win a race in 2014, their first blank season since 1993, while dominant Mercedes won 16 of the 19 grands prix and took both titles. The sport's oldest and most successful team have carried out a major restructuring, with a host of senior staff leaving and Maurizio Arrivabene now installed as their third principal of the year. Ferrari have undergone massive restructuring after failing to win a single race last season . Team principal Maurizio Arrivabene (left) has confirmed the marque will be bringing in Jock Clear . Arrivabene told a news conference at the team's Fiorano test track on Monday that Clear would be taking the departed Pat Fry's job as head of engineering with his arrival date still being negotiated with Mercedes. 'We respect agreements and regulations,' he added. Clear, who also worked with Jacques Villeneuve at Williams when the Canadian won the 1997 world championship, will bring invaluable knowhow to Ferrari from Mercedes at a time when the Italian team are playing catch up. Arrivabene dismissed speculation that former Mercedes technical director Bob Bell, who resigned in December 2013, could also be moving to Maranello and said Ferrari now had the right people in place.

'I am not a magician, there are no miracles to be made. We have to work as a team, this is the most important thing. 'I don't believe in individual success. I believe in team success,' he added.

Schools around England will be hosting international teams next autumn as part of the third biggest sports event in the world after the Olympics and football’s World Cup. They are all being used as training bases after emerging successful from a bidding process which saw organisers draw up a shortlist of 100 proposed centres around the country. Fit for internationals: South Africa are among the sides who will train at English schools during World Cup . Organisers are hoping each centre will promote ‘adopt a team’ initiatives which proved successful at the last World Cup in New Zealand where home fans supported not just the All Blacks. Each team base had to offer an outdoor and indoor training facility, a pool, gym and hotel within close proximity.

"Darren Bent has joined promotion-chasing Derby County until the end of the season on loan, signalling the end of his time at Aston Villa. The 30-year-old will officially join the Rams when they transfer window opens on Saturday. Bent will not be able to feature in Derby’s FA Cup match against Southport as players must be registered with the FA by midday on Friday – but will be available for the key game against Ipswich at Portman Road on January 10. Darren Bent is all smiles after penning a loan deal at Derby County until the end of the season . The 30-year-old is pictured with his new Derby strip with manager Steve McLaren . FIFA rules bar players from representing more than two clubs in a season – but that has been sidestepped because Bent’s move to Brighton was on an emergency loan, and as such is not counted. The FA, Premier League and Football League all sanction these kind of transfers, even if FIFA have expressed frustration in similar circumstances in the past. The world governing body voiced their disapproval when Nicky Shorey played for three clubs in 2010. Bent will play for Derby having appeared for his parent club Aston Villa too. Bent tweeted on Friday: 'Excited to join @dcfcofficial & will give everything to help the team for the rest of the season. 'I would also like to thank Brighton who were great to me during my time there.' The short-term transfer brings an end Bent’s Aston Villa career, with his £65,000 per week contract expiring in the summer. He moved to Villa Park in January 2011 at a cost of £18million and has scored 25 goals in 72 games. Bent spent last season on loan at Fulham and had a brief spell at Brighton this campaign, scoring twice in five matches. Brighton paid £18,000 of his wages and Derby are likely to be contributing a similar amount. Bent is believed to have chosen Derby ahead of other clubs for football reasons. McClaren will believe he can re-invigorate a striker who could add a timely cutting edge to Derby’s bid for Premier League football. McClaren handed Bent two of his 13 England caps during his time as national manager. Bent's (left) Aston Villa contract runs out in the summer, and he will sign for Derby until its conclusion .

"The number of dead U.S. soldiers whose remains were dumped in landfill has been revealed and it is much higher than the military originally admitted. The Army had initially said it was unable to tell how many of the soldiers' bodies, repatriated from Iraq and Afghanistan, had been part of the process that has been a national scandal for America. But it has now been revealed that the remains of at least 274 troops - comprising 976 body fragments -  that could not be identified or were later recovered from the battlefield were incinerated and sent to a landfill site in Virginia, operated by Waste Management Inc. Shocking numbers: It has been revealed that the remains of 274 soldiers were dumped in landfill in Virginia . The families of the dead had authorized the military to dispose of the remains respectfully and with dignity. However, the relatives were completely . unaware that the remains were being dumped in landfill while the . landfill site was not informed what was being thrown away. The Dover . mortuary changed its policy to burying the parts at sea in June 2008. The figures come from a report based on information from a database at the mortuary, where the remains of most war dead return. According to The Washington Post, Air . Force officials claim they don't know when the practice began but that . its first record of such a procedure was on February 23, 2004. The secretive practice which ran for . five years, between 2003 and 2008, when the remains of some 6,300 dead . soldiers passed through Dover Air Base mortuary. The scandal is the latest to hit the military base which receives all America's war dead and prepares them for burial. Dover's mortuary processed over 4,000 sets of remains from 2008 to 2010, most of which were Iraq and Afghanistan war dead . It was earlier revealed that body parts belonging to deceased soldiers were lost or sawed off without the family’s permission. A damning report found that an arm . bone belonging to a dead marine was hacked off without asking his . parents by staff at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. An ankle and some soft tissue went . unaccounted for due to ‘gross mismanagement’ and may have been mixed in . with the remains of other soldiers. An 18-month probe into Dover's mortuary, pictured here, revealed one soldier had his arm cut off by staff without the family's permission . Whistleblowers also claimed that the . fetal remains of dependents of military personnel were shipped from . Germany back to the U.S. in cardboard boxes that had already been used. The scandal at Dover Air Force base . began after complaints by three whistleblowers - civilians who worked as . embalmers or technicians - who sparked an 18-month investigation by the . Air Force Inspector General. A separate probe was carried out by . the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative . agency which looks into claims by whistleblowers. Among the most egregious instances was . when the family of one marine asked to see his dead body one more time - . and staff at Dover had hacked his arm bone off. The heat from a bomb attack in . Afghanistan had caused the soldier’s arm to fuse at 90 degrees to his . body so he was unable to fit into his uniform or his casket. But instead of speaking to his family to see what was for the best, staff went ahead and trimmed it anyway. The investigation found the two body . parts that went missing were a piece of an ankle belonging to a soldier . killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in April 2009. The investigation found two body parts . went missing entirely, including a piece of an ankle belonging to a . soldier killed by a bomb in Afghainstan and a small piece of flesh . belonging to an airman who died in plane crash in Afghanistan . The second was a small piece of flesh belonging to an airman who died in plane crash in Afghanistan in July 2009. The investigation found two body parts went missing entirely, including a piece of an ankle belonging to a soldier killed by a bomb in Afghainstan and a small piece of flesh belonging to an airman who died in plane crash in Afghanistan . The investigation did not discover . what happened to them - but raised the possibility they fell out of the . plastic bags where they were being stored in the morgue refrigerator and . got mixed in with the remains of others. The whistleblowers also drew attention . to shipping of fetal remains belonging to relatives of military . personnel back to the U.S. Instead of being transported in the more dignified aluminium cases they were shipped in re-used cardboard boxes. In a statement accompanying her report Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said the findings were ‘deeply troubling’. She said: ‘The mortuary for the United States military should boast the best conditions and best practices of any mortuary.’ The report added that there was a . ‘pattern of the Air Force’s failure to acknowledge culpability for . wrongdoing relating to the treatment of remains of service members and . their dependents. The Dover scandal comes just months after it was revealed Arlington National Cemetery had 211 graves either mislabelled or containing the wrong person's remains . The Dover scandal comes months after . it was revealed Arlington National Cemetery had 211 graves either . mislabelled or containing the wrong person's remains .

He said: 'We understand the obligation . of this work, the sanctity of this work, the need for reverence, the . need for dignity and respect of our fallen, just as if these were our . sons and daughters'.

David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier featured both in England and America for LA Galaxy. 'I think it's a match made in heaven really,' he told the newspaper. 'One of the reasons I chose LA Galaxy was because of the success they've had recently. 'I want to finish my career very strong. I want to add some medals and trophies to my collection.' The former England captain will be joining the Western Conference side who have won three of the last four MLS Cups - including the 2014 edition. He will follow in the footsteps of former Three Lions team-mate Frank Lampard in heading across the Atlantic but unlike the on-loan Manchester City star he will start his MLS career on schedule. LA coach Arena believes the club's successful history made it an attractive proposition for Gerrard. 'Steven Gerrard arrives in July and by then we will certainly have a plan available,' Arena said. 'He's a player of quality. I'm not concerned about how he's going to fit in with our team. 'We have a club now with a proven history of success. All those things go hand in hand in making LA Galaxy a very attractive team for players such as Steven Gerrard.' Galaxy president Chris Klein described the Reds captain as 'the perfect fit'. 'We just started thinking in the universe of players that are out there, we want to make a decision on what signifies a Galaxy-designated player. 'When we look at that, Steven Gerrard is the perfect fit with what he brings to us on the field and the character that he has off it.'

The Reds skipper, who was out in Liverpool city centre at Secret nightclub on Tuesday night to celebrate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday, admitted had his boyhood club offered him a new contract last summer he would not be leaving at the end of the season. However, the midfielder insists he does not want to blame anyone for his impending departure. A contract offer was not made to Gerrard, who turns 35 in May, until November - by which time he had already been told by Brendan Rodgers his playing time would be managed. Such a tactic had already seen him left on the bench for Liverpool's Champions League match against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu and that, combined with the delay in offering him an extension, resulted in the player coming to a decision about his future. 'If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'I'd just retired from England to concentrate all my efforts on Liverpool. I didn't want my club games to be tailored. 'My injury record had been fantastic for the past two and a half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. 'It's all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. 'There's no blame and I'm not angry about it. There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. 'There is no finger pointing from me towards the manager or anyone else at the club.' Gerrard proved his enduring worth to the Reds by scoring both goals in their 2-1 FA Cup third-round win at League Two side AFC Wimbledon on Monday night. The draw for the fourth round sees Rodgers' team at home against Bolton.","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in July .

"Wayne Rooney got involved in the' Throwback Thursday' hype on his Instagram earlier today, when he posted a picture of the moment he met controversial boxing legend Mike Tyson. The Manchester United captain has previously revealed that the former 'undisputed heavyweight champion of the world' was his all-time favourite sportsman. Rooney admitted last year that he stopped boxing at the age of 14 to concentrate on playing football on the advice of former Everton boss Colin Harvey - which appears to have paid off.

United welcome struggling Leicester City to Old Trafford on Saturday and with the race of fourth hotting up - the England captain knows there can be no room for error. The Red Devils will also be hoping there won't be a repeat of the meeting between the two sides earlier in the season, when Nigel Pearson's men fought back from 3-1 to win 5-3. Louis van Gaal's side recovered from a disappointing home defeat to Southampton, to pick up three points away at Queens Park Rangers before the FA Cup meant a two-week Premier League break.

"Dominique Ansel's now world-famous pastry - the cronut - celebrated its first birthday last month. Since introducing the croissant-donut hybrid, the New York bakery has seen lines . around the block from dawn every morning and there have been countless . copies rolled out across the world. But there's a new sweet treat on the block hoping to knock the cronut from the top spot as the world's most fashionable sweet treat. Say hello to the 'biskie', a fresh, handmade creation that prides itself as the combination of the best bits of a cookie, cake and a biscuit. Watch out, cronut! There's a new sweet treat hoping to take the bakery world by storm called the Biskie - a cookie, cake and biscuit hybrid . The new pastry, which starts at £2.20 per piece, describes itself as 'not a macaroon or a whoopie pie . and not quite a biscuit or a cookie but a crisp and melt-in-the-mouth treat with an incredibly light whipped buttercream filling'. With two cookies as the outer biscuits, the Biskie is layered with handmade jams and caramels and is made with all-natural colourings and flavourings. Developed by the Cutter & Squidge bakery in London, Biskies are available in 12 flavours, with more being created every day. Signature flavours include green tea, white chocolate and raspberry, milk chocolate with peanut and salted caramel, and almond, raspberry and cherry.

The creators of the Biskie are Annabel and Emily Lui, two food-obsessed sisters who run the Cutter & Squidge bakery. With a family background in food, the women started in a tiny kitchen in North West London and now they're getting set to launch their own biskies pop-up in Selfridges food hall on June 30. They say their passion inventing new products, recreating time-honored classics and above all, creating cutting-edge taste sensations. Being health-conscious, Annabel and Emily use only the best natural ingredients for all their products and reduce fat where possible. Their specially created buttercream is made with half the amount of butter and sugar normally used in baking and their homemade jams are made with real fruit - each biskie has around 175 calories. Almost healthy? Their specially created buttercream is made with half the amount of butter and sugar normally used in baking and their homemade jams are made with real fruit . They also do not use any margarine or hydro-fats and, where possible, use ingredients sourced from British producers, they say. Speaking about their creation, they said: 'We are both self-taught bakers with no formal training but set up Cutter & Squidge, a new innovative-baked goods company based in Fulham in 2013. 'Our cooking ethos is to use all natural ingredients - no artificial colourings or flavourings. When we are creating something with passion fruit then it is made out of fresh passion fruits which we cut and scoop our ourselves, it's more expensive and time-consuming than buying ready-made puree but the flavour from a fresh passion fruit is unparalleled. 'If the biskie is green it's because we've used premium Japanese green tea which is naturally vibrant green, no need for artificial colourings and it tastes amazing. 'We have even created our own colour tints from fruits, veggies and spices to colour our own flowers and sprinkles. It is amazing how many colours you can derive from a red cabbage (including green!) using a bit of natural kitchen chemistry.' So what do they taste like? FEMAIL's resident food expert, Martha Cliff, said: ‘When we thought there were enough hybrids in the world (cronuts, labradoodles and Kimye), they found another. 'A funny cross between a whoopee pie and an ice cream sandwich, it’s fair to say that the three quarters I managed to wrestle to myself were not enough.

"Katie Holmes will be 'happy' to give evidence about her marriage to Tom Cruise  - as he continues to battle allegations he 'abandoned' their daughter, sources have revealed. The actress is believed to have signed a non-disclosure agreement as part of her divorce from the A-list star in July last year and it is thought this means she cannot reveal any details about their five-year marriage. However, Cruise, 51 is now gearing up for a $50million defamation case against Bauer Media - contesting their magazine's claims that he abandoned Suri, his daughter with Katie. And if it goes to trial - as his lawyer states - Katie, 34, could be called to the stand. Katie - who spent Thanksgiving on Thursday in Ohio with her family and seven-year-old Suri - will have no issue with this, sources connected with the case tell MailOnline, saying she will be happy to get the chance to speak freely about their marriage and split. Home for the holidays: Katie Holmes jetted back to New York for Thanksgiving from Cape Town International Airport in South Africa on Tuesday . A source said: 'Katie has been . dignified, she has got her life back together following her divorce from . Tom and is devoted to Suri, who's the only person who matters to her. 'But . if this case comes to court, Katie could be deposed and this means she . could have to reveal details about her marriage - but to be honest, this . is her chance to speak openly and she'll be happy to do it.' Cruise's . attorneys were back in court on Tuesday asking the judge to help lay . out the groundwork for their defamation case against publisher Bauer . Media over their In Touch Weekly and Life & Style stories in July . and October 2012 that claimed the star had 'abandoned' Suri.[related] . In depositions obtained by . Radar, Mission: Impossible star Cruise admits his devotion to Scientology may have played a part in his divorce to Katie. During . their five year marriage the actress was a practitioner of the church . although as soon as the couple broke up she left - taking Suri with her. During . a fierce exchange last September between the actor and the magazine’s . lawyers he was asked if Holmes had divorced him 'in part to protect Suri . from Scientology'. 'Listen, . I find that question offensive,' he exploded. 'I find it, those . statements offensive. Like with any relationship, there are many . different levels to it. You know, I, I find it very offensive. There is . no need to protect my daughter from my religion.' Single mom: Katie Holmes drops off daughter Suri at school in NYC on November 10. Katie could be called to give evidence by Bauer Media . Pushed further by the magazine's attorney Elizabeth McNamara he was then asked: 'And Ms Holmes has never indicated in any way that was one of the reasons she left you? To protect Suri from Scientology?' The Mission Impossible star then admits: 'Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes.' He was then asked: 'Is Suri currently practising Scientology?' to which he replied: 'NO.' Cruise was then forced to admit he went nearly . four straight months without seeing Suri following his divorce from Katie, alongside missing his daughter's first day of school last year. He also admitted that he only spent 10 days with his daughter from June to November 2012 last year. However, Cruise insists . he is an attentive and loving father, who stays in constant contact with . Suri through phone calls and emails as his film commitments take him . all over the world. Despite this, he did not spend Thanksgiving with Suri. Katie and Suri boarded a first class flight from New York’s LaGuardia Airport to Detroit, Michigan, early on Thursday morning. The quick flight landed less than an hour from Toledo, Ohio, where Katie's parents and siblings live, Radar reported. A fellow passanger @molzer12 tweeted: 'Katie Holmes and Suri Cruise on my flight back to Michigan. Suri playing with stuffed yellow lab. Why do I care? Dunno but I do.' Katie rushed back from filming in South Africa this week to spend the holidays with Suri. Happier times: Katie Holmes, ex-husband Tom Cruise and their daughter Suri celebrating her 33rd in NYC on December 18, 2011 . Travelling style: Katie dressed in a comfortable traveling outfit of denim shirt and jeans, with a warm black cape thrown over the top . Dressed down for the gruelling 17-hour flight back to New York, bare-faced Katie went without make-up . and tied her hair back in a simple chignon. Last Thanksgiving, Suri spent the day itself with her father Tom, while Katie returned to her hometown in Toledo, Ohio where she spent the day with her family. The low-key day involved competing in the local Turkey Trot before returning home to dinner at her parents' house with her four older siblings and their families. It was the first Thanskgiving since Katie and Tom's surprise divorce and Katie instead had her daughter with her for Christmas. Frequent flier: Despite the tiring flight the hard-working mom has been racking up the air miles as she attempts to visit Suri as much as possible while filming The Giver in South Africa . This week, when asked about his plans to see Suri over the holidays, Cruise's long-term lawyer Bert Fields told E! News that he expected Cruise to be 'seeing her a lot', adding 'He loves his child.' 'He never abandoned her [Suri],' he said: 'After the divorce, he talked to her every day and sometimes twice a day because he was very concerned.' After hearing arguments from both sides this week, Judge Jacqueline Chooljan ruled today that Cruise's team could not pursue questions against Bauer related to Nazis, however, they can ask the media company to address whether they have ever reported that Scientology was a cult banned in Germany. His legal team was also able to persuade the judge that they needed Bauer attorneys to swear under oath that they had produced all sources and information pertaining to their choice of using the word ""abandoned"" used on their cover. They said they did not want to be surprised at trial. Bauer attorney Elizabeth McNamara tells E! News she was grateful the court shut down what she called Cruise's legal team's 'sideshow'. She said, 'Hopefully it [the entire case] will be dismissed.' However, Fields insisted that contrary to McNamara's belief, he thinks this case will go to trial and that ultimately the jury will award Cruise 'enormous damages'. Fresh and easy: Bare faced Katie went without makeup and tied her hair back in a simple chignon . Meanwhile, Katie is currently filming her new movie, The Giver. The . book, and now the film, tells the story about a society which has gone . to great - and sinister - extremes to make everything equal and . peaceful. The science fiction film is based . around Jonas (played by Brenton Thwaites), who learns of the real world . outside his idyllic life. Katie . plays his mother, while True Blood star Alexander Skarsgard portrays . his father, in the movie set for release on August 15 2014.

"Many people are worried about the potential health effects of man-made chemicals sprayed on crops. But now there’s a more natural alternative from an unlikely and very small source. Dutch inventors have created an ‘EcoFarm’ that is part fish tank and part herb box and will use fish waste as a natural fertiliser to help herbs and cherry tomatoes housed above the fish tank grow rapidly. Scroll down for video . Dutch inventors have created an 'EcoFarm' that is part fish tank and part herb box and uses fish waste as a natural fertiliser to help herbs and cherry tomatoes housed above the fish tank grow rapidly . The EcoFarm is a closed loop ecosystem that consists of a tank topped with a special grow bed filled with stones. The dirty water containing fish poo is pumped up into the grow bed where the plants grow on the rocks, with all the fertiliser and nutrients coming from the fish. Herbs and small fruit and vegetables such as cherry tomatoes, peppers and strawberries can be grown in the bed. The plants work as a natural filter and clean the water. Dirty water containing waste is pumped into the 'grow bed' to feed the plants, which in turn clean the water in the fish tank below. ‘We believe that local farming is the first step to deliver fresh tasty fruits and vegetables,’ said the inventors, who are currently raising funds on crowd funding website Kickstarter. ‘With this goal on mind, Ecobird has started to develop a product line based in aquaponics.’ Aquaponics is a food production system that combines conventional aquaculture, of raising aquatic animals in tanks, with hydroponics - cultivating plants in water. The inventors, who are based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, describe their EcoFarm as ‘a symbiotic environment where the waste of the fish is used as a natural fertiliser and the plants clean the water.’ 'You can grow fresh food with the tiniest amount of effort. The only thing you need to do is feed the fish.' It may seem to some people like a neat solution for something that aquarium owners have been doing for years – watering their plants with dirty water from their fish tank. The inventors, who are based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, describe their EcoFarm as 'a symbiotic environment where the waste of the fish is used as a natural fertiliser and the plants clean the water.' Illustrations of the EcoFarm are pictured . Many people have reported on internet forums that their houseplants have thrived faster than normal by using the fishy water. 'I wanted to see how well the water from my tanks would do as a fertiliser and the results are stunning,' one person wrote on fishforums.com, while another said: I've used my tank water for years. Better than any fertiliser I ever used.’ The EcoFarm costs from €85 (£68) in Europe and the kit will include a fish tank, grow bed, pump, stones and gravel, seeds to get them started. The product will be made using injection moulding. The company expects to start production in November and to ship the tanks just in time for Christmas, if it managed to raise the money needed. The team has so far raised €2,155 (£1,717) and have a target of €125,000 (£99,603).","The EcoFarm is part fish tank and part herb box. It's been invented by a team in Rotterdam, the Netherlands .

"It's not often a tomato is described as so sweet 'whenever people see it they just want to hug it' - but this was no ordinary piece of fruit. The heart-shaped tomato was grown by retired dagger maker, Rod Matless, who said he was shocked when he noticed it in his greenhouse while inspecting his latest produce. Mr Matless, 69, who suffered a heart attack a few years ago, was so taken aback by the phenomenal fruit that he decided to sell it at auction and donate the proceeds to the British Heart Foundation. Look of love: Rod Matless lovingly holds up the heart-shaped tomato that sprouted in his greenhouse - the gardener sold the fruit for £16 and donated the cash to the British Heart Foundation . The 2.26oz tomato was bought for £16 on eBay by a woman from Wales - who said she planned to give it to someone special. Mr Matless, of Wymondham, near Norwich, said: 'It was a bit of an obvious thing to do I suppose. 'I spent a couple of days thinking about it and I wasn't really sure, but this seems like a good use. 'I hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of a good.' He added: 'It's very sweet - whenever people see it they just want to hug it.' But with the tomato's freshness a key factor, enthusiastic gardener Mr Matless was up against the clock to deliver it to its new owner before rot set in. He said: 'I didn't want to send someone something horrible. I probably could have raised a bit more money with more time but I was worried about it. Good cause: Mr Matless said that 'whenever people see it they just want to hug it...I hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of a good' 'It will certainly make a nice present for a loved one.I hope that they like it and I'm glad I got to help.' 'It's all been very good fun and I've really enjoyed growing this very special tomato.' The French once called tomatoes 'pomme d'amour', meaning love apple, but some say this is because they believed it was an aphrodisiac and had little to do with its shape.","Rod Matless, 69, was shocked when he found the fruit in his greenhouse .

"Plants use a newly discovered 'language' to 'speak' to each other, research has revealed. The finding opens the door to a new area of science that explores how plants communicate with each other on a molecular level. It could also give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world. Plants use a newly discovered 'language' to 'speak' to each other, research has revealed. They studied the molecular communication between a parasitic plant called dodder, and two host plants, Arabidopsis (pictured left) and tomatoes (pictured right) Professor Westwood, an expert in plant pathology, physiology and weed science at Virginia Tech, said: 'The discovery of this novel form of inter-organism communication shows that this is happening a lot more than any one has previously realised. 'Now that we have found that they are sharing all this information, the next question is, ""What exactly are they telling each other?""' Professor Westwood examined the relationship between a parasitic plant called dodder, and two host plants, Arabidopsis and tomatoes. In order to suck the moisture and nutrients out of the host plants, dodder uses a root-like appendage called a haustorium to penetrate the plant. Professor Westwood has previously discovered that during this parasitic interaction, there is a transport of RNA between the two species. The research could  give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world and in extreme cases lead to famine (illustrated with a stock image) Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a family of large biological molecules that code and decode information passed down from its DNA. His new work expands the scope of this exchange and examines the mRNA, or messenger RNA, which sends messages within cells telling them which actions to take, such as which proteins to code. Professor Westwood has previously discovered that during this parasitic interaction, there is a transport of RNA (illustrated) between two species. It was thought that mRNA was very fragile and short-lived, so transferring it between species was impossible. But Professor Westwood found that during this parasitic relationship, thousands upon thousands of mRNA molecules were being exchanged between both plants, creating an open dialogue between the species that allows them to freely communicate. Through this exchange, the parasitic plants may be instructing the host plant to lower its defences so that they can more easily attack it. Professor Westwood's  hopes to discover precisely what the mRNA are 'saying'. His findings, published in the journal, Science, will  be able to examine if other organisms such a bacteria and fungi also exchange information in a similar fashion. They could also help solve issues of food scarcity. Commenting on the research, in which she was not involved, Julie Scholes, a professor at Sheffield University, said: 'Parasitic plants such as witchweed and broomrape are serious problems for legumes and other crops that help feed some of the poorest regions in Africa and elsewhere. 'In addition to shedding new light on genetic interactions, Professor Westwood's findings have exciting implications for the design of novel control strategies. For example, armed with this new knowledge, scientists could engineer plants that could combat against the mRNA information that the parasite uses to disrupt its host.' Professor Westwood added: 'The beauty of this discovery is that this mRNA could be the Achilles heel for parasites. 'This is all really exciting because there are so many potential implications surrounding this new information.'","An expert at Virgina Tech found a form of inter-organism communication .

"Four Stone Age people found in caves in China could be a entirely new species of humanoid - and the discovery 'opens a new chapter' in the history of evolution, say archaeologists. The fossils, found in two caves, belong to a previously unknown Stone Age people and have a 'highly unusual' mixture of ancient and modern features. Named the 'Red Deer people' because of the animals they hunted and dating from between 14,500 to 11,500 years ago, they are the youngest humanoid fossils to be found in Asia. Previously it had been thought that early humans had little competition in the continent. Four mystery cavemen dug up in China could be a new species of humanoid, scientists say. The fossils, found in two caves, belong to a previously unknown Stone Age people . One of the skulls found in 'Red Deer Cave' in China - researchers say that the skulls have a mixture of ancient and modern features . The 'Red Deer' discovery has ‘startling implications for the early peopling of Asia’, said Professor Curnoe, of the University of New South Wales. They would have shared the land with modern looking humans at a time when China's earliest farming culture was beginning, he said. Writing in journal PLoS One, Prof Curnoe explained: ‘These new fossils might be of a previously unknown species, one that survived until the very end of the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago. He said: ‘The discovery of the red-deer . people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story - the . Asian chapter - and it's a story that's just beginning to be told.’ ‘Alternatively, they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of Africa, a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people.’ Three sets of remains were found at Maludong - Red Deer Cave' - in the Yunnan province in 1989. They were unstudied until 2008. Analysis of skulls in the 'Red Deer' cave in China hints that the people might be a new species of humanoid . Early humans in the BBC series Planet of the Apeman: The 'Red Deer' people could have come from an early - and undocumented - migration of humans from Africa . A fourth was found in 1979 a cave near the village on Lonling in neighbouring Guangxi Zhuang province. It was encased in rock until 2009. The skulls and teeth from both finds are very similar to each other and show an unusual mixture of archaic and modern anatomical features, as well as previously unseen characteristics. Scientists have named them 'red deer people' because evidence suggests that they hunted extinct red deer and cooked them in the Maludong cave. Until the discovery, no fossils younger than 100,000 years old had been found in mainland east Asia other than those of our own species, Homo sapiens. This suggested that Homo sapiens had the run of the area which was devoid of our evolutionary ancestors once the first humans appeared. But the new find suggests this may not have been the case. Professor Ji Xueping, of the Yunnan Institute of Cultural Relics and Archeology, said: ‘Because of the geographical diversity caused by the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, south-west China is well known as a biodiversity hotspot and for its great cultural diversity. ‘That diversity extends well back in time.’ In the last ten years scientists have discovered the enigmatic 'Hobbit' fossil in Asia as well as evidence modern humans interbred with ancient Denisovans, a species from Siberia. The latest find shows there is more to learn from the continent, said Prof Curnoe.","'Red deer people' lived 14,500-11,500 years ago in Asia .

"They came in their droves and queued outside Apple stores all over the world. From Tokyo to Sydney, London to New York, thousands waited for hours – sometimes days – to get their hands on the third incarnation of the iPad. Some who didn’t like the idea of sleeping on a cold pavement paid as much as £300 to jump the queue. Scroll down to see video of Apple fans . Among the ordinary shoppers wanting to get their hands on the latest must-have product were profiteering gangs. They infiltrated queues to buy iPads and re-sell them at inflated prices abroad . Customers in Apple's Regent Street store, all bagged up with their purchases. Dozens of people were paid by 'agents' to join queues around London and grab iPads to sell on. However, there is no suggestion that those pictured had any part in this . Black market gangs in London paid people to join the queue and buy the new tablets so they could then be sold on at a profit. The frenzy – reminiscent of the scenes which greeted the launch of its predecessor this time last year – is all the more surprising given that the latest iPad represents only an evolution of previous designs rather than a revolution. Its key selling point is a so-called ‘retina display’, with a high-definition touchscreen boasting 3.1million pixels – more than an HD television. The new model, which costs from £399 to £659 in the UK, also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor, making it attractive to those who use it to play games. The wait for the pay-day paid off: 16-year-old Noah Green was fourth in the queue - but sold his spot for £300 . Eager for a bite of the Apple: People sit in the queue for the new iPad 3 outside the company's flagship store on Regent Street in London . Noah Green, a 16-year-old student from Stanmore, North-West London, had been fourth in the queue at Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, London, but said someone had paid him £300 to move back. Before going through the door, he said: ‘It is worth it. I am still 18th in the queue so I will be one of the first to buy an iPad. I am going to sell it though and earn some money.’ Many appeared to have been paid £10 or £20 to wait in line for hours on behalf of a third party. Some buyers had their hands full of shopping bags filled with products. One was even pictured wheeling items out on a trolley.

Tech Crunch said: 'Once you see and use the new iPad, there will be no going back.' One said: ‘We’re just buying and selling, we’re not doing anything illegal. We bought them and we sold them.’ At Covent Garden, men were seen handing over money, collecting receipts and organising scores of people queuing. One agent, who gave his name as Martin, said: ‘I hope to get around 70 iPads today. I will be sending them on to India.’ The new iPad will not be on sale officially in India for at least another week. Stores were given only a limited supply of the new device and many had sold out by mid-afternoon. This allowed buyers who did manage to get one the opportunity to make a quick profit by selling them via eBay. Sellers on the auction website were offering the 16GB version, which connects to the web via wifi, for as much as £562.79 – a mark-up of £163.79, or 41 per cent, on the official price of £399. The scenes were repeated around the world. In Paris, one customer, Athena May, said: ‘I don’t think it’s worth the price but I guess I’m a victim of society.’ Shares in Apple punched through the $600 barrier – a new record – briefly on Thursday pushing the value of the technology giant to $560billion (£354billion) and confirming it as the world’s most valuable company.

"The BBC has announced the launch of a 'pay-to-keep' download service which will give viewers access to older and previously unavailable shows. 'Project Barcelona' will connect the BBC archives to the Internet, allowing viewers to pay a 'relatively modest' fee to download older classics. The rumoured price for a TV show is about £2, which could then be kept forever on a computer hard drive. Catch-up TV: The success of iPlayer has inspired the BBC to open up the archives so that long-hidden classics can be seen again . The project means shows which have never seen the light of the day . since their first run may finally be available to a nostalgic audience. Many older shows, for instance from the 1980s and 1990s, retain a . loyal following, but without enough demand to warrant a DVD release, . there is currently no way of making them available to the public. BBC director general Mark Thompson announced the proposals at the Royal Television Show in London, and asked UK producers to give their support. He said: 'a large proportion of what the BBC makes and broadcasts is never seen or heard of again. 'The idea behind Barcelona is simple. It is that, for as much of our content as possible, in addition to the existing iPlayer window, another download-to-own window would open soon after transmission - so that if you wanted to purchase a digital copy of a programme to own and keep, you could pay what would generally be a relatively modest charge for doing so'. Thompson called the scheme the 'digital . equivalent' of buying a DVD, and suggested other streaming or Web TV . services might be able to buy or licence the content. He said: 'It's the exact analogy of going into a high street shop to buy a DVD or, before that, a VHS cassette. In the 1960s and 1970s, most shows . were broadcast once and never seen again. Indeed tapes were often wiped . or re-used, meaning a lot of material, like early Doctor Who episodes, . are lost forever or only exist in audio format. If . shows were 'repeated', it would normally be by getting the actors to . reprise their characters, as casting agencies were anxious that repeats . would reduce the demand for actors. But . as time went on, the cultural value of TV began to be recognised and . the BBC began storing broadcasts for posterity. 'For decades the British public has understood the distinction between watching Dad's Army on BBC1 and then going out to buy a permanent copy of it. Barcelona is the digital equivalent of doing the second.' In order to tempt content providers over to Barcelona, the BBC will give them a little more cash - 40p per episode, compared to, for instance, the 28p offered by iTunes. While Thompson said the project would provide additional funding for independent productions, he denied accusations it was a 'second licence fee by stealth'. Internet streaming has taken off in a big way in the last few years, spearheaded by services such as iPlayer. Most operators, such as Sky, Channel . 4, and ITV also offer limited streaming services for free, although it . is likely that many services will try to profit from their operations . over time. Meanwhile big players in the market . such as Lovefilm, Netflix and Apple's iTunes are pushing TV and movie . streaming globally, and most services are available across a wide range . of distribution channels, such as on the web, on video consoles like the . Xbox 360, and through set-top boxes. Daleks from 1963: Many early episodes of Doctor Who are unavailable to the wider public, but iPlayer-style digitisation may once again offer older shows to a modern audience . The BBC officially launched iPlayer in 2007, and quickly became a hit. While iPlayer drew some criticism from some commercial content providers for offering the service for free, it has drawn a great reaction from viewers who can catch up with shows for up to a week after broadcast. It has also helped provide niche shows with an expanded audience, and helps the BBC assess get a better picture of ratings of shows. Two of the BBC's biggest shows from the last few years, Doctor Who and Sherlock, both spearheaded by writer Steven Moffat, regularly pick up millions of extra viewers via iPlayer. Criticisms of the service generally relate to the unavailability of the service overseas due to licencing issues.","Unavailable classics will be available for a rumoured £1.89 an episode .

"A green-fingered pensioner's attempt to grow shrubs and flowers in his front garden has spectacularly back-fired - after the foliage grew so fast it engulfed his entire house. Colin Melbourne's £240,000 semi-detached property in posh Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has become consumed by rampant ivy and conifers, leaving it invisible to passers-by. His front garden is so overrun with plants the windows, front door and even the garage are hidden beneath the sprawling greenery. Scroll down for video . The £240,000 home in posh Leamington Spa has become almost invisible to passers-by due to sprawling ivy . Neighbours would help pensioner tame his unruly garden if asked but think owner is 'probably too proud to ask' Residents who live near Mr Melbourne, 78, are now urging the council to help him bring his wayward garden back under control. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'Mr Melbourne lives in the house and has done for many years. 'He is often seen planting flowers and shrubs but the weather this year has sent them skyward. 'He is a character and usually puts his plants in bags before transferring them into his garden. One resident said that the good weather this year has sent the green-fingered pensioner's foliage up to the sky . 'The front garden has also been a bit unruly but this summer the good weather has sent the ivy and conifers shooting up. 'The house is so hidden you can't even see the front door. 'I feel sorry for the people living directly next door because their home is very nicely kept and has recently been repainted. Another local said it was unfair for neighours who take care of their home but live next to the unsightly foliage . 'I hate to say it but the house has become a bit of an eyesore and the council really should take some action if for no other reason than to help Mr Melbourne control his plants. 'It must be really depressing living like that, it must be very gloomy inside.' Another neighbour added: 'Mr Melbourne is no trouble to us or anyone on the street. 'His efforts to improve his garden have clearly got away from him and we'd all happily help him if he wanted us to but I daresay he's too proud to ask.' Mr Melbourne took up gardening after retiring from his job as a market trader. Neighbour and friend Trudy Dickson, 50, who has known him for 20 years, said: 'Colin is a lovely man and a real character. 'He used to run a market stall in Coventry selling women's handbags. His front room was always full of stock and he used to put flowers in the bags which he couldn't sell. 'No one minds that his garden is overgrown, it is a bit of a local landmark and probably wouldn't be the same if he cut it all down. 'He is a character but very generous. When we held a street party for the Queen's Jubilee he gave a very generous donation and came out and chatted to everybody. He was charming. 'He has always shown an enthusiasm for gardening but it does look like his plants have got away from him a bit.' Mr Melbourne yesterday refused to comment. In February last year homeowner Kenneth Mould, 50, was fined £1,000 after he failed to tidy up the front of his home in Rugeley, Staffordshire, which was completely obscured by ivy.","Front of house in leafy area is consumed by rampant ivy and conifers .

"Despite the numerous health benefits of condoms, they're often criticised for reducing the level of pleasure felt by men, and women, during sex. With this in mind, a pair of PHD students has created a digital prototype device that sends short electric impulses along the underside of a condom. This can increase the amount, and range of sensations, felt during sex - and opens up the technology to be used with other wearable devices and sensors. Scroll down for video . Dubbed Electric Eel, the digital condom prototype, pictured here around a courgette, was created by Firaz Peer and Andrew Quitmeyer from Georgia Tech's Digital Media Program. The prototype was made using a soft 'stimulating sleeve' fitted with electrodes . A porn studio in Los Angeles has started using software to digitally remove condoms from scenes in post-production. State law insists scenes are filmed using condoms. However, this is said to be damaging business; causing permits and viewing numbers to drop dramatically. Falcon Studios used CGI and airbrushing in their latest production in a bid to appease the law and viewers. Dubbed Electric Eel, the prototype was created by Firaz Peer and Andrew Quitmeyer from Georgia Tech’s Digital Media Program. Using their design, Peer and Quitmeyer said they envisage conductive leads being directly embedded into existing condoms by manufacturers, while 'maintaining the soundness and protection that the condoms already provide.' To test the range of sensations, Peer and Quitmeyer made a soft, 'stimulating sleeve' fitted with conductive arrays of electrodes along the underneath part of the shaft. The device is powered by a programmable . Lilypad microcontroller, which can receive various inputs and commands, . and send electrical impulses to small electrodes lining the inside of . the sleeve. 'This type of device could be hooked up to numerous controllers, directed in person or using existing internet software,' said the designers. The device is powered by a Lilypad microcontroller, pictured, which can take in various inputs and commands, and send electrical impulses to small electrodes lining the inside of the sleeve. The amount of electricity applied is 'very small' although the designers did not specify the exact charge . One example Peer and Quitmeyer tested was connecting the device to a homemade breath sensor. Users could control the pulses by changing the frequency of breaths and during tests, the device was described as ‘pleasurable, comfortable and exciting.’ In terms of safety, the amount of electricity applied is very small – although the designers did not specify the exact charge - and the designs have all been tested by the makers, personally. Peer and Quitmeyer have set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund the project and are hoping to raise $10,000 (£6,000) by March 31.","The Electric Eel prototype was created by PHD students from Georgia .

"An inventor has created a terrifying means of using a slingshot to apply a condom -  and says it is all in the name of beating sexually transmitted infections.

Scroll down for video . Joerg Sprave, of The Slingshot Channel, designed the Condom Applicator Slingshot Gun in a light-hearted attempt to win a $100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . He created the gadget in response to the foundation's offer of grants for people who could cut sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies by creating the next generation of condoms . On behalf of the Grand Challenges in Health programme, Bill and Melinda Gates are offering $100,000 worth of start-up money for an idea which could spawn the next generation of condom technology. Condoms are seen as vital for preventing unwanted pregnancies and STIs but are often shunned on the basis that they are thought to reduce sexual pleasure. Therefore, the Gates Foundation is looking for an idea which leads to the creation of condoms that increase pleasure in the hope this will encourage people to use them. Mr Sprave’s contraption allows the unlucky subject to attach a condom to the barrel of the slingshot gun. They can then prepare the gun for firing before pulling the trigger at close range and releasing the condom at high speed. Mr Sprave has posted a video of the eye-watering device on YouTube and in the two days since it appeared it has been viewed nearly two million times. In the video the inventor says: ‘The Slingshot Channel cannot stand back when someone poses a great challenge. ‘Of course there are problems - like the lack of accuracy, and the fear. 'There is pain. 'But of course, it needs some improvement. 'That is why I need the money.’ He adds: ‘Nothing fascinates male human beings more than guns and sex so when we combine both you must see the huge potential this has. ‘So, come on, pass over the hundred grand and then we will make a product out of this.’ Mr Sprave's contraption allows the unlucky subject to attach a condom to the barrel of the slingshot gun .

It is hoped that the inventor will manage to design a condom that does not reduce sexual pleasure meaning that people are not tempted to go without them.

"A female condom which can protect against pregnancy and sexual diseases by dissolving inside the body has been developed. Experts claim the 'discreet protection' can safeguard people from HIV and unwanted pregnancy by 'melting' and releasing chemicals. Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) developed the condom from tiny microfibres through a method called 'electrospinning'. Scroll down for video . Female condoms have been distributed on World Aids day in Siliguri, India. The new design could help protect against HIV . The cloth-like fibres can be woven from medicine into extremely thin 'webs' They are then designed to dissolve after use, either within minutes or over several days. Not only would the condom block sperm, it could time-release a potent mix of anti-HIV drugs and hormonal contraceptives. The team was given $1m to develop the technology, which uses an electric field to charge fluid through air to create the very fine, nanometer-sized fibres. The team say it could replace existing contraception such as the pill . Kim Woodrow, a UW assistant professor of bioengineering, said: 'Our dream is to create a product women can use to protect themselves from HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. 'We have the drugs to do that. It’s really about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent, and allows a woman to want to use it.' Prof Woodrow presented the idea, and co-authors Emily Krogstad and Cameron Ball, both first-year graduate students, agreed to pursue the project, at a meeting held last year. Ball added: 'This method allows controlled release of multiple compounds. 'We were able to tune the fibers to have different release properties.' One of the fabrics dissolves within minutes, offering users immediate protection, while another fabric dissolves gradually over a few days, providing an alternative to the birth-control pill, to provide contraception and protect against HIV. While the researchers agree the technology is more discrete, they admit it people mayhave some doubts. 'At the time of sex, are people going to actually use it? That’s where having multiple options really comes into play,'  Krogstad told the University of Washington.","Female condom could safeguard from HIV and unwanted pregnancy by 'melting' and releasing chemicals .

"Warning: More than 150,000 adults aged under 25 were diagnosed with chlamydia in 2010 alone . Chlamydia - the world's most common sexual infection - is a more cunning and highly evolved bacterium than thought, scientists say. Researchers analysed the entire genome of Chlamydia trachomatis and discovered that exchanges of DNA between different strains of the disease to form new versions are more common than believed. But current screening methods do not differentiate between the different strains, reports Nature Genetics, meaning the bacteria have the potential to become anti-biotic resistant without anyone realising. Across the world there are around 100 million new cases of chlamydia each year, making it the most commons STI in both the UK and globally. Researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute found that if two strains of the disease infect the same host they are able to exchange DNA and create an entirely new strain. This can happen even when the strains are in different parts of the body, they say. Dr Simon Harris explained: 'Scientists recently discovered that if two Chlamydia strains co-infect the same person at the same time, they can swap DNA by a process called recombination. 'This was originally thought only to affect a few 'hotspots' within the genome. We were very surprised to find recombination is far more widespread than previously thought.' Prof Ian Clarke of the University of Southampton added: 'Despite this being the most important sexually transmitted infection in the world, until now it's clear that there are major gaps in our knowledge of the strains that are currently circulating, their evolution and natural history.' Because current tests do not distinguish different strains, if a patient tests positive again after anti-biotic treatment it is not known whether the drugs have failed or they have picked up a second infection. This photo micrograph reveals what chlamydia looks like up close . This means that if anti-biotic resistance did occur in the general population, it would not be detected by current diagnostic procedures.No strains of resistant bacteria have been seen in patients, although they have been created in the laboratory, said Dr Nicholas Thomson, of Wellcome. He said: 'Until now a person treated with antibiotics with a reoccurring infection of C. trachomatis was assumed to have been re-infected. 'The current gaps in our understanding of the population makeup of Chlamydia limit our ability to implement health policies, because we do not fully understand how Chlamydia spreads within our population.' The findings are also important for the treatment of African Chlamydia, a form of the bacteria that can cause eye infection trachoma or blindness. These strains also use recombination to avoid the immune system, said Dr Martin Holland, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said: 'For many years various groups have observed co-circulating strains of Chlamydia causing trachoma. In our study we have shown that some strains appear to have swapped only their surface coat. 'This provides real clues as to how this bacterium is able to avoid the human immune system and cause disease.' More than 150,000 adults aged under 25 tested positive for chlamydia in England in 2010. However, most people don't noticed any symptoms and so don't know they have it. The STD is treated with anti-biotics. However, the NHS warns it can cause problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility if left untreated. Anyone under 25 in the UK can get a free and confidential chlamydia test.

"More than 102,000 flights are made every day across the world. To put this  into perspective, a web developer has created a beautiful visualisation that simulates each of these flights on a globe. The Flight Stream visualisation doesn't show real-time positions of these flights, but rather routes between major airports - and the result resembles swarms of fireflies. Click the interactive tool below . Flight Stream was created by San Francisco-based web developer Callum Prentice. He used data from the Open Flights database to plot the number and location of flights and airports around the world. The animation has been designed for desktop browsers, but Mr Prentice has also created a video for people on mobiles . Flight Stream was created by San Francisco-based web developer Callum Prentice. He used data from the Open Flights database to plot the number and location of flights and airports around the world, which includes 59,036 routes between 3,209 airports on 531 airlines as of January 2012. The site was created as an 'experiment to map many of the airline flights between world airports,' explained Mr Prentice. Tools on the site let visitors control the opacity of the individual flight tracks, change the size of the airports as well as adjust the speed of the animation. Last year, NATS (formerly known as National Air Traffic Services), produced the third in its series of air traffic visualisations, taking a tour of the UK’s airspace, called UK 24. During the visualisation, around 7,000 flights are shown entering and leaving UK airspace. The day starts with the bow wave of transatlantic traffic heading towards the UK on organised and separated tracks. This is joined by traffic from Europe and the first waves of departures from UK airports. Traffic levels are then seen growing to reveal the main ‘trunk roads’, or routes, of airspace as well as the hubs around London, Manchester and central Scotland. There are also visualisations of military training flights, showing RAF jets performing manoeuvres training off the east coast of England and near to North Wales. It then reveals a ‘spider’s web of helicopter tracks’ originating in Aberdeen, taking people and supplies to  North Sea oil and gas rigs. The animation has been designed for desktop browsers, but Mr Prentice has also created a video for people on mobiles to be able to view the animation. Mr Prentice told MailOnline the visualisation was just a hobby, and admitted that there is so much data around major airports, 'it just blurs into a mess', but the visualisation was fun to do and 'looks pretty.' The British-born developer currently works for 3D Virtual World Second Life in California and has released the code for his Flight Stream design, as well as his other interactive projects, on his website.

The visualisation then shows holding stacks over London, also known as a holding manoeuvre that is used to delay a flight from landing, but keep it within the airspace. This is particularly key around Heathrow, continued Mr Kelly, which provides ‘the constant flow of traffic that makes it the world’s busiest dual runway airport with 1,350 movements a day.’ At Heathrow alone, goods worth £133 billion were shipped in and out last year, more than the combined value of goods transiting through the UK’s two largest ports, Felixstowe and Southampton. The tour then moves around the UK to include the other major airports, NATS’ two control centres in Swanwick and Prestwick, and general aviation traffic. There are also visualisations of military training flights, showing RAF jets performing training manoeuvres off the east coast of England and near to north Wales.

To create the video, visualisation experts from a company called 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights.

"The launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are just days away, and a lot of the talk about the new devices are their larger, ion-strengthened glass screens. Now the American Chemical Society has created a video that explains why this type of screen is typically stronger than other displays - and it involves using a hot bath of potassium. The video also reveals many of the other elements found in smartphones, including gold, silver, tin, and even arsenic. Scroll down for video . The American Chemical Society has explained how the ion-strengthened glass on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (pictured left to right) is stronger than regular glass, because it is placed into a hot potassium bath. The chemist has also revealed other elements found in phones such as silver, gold, tin, aluminium and silicon . In the build up to Apple’s iPhone 6 event, nearly every report claimed the devices would have a sapphire screen. Instead, Apple unveiled 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets that both feature ion-strengthened glass, during last week's launch. To make ion-strengthened glass, glass is placed into a hot bath of potassium salt, typically potassium nitrate, at around 300°C (572°F). This causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate, which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution. The larger potassium ions in the bath squeeze themselves into the holes created by the moving sodium. This compresses the glass, to accommodate the larger ions, which in turn makes it stronger. By comparison, sapphire screens are made from synthetic sapphire - a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. According to the American Chemical Society’s video, created with help from experts at the Compound Interest blog, ion-strengthened glass is created using a potassium bath. One method is to dip the glass into a hot bath of potassium salt, typically potassium nitrate, at around 300°C (572°F). This causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate, which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution. The larger potassium ions in the bath squeeze themselves into the holes created by the moving sodium. This compresses the glass, to accommodate the larger ions, which in turn makes it stronger. When broken, chemically strengthened glass still shatters, similar to traditional glass, but it is said to be between six and eight times stronger. An alternative method for strengthening glass, is submerging the glass into a sodium nitrate bath first. This enriches the surface with more sodium ions, and when the ions in the glass are immersed in potassium nitrate, there are more sodium ions to be replaced, which increases the compression and strength. By comparison, sapphire screens are made from synthetic sapphire - a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. To make ion-strengthened glass, glass is placed into a hot bath of potassium salt, typically potassium nitrate, which is around 300°C (572°F). This heat causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate, which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution (illustrated) By comparison, the Apple Watch (pictured) features a sapphire crystal screen . As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. Elsewhere, the screen on typical smartphones are also made up of extremely rare elements called praseodymium, gadolinium and terbium. And to achieve the charge needed to power the touchscreen, a compound of indium, tin and oxygen is used in a transparent film that conducts electricity. The video also explains that a typical smartphone contains about 300 milligrams of silver and 30 milligrams of gold, housed in an aluminium case. Copper is used in the wiring and circuitry, and the silicon chips that power the devices also feature oxygen, antimony, phosphorous, gallium and arsenic.. ‘So there you have it. Those are the elements that make up the phone, you can’t put down,' concluded the American Chemical Society.

"Paul Gauguin is famous for his use of bold lines and colourful imagery to depict Tahitian life. Little is known, however, about the techniques and materials the French artist used to create his unusual and complex graphic works. Now a team of US scientists and artists have used a light bulb, an SLR camera and a laptop to uncover new remarkable new details of Gauguin's printmaking process. Scroll down for video . The technique was originally revealed by peeling back layers of the 3D surface of the print 'Nativity (Mother and Child Surrounded by Five Figures),' made by Gauguin in 1902 . The scientists used multiple wavelengths of light shining from different directions onto Gauguin's prints. The technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape, providing a much clearer view of the paper's topography. For the study of an artwork, the piece was fixed in place, as was an SLR camera. A light bulb was moved to 20 different locations and a photo taken of the artwork for each light bulb position. The digital data for each pixel of each image then was run through Cossairt's software. Essentially, the researchers were measuring only the response of an artwork's surface to changing lighting. For each image, they knew the angle of the lighting and the brightness of each pixel and from that they could can calculate the unknown - the surface structure. Researchers at Northwestern University say Gauguin formed, layered and re-used imagery to make 19 unique graphic works. The technique was originally revealed by peeling back layers of the 3D surface of the print 'Nativity (Mother and Child Surrounded by Five Figures),' made by Gauguin in 1902. Gauguin created the print using a layering of images created on paper by drawings, transfer of images and two different inks. The 'Nativity' findings overturn an earlier theory as to how Gauguin might have produced the print. Oliver Cossairt, who led the research, was 'blown away' by the scientific results, so the his team reproduced what they believed to be Gauguin's process. The printmaking process produced a piece of art very similar to Gauguin's original. 'To measure the 3-D surface of the prints, we used some very accessible techniques that can be used by art conservators and historians around the world to analyse artworks,' said Cossairt, who developed the software to analyse the imaging data. 'In applying these techniques to Gauguin's work, we came up with some interesting answers to questions about what his printing process was.' As well as 'Nativity', the team studied 18 other Gauguin monoprints in the Art Institute's collection. They used multiple wavelengths of light shining from different directions onto the prints to investigate the surface of the paper and re-evaluate how Gauguin created his works. The technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape, providing a much clearer view of the paper's topography.

'For each image, we know the angle of the lighting and the brightness of each pixel and from that we can calculate the unknown - the surface structure.' The surface structure of 'Nativity' revealed white lines, in which there is an absence of ink. This indicates those lines were created using a transfer process, where Gauguin drew on an inked surface, removing ink, and those empty lines were transferred to his print. Using a simple light bulb, an SLR camera, and computer software, researchers have uncovered new details of French artist Paul Gauguin’s printmaking method . The ink of the black lines sits atop ridges in the paper. Gauguin would have placed his paper on an inked surface and then drawn on the back of the paper, causing ink to be transferred to the paper where pressure from the artist's pencil was applied. 'Gauguin died more than a century ago, but there is still something to say, something new to find out, in large part due to this teamwork,' said Harriet Stratis, senior research conservator at the Art Institute and the museum's lead collaborator on the Gauguin project. 'Gauguin probably was doing these kinds of prints for five years, so this research puts a whole body of work together,' she said. 'The evidence points to a completely different artistic approach by Gauguin.' Casadio says that information such as this can be included in augmented reality apps to help art lovers learn more about prints just by pointing your phone at them.

"It may sound like a sci-fi weapon, but two scientists have created a real 'death ray'. The ‘weapon’ is built from the sort of materials found in people’s garages and harnesses the sun’s rays to melt zinc and aluminium. The main component of the 'death ray' is a Fresnel lens - which is ridged on one side to focus light into a small area - and used to be fitted in TV sets. Scroll down for video . The ‘death ray' (pictured) is built from the sort of materials found in people’s garages and harnesses the sun’s rays to melt zinc and aluminium using a Fresnel lens . The DIY death ray was made by Kevin Moore and Grant Reynolds of the Science Channel. They were inspired to harness light to burn metal after thinking about children using small magnifying glasses to melt plastic figures, for example. They built a basic frame from wood and positioned the lens - which can capture a greater degree of light thanks to its ridged surface - to focus the sun’s ray to a small point. The device can pivot up and down and from side to side, so it can be pointed towards the sun. ‘That way we can focus the maximum amount of photons into a small spot,’ the designers said in a video. The device has been used to liquefy a pile of zinc disks (pictured), meaning that the beam was hotter than 450°C (842°F).  It was made by Kevin Moore and Grant Reynolds of the Science Channel . They then placed an aluminium packet of popcorn beneath the lens. The beam quickly burned a hole though the packaging to reveal the popcorn inside (pictured), which began to pop . A Fresnel lens is flat on one side and ridged on the other, usually in concentric circles. Each ring is slightly thinner than the next so it focuses the light towards the centre, concentrating it. Each ridge bends the light slightly more than the one beneath it, so the light rays all emerge in a beam. They were first used in the 1800s as the lens that focuses the beam in lighthouse lamps. Plastic versions are used as magnifiers and are often made of thin plastic and huge glass versions are used as solar concentrators. Their aim was to create a ray of light that is 850°C (1,500°F). Moore and Reynolds noted the beam was ‘insanely hot’ by accidently burning themselves. They then managed to liquefy a pile of zinc disks, meaning that the beam was hotter than 450°C (842°F). Next, they placed an aluminium packet of popcorn beneath the lens. The beam quickly burned a hole though the packaging to reveal the popcorn inside, which began to pop. This means that the focal point was hotter than 660°C (1,220°F) - the melting point of aluminium. However, when the duo put a square of silicon bronze under the ray, which is used to make nuts and bolts, it smoked but didn’t melt, meaning the beam was not as hot as intended.

"Applying 'night-time sunscreen' after a day in the sun may help reduce the risk of developing skin cancer, according to scientists. Researchers have found that much of the damage caused by ultraviolet light from a day on the beach occurs hours after the sun has set. They discovered that energy absorbed from the sun by skin cells called melanocytes is transferred to the DNA in the dark, causing it to deform. Scroll down for video . Sunburn (stock image) causes DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer, and new research from Yale University has found this damage can continue for several hours after the sun goes down . The scientists believe that a new type of 'evening after' sunscreen containing vitamin E could be developed to block this transfer of energy. Professor Douglas Brash, a dermatologist at Yale University, said: 'So our understanding has been that you put on sunscreen before you go out into the sun and that protects your skin. In tests using mouse and human melanocytes, experts found UV radiation from sunlight causes enzymes in the cells to create two chemicals that react together. These then excite electrons on the melanin with energy. This means the melanin effectively absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight. However, in the dark the melanin transfers this energy to the DNA to cause the same damage that can occur in sunlight. In melanocytes without melanin, the damage to the DNA only occurred during sun exposure and not afterwards. 'Here you have a different situation where what you want to do is add something after you leave the beach or tanning bed that protects you for several hours after. 'You could imagine designing chemicals that dissipate that energy before it has a chance to get to the DNA. 'There are chemicals like that that already exist and we used some of those as tools in the research, but you could imagine getting better ones that are practical to use in the skin.' Ultraviolet light is thought to damage DNA by causing a ring-shaped structure to from in the DNA, known as a cyclobutane dimer. This prevents the genetic code from being read properly and leads to faults in the functioning of the cells, leading to them becoming cancerous. Melantocytes produce a pigment called melanin that was thought to help protect the skin from ultraviolet light. People with blonde or red hair, and fair skin tend to have less melanin in their skin and are more vulnerable to skin cancer caused by sunburn. The Yale study found that DNA damage (labelled as CPDs in the graph above) in melanocyte skin cells continued for up to four hours after exposure to ultraviolet light had stopped, increasing the risk of cancer . In tests using mouse and human melanocytes, experts found UV radiation from sunlight causes enzymes in the cells to create two chemicals that react together. These then excite electrons on the melanin with energy. This means the melanin effectively absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight (stock image) Scientists recently unlocked one of the secrets of how coral shields itself from harmful ultraviolet rays - and they hope it could create ‘sunscreen in a pill’. A single pill could provide weeks of protection for the skin and eyes, cutting the odds of cancer, removing the need for creams and sunglasses, and keeping wrinkles at bay. However it would do nothing to bronze the skin, meaning sun-worshippers would have to resort to fake tan if they want a ‘healthy glow’. The scientists at Kings College London took their inspiration from samples of coral collected from Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. It was known that the marine organism can shield itself from the sun’s rays and it was thought that the protection came from a compound made by algae that live within it. The researchers found the algae makes a compound that is transported to the coral, which then modifies it into a sunscreen that protects it from UV damage. However, Professor Brash and his team, whose results are published in the journal Science, found that it is melanin that is also responsible for this overnight damage. In tests using mouse and human melanocytes, he found UV radiation from sunlight causes enzymes in the cells to create two chemicals that react together. These then excite electrons on the melanin with energy. This means the melanin effectively absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight. However, in the dark the melanin transfers this energy to the DNA to cause the same damage that can occur in sunlight. In melanocytes without melanin, the damage to the DNA only occurred during sun exposure and not afterwards. Professor Brash said: 'When sun hits your skin normally what happens is that it makes damage to your DNA in a millionth of a millionth of a second. 'In melanocytes, which are the cells that make the pigment that is protecting your skin, that is not all that is going on. 'You are getting the same kinds of DNA damage in your skin for hours after the exposure has ended. 'What is suprising is that melanin is actually doing things that can cause cancer as well. However, in the dark the melanin transfers this energy to the DNA to cause the same damage that can occur in sunlight. Sunlight damages the upper layers of skin (keratosis pictured) but also damage the DNA . The diagram above shows the effects of ultraviolet radiation (yellow arrows) on the upper layers of the skin. In addition to a 'night-time sunscreen', Professor John-Stephen Taylor at the Washington University in St Louis, who studies DNA damage caused by the sun, said that improved daytime suncreens could also help . 'Because this is slow and takes several hours it gives us the opportunity to jump in and intervene.' Professor John-Stephen Taylor, a chemist at the Washington University in St Louis who studies DNA damage caused by the sun, said that improved daytime suncreens could also help. He said: 'Researchers have long sought methods to prevent skin cancer induction, and the results of this study indicate that sunscreens should aim to minimise exposure to both UVB and UVA. As suggested by the authors, UV DNA damage arising in the dark might also be reduced by agents that scavenge or interfere with superoxide and nitric oxide production or that quench the excited triplet-state intermediates.'","Dermatologists  at Yale University want to develop a 'night-time' sunscreen .

"Smartwatches  typically need to be paired with a phone and in many cases the wearables only work with specific devices. But one firm has come up with an alternative device that looks like a bangle, has a 4G connection and can be used to make calls. Called Neptune Duo, the gadget will comprise two parts - a ‘Hub’ that is worn on the wrist and a 5-inch touch display that is kept in a pocket for when a user wants to see information on a larger screen. Scroll down for video . The Neptune Duo, which is said to be 'the world's smartest wearable' comprises two parts - a ‘Hub’ that is worn on the wrist and a 5-inch touch display that's kept in a pocket or bag. This screen will be used when a user wants to see information on a larger screen, for example (both illustrated) The idea is, that the ‘phone’ component is kept on a user’s wrist where it is less likely to be lost, than in their pocket. The concept Hub bracelet is shown with a curved 2.4-inch touchscreen and can be used in the same way as a phone because it supports 3G and 4G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and NFC. Its designers imagine it running on a quad-core processor, with 64GB of storage and a 1,000mAH battery inside. It’s described by Montreal-based firm Neptune as ‘the world’s smartest wearable’ and owners will be able to make calls, send messages, check Facebook plus other social networks, and track fitness statistics on their wrist, when it is launched later this year. The Hub will run on Android Lollipop, so users will be able to use an array of apps made for wearables. And if they want to watch a film, look at a map or anything else that requires a larger screen, they can use the ‘Pocket screen’. The Hub bracelet has a curved 2.4-inch touchscreen and will allow people to make calls, send messages, check Facebook and track fitness statistics on their wrist . Display: 2.4 inch capacitive touchscreen . Connectivity: Wi-Fi, 3G, GPS, LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC . Processor: Quad-core processor . Storage: 64GB . Operating system: Android 5.0 Lollipop . Battery: 1,000mAH . Extras: speaker, microphone, vibration motor, sensors, accelerometer, gyroscope and digital compass . The display connects to the Hub wirelessly and has been designed with a 720p 5-inch screen, plus an 8MP camera on the rear, and a 2MP front-facing camera. According to the firm’s website: 'Much like a mouse, a keyboard, or a computer monitor, the Pocket screen is simply an interface for your Hub. It's not very smart, it doesn’t need to be'. The company said the screen should only need charging once every few days if it is not used heavily. The Hub is designed to be used without the extra screen, leading the company to claim that people will never have to worry about forgetting their phone again. The screens are also interchangeable, so a user could borrow a friend’s if they have left theirs at home, for example. ‘With all your apps and files stored on your Hub, a lost or stolen Pocket screen doesn’t mean lost data anymore,’ the website said. The Pocket screen (illustrated) connects to the Hub wirelessly and has a 720p 5-inch display plus an 8MP camera on the rear, and a 2MP front-facing camera for selfies . Display: 5-inch touchscreen . Resolution: 1280x720 HD . Camera: 8MP rear-facing with LED rear flash and 2MP front-facing . Battery: 2,800mAh . Extras: In-ear speaker, loudspeaker, microphone, vibration motor, sensors, accelerometer and gyroscope . The screen will also double as a battery pack for the Hub, which itself will need charging every few days with normal use. This suggest it has a better battery life than Apple’s forthcoming Apple Watch, which is rumoured to need recharging every day. The Neptune Duo is due to ship later this year and can be pre-ordered for between $498 (£323) and $698 (£452), depending on how much people want to pledge before launch. It’s expected to retail for $800 (£518). With this price tag, the device will be going head-to head with the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S, which  will both be able to make calls with the help of an accompanying smartphone. Neptune’s founder Simon Tian, said: 'My goal is to create a new brand that can stand on its own. If I can even grab 0.5 per cent of the market, we'll be a huge business.’ Despite being 21 years old, it’s his second attempt at a smartwatch, The Globe and Mail reported. He dreamt up his first, called Pine, when he was still at school and has sold around 8,000 so far. The Hub (illustrated) will be able to be used as a phone because it supports 3G and 4G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and NFC, as well as running on a quad-core processor, with 64GB of storage and a 1,000mAH battery inside .","Neptune Duo comprises a 'Hub' band a five inch 'Pocket screen'

"Dr Spock’s tricorder could soon be ‘fact, not science fiction’, allowing people all over the world diagnose their own illnesses. This is according to a group of engineers who have set up a £6 million ($10 million) competition to develop a real-life version of the Star Trek gadget. The Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, launched last year, hopes to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, including anaemia, tuberculosis and diabetes. Scroll down for videos . Dr Spock's tricorder could soon be 'fact, not science fiction', allowing people all over the world diagnose their own illnesses. Pictured is AMI Vitals Fit device, one of the ten finalists . Now ten finalists have been chosen from a diverse range of backgrounds including a team backed by Nasa and the Bill Gates Foundation, and others who come from university departments. According to the rules, finalists must demonstrate their devices on humans next year and three winners will be announced in 2016, with a top prize of £4.3 million ($7 million). To win the cash prize, the device has to monitor vital signs as well as diagnose 16 different conditions. One of the finalists, the Silicon Valley-based group Scanadu, revealed a handheld scanner at the CES conference earlier year. Team Aezon are the youngest team competing for the Qualcomm Tricorder XPrize. Aezon's solution is a monitoring device designed to gather five different vital signs at once, to be worn around the neck .

Built-in sensors then establish body temperature and heart rate . A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) tricorder and a medical tricorder. Medical tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission. The scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. The technology was developed by Scandu's chief executive Walter De Brouwer, 56, at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California. It contains a variety of different sensors, alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget, that can read five vital signs. These include body temperature, heart rate, oximetry (blood oxygen levels), heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT) - the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person’s body. PWTT is related to blood pressure. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Davantri tricorder is shown on the left while the ScaNurse is on the right.

The tricorder uses a micro-USB adapter that can be hooked into a USB port, and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery. A tricorder prop from Insurrection, a Star Trek film. Now researchers are creating real-life versions . When it is being used a few times every day, the battery lasts for about a week, the firm says. Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera. They hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, say – in the same way a doctor would – and then feed it into a computer for analysis. Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests. DMI, for instance, has teamed teamed up with Nasa to create a device that astronauts could use to monitor their health on long trips and in zero gravity. Doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately. For instance, light sensors can now track blow flow and oxygen levels within the human body. Other sensors can be used to detect gases in breath that may indicate certain diseases. A real-life tricorder may not be as far away as people think. The challenge, now, will be to bring all of these elements together into one device.

"With bold colours and long trails, these photographs look more like a painting of the night's sky by Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. But in fact photographer Vincent Brady managed to capture these dazzling images using a custom rig of four cameras - each with a fish eye lens attached to give a 360 degree view. He managed to achieve a series of images that show the paths that the stars etch through the sky above some of the most beautiful landscapes in the United States. Vincent Brad's Planetary Panoramas, like this one of Devils Tower in Wyoming, resemble Vincent van Gogh's masterpiece Starry Night . By combining the images taken by the four cameras together he has been able to create pictures that take on an almost surreal quality. The technique has also enabled him to produce real pictures that bear a striking resemblance to van Gogh's masterpiece Starry Night. Mr Brady said: 'The Earth is rotating at a steady 1,040mph - I created a custom rig of four cameras with fisheye lenses to capture the entire night-sky in motion. 'I created them on a number of cold, dark, sleepless nights under awe-spiring skies.' Mr Brady had to obtain special permission from the resident Navajo to photograph this image of Monument Valley in Arizona overnight . Mr Brady has also used his innovative technique to show how the colours of the Northern Lights fill the sky above Iceland in the picture above . Mr Brady hiked two miles into the Utah desert at night to capture this picture of the huge Landscape Arch, which has a span of 290 feet . Mr Brady set each camera to take photographs continuously for around three hours with exposures of around one minute. Each camera produces between 100 and 200 images. Mr Brady then edits the images of from the four separate cameras to combine them into startrails. He then stitches the resulting four images together to make seamless star trails that he calls Planetary Panoramas. He hit on the technique in 2012 while experimenting with shooting 360 degree views of landscapes. He said that he wanted to capture the entire night-sky in motion as the Earth rotates at 1,040mph. The strange swirls in the sky that appear in Starry Night by Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh have been greatly debated. The artist created the masterpiece between 16 and 18 June 1889 from the view out  of an asylum window. Some have claimed that the shapes in the night's sky were extensions of van Gogh's fragile mental state at the time. But a recent claim suggests that the spirals actually depict galaxies and may have been inspired by drawings of the cosmos at the time. The claim was made by American artist and photographer Michael Benson in his new book, Cosmigraphics. Of particular interest, he says, is a drawing of the Whirlpool Galaxy - official designation M51a - by Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, in the mid 19th century. To observe the night sky, Lord Rosse built the largest telescope at the time - one with a mirror six feet (1.8 metres) in diameter - with which he observed the galaxy and made his drawing. The Starry Night now hangs in New York's Museum of Modern Art. The swirls in Vincent van Gogh's masterpiece Starry Night, one of his most famous paintings, are thought to depict galaxies drawn at the time . Each image shows how the stars appear to rotate around the north star. Among the locations he has taken photos are the Delicate Arch in Utah - a 65 feet freestanding archway of rock, Devils Tower in Wyoming, Monument Valley in Arizona, and Logan Pass at Glacier National Park. Mr Vincent said: 'I find the best results when scoping out locations in the daytime before going out into the pitch blackness. The custom camera rig used by Mr Brady (above) allows him to capture a 360 degree view of the landscape and sky over several hours . Trails left by the stars in the sky above Delicate Arch in Utah appear to mirror the layers in the orange sandstone beneath in the image above . Mr Brady has also used his technique to produce globe like 360 degree views of places like the one above of Sleepy Hallow in Michigan . The brief flashes of light produced by fireflies also intrigue Mr Brady and he has used his technique to capture them like in the photo above . 'I typically but not always setup just before sundown and take a few photos while sunlight is still present and blend in these shots with the night scene to bring out some details in the elements. 'My rig has taken me to firefly parties in Missouri, dark eerie nights at Devils Tower and through Logan Pass at Glacier National Park. 'I've been up the mountains of British Columbia and around the amazing arches and sandstone monuments in the Great American Southwest.' The planet seems to revolve around the tip of this totem pole shaped rock in Arizona thanks to the 360 degree photography technique .","Photographer Vincent Brady set up four cameras on a special rig to capture hundreds of pictures for each image .
The pictures, which he calls Planetary Panoramas, show a 360 degree view of landmarks around the United States .
He left the cameras to take pictures for up to three hours at a time, exposing each shot for around one minute .
The result is a series of beautiful pictures that show the path taken by the stars through the sky as the Earth rotates ."

"Nasa has revealed a plan to make the International station station cool - in fact, to make a part of it the coldest spot in the universe. Researchers say that studying matter at just above absolute zero could give them new insights into the quantum world. This, they say, could revolutionise our understanding of the world, and lead to vastly faster electronics and lasers. Scroll down for video . The experiment will create an area of the ISS cooled to 100 pico-Kelvin, one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero, where all the thermal activity of atoms theoretically stops . In the vast gulf between stars and galaxies, the temperature of gaseous matter routinely drops to 3 degrees K, or 454 degrees below zero Fahrenheit - but Nasa want to go even lower, to 100 pico-kelvin. 100 pico-Kelvin is just one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero, where all the thermal activity of atoms theoretically stops. At such low temperatures, ordinary concepts of solid, liquid and gas are no longer relevant. Atoms interacting just above the threshold of zero energy create new forms of matter that are essentially quantum, Nasa said. 'We’re going to study matter at temperatures far colder than are found naturally,' said Rob Thompson of JPL, who is head of the Cold Atom Lab. The 'atomic refrigerator’ is scheduled to launch in 2016. 'We aim to push effective temperatures down to 100 pico-Kelvin,' said Thompson. 100 pico-Kelvin is just one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero, where all the thermal activity of atoms theoretically stops. At such low temperatures, ordinary concepts of solid, liquid and gas are no longer relevant. Atoms interacting just above the threshold of zero energy create new forms of matter that are essentially quantum, Nasa said. The experiment will use lasers to cool materials. The space station is the best place to do this research, Nasa said, because microgravity allows researchers to cool materials to temperatures much colder than are possible on the ground. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the bizarre rules of light and matter on atomic scales. In that realm, matter can be in two places at once; objects behave as both particles and waves; and nothing is certain: the quantum world runs on probability. The team are set to begin their experiments looking at a unique phenomenon. 'We’ll begin by studying Bose-Einstein Condensates,' they said. In 1995, researchers discovered that if you took a few million rubidium atoms and cooled them near absolute zero, they would merge into a single wave of matter. In 2001, Eric Cornell of the National Institute of Standards & Technology and Carl Wieman of University of Colorado shared the Nobel Prize with Wolfgang Ketterle of MIT for their independent discovery of these condensates, which Albert Einstein and Satyendra Bose had predicted in the early 20th century. The laser cooling system will have five steps to reduce materials to just above absolute zero . If you create two BECs and put them together, they don't mix like an ordinary gas. Instead, they can 'interfere' like waves: thin, parallel layers of matter are separated by thin layers of empty space. An atom in one BEC can add itself to an atom in another BEC and produce – no atom at all. 'The Cold Atom Lab will allow us to study these objects at perhaps the lowest temperatures ever,' says Nasa. The lab is also a place where researchers can mix super-cool atomic gasses and see what happens. 'Mixtures of different types of atoms can float together almost completely free of perturbations,' explains Thompson, 'allowing us to make sensitive measurements of very weak interactions. 'This could lead to the discovery of interesting and novel quantum phenomena.' The space station is the best place to do this research. Microgravity allows researchers to cool materials to temperatures much colder than are possible on the ground. 'It’s a basic principle of thermodynamics that when a gas expands, it cools,' said Thompson. How the experiment will get there . 'Most of us have hands-on experience with this. If you spray a can of aerosols, the can gets cold.' Quantum gases are cooled in much the same way. In place of an aerosol can, however, we have a ‘magnetic trap.’ 'On the ISS, these traps can be made very weak because they do not have to support the atoms against the pull of gravity. 'Weak traps allow gases to expand and cool to lower temperatures than are possible on the ground.' 'We’re entering the unknown.'","Experiment will create an area of the ISS cooled to 100 pico-Kelvin .

"Legends of vampires roaming rural areas of Eastern Europe may have actually been the result of untimely deaths of cholera victims, according to scientists. Suspected vampires were buried in bizarre rituals during the 17th and 18th centuries to ward off evil and prevent them from rising again from the grave. But rather than being blood-sucking monsters, tests have revealed they were in fact early victims of cholera and were viewed suspiciously because they died so suddenly. This 30 to 39-year-old female was found buried with a sickle across her neck in an attempt to cut her head off should she try to rise from the dead, but scientists believe she may have been the victim of a cholera outbreak. However, they have been not yet been able to find evidence of the disease on the remains . Archaeologists discovered skeletons in a Polish cemetery that had rocks and sickles placed across their necks in these strange funerals, known as apotropaic burials. Initially it was thought the people had been suspected as vampires because they were viewed with suspicion for being outsiders who had recently moved to the area before dying. However, now scientists have analysed the dental enamel from the teeth of six 'vampires' along with 60 other individuals from the cemetery. They found that rather than being immigrants to the area, they were locals and their deaths had instead been viewed by others in the area as strange for other reasons. The scientists claim that the burials appear to match with a time when cholera epidemics were prevalent in Eastern Europe and these may have been the first people to die in outbreaks. Dr Lesley Gregoricka, from University of South Alabama, who led the work, said: 'People of the post-medieval period did not understand how disease was spread. 'Rather than a scientific explanation for these epidemics, cholera, and the deaths that resulted from it, were explained by the supernatural - in this case, vampires.' Vampire legends have suggested that the power of the undead can be passed to their victims through their bite, much like a disease. Frightened locals also placed stones on the throat of this 45 to 49-year-old female found in the Drawsko Pomorskie cemetery to prevent her from biting anyone or feeding on the living . In some stories, such as in the film and comic series Blade, vampirism is actually spread by a virus. However, the new research, which is published in the journal PLOS One, suggests while a disease may have to blame, it was not because it was turning its victims into blood suckers. In some stories, such as in the film and comic series Blade, vampirism is actually spread by a virus. However, the new research, which is published in the journal PLOS One, suggests while a disease may have to blame, it was not because it was turning its victims into blood suckers. Instead, by killing those that caught it in a way not encountered before, it led to the victims being viewed suspiciously by others in the local area, particularly once others started dying in similar ways. It was also thought the people had been suspected as vampires because others believed them to be outsiders who had recently moved to the area before dying.

They found that rather than being immigrants to the area, they were locals and their deaths had instead been viewed by others in the area as strange for other reasons. Instead, by killing those that caught it in a way not encountered before, it led to the victims being viewed suspiciously by others in the local area, particularly once others started dying in similar ways. The researchers studied skeletons that had been unearthed during excavations at a cemetery in the town of Drawsko Pomorskie in north western Poland. In total, 285 human skeletons were recovered from the site between 2008 and 2012. Six of them - including one adult male, three adult females, a teenage female and another child - were found to have been buried in strange ways. Five of them had been buried with a sickle placed across their throat or abdomen, as a way of removing the head or guts should they attempt to rise from the grave. Two had also had large stones positioned beneath their chins to prevent them from biting others. Other items including coins bearing crosses were also found with the remains. Unlike other vampire burials in Eastern Europe, these had been buried among others in the cemetery. Usually the graves of suspected vampires were situated on the outskirts. In an attempt to find out who these people were, Dr Gregoricka and her colleagues examined the molars from 60 individuals using strontium isotope ratios. These were then compared to the strontium isotopes found in the teeth of animals from the same area. Many vampire legends include stories of how vampires can turn their victims into fellow members of the undead by infecting them with their bite. One of the suspected vampires was an adult male, while four were females, raising the prospect that locals feared they had been turned into vampires in a similar way . As these isotopes build up in the teeth through an animal and person's life from their diet and water, they were able to work out whether those buried in the cemetery had been local. The results showed that each of the six vampires, rather than being outsiders, had been members of the local community. This led the researchers to conclude that there had been something else to cast suspicion on their deaths. Dr Gregoricka said: 'A multitude of attributes associated with vampirism also made locals susceptible to accusation, possibly resulting in apotropaic burial at Drawsko. 'Individuals ostracized during life for their strange physical features, those born out of wedlock or who remained unbaptized, and anyone whose death was unusual in some way – untimely, violent, the result of suicide, or even as the first to die in an infectious disease outbreak – all were considered vulnerable to reanimation after death . 'In particular, historic records describe multiple cholera epidemics that swept through Poland throughout the 17th century as a result of contaminated water. 'The first person to die from an infectious disease outbreak was presumed more likely to return from the dead as a vampire.' But she added: 'However, because cholera kills quickly and does not leave behind visible markers on the skeleton, it is unclear if this is the case at Drawsko.'","Skeletons found in a cemetery in Poland were suspected as vampires are thought to have been the first to die in disease outbreaks .
The victims were buried with sickles across their necks and stones under their chins to prevent them rising from the dead and biting the living .

"Air traffic controllers are left unable to explain a plane's strange contrail, which was photographed on Monday morning by a woman in Southsea, Hampshire. The plane's trail resembles a ditch, bent in such a way that suggests that the plane suddenly changed its path mid-air before going back on itself. Florence Lehmann, a local teacher, was the first to spot the plane's vapour trail when she left her home at about 7:20am on Monday. Scroll down for video . Air traffic controllers cannot explain strange contrail . 'It's really weird,' she said. 'It looks like the pilot sneezed or fell asleep.' 'Somebody said a UFO had been spotted recently in the area and the pilot had tried to avoid it, which I quite like the sound of. 'There was no wind this morning and the plane actually moved trajectory.' The sighting she mentioned refers to a spotting in Portsmouth last week. A grey-spherical object was photographed above the neighbouring town, causing speculation from some residents that it may have been a UFO. Adding fuel to such speculation, the Met Office reportedly said that last week's sighting was not linked to the weather. Planes often leave a visible vapour trail in the sky, but they normally follow a straight line . As far as this week's flight path detour, it too remains a mystery. A spokeswoman for Nats, the air traffic control company, is unable to offer explanation as to why the plane had apparently changed direction. 'Unfortunately Nats has no knowledge of the purpose of any given flight and we do not identify individual aircraft to members of the public,' she said.","Woman photographed strange plane vapour trail over Hampshire .

"It could soon be possible to closely examine some of the coldest items in the universe 'indefinitely' due to a breakthrough in imaging techniques. Up until now, studying matter at temperatures close to absolute zero was difficult because the light energy from the cameras caused the matter to heat up and be destroyed. Physicists from Nottingham have created a computer program that not only reveals for the first time exactly how this energy behaves, it helps create a way of using this energy to keep the particles cold. When boson particles are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero they turn into a gas, known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), pictured. For the first time, researchers have simulated how matter behaves when photographed at these temperatures and developed a way to keep it cool, making it possible to study the gas for longer . Extremley-cold Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) represents a new state of matter and is one of the cornerstones of quantum physics. There is currently a great deal off interest in the use of BEC in precision measurement. At the moment, some of the most sensitive detectors ever made - to measure things like rotation, acceleration, and gravity - use the wavelike properties of atoms. Scientists believe BECs could further improve their accuracy . Another potential use is in quantum information processing. If you want to build a quantum computer, you need a way to start with matter that is in the same state, and a BEC could help achieve this. By keeping them cold, the condensates and their atomic processes can be studied for much longer. The process hasn’t been used in a real-world experiment yet, but the scientists from Nottingham University believe it could make studying the coldest of objects much easier. When particles called bosons are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero they turn into a dilute gas. This change of state is known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Absolute zero is -273.15 Celsius (-459.67 Fahrenheit) and at this temperature atoms behave differently. For decades scientists have been studying how and why they do this. The boson particles change into this state because the drop in temperature reduces how much energy they have. BEC (pictured in purple) being measured with off-resonant light (red).

"Zombies might be something you associate with modern popular culture. But for our ancestors in the Iron Age, it appears they too were fearful of ‘the walking dead.’ A female skeleton found in Wiltshire has all the signs of a ritual burial designed to stop her rising from the ground. An Iron Age woman was found buried without her feet in Wiltshire, UK . The discovery was made in a field near West Knoyle during a dig for Wessex Water, who are building a pipeline 64 kilometres (40 miles) long to carry water from Dorset to Wiltshire. Although Iron Age discoveries are not in themselves unusual, it was the nature of this burial that made it so odd. In addition to the woman’s feet being chopped off and buried alongside her, she was also buried with the carcasses of sheep and goats on her head. The Iron Age in Britain was a period in history that began around 700 BC and ended with the Roman invasion in AD 43. Burial practices were extremely varied. In some regions, such as the South, formal burials were rare, with only a small number of adult burials known from pits inside hill forts and other settlements. Finds of bone fragments on many sites have led to the suggestion that the majority of the population in this region were disposed of by 'excarnation' - the deliberate exposure of the corpse. In the South West and West, bodies were sometimes interred in small stone coffins, known as 'cists'. In East Yorkshire, large formal cemeteries including burials with cart and horse equipment have been discovered. Bog bodies show evidence of a violent death, and in the cases of Lindow Man from Lindow Moss in Cheshire and the recent Irish discoveries at Clonycavan and Croghan, a possible ritual or sacrificial killing has been suggested.Many bog bodies show evidence of a violent death, and possible ritual or sacrificial killing . The placing of these individuals in wet locations may also link with the later prehistoric ritual practice of depositing metalwork in rivers, lakes and bogs. Source: BBC . And alongside her were found the remains of a child aged ten and two men with sword wounds. ‘I think this cemetery is marked for difficult deaths where people were probably worried about the circumstances in which they’ve died,’ Dr Melanie Giles, Senior Lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Manchester, told MailOnline. Such burials have been known to be performed where the local community were frightened by the nature of the death. This could be death caused by childbirth, violent wounding or illness. In such circumstances, locals were afraid that the bodies could rise from the dead and haunt their community. So, to prevent such an occurrence they would sometimes chop off the feet of a body after its death so it could not walk. They would also leave food offerings for the undead to prevent them rising. The burial was found in a field in West Knoyle during a dig for Wessex Water . The odd burial may have been a ritual to prevent the woman rising from the dead . Alongside the woman were found a 10 year-old child and two men with sword wounds . ‘Chopping off whole feet is something done after death to stop them haunting you,’ explains Dr Giles. ‘It looks like a sort of rite designed to prevent her rising and becoming a member of the walking dead.’ The goats and sheep, meanwhile, are common funeral offerings. They are often placed on the head or upper chest to appease the spirit and send it off with food to the afterlife. But the exact circumstances behind the deaths of the individuals will likely remain somewhat of a mystery. ‘It’s the clustering of these bodies that is fascinating,’ says Dr Giles. ‘It looks as if everybody in that group died in an untimely way.’","A skeleton of an Iron Age woman has been found in Wiltshire .

"Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011 - but another launch event has passed without it making an appearance. Now Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has revealed that TV is an area the firm continues to have great interest in, but admitted ‘if we’re really honest, it’s stuck back in the seventies.’ Mr Cook made the claims on the Charlie Rose Show in the US. Scroll down for video . During an interview with US chat show host Charlie Rose, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) said: ‘TV is [a product] we continue to have interest in, but it's stuck back in the seventies. When you go in your living room to watch the TV, it almost feels like you’re rewinding the clock' ‘The hardest decisions we make are all the things not to work on,‘ Mr Cook told the chat show host. ‘There’s lots of things we have interest in, but we know we can’t do everything great.’ When asked if TV was one of those examples, Mr Cook replied: ‘TV is one that we continue to have great interest in, but TV is one of those things that, if we’re really honest, it's stuck back in the seventies. Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011. Earlier this year, reports claimed Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV had been delayed until next year. Apple engineers working on the gadget were told not to expect it to launch until 2015, and the delay was blamed on cable companies refusing to do deal. Rumours claim Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen making is four times sharper than even current HDTV pictures. The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV, as well as films and TV shows. It is also expected to be able to run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control. ‘Think about how much your life has changed, and yet when you go in your living room to watch the TV, it almost feels like you’re rewinding the clock, and you've entered a time capsule.' He continued that the ‘interface is terrible' and people only watch shows when they come on, unless they remember to record them. However, PC Pro's Barry Collins believes Mr Cook is wrong. Mr Collins wrote: 'The stress of last week’s big Apple announcements must be getting to Tim Cook. 'The man needs a holiday. 'That can be the only explanation for some bizarre comments he made over the weekend, when he was asked about Apple’s TV plans.' He then goes on to explain all the ways in which TV has developed and advanced since the large, bulky sets of the 70s and the piles of videos using a series of pictures. Similarly, finance journalist Aaron Pressman tweeted: 'TV is stuck in the 70s? It’s too annoying to pay by credit card? @tim_cook needs to get out of his Apple bubble a bit more.'

"An ‘omelette on a stick’ might not appear the most appetising way to start the day. However, the import is being presented as the ideal ‘breakfast on the go’. It is one of the foods that can be created using the Rollie ‘vertical grill’ from the US. Lakeland is bringing the Rollie to Britain and boasts that, as well as the simple omelette, it can create many more tasty snacks, including party canapes and sweet treats. Essentially, the Rollie is a heated tube with a non-stick coating on the inside. The user simply cracks two eggs and pours in the mixture and then, part way through the heating process, adds a stick down the middle as it begins to solidify. The cylindrical omelette pops up when it is cooked in what the manufacturer, Kalorik, boasts is an ‘easy to eat’ shape. Kalorik also claims it takes five to six minutes to cook a two-egg omelette on a stick, however video bloggers who have tried the Rollie suggest it is actually six to eight minutes. Videos on the firm’s website suggest that as well as cooking breakfast, workers could keep the device on their desk to turn out a hot lunch. Lakeland is renowned for bringing kitchen innovations to British consumers, such as its yellow banana holder and the popular Mary Berry baking range. However, the company faces an uphill task to win over consumers in this country to the Rollie, given the fact it has received mixed reviews in the US. It was ridiculed on TV comedy show the Colbert Report, where host Stephen Colbert suggested it provides an answer to the question: ‘How can I make my breakfast fit more snugly into my colon?’ Scroll down for video .

Egg roll: The machine's makers claim it takes six minutes to cook an omelette - longer than in a frying pan . Critics have also identified a number of flaws. For example, the six to eight minutes it takes to cook an egg lolly is slower than using a frying pan. At the same time, it is not suitable for a dishwasher, which means it has to be cleaned by hand. A Lakeland spokesman said: ‘Omelettes on a stick are perfect for quick, fuss-free breakfasts but we think Rollie has so much more to offer, especially at this time of the year when parties are in full swing. ‘Perfect for making canapés, just pop your ingredients inside the vertical non-stick grill and, when cooked, lift out and slice up ready for the party platter.

The peculiar outline was captured by craftsman John Hindley - who claims he took the picture of what looked like a 'glitch' in the clouds after feeling a 'magnetic pull' towards it. The 35-year-old insists he is a perfectly rational man but after zooming in on the photo believes what he saw could have been a UFO. Spooky: The peculiar outline was captured by craftsman John Hindley - who claims he took the picture of what looked like a 'glitch' in the sky after feeling a 'magnetic pull' towards it . Mr Hindley was staying at a friend's house in Middleton, Manchester, on November 7 when he woke at around 10am. After getting up he recalls feeling a 'pulling sensation' that led him to look up into the sky where he spotted the paranormal-looking shape drifting over the Pennines around two miles away. Standing by the window on the third floor of the maisonette he took a picture using his mobile phone. Mr Hindley said: 'I just got up from the sofa and I felt this pull to take a picture out the window there and then. Something drew me to the window. 'Two days after I remembered feeling I had. It was like that pull I had had before. 'Normally when you take a photo there is no emotion so I remembered that feeling I had - and so I thought I would take a look at the photo. It had it again when I looked at the photo. Unexplained: The object - which is oval shaped with lights emanating from it - remained in the same position in the sky for half an hour before disappearing. He added: 'It was like a magnetic pull - a lunar pull. I felt the same pull at when I took the picture . 'I am a rational man. I have never felt that feeling before. With the feeling I had and what it looks like, I don't think it was a Chinook helicopter. 'I definitely think it could have been a UFO. I think people more people are realising that we are not the only people floating around the vicinity. 'I mean the photo shows the lights shining through the clouds. I really don't think it is a reflection - look at the saucer shaped object and the lights and the two lines coming out of the bottom.' The object - which is oval shaped with lights emanating from it - remained in the same position in the sky for half an hour before disappearing. Nigel Watson, author of the Haynes, UFO Investigations Manual, claims there has been a progressive build up of sightings in the UK this year. Recent sighting: Just two months ago this dark grey, disc-like object was spotted in the sky above Portsmouth . He said: 'Only recently a blue light was seen and filmed flying over Liverpool, and a BBC local news crew captured two nebulous fast moving lights moving over Walton-on-the-Naze in October. 'As with most UFO photographs it is hard to tell what created these images. The majority tend to be of Chinese lanterns that always give off an orange or red light. 'In this case the lights are tightly packed together so it is doubtful lanterns were responsible for this. 'An added mystery to this sighting is that the photographer felt magnetically attracted to the object. 'In many cases people have viewed UFOs and experienced a loss of time or felt an impulse to signal to the object. It could be just a subjective factor or energy radiating from the object interacting with the witness.' Just two months ago a dark grey, disc-like object was spotted in the sky above Portsmouth. After weather experts ruled out the possibility that the shape was a cloud, many of the town's residents were left wondering exactly what it was that passed over their homes. The man who took the photo said: 'My initial thought was that it was a plane, but it was just moving too quickly. 'I was the only one that saw it but was quick enough to take the picture. Last year a professional photographer inadvertently captured this strange flying object in Devon . The photo was taken in Devon, with the object floating above turbines at Fullabrook wind farm . 'I definitely believe in UFOs and am very interested in science fiction, and often look up at the sky in the evening wondering if there is anything or anyone else out there.' And last November there was another UK sighting, in Devon, where images showed what appears to be a UFO floating above turbines at Fullabrook wind farm. The mysterious object - which was also grey in colour, quite large and oval-shaped - was unintentionally captured by a professional photographer.","Peculiar oval-shaped flying object was spotted in sky over the Pennines .

"A wild and windy rock on an Aegean island has revealed what experts say is some of the earliest gay erotic art ever found. Researchers found two giant phalluses and a stream of steamy text carved into rocks on the Aegean island of Astypalaia. The inscriptions talk about two men mounting each other, and the find is is described as 'very, very rare.' The oldest erotic grafitti  in the world on Astypalaia also highlighted the extent of literacy at a time when the Acropolis in Athens had yet to be built.  Credit: Helena Smith for The Guardian . Astypalaia is a Greek island with just under 1500 residents. It belongs to the Dodecanese, an island group of twelve major islands in the southeastern Aegean Sea. Astypalaia's treaty with Rome, made in 105 B.C., has survived in an inscription found on the island. It states The Astypalaians would not aid the enemies of the Romans or allow such enemies passage through their territory, and likewise the Romans would not aid the enemies of the Astypalaians or allow such enemies passage through their territory; in case of an attack on Astypalaia the Romans would come to its aid, in case of an attack on Rome the Astypalaians would come to its aid; etc. Dr Andreas Vlachopoulos of the University of Ioannina told The Guardian the art was clearly homosexual. 'They claimed their own space in large letters that not only expressed sexual desire but talked about the act of sex itself,' he told the Guardian. 'And that is very, very rare.' 'We know that in ancient Greece sexual desire between men was not a taboo.. The inscriptions date from the fifth and sixth centuries BC, and it is believed were near to a soldier's garrison. One inscription, believed to have been carved in the mid-sixth century BC, proclaimed: 'Nikasitimos was here mounting Timiona (Νικασίτιμος οἶφε Τιμίονα)'. Other rock art found at the site include carvings depicting oared ships, daggers and spirals – all still discernible despite exposure to the erosive effects of wind and sea. The inscriptions and large phalluses carved into Astypalaia's rocky peninsula at Vathy. Found overlooking the Bay of Vathy on the island's north-western tip, the inscription has led the archaeologist to believe that soldiers may once have been garrisoned in the area. Astypalaia is best known for its ancient cemeteries of mass graves containing the remains of newborn infants. At Kylindra, on the west flank of the castle hill, a unique graveyard has been excavated by the Greek archaeological service. At least 2700 newborns and small children were buried in ceramic pots between approximately 750 B.C. and Roman times. Astypalaia is a Greek island with just under 1500 residents - and could now be home to the world's first homosexual erotic art .","Two giant phalluses and a stream of steamy text carved into rocks on the Aegean island of Astypalaia .

"A huge hump-backed 'ostrich' dinosaur, taller than a London bus and with arms eight feet (2.4 metres) long tipped with razor sharp claws, has been modelled based on Mongolia fossils. Two almost complete skeletons - which included the remains of digested fish in the belly of one - have helped build an accurate picture of the lifestyle of mysterious Deinocheirus mirificusone. For almost 50 years it was known only from two gigantic arms but the new collection of fossils  have now been pieced together. Scroll down for video . Scientists had wondered about an odd dinosaure called Deinocheirus mirificusone for almost 50 years after discovering two of its huge arms. Now a pair of new skeletons unearthed in Mongolia have allowed them to assemble the missing pieces of the puzzle. Shown is a 3D model of the creature . Analyses indicate Deinocheirus was the largest member of the ornithomimosaurs - a group of dinosaurs that bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches, Dr Yuong-Nam Lee and colleagues report in Nature. The  creature is estimated to have measured an incredible 36 feet (11 metres) long and stood over 16 feet (4.9 metres) tall, and it would have have weighed about 7 tons (6,350kg). A giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was as long as of a double-decker bus, scientists from the University of Edinburgh claim. The terrifying creature roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and may even have eaten dinosaurs, according to a new study. The fearsome prehistoric reptile measured more than 30 feet (nine metres) long. Fresh research into Machimosaurus reveals key details of how and where it lived. Experts say three different species could be found in Europe and a fourth in Ethiopia. The skeletons, discovered in two different quarries in 2006 and 2009, shows that Deinhocheirus, roamed Earth 70 million years ago. The 2006 specimen of Deinocheirus mirificus was found at quarry Altan Utul IV; the 2009 specimen at Bugiin Tsav. Both of these are quarries are in the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi desert, a rock unit dated to 70 million years ago. The dinosaur has unique features not seen in other ornithomimosaurs, such as an elongated toothless snout flaring out at the sides and a humped back. It also had an enormous lower jaw more like theropods such as T-Rex. Vertebrae from the two new specimens also showed long, flat neural spines jutted upwards from the middle of the dinosaur's back to create a sloping, bony hump. Look familar? Analyses indicate Deinocheirus (illustrated right) was the largest member of the ornithomimosaurs - a group of dinosaurs that bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches (left), Dr Yuong-Nam Lee and colleagues report in Nature, and it roamed Earth 70 million years ago . No other ornithomimosaur has been found with such a structure, but other sorts of unrelated dinosaurs - such as the croc-snouted Spinosaurus and the shovel-billed Ouranosaurus - have been found with similar 'sails'. Fleshy 'sails' could have helped dinosaurs regulate their body temperature but other scientists believe the bones supported something more like a bison's thick hump. The researchers said Deinocheirus would have lived by rivers with a duck-like bill probably helping it forage for food at the bottom of streams. Blunt and flattened bones under its claws could have prevented it from sinking on wet ground. Fish remains were found among what seems to be stomach contents but the Deinocheirus skeletons also have features associated with plant consumption - suggesting the creature was an omnivore. Over a thousand small, polished stones were discovered around the belly region of one of the fossils. Dr Lee described these as gastroliths - or stomach stones - that the dinosaur intentionally swallowed to grind up tough plant material.

Its Latin name means 'unusual horrible hand.' Dr Lee, of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources in Daejeon said: 'These fossils provide new insights into the creatures and reveal unexpected features that could not have been predicted from the partial skeletons originally discovered in 1965. 'The discovery of the original specimen almost half a century ago suggested this was an unusual dinosaur - but did not prepare us for how distinctive Deinocheirus is - a true cautionary tale in predicting body forms from partial skeletons even for animals in which the relationships are known.'

"Facebook and Twitter are simply the latest versions of social platforms invented by the Romans, according to a new book. Its author claims that the internet has enabled the way people communicate with groups to return to its natural social state, as used by the Romans some 2,000 years ago. In particular, journalist Tom Standage says that the way ancient graffiti was used to boast or complain about a variety of subjects was a key moment in the birth of social networking. Tom Standage traces the rise of social media throughout history and compares large walls in Rome's Forum where residents wrote messages about their sexual conquests, hotel reviews and political opinions, with a Facebook wall in modern times . Mr Standage said modern users of social networks are the ‘unwitting heirs of a rich tradition with surprisingly deep historical roots,’ in his latest book. In 'Writing on the Wall : Social Media – The First 2,000 Years', the Economist’s digital editor writes that it is as if the Romans and several historical figures including Thomas Paine and Martin Luther were on Facebook as they communicated in a similar style to the statuses users post today. He justifies the idea by defining social media as 'an environment in which information was passed from one person to another along social connections in order to create a distributed discussion among a community'. For centuries, people communicated in a similar, shared way before the arrival of mass media and the printing press began spreading news in a ‘one-way conversation', Mr Standage told Washington Monthly. Author and journalist Tom Standage, said modern bloggers (pictured) and users of social networks are the 'unwitting heirs of a rich tradition with surprisingly deep historical roots', in his latest book . Sir John Harington (pictured) who lived in the 16th Century, composed epigrams which Mr Standage said bear some resemblance to tweets . He believes it was similar to what we experience today when using social media and the internet, . which has enabled anyone to become a publisher. In the book, he traces the rise of social media throughout history and compares Facebook to large walls in the Forum, in Rome, where residents wrote messages about hotel reviews, political opinions and even their sexual conquests. Sir John Harington, the inventor of the first toilet, who lived in the 16th Century, composed epigrams about life at the time which Mr Standage said bear some resemblance to the brief Tweets of today. He cites Martin Luther’s act of pinning his 95 Theses on a church door as an example of a piece of writing going viral. Mr Standage writes: Luther had unwittingly revealed the power of a decentralised, person-to-person media system whose participants took care of distribution, deciding collectively which messages to amplify through sharing, recommendation and copying.’ He also says that modern blogging culture is not dissimilar to the chaotic media environment of the 1640s, while ancient tablets with their flat writing surfaces and frames, look very much like modern tablet computers. Mr Standage is an expert at drawing thought-provoking comparisons between modern technology and in the past has written books about the 'Victorian internet' and an 18th century chess-playing robot that inspired modern artificial intelligence research.","Author Tom Standage says the internet has enabled the way people communicate with groups to return to its natural social state .

"Captaincy is a serious business, but it won’t force the fun out of Joe Marler. The England prop will go to Twickenham today determined to carry on epitomising his club’s colourful image. A Harlequin is defined as a ‘joker’ and a ‘jester’, in which case the new skipper will stay true to the logo on his chest. The armband around his sleeve will not remove the grin from his face. A Harlequin is also defined as a ‘mute character in a traditional pantomime’, but in that regard the cap doesn’t fit. Marler can be relied upon to keep delivering his trademark one-liners and generally maintaining a vocal presence, despite the responsibility of his new role. Captain: Joe Marler is hoping to bring his own brand of captaincy to Harlequins . ‘I have no idea yet what sort of captain I’m going to be,’ said the 24-year-old ahead of his side’s Aviva Premiership opener against London Irish; Part II of the annual London Double Header extravaganza at HQ, following the opening game between Saracens and Wasps. ‘But I’m not going to change a huge amount in the way I am. ‘There’s being a joker and being obstructive and there’s just having a laugh and enjoying the job. ‘I’ll probably have to stop shouting things out in meetings as much and accept that just before a game is not the best time for practical jokes!’ All the indications are that the jester in Marler is not going to be suppressed by leadership. He is in no hurry to ditch the non-conformist streak. Respect: Marler is only 24 but has played over 100 games for Quins and has 22 caps for England . Age: 24 . Position: Prop . Height: 6ft . Weight: 17st 5lb . CLUB CAREER . Began playing rugby at Eastbourne RFC. n Joined the Harlequins academy in June 2008. Quins apps: 105 Tries: 5 . INTERNATIONAL CAREER . Captained England Under 18s against Wales in 2008. Also played for the Under 20s and England Saxons. Senior debut: v South Africa, June 2012 . Total caps: 22 . Back in December, 2011 the rookie loosehead played for Quins at a sold-out Twickenham with his familiar Mohican supplemented by hair forming the words ‘Jolly Hogg sausage’ to advertise team-mate Olly Kohn’s catering company. Other slogans and patterns have followed, and the eye-catching trend won’t necessarily end with the club captaincy role. ‘I don’t know if I will do something like that again — no-one has approached me for some time,’ he said. ‘But I’m open to offers!’ In recent years, Quins have been led by England captain Chris Robshaw — a very different character to Marler, more serious, less exuberant — but the club’s director of rugby, Conor O’Shea, had no doubts about making this appointment and doesn’t want a clone. ‘Joe is a natural-born leader,’ said the Irishman. ‘He has played over 100 times for the club and he’s got 20-odd caps for England. He is one of the most respected blokes in our squad. Wind-up: Marler admitted he was initially unsure about taking the role and thought the offer was a wind-up . ‘Will he live and learn? Yes, but I don’t want him to be Chris Robshaw, Andre Vos (another former Quins captain) or Winston Churchill...I want him to be Joe Marler, bringing his own brand of leadership. ‘He will make some unbelievable decisions and he might also get questioned the odd time, because that goes with the job. You are up there to be shot at. But we do not want him to morph into something he’s not. He was picked to be captain because he is Joe Marler.’ The new skipper had led a team only once before — reluctantly — as a teenager. He gave a frank assessment of his efforts. ‘It was an England Under 18s training game at Bisham Abbey,’ said Marler. ‘I said no (to the captaincy), but ended up doing it anyway. ‘It was a training game against the South East academies. We won by 30-odd points but in the last play of the game we got a penalty and I told Rory Clegg to kick the goal because I was hanging (exhausted). It was a training game and I shouldn’t have done that but I was too tired! ‘He did kick the goal, he nailed it, but I don’t know if I would do that again. I might go at it Barbarians style — they are decent crowd favourites who never go for the posts. We’ll see how it goes.’ Decision: After being 'apprehensive' about taking the role, Marler took advice from those close to him . When O’Shea approached Marler about taking on the role, the offer was initially treated as a wind-up. It was no such thing and the man in charge gave the player space to think about whether or not he wanted the armband and the responsibility. The immediate inclination to decline was gradually overcome. ‘I was initially shocked and I looked for every possible reason not to do it because I was a bit scared and apprehensive,’ said Marler. ‘I took a while to think about it and I spoke to a few people — Chris, Will Skinner (another ex-Quins captain) and my partner (Daisy) — then decided to give it a crack.’ Asked if leading a team containing the current England captain was an onerous prospect, he added: ‘Chris is a good, decent bloke and when I spoke to him, he said, “Go for it, I think it will be good”. He will back me all the way. To have guys like him, Nick Easter, Nick Evans and Danny Care around makes my life easier.’ His first task, starting today, will be to oversee a better start to this domestic season than Quins had last year, to avoid the need for another late charge. Prop: Marler faces a duel with Alex Corbisiero of Northampton to be England’s first-choice loosehead prop . ‘We’re really excited,’ he said. ‘Our realistic goal is to be far more consistent. We went on a great run at the end of last season that got us into the semi-finals, but ideally we don’t want to have to do that; where every game is a must-win.’ On a personal level, Marler faces an intriguing duel with Alex Corbisiero of Northampton to start the autumn Test series as England’s first-choice loosehead prop. ‘I’m very realistic about where I stand with England,’ he said. ‘I will try my hardest this season to push for that World Cup squad because it is a massive dream and a massive goal. But if I don’t take care of club business, I will be nowhere near it. ‘If your club is doing well, you have a chance to be looked at more than others when it comes to England selection. And I suppose being captain of Quins can’t hurt.’ It certainly can’t. The jester with the armband has a glorious opportunity to expand his repertoire at the best possible time.","Joe Marler is new captain of Harlequins .

"Millions of travellers make the pilgrimage to Angkor Wat to take in the incredible 900-year-old towers and sculptures of Cambodia's iconic temple complex. And now they have extra cause to make the trip, after archaeologists used Nasa technology to reveal 200 hidden paintings on the buildings' walls. While the faded pictures might be invisible to the naked eye, processed images show elephants, gods, musical instruments, boats and patterns, which are all thought to be ancient graffiti. A discovery to trumpet! Technology used by Nasa has revealed 200 hidden paintings on the walls of Angkor Wat, including this pair of elephants . Archaeologist Noel Hidalgo took photographs with a bright flash and later used ‘decorrelation stretch . analysis’ to enhance them and reveal the artwork on the walls. The . tool is also used by Nasa to look at the subtle colour differences in . Martian rock in photographs taken by its Opportunity rover on the red . planet. At Angkor Wat it revealed more than . 200 images of animals such as lions and elephants, people; deities . including the Hindu monkey god Hanuman; boats and an image of the temple . complex itself, a selection of which have been published in the journal . Antiquity. Experts believe that the artistic markings were made by pilgrims visiting the holy site after it was abandoned in the 15th century, but the more elaborate paintings could have been created during earlier attempts to restore the temple to its former glory, Science reported. The 500-acre temple complex was built in the 12th century and is known for its intricate carvings, some of which measure more than half a mile (1km) in length. Most archaeologists believe that parts of the temple were painted, so when Noel Hidalgo Tan, a rock-art researcher at Australian National University in Canberra spotted paint traces and faint images in 2010 he was excited. He took photographs with a bright flash and later used ‘decorrelation stretch analysis’ to enhance them and reveal the artwork on the walls. The tool is also used by Nasa to look at the subtle colour differences in Martian rock in photographs taken by its Opportunity rover on the red planet. The Angkor Wat temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. Although Angkor Wat appears, at first glance, to be a mass of stone with a central causeway it actually consists of a series of elevated towers, covered galleries, chambers, porches and courtyards on different levels connected by stairs .

A painting of Angkor wat is pictured left and a boat, right . No monkey business: Experts believe that the artistic markings were made by pilgrims visiting the holy site after it was abandoned in the 15th century, but the more elaborate paintings could have been created during earlier attempts to restore the temple to its former glory. A Hindu monkey god is pictured . But at Angkor Wat it revealed more than 200 images of animals such as lions and elephants, people, deities including the Hindu monkey god Hanuman, boats and an image of the temple complex itself, a selection of which have been published in the journal Antiquity. ‘Some of the most detailed paintings, the . ones located at the top of the temple, are passed by literally . thousands of visitors every day, but the most elaborate scenes are . effectively invisible to the naked eye,’ Dr Tan told LiveScience. Because some of the paintings are so . haphazardly arranged, experts believe they were graffiti left by . visitors after the temple was abandoned for the first time in 1431. However, one group of painstakingly-drawn pictures, which are drawn on the highest part of one of the temple’s towers, are thought to be part of a 16th century restoration programme, when the building was converted from a Hindu temple to a Buddhist holy site. Mapped: The 500-acre temple complex was built in the 12th century and is known for its intricate carvings, some of which measure almost 1,093yards (1km) in length. Here, a map shows where hidden paintings were discovered . Music to archaeologists' ears: A chamber - known as the Bakan - contains a scene showing Khmer musical instruments (pictured) such as different types of xylophones, gongs and wind instruments . The real deal: A Khmer musical ensemble known as the pinpeat, which is made up of gongs and appears in the faded artwork is pictured . The chamber – known as the Bakan - contains a scene showing Khmer musical instruments such as different types of xylophones, gongs and wind instruments as well as another showing people riding horses between simples. Dr Tan believes that the most skilful artworks may have been commissioned by Cambodia's King Ang Chan who launched the restoration project. During his reign between 1528 and 1566 Angkor Wat was transformed from a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu into a Buddhist site and numerous carvings were completed. Some of the faded paintings appear to support his theory as they feature Buddhist iconography such as a monument known as a stupa. It is thought that the long-lost paintings could further experts’ knowledge about a little-known period in the temple’s existence. Angkor Wat (pictured) lies 3.4 miles (5.5km) north of the town of Siem Reap in Cambodia. The region contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries . Angkor in Cambodia is one of the most significant archaeological sites in southeast Asia and home to the magnificent remains of the Angkor Wat . The temple complex lies 3.4 miles (5.5km) north of the town of Siem Reap in Cambodia. The region contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries. The Angkor Wat temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. Wat is the Khmer word for temple. It was built as a Hindu place of worship but in 1432, when the capital moved to Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat was maintained by Buddhist monks. Although Angkor Wat appears, at first glance, to be a mass of stone with a central causeway, it actually consists of a series of elevated towers and covered galleries on different levels connected by stairs. The galleries and its columns set the boundaries for the first and second levels, while the third level supports five towers - one in each corner, and one in the centre. Each tower features graduated tiers that create a cone shape, and the highest tower within the temple complex is 699ft (213m). The outer gallery of the temple contains bas-reliefs that stretch for almost 1,960ft (600m), including the Ramayana gallery in the western section. It is thought Angkor Wat was built as funerary temple for King Suryavarman II facing the west towards the setting sun – a symbol for death. The bas-reliefs were designed to be viewed from left to right in the order of a Hindu funeral ritual, and this supports the funerary claims. Angkor Wat is said to be a ‘miniature replica of the universe in stone’ and represents an earthly model of the cosmic world.

"A beautician who once dated one of the Woolwich killers said he was ‘lovely’ and just a ‘normal boy’. Justine Rigden, 26, is understood to have been Michael Adebolajo’s girlfriend for a year when he was a teenager. Her relationship with the boy known to his friends as ‘Narn’ ended before he adopted radical Islamist views. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Justine Rigden dated Michael Adebolajo when he was a teenager in Essex . Rigden, 26, yesterday described Adebolajo as a 'lovely, polite boy' She described her shock after realising her ex-boyfriend was the bloodied man seen wielding a meat cleaver as he claimed butchering a British soldier was an ‘eye for an eye’. Miss Rigden works for a hairdressing salon in Hornchurch and claims to have been shortlisted as the ‘Face of Essex’. She said: ‘He was really friendly and really polite, and there was never anything to  suggest he would be caught up with anything like this. ‘He was just a lovely, polite boy. He stayed at my family’s house and I stayed with his. He was a very family-oriented person. Shock: Rigden said he was a 'normal, regular boy' 'Just a lovely, lovely guy': Friends recall what . Michael Adebolajo was like at Marshall Fields School (left) and after . the brutal murder . Justine Rigden works for a hair salon in Hornchurch and is believed to have dated the terror suspect when they were teenagers . ‘He had a group of friends from Hackney. They weren’t “wrong-uns”, they were  OK, and he used to do a bit of MC-ing, rapping. ‘Nobody can believe it. He was just this normal, regular boy.’ In a video posted on YouTube, the stylist says she admires Jennifer Lopez, because she is a ‘role model for real women with curves’. Pictures on Miss Rigden’s Facebook page showed her modelling in photo shoots, before the page was taken down from the internet on Thursday night. Her profile on the website of the hair salon where she works describes her as an ‘enthusiastic member of the team who will make you feel valued the moment you walk in  the door’. School friends of Adebolajo say he lived a Western lifestyle in his teens, growing up in Essex as a Christian with hard-working Nigerian immigrant parents. Among his friends on Facebook are two serving police officers who knew him from school. He was also close friends with a soldier who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq.Adebolajo was even consoled by friends at the funeral of Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath who died in 2007 when his Land Rover was blown up as it protected a convoy near Basra. The pair were classmates at Marshalls Park School, in Romford, and spent time at each other’s houses after lessons. Images of Justine Rigden appear on YouTube which show her colouring a customer's hair. On the company's website she is described as an 'enthusiastic member of the team' Justine Rigden (right) said Adebolajo (left) stayed at her house when they were going out during their teens . Remembered: Drummer Rigby, a keen football fan who followed Manchester United FC, was just starting his Army career and had recently fought in Afghanistan with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers . Moving: Two boys lay flowers outside Woolwich Barracks where Lee Rigby died . The soldier’s brother Grant, 26, said: ‘What happened in Woolwich was butchery, unbelievable. ‘I’ve asked myself whether he would have done this to my brother also. ‘I don’t know what happened to Michael because he used to be the most laid-back, nicest guy in the world. But I know that if my brother were alive today he’d want to try and make him see sense.’ He added: ‘Describing my emotions is so difficult. I can’t feel anger toward the Michael I knew, because he was so nice a person. We can’t understand it. I don’t think we ever will.’ Adebolajo, 28, is believed to have been radicalised in his late teens by hate preachers Omar Bakri Muhammed and Anjem Choudary. Bakri Muhammed, who was thrown out of Britain when he was the leader of the now banned extremist group Al Muhajiroun, boasted he had converted Adebolajo to Islam when the boy visited his street stall in London. ‘We would talk about the meaning of life with passers-by,’ he said. ‘He stopped to speak with us and we invited him to Islam. ‘Because he is a convert I can still remember him. At that time there were a lot of conflicts around the world, and in Iraq and in Afghanistan especially. We talked to him about these and he sympathised with the Muslim people, it seemed. ‘He was in his 20s, a quiet boy who didn’t ask many questions. He used to come to our open talks and speeches.’ Middle-class upbringing: Michael Adeboloja attended Marshalls Park school in Romford . Despite spouting rhetoric about supposed British crimes in 'our lands', Adebolajo is a British citizen born in London. His mother and father are hard-working Nigerian immigrants from an academic family in West Africa who settled in London in the early 1980s. A Christian couple, they believed in assimilating into British life, and Michael seems to have forged easy friendships with schoolmates of all colours and creeds. Virtually all the friends on his Facebook page have traditional British names such as Louise, Kelly, Robert, Craig, Gemma, Lauren and Paul, to name a few. Among them is Matthew Selt, now a professional snooker player. He was 'just a lovely, lovely guy', in the words of former classmate Stephen Cavalier – who, as a serving PC in the Metropolitan Police – could scarcely have followed a different path. Terror suspect: Anjem Choudary (right) claimed that this is him pictured with Michael Adebolajo, 28, (circled) at an Islamist demonstration in London in 2007 . Speaking at his home in Essex yesterday, Mr Cavalier said: 'It seems odd to say it now, after the events of yesterday, but I remember him as just a lovely, lovely guy. 'I knew Michael at Marshalls Park School in Romford when we were teenagers. He was a good sportsman and just an all-round nice guy.' He said he was no longer close to Adebolajo, who had requested they become 'Facebook friends' a few years ago. 'As soon as I saw the news last night I immediately recognised it was Michael. I was in shock really when I saw him.' Adebolajo's dark side seems to have been awakened in his mid-teens, around the time Tony Blair was sending British troops into Afghanistan and Iraq.

"A young couple have caused outrage in Malaysia and Singapore by posting erotic photographs and videos of their sexual exploits on a blog. Alvin Tan, 24, a law student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), and his girlfriend Vivian Lee, 23, have been heavily criticised in both countries for the revealing blog called 'Sumptuous Erotica'. The blog - which also contains close-ups of the couple's genitals - has challenged the conservative values in both countries, where pornography is illegal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial: Alvin Tan, 24, and his girlfriend Vivian Lee, 23, have caused outrage in Malaysia and Singapore by posting erotic photographs and videos of their sexual exploits on a blog . Even men's magazines such as Penthouse and Playboy are banned. In the blog, as reported by the Times of India, the couple said sex was a natural reproductive process which does not deserve the stigma attached to it. However, by Tuesday the blog was taken down by the couple because of 'family pressure'. In a video posted on YouTube, Lee said: 'We actually shut down the blog because of family pressure.' Tan added: 'Yes, we will continue doing what we love doing. But it's more of a question of timing. We probably won't continue again so soon from now.' People attempting to gain access to the blog are instead asked to give their names and email addresses if they want updates from the pair. The blog has since become a major topic of debate in the Malaysian media. Even senior members of the government have waded into the row. Information Minister Rais Yatim, speaking in the Star newspaper,  said Malaysia has 'legal redress' under the Communications and Multimedia Act, which oversees the country's Internet content. However, he said the government would rather not use this until seeing what the Singaporean authorities are pursuing. The NUS confirmed today that Tan will be questioned by officials at a disciplinary hearing. Critics of the pair want him expelled from the university. Government officials in Singapore have not commented but a number of social media sites have been inundated with calls for Tan's scholarship to be revoked.","Alvin Tan, 24, and his girlfriend Vivian Lee, .

"The best way to outsmart Ryanair's pricing policy is to book ten days before your flight departs, it was claimed today. Economics professor Claudio Piga said he has researched the low-cost airline’s flight costs - and found passengers booking their trip at least seven weeks in advance pay more. But the Keele University expert also found that fares are raised by between 50 and 75 per cent in the last few days before departure, meaning last-minute bargain hunting is not the best method. Claim: The best way to outsmart Ryanair's pricing policy is to book ten days before your flight departs . Mr Piga claimed low-cost airlines know some people will regularly book early because they have to travel on a certain day, reported Sunday Times social affairs editor Nicholas Hellen. And to avoid complicating business when people book flights at the last minute, the airlines want late bookers to know that they will face price rises. The professor described prices from low-cost airlines as being on a ‘U-shaped temporal profile’, with best value available ten days before take-off. He realised that the price of seats on flights went up by around 3 per cent every time one was sold. Getting on board: An expert realised that the price of seats on flights went up by around 3 per cent every time one was sold . But a Ryanair spokesman told the Sunday Times that the research was ‘hopelessly inaccurate’.

He added: ‘Ryanair's lowest fares are sold on a first come, first served basis and rise only as quickly as the low fare class are sold in the six months prior to departure.’ Mr Piga will present his findings at the Royal Economic Society conference in Manchester this week. In a previous similar study in 2003, the expert claimed that passengers who book early do not always get the cheapest seats on low-cost airlines.","Economics professor Claudio Piga has researched airline's flight costs .

"British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford has lost her appeal over a UK Government refusal to fund her legal challenge against her death sentence for drug smuggling. Her lawyers attempted to challenge a High Court ruling that the Government was not legally obliged to pay for 'an adequate lawyer' to represent her after she was sentenced to death by an Indonesian court. But today three senior judges headed by Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, dismissed her challenge in the Court of Appeal. British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford has lost her appeal over a UK Government refusal to fund her legal challenge against her death sentence for drug smuggling . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office refused to fund her case as a matter of Government policy. She was sentenced to death by firing squad by a court in Bali for taking £1.6million of cocaine on to the island. In January, the UK High Court upheld the Government's stance of not providing legal funding for British nationals arrested abroad, even in exceptional circumstances. After the High Court gave its decision, Sandiford received a private donation of over £2,500 that enabled her to be represented by an Indonesian lawyer at the subsequent Bali appeal. Having lost that first appeal, she is now in a race against time to raise money to take her case to Indonesia's Supreme Court in Jakarta. The appeal court heard that Sandiford needs about £8,000 to fight on. Lindsay Sandiford sits in her cell knitting while on death row in Kerobokan prison, Bali. She was sentenced to death by firing squad by a court in Bali for taking £1.6million of cocaine on to the island . The sum of £2,000 has already been found, but around £6,000 is still needed from the Government as money from private sources following publicity was 'fully exhausted', said lawyers for Sandiford, who is not entitled to legal aid in Indonesia. Lord Dyson, sitting with two other judges, said the court had given 'very careful consideration' to the issues raised in what he described as a 'troubling' case. He said the reasons for the judgment would be given 'as soon as possible'. Lord Dyson, when announcing the decision to dismiss the appeal, said it was 'obviously a terribly serious matter'. He said it was 'most unfortunate' that the sum required to secure the representation sought by the appellant - roughly £6,000 - was 'relatively speaking' a 'very small sum indeed'. The judge added: 'But that cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. 'But it may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days.' Rosa Curling, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Sandiford, said outside court: 'We are obviously very disappointed by the decision and we will consider with our client once we have received the reasoning of the court whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.'","Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death by an Indonesian court .

"Police fear they will never get the chance to quiz the alleged killer and gay lover of a British man who moved to the U.S. and reinvented himself as a talk show host in Louisiana. Scott Rogers, 52, was found dead in his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana last week, just one day before he was due to appear in front of a Grand Jury who was investigating whether lied on documents he lodged to foster two children. Police in Baton Rouge believe Rogers was shot by his son-in-law and lover Mathew Hodgkinson, who then attempted to take his own life, but survived. Scott Rogers, who moved from Britain to the U.S., was found shot dead at his home in Louisiana last Wednesday by police . Police believe Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured, shot dead Mr Rogers, right before attempting to take his own life . Mr Rogers was found beside his lover and son-in-law Mathew Hodgkinson who was critically injured . Detectives believe Hodgkinson wrote a suicide note, pictured, which is undergoing forensic investigation . Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi said his officers want to question Hodgkinson but medics have told him the situation is 'grim'. He said: 'They originally told me the next 48 to 72 hours would be very important and there being no change (in his condition) is not a good sign. 'At this time it looks grim that we would ever have the chance to arrest him. 'I am going to meet with my investigators on Tuesday morning and see which direction we are going in.' It is understood that Hodgkinson had testified at a Grand Jury in Baton Rouge before he went home to Rogers. Hodgkinson's wife, Kimmy Ann Scott Rogers, who is also Rogers' biological daughter, was testifying to the Grand Jury at the time of her father's murder. Investigators believe that Hodgkinson married his daughter so he would not be deported from the United States and continued his affair with the 52-year-old former dance teacher. Hodgkinson is currently being treated in Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital where his condition is described as critical. He is understood to have suffered a life-threatening brain injury. Sheriff Stassi said his investigators were looking into the circumstances of Rogers' departure from the UK after he was cleared of child-sex allegations. Scott Rogers, pictured, left the UK and attempted to rebuild his life after being cleared of child sex allegations in 1993 . These allegations were never revealed to US authorities when he was in the process of fostering two children. Rogers had already adopted a ten-year-old boy and was in the process of fostering a two-year-old child when authorities were made aware of Rogers' past problems. According to Sheriff Stasi: 'The noose was tightening. That’s why the other guy (the third man in the house) said they had talked about a potential group suicide. 'He decided that wasn’t the way his life was going to end.' Hodgkinson survived the suicide attempt and is in a coma. He was a former student of Rogers' in the U.K. and his lover, and he had married Rogers' daughter Kimmy in order to be able to stay in the U.S., WBRZ reported. Rogers, who was well-known locally as the host of the feel-good weekend show 'Around Town', was found dead under covers in bed. Beside him was a suicide note apparently written by Hodgkinson, reading: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' The note was an apparent reference to troubles they had been experiencing with authorities in regards to Rogers' children earlier this month. He was under investigation for fraud and the state had taken custody of his two kids - a 10-year-old adopted son and a two-year-old boy he was in the process of adopting - The Advocate reported. His show had also been canceled on Monday, WBRZ reported. Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi told the Times-Picayune that the marriage between Hodgkinson and Rogers' daughter was a sham to keep him in the country. She was reportedly testifying before a federal grand jury when her father was killed. As a result, Stassi said Rogers' home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several weeks. 'It looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide,' Stassi said. 'It's been topsy-turvy at this residence... We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it culminated in this.' Rogers had been involved in three child molestation cases before he moved to the U.S. in the 90s, Stassi said. He was cleared in one, but two others are still pending overseas, he said. 'There were some other accusations that come up that were not totally resolved when he left England,' Stassi told WBRZ. 'I think the past history was catching up.' Rogers, then known as Richard Scott-Rogers, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983. Rogers had founded the Acadamy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . The school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children to the school. On Thursday two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that Scott Rogers had sexually abused them as young boys in the UK. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been intimately involved with Rogers from the age of 13. He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he was 18. The other alleged victim described him as a 'monster'. Rogers, was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993, according to the Bury Free Press. Parents told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags'. In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993. In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult'. It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.' At the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television. 'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.'","Scott Rogers, 52, was cleared of child sex abuse allegations in the UK .

"Mercedes-Benz is at the centre of a row over safety standards after the discovery of an electrical fault that causes wiring in the boot of some saloons to burn out. After receiving more than 400 complaints, including five reported boot fires, America’s motoring safety watchdog ordered the firm to recall cars deemed to be at risk, warning that the fault could ‘increase the risk of a crash’. The problem has led to the recall of more than 250,000 cars in the United States. The US motoring watchdog has ordered Mercedes to recall C-Class cars made between 2008 and 2011 after five reported boot fires - but no safety warning has been issued in the UK (file picture) But no official warning has been issued by Britain’s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) to the estimated 50,000 motorists who may be affected. The problem affects cars built between 2008 and 2011 in the C-Class range, which would have cost up to £30,000. In Britain, the cost of repairing the fault would be about £500. Dr Zafar Khan, from Banstead, Surrey, said C-Class owners like him had been left in the dark, adding: ‘No explanation has been given for the anomaly over the way matters are dealt with here and in the United States. Last night Mercedes-Benz confirmed that British models had the same fault as US cars, but a spokesman said: ‘Investigations consistently found that a recall is not required under UK standards.’ The DVSA said: ‘The manufacturers are working closely with customers affected by this issue.’ Two weeks ago the company was forced to recall more than 8,000 C-Class saloons because of a steering wheel fault.

MI5 had been monitoring the two fanatics responsible for the slaughter of a young soldier near Woolwich barracks for eight years. The Security Service is facing an inquiry by MPs amid a raft of devastating revelations about the killers’ known links to Islamist extremism. One of the pair – Michael Adebolajo – was so high profile he was photographed outside Paddington Green police station six years ago behind notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary. He was even intercepted by officials as he attempted to travel to Somalia to fight alongside Islamist terrorists last year. It also emerged that Adebolajo was a violent ex-prisoner who was a member of a banned terrorist group. Incredibly, he was said to have been preaching jihad on the streets of Woolwich earlier this week, only a few hundred yards from where 25-year-old Army Drummer Lee Rigby – a married father – was beheaded. As MI5 faced accusations that they let the men slip through the net, David Cameron ordered a full intelligence review by a Westminster committee. On a dramatic day: . Previously: Michael Adebolajo was in a group of Muslim extremists who fought with police outside the Old Bailey in 2006. He had been arguing that he had the right to 'behead those who insult Islam' Terror suspect: Anjem Choudary (right) claimed that this is him pictured with Michael Adebolajo, 28, (circled) at an Islamist demonstration in London in 2007 . Police chiefs described the counter terrorism investigation, one of the largest in recent history, as ‘complex and fast-moving’. Adeolajo, 28, and his friend remained under armed guard in separate hospitals being treated for gunshot wounds. They are expected to recover fully. The second suspect was reported last night by news outlets including Channel 4 News and The Times to be Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London. The victim was named yesterday as Drummer Rigby, a veteran of the Afghanistan war who has a two-year-old son. Father of a son: The victim was named yesterday as Drummer Lee Rigby, a veteran of the Afghanistan war . Much missed: Lee Rigby's friends, families and colleagues have paid tribute to the 'bubbly' character they loved . The . young soldier was run over and hacked to death with a meat cleaver and . knives near his barracks in Woolwich, South East London. Minutes . later the two Islamists were gunned down by firearms officers after . charging towards them in an apparent attempt to kill themselves. The . atrocity triggered a wave of national revulsion as the Prime Minster . branded it an attack on the British way of life and a ‘betrayal of . Islam’. Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Lee Rigby in this car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers. The streak of blood in front of the car shows how they dragged his body into the street . After the killing: Michael Adebolajo, 28, pictured on Wednesday, once served a jail sentence for violence . Angels of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, and her mother Amanda (right) talk to Adebolajo while Ingrid Loyau-Kennett (left) talks to the Adebowale as Lee Rigby lies dead in the road .

He added: ‘This country will be . absolutely resolute in its stand against violent extremism and terror. We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms.’ The list of questions faced by the authorities was growing fast as evidence of the danger the two men posed to Britain grew. Sources said both men featured in ‘a number’ of counter terrorism investigations in recent years but were not seen as a ‘threat to life’. Yet Adebolajo, who was born in South London but is of Nigerian descent, was linked to Choudary as long ago as 2003. The . former fitness instructor is believed to have been a member of Al . Muhajiroun, which was led by the hate preacher until it was banned by . the Government. British citizen: The second attacker was named last night in reports as Michael Adebowale, 22 . Sticken: The two alleged terrorists were filmed a the drama as it unfolded on camera phones before witnesses were shepherded away by officers . Picture: This image was the first to emerge on Twitter, showing people close to the soldier's dead body while police hang over the men they have just shot, the same street as today's stabbing . Aftermath: The men waited for 20 minutes saying they wanted to shoot the police, but were gunned down themselves and are shown here being detained . Hovering: An air ambluance comes into land on Woolwich's  Wellington Street as crowds gather at the scene of the murder . He was jailed at least once for . violence and friends said he was a member of a gang of knife-wielding . street robbers in his hometown of Romford, Essex.

Footage showed him standing directly behind Choudary during a protest outside Paddington Green police station in April 2007. It . is believed he may have also been held by the Met in 2006 after . protesting outside the Old Bailey during the trial of four Muslim men. The . defendants were ultimately jailed for their part in protests at the . Danish embassy in London against cartoons satirising the Prophet . Muhammad. Tearful: A mourner is overcome as he surveys the field of flowers that has been laid in Woolwich in recent days . Tributes: A group of mothers and their children head to the Bararcks to leave flowers and messages for the dead soldier, who also had a son, two . Sad: Bouquets and wreaths are being left along the street and tied to teh railings close to where Lee Rigby died .

Message: A handwritten note was also left by one member of the public left distraught by what happened to the murdered man Lee Rigby . Attached to a bunch of white roses, the neatly written note is from a person who didn't know the victim but felt moved to visit where he died . Men linked to Al Muhajiroun gathered outside the high security police station after Muslim convert Abu Izzadeen was arrested for inciting terrorism. Unbelievably, it is also claimed he was intercepted by police as he attempted to travel to Somalia last year to fight jihad. Sources said Adebolajo wanted to join Al-Shabaab, a notorious Al Qaeda affiliate responsible for terrorising the region. The 28-year-old was seen as recently as . last week wearing white robes and a cap as he preached outside a branch . of Poundland in Woolwich. Delicate: A forensic officers examine a revolver at the scene and places it in a protective box pistol close to Woolwich Barracks . Forensic approach: A team of police comb over grass and a brick wall for evidence to be used in this shocking murder case . Police have guarded the area where Lee Rigby was killed for at least 48 hours as they investigate exactly what happened . Residents said the former University of Greenwich student was handing out leaflets encouraging locals to support rebels in Syria. The second attacker, named last night in reports as Michael Adebowale, 22, is believed to have been born in Nigeria before becoming a naturalised British citizen. 'This is going to be a big blow to the new director of MI5, who has only been in the job for a couple of weeks' Professor Anthony Glees, University of Buckingham . A woman believed to be his girlfriend was arrested during a raid at his home in a block of council flats in Woolwich. Security officials are currently monitoring more than 2,000 suspects and sources point out they must target their resources on the fanatics considered to pose the greatest danger. They also say MI5’s resources have been dramatically increased since the July 7 bombings which has meant the number of suspects crossing the ‘radar’ of surveillance teams has itself soared.

"A white homeowner who gunned down an unarmed 19-year-old black woman on his porch last year has been sentenced to at least 17 years in prison. Theodore Wafer was convicted of second-degree murder in August for killing Renisha McBride outside his home in Dearborn Heights in Detroit, Michigan home in the early hours of November 2. Before getting his sentence, 55-year-old Wafer apologized to McBride's family, saying he killed a woman who was 'too young to leave this world'. 'I apologize from the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry for your loss and I can only hope and pray that somehow you can forgive me,' Wafer said, pausing to control his emotions. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Theodore Wafer is led from the courtroom on Wednesday after he was sentenced to 17 years for shooting a teenager on his porch last year. He was convicted of second-degree murder last month . Sadness: Jasmine McBride, 23, the sister of 19-year-old victim Renisha, McBride reads an impact statement before the court during the sentencing on Wednesday. Wafer apologized to the family in court . 'From my . fear, I caused the loss of a life that was too young to leave this world . and for that I'll carry that guilt and sorrow forever.' In response, Judge Dana Margaret Hathaway, called it 'one of the saddest cases' she's heard. 'I am . confident that if you weren't going to prison today, you would never . commit another crime,' she said. 'I . fully recognize that you did not bring these circumstances to your . doorstep. They arrived there. But once you did, you made the choices . that brought you here today.' Wafer was convicted last month after a nine-day trial that centered on whether he had a reasonable and honest belief that his safety was in peril. Gunned down: Renisha McBride, 19, was shot dead on Wafer's porch after she crashed her car nearby and banged on his front door in the early hours of the morning. The jury did not believe he was in danger . Relief: Walter Simmons, the victim's father, said outside court that he was happy with the sentence . Decisions: Judge Dana Hathaway said in court on Wednesday that she believes Wafer would never commit another crime if he were freed but that he made the wrong choices that fateful morning . He . testified that he was awakened by pounding on his doors and shot McBride . - who was found to be extremely drunk - because he feared for his life. But a jury rejected his claim of self-defense. Wafer . is white and McBride was black, and some wondered whether race may have . been a factor, likening it to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon . Martin - but race was hardly mentioned at the trial. Prosecutors . recommended at least 17 years in prison for Wafer, including two years . for unlawful use of a gun. Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter asked for . as few as six years in prison. Noting Wafer's age, Carpenter said at the hearing Wednesday that anything more than 10 years in prison would be a 'life sentence'. After the sentencing, McBride's sister, Jasmine, told NBC: 'I'm very happy. I believe justice was served and I believe my sister can rest peacefully now.' Emotional: Monica McBride, the mother of the victim, is pictured crying during the guilty verdict last month . No one knows why McBride ended up at Wafer's home about 4.30am, although prosecutors speculated she may have been seeking help. She had crashed her car into a parked car about a half-mile away in Detroit around 1am. An autopsy found she was extremely drunk. Wafer opened the front door and shot McBride in the face, firing through a screen door. He first suggested to police that it was an accident but later admitted to intentionally pulling the trigger. The jury convicted Wafer of murder, manslaughter and a gun-related charge on August 7. He will be eligible for parole after serving the minimum sentence.","Theodore Wafer, 55, was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Renisha McBride, who was killed on November 2 last year .

"Meteoric rise: Model Jourdan Dunn raked in £2.4 million in the past year alone from Burberry and becoming the face of Maybelline cosmetics . As she strutted down the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in California last week, pausing to pose artfully for photographers, Jourdan Dunn looked every inch the supermodel. Showing off her willowy frame in a black bandeau and long skirt by French designer Balmain, on Sunday the 24-year-old mingled with the likes of Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé, eclipsing both with one dazzling smile. Feted as one of the most beautiful women on the planet — that rare combination of feminine elegance and cool — she seemed perfectly at ease in such celebrated company. Then so she should. Her name may not yet be as globally famous as theirs, but Forbes Magazine has just made Jourdan the first black British woman to gain a place on its list of the world’s highest-earning models. She raked in £2.4 million in the past year alone, working for the likes of Burberry and becoming the face of Maybelline cosmetics. Her high-flying career has seen her model for every major fashion house, appear on numerous Vogue covers and appear in catwalk shows from Christian Dior to Victoria’s Secret. It has earned her a bevy of celebrity friends, including model of the moment Cara Delevingne, as well as singer Rita Ora, not to mention a jet-setting lifestyle and an army of fans who follow her every word on Twitter. A gilded existence indeed, but Jourdan’s ascendency has not been quite as smooth as her polished appearance might suggest. The great-granddaughter of Jamaican immigrants who came to Britain in the early Sixties in search of a better life, she comes from a long line of strong, independent women often let down by the men in their lives. She was raised in Greenford, West London, by a single mother who took on three jobs to make ends meet after Jourdan’s father left the family home when she was a toddler. Jourdan then became a single mother herself after becoming pregnant at 18, just as her modelling career was taking off. Her son Riley, now four, was born in 2009 with sickle cell anaemia, a blood disorder he inherited from Jourdan and her then boyfriend, Jordan Cummings. If that wasn’t enough to cope with, Cummings was arrested (and later jailed) for drugs offences two months after the baby’s birth. A tumultuous young life, then, but a family friend told the Mail that the Dunn family are ‘incredibly strong’. Scroll down for video . Jourdan Dunn looked every inch the supermodel as she strutted down the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in California last week . ‘You don’t mess about with any of them,’ he said. ‘If you do, it’s like fooling around with a hornet’s nest. They are very loyal and they look after each other. They’re survivors, particularly the women. Right from the moment the Dunn family arrived in this country, they were aspirational.’ If proof were needed of just how far the Dunn family has come since leaving the parish of St Thomas in Jamaica in the early Sixties, a trip to the gritty streets of Harlesden in North-West London would provide it. There, outside Tavistock Community Centre in July, a small blue heritage plaque was unveiled to The Cimarons, the UK’s first home-grown reggae band, which performed on Top Of The Pops, sang with Bob Marley and was, for a time, managed by Paul McCartney. Among the five-strong group, which still occasionally performs together, is Jourdan’s grandfather, bassist Franklyn Dunn. On the day the plaque was unveiled, Jourdan was jetting to New York for her latest assignment. Somehow, you imagine Franklyn would understand her not being there. For Jourdan’s career has been the epitome of glamour, in direct contrast to her unstarry upbringing. Her father, accounts clerk Rodney Alveranga, who was 21 when she was born, left the family home when his daughter was just three and has since remarried and started a new family. Determined to support Jourdan and her two younger brothers, Antoine, now 21, and 17-year-old Kain, her mother Dee juggled three jobs as a receptionist and secretary while raising her children. Family: She became pregnant at 18 just as her modelling career kicked off. Riley (pictured in 2012) is now four . Dee’s mother Cynthia, who knew from bitter experience how hard it was to be a single mother, also stepped in to help with her grandchildren. This loving but austere lifestyle might have gone on unbroken if Jourdan hadn’t caught the eye of a talent scout in the Hammersmith branch of Primark nine years ago. Even as a 15-year-old schoolgirl, her looks were striking. At 5ft 10in tall, she towered over most of her contemporaries at Acton High School in West London and yet as a young teen, she claims to have been self-conscious about her skinny frame. ‘I’d look in the mirror and hate myself. I thought I was disgusting,’ she said a year ago. Yet it took only moments for the representative from Storm, one of the most famous modelling agencies in the world, to see she was a star in the making. A meeting at the agency’s London offices with her mother resulted in a signed contract. A year later, in 2007, Jourdan made her catwalk debut at New York Fashion Week. In 2008, she made headline news at London Fashion Week when she spoke about the issue of colour in the fashion world, saying: ‘London’s not a white city, so why should our catwalks be so white?’ Just weeks later, she became the first black woman to model for Prada since Naomi Campbell in 1997. A few months after that, she was named model of the year at the British Fashion Awards. And now Dunn has gone on to achieve what Naomi Campbell, Britain’s first black supermodel, could not, in part because Forbes invented the models rich list in 2006 after the peak of Campbell’s success. But back in 2009, having only just made a name for herself, Jourdan saw her brief modelling career flash before her eyes when she became pregnant. The father, Jordan Cummings, a teenager from Islington in North London whom she had been dating for several years, was hardly the kind of man to offer a stable future. Given what her own mother, Dee, had gone through as a single mother, Jourdan was worried about breaking the news after taking a pregnancy test in a toilet cubicle at Heathrow Airport en route to Jamaica with her mother and brothers. ‘It was the worst plane trip ever. It was very emotional telling my mum, very emotional. It was one of the hardest things of my life. She had me young, she was blaming herself, she was very angry, she was upset.’ Journey: The father, Jordan Cummings, was arrested and jailed shortly after Riley's birth. They are no longer together but stay in contact for the sake of their son, while Jourdan fulfills her dream of being a top model . Jourdan knew she was a carrier for sickle-cell anaemia, which can have life-threatening complications, and when doctors told her the child had, indeed, inherited the disorder, she was determined to maintain a strong front. Seven months pregnant in 2009, she proudly strutted down the catwalk for Jean Paul Gaultier, but later admitted feeling ‘so guilty and so horrible inside’. The arrest of Cummings just weeks after Riley’s birth made matters even more stressful. In February 2010, he was jailed for three-and-a-half years for possessing cocaine with intent to supply. The pair are no longer together, though 24-year-old Cummings’ mother, Jenny Hobart, told the Mail this week that they keep in contact for the sake of their son. It was Jourdan’s mother who came to her rescue, offering to care for the child while she fulfilled her modelling assignments. Within ten weeks of Riley’s birth, she was back at work, picking up her meteoric career where she had briefly left off. She said: ‘I have seen that doing this can help him and give him a better start in life. I’m doing it for him.’ As a young, black woman making her way in an industry dominated by white models, her achievement is remarkable. This week when a Twitter follower pointed out that British Vogue hadn’t put an individual black model on its cover since 2002 and called for them to rectify that with Jourdan, the model furiously replied: ‘So, if British Vogue puts me on the cover now it would be because they were bullied into it, not because I’m deserving of one . . .’ Her appearance on the Forbes models rich list may well suggest a sea change in attitudes within the fashion industry, but having battled to come so far, Jourdan Dunn is clearly determined to be seen as a force in her own right.","Jourdan Dunn, 24, fell pregnant at 18 just as she started modelling .

"South Korea is to introduce a blazing fast 5G mobile internet service, quick enough to download a full length feature film in less than a second. While most of the world has yet to experience the improvements offered by 4G services, the technologically advanced country  has announced a  £900million (1.6 trillion won) in its successor. South Korea's science ministry said it aims to implement the technology, which is about 1,000 times faster than the 4G, within six years. Speedy: South Korea are investing £900million into 5G wireless internet services capable of downloading an entire film in a single second . 5G will allow users to . download a 800-megabyte movie file in one second, compared with 40 . seconds using 4G, the science ministry said, adding that such speeds . would help South Korean firms win overseas deals. A . ministry spokesman said: 'We helped fuel national growth with 2G . services in the 1990s, 3G in the 2000s and 4G around 2010. Now it is . time to take preemptive action to develop 5G.' 'Countries . in Europe, China and the US are making aggressive efforts to develop 5G . technology ... and we believe there will be fierce competition in this . market in a few years,' it said. Under the roadmap, a trial 5G service will be rolled out in 2017 and a fully commercial service in December 2020. Priority . will be given to developing key features for the new network, including . Ultra-HD and hologram transmission as well as cutting-edge social . networking services. Related . industries will be able to rack up sales of 5G-related devices and . infrastructure equipment worth 331 trillion won from 2020 to 2026, the . ministry estimated. The . government hopes to implement the plan with investment and cooperation . from operators such as SK Telecom and Korea Telecom as well as handset . makers like Samsung and LG. It . also aims to expand the telecom infrastructure equipment industry, . which is relatively weaker than the mighty mobile device sector. Led by Samsung - the world's top handset maker - South Korea has a leading 30-percent stake in the global mobile device market. 'But the (telecom) infrastructure . equipment industry has only a 4.4 percent share in the global market, . with exports very limited,' the ministry said. Chinese . equipment makers including Huawei have expanded their presence in the . global market from 12 percent in 2007 to 26 percent in 2012. Huawei . announced in November that it was looking at a 5G commercial rollout by . 2020, with a minimum investment of $600 million to develop the . technology. Seoul intends . to take up to a 20 percent stake in the world's telecom infrastructure . equipment market by 2020, according to the ministry. South Korea's science ministry said it aims to implement the technology, which is about 1,000 times faster than the 4G, within six years . New opportunities South Korea is renowned for being at the forefront of internet technology with broadband speeds that consistently out-pace those in Europe or the United States. Officials said the new service would also mean people on bullet trains running faster than 500 kilometres (310 miles) an hour would even be able to access the Internet, compared with 300 kph currently. 'Bullet trains around the world keep getting faster, with some in China running as fast as 500 and 600 kilometres per hour,' said one ministry official who declined to be named. 'If we have the technology to allow fast Internet access in these trains, it can open new opportunities for us globally,' he said. Samsung Electronics announced back in May that it had successfully tested 5G technology, managing data transmission of more than one gigabyte per second over a distance of two kilometres. Samsung said it had found a way to harness millimetre-wave bands which have proved to be a sticking point for the mobile industry to date. The test used 64 antenna elements, which the tech titan said overcame the issue of 'unfavourable propagation characteristics' that have prevented data travelling across long distances using the bands. However, it made clear that the technology would not be available commercially before the end of the decade.","South Korea is now investing £900million in 5G services .

"Like any proud Welshwomen, they wanted to celebrate St David’s Day. But when these friends arrived at Harrods in national costume, the celebrations came to an abrupt end. Their outfits of tall black hats, red skirts and white aprons apparently didn’t meet the dress code of the exclusive London store. The Welsh women were celebrating St David's Day in London, but were refused entry to top department store Harrods because of their traditional dress . Out for a fun time: The group said they were smartly dressed and well behaved on their national day . A uniformed woman security officer told them: ‘You can’t come in here dressed like that.’ The group, including a doctor, an NHS manager, a lawyer and a fashion designer, had spent £200 on their traditional costumes to make sure March 1 – the day the Welsh honour their patron saint St David – was one to remember. They were on a weekend theatre trip to London from their homes in Bridgend, South Wales, and a trip to the Harrods champagne bar was on their itinerary. Yesterday Harrods apologised for the blunder, and pointed out that the women were allowed in after security checks. The six travelled from Bridgend, South Wales, to London for a theatre break weekend - and said everyone enjoyed their festive costumes . It was only when the women protested that they were being racially discriminated against that the store backed down . Trip organiser Gaynor Newton, 56, said: ‘We were gobsmacked – we were smartly dressed and well behaved on our national day. ‘The first woman security officer who stopped us was quite rude and just said we could not enter the store because we were in our national costume. As we stood there an Asian woman in a sari and an African woman in lovely colourful robes both entered the store without a problem. ‘Everywhere we went people were happy to see us and wanted their photographs taken with us, until we got to Harrods where we were shocked by the way the staff treated us.’ The women were eventually let in but say they were shocked by the way they were treated . It was only when the women protested that they were being racially discriminated against that staff backed down. Knitwear designer Denise Evans, 50, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it – would they stop a Scotsman from entering Harrods in his kilt? I don’t think so.’ Harrods yesterday apologised, saying it was a misunderstanding. ‘The security guard asked for the group to wait while she double-checked it was in keeping with our dress code,’ a spokesman said. ‘The women didn’t want to wait and went to another entrance where they were admitted, as by that time the security team were aware they were wearing national dress. ‘We certainly did not deny them entry and always welcome all  visitors in national costume. We apologise for any confusion.’ Harrods today apologised saying it was a misunderstanding and the women from Wales were welcome .","Security officer thought costumes clashed with store's dress code .

"British Gas is paying staff bonuses to inflate customers’ bills by up to 60 per cent, a whistleblower has claimed. The former employee said he felt ‘disgusted’ by the policy, which encouraged staff to target charities and small businesses and sell them the most expensive deals possible. Employees were told they could triple their £14,600 salary through commission if they sold the highest-priced tariffs to enough customers. Churches and charities – including the Scouts – were among those targeted by the policy, the whistleblower said, with some organisations ending up £2,000 a year worse off. British Gas is paying staff bonuses to inflate customers' bills by up to 60 per cent, a whistleblower has claimed . Last night, energy regulator Ofgem said it would examine the evidence uncovered by the Mail and take ‘firm action’ if it found British Gas had not been ‘honest and transparent’ with its customers. The former sales worker, who asked not to be named, said he witnessed sales agents on a ‘regular basis’ signing up churches and charities to long-term contracts at the maximum price in order to earn a higher salary. Smaller businesses and charities tended to fall for the tactic because they had fewer resources to research the best deal, he said. The whistleblower, who worked for British Gas between 2010 and 2013, said its policies had been engineered to ‘rip off’ customers – and he believed the practice was continuing today. His revelations come just days after the company was fined £5.6 million for blocking business customers from switching suppliers. ‘People were desperate to make the salaries they had been promised, so everyone inflated the prices,’ he said. ‘Scouts was a favourite one; churches, charities, small businesses, where people would just go for the maximum 5p notch-up,’ he added. By switching to the most expensive deal, a company’s bill could increase by more than £2,000 a year. ‘For a small business, that kind of price increase could be enough to finish you off,’ he said. A sales representative would normally make between £4 and £37 in commission per deal if they managed to persuade existing customers to renew contracts or add more properties to their accounts. But if they managed to move the customer to a more expensive deal – known as ‘notching up’ – they could earn more than £400 a time. The ex-sales agent said most employees felt guilty notching up bills, but others thrived on it – and made up to £80,000 a year. ‘Some people were quite proud about notching up the unit rates,’ he said. ‘I felt guilty. I didn’t do it that often. But there were plenty of people there who had no guilt whatsoever. ‘They were doing it for the big bucks because they were greedy.’ The former employee said the words ‘Volume to value’ were painted on the walls of the company’s call centre in Leicester to encourage staff to target customers worth more to the business – in other words paying more, or higher, bills – rather than seeking a greater number of customers. The whistleblower’s own method of ‘cheating the system’ was to notch up customers who had empty buildings. These customers wanted the cheapest standing charge and weren’t affected by notched-up unit rates because they used very little energy. He said: ‘That meant I got the commission, but the customer didn’t actually pay more. ‘The company had a lot of people off with stress on the sales floor, and it was partly linked to sales targets but partly linked to what you had to do to make your money.’ The whistleblower said the former managing director of British Gas, Phil Bentley, was made aware of the practice by staff. But he suggested customers would eventually benefit from rip-off deals because their rates were fixed and energy prices would get even higher still over time. Clients who contacted British Gas to . renew contracts or add properties to their accounts were called ‘hot . leads’ and passed on to the sales department. Customers often called . the company when their contracts were rolled over. If customers failed . to notice their tariff was due to expire, they would automatically be . put on to a much higher rate. This meant call centre staff were able to . offer them rates a fraction lower than the  rollover rate but still up . to 60 per cent higher than the best deal. British Gas stopped the . practice of automatic rollovers in July last year. For selling energy . to customers at the base rate, which was 8p in 2010 and rose to 13p by . 2013, sales agents would earn between £4 and £37 per deal. For inflating . the prices by up to a maximum of 5p per unit of energy, they earned . between £93 and £403 per deal. But customers could lose thousands. A . low user using 6,000Kw a year would have paid £480 at the base rate in . 2010. With a 5p notch-up, this would increase to £780 a year. The bill . for a medium user (18,000Kw a year) would have risen from £1,440 to . £2,340, and a high user using 45,000Kw a year would have been billed . £5,850, instead of £3,600 at the base rate. No action has been taken to change the commission structures. ‘Over . three years I flagged it up ten times,’ he said. ‘I just gave up in the . end – I didn’t get anywhere. I felt I was in a precarious position . anyway. Everyone there was made to feel they should be grateful for . their jobs.’ A not-for-profit tariff existed for charities, but according to the ex-sales agent this rate was ‘never’ used because staff members did not know what commission they would get and the tariff was actually worse value than the standard rate. In October, British Gas announced it was increasing prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2 per cent. The increase put the average annual household bill up by £123. A spokesman for Ofgem said: ‘There are strict rules in place which require suppliers to take all reasonable steps to ensure information provided is complete and accurate, understandable and not misleading, and that sales activities are conducted in a fair, honest, transparent and professional manner. ‘We welcome the information the Daily Mail has given us. We would encourage anyone with information that an energy company is not complying with Ofgem rules to provide us with this.’ British Gas Business managing director Stephen Beynon, said: ‘We strongly refute any suggestion that business contracts have been negotiated inappropriately. This is a highly regulated market, and every part of the sales negotiation process is closely monitored. ‘Sales agents do receive commission, but we are reducing its importance. We’re leading the way in addressing the variability in price that customers face in this market, and we’ll continue to do so.’ He added: ‘We take very seriously any concerns raised by employees or customers, and our processes, as well as sales agents’ terms, are regularly reviewed to ensure they are fair and appropriate.’","Whistleblower revealed staff are encouraged to sell most expensive deals .

"Injured Manchester United defender Luke Shaw was spotted out for dinner with his friends on Saturday, just hours after his United team-mates failed to score against newly-promoted Burnley at Turf Moor. The 19-year-old England international was spotted coming out of the swanky San Carlo restaurant at 11pm  - the same venue new signing Angel di Maria was seen at earlier in the week. Shaw's fitness was questioned by new United manager Louis van Gaal on the club's pre-season tour of the USA, and he has been working hard to recover from a hamstring injury. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal discuss another poor result for United . Attention: Shaw held his hands in front of his face as he left the swanky San Carlo restaurant at 11pm . Van Gaal has since stuck up for the youngster though, especially after national team manager Roy Hodgson admitted he would be happy for the Dutchman to get Shaw fitter. 'Roy Hodgson cannot judge at this moment,' Van Gaal said. 'I have never seen him here at a United training session. 'In the United States I said to Luke, 'you came here and you were not fit'. I changed his programme and he did everything that he had to do to be fit. 'Now he is an example in the dressing room. He is training fantastically.' Out and about: Shaw (left) with his friend in tow, on their way to a bar in Manchester's city centre . Injured: Shaw has been out with a hamstring injury since August 13, but is recovering well . San Carlo: Angel di Maria was spotted at the same restaurant earlier in the week . United's start to the season has been less than impressive, with Van Gaal's side still yet to pick up a win after three matches. Shaw has been sidelined since picking up a training injury on 13 August, but is expected to make his competitive debut for the Red Devils after the international break. The camera-shy Shaw, pictured below, was snapped heading from San Carlo to another bar in Manchester with a friend in tow.

"Police officers in Ferguson have begun wearing body cameras in an effort to restore trust in the force after the shooting of unarmed teenager Mike Brown. Officers have been equipped with the cameras after two private companies, Safety Vision and Digital Ally, donated more than 50 of them last week. Officials say officers first wore the cameras at a protest on Saturday, and captured images of protesters taunting officers. Police officers in Ferguson have begun wearing body cameras following the shooting of Mike Brown (pictured, officer and journalist are recorded using the cameras) Officer Morris Parish from the Lake Forest Police Department (pictured) has voluntarily been wearing a camera for months, and says it has helped overturn a made-up claim against him . Officers in Ferguson are now wearing the cameras (pictured) after two private companies donated more than 50 of them to the police force following three weeks of protests there . Police first wore the body cameras (pictured) during a protest in Ferguson on Saturday . Civil rights groups have been calling for the introduction of the cameras ever since black teenager Mike Brown was shot by white policeman Darren Wilson on August 9. After the incident police claimed Brown struggled with Wilson, causing the officer to fire his gun, while witnesses said Brown was in the process of surrendering when he was shot in the head and chest. The policy of equipping officers with cameras has the support of scores of law enforcement agencies and the American Civil Liberties Union. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the cameras have been well received by officers. Officers first recorded footage using the cameras on Saturday during more protests in Ferguson and say they recorded images of police being taunted by protesters (pictured) The move is part of a trust-building exercise by Ferguson police as they try to repair their reputation following the shooting of unarmed teenager Mike Brown . 'They are really enjoying them,' he said. 'They are trying to get used to using them.' Safety Vision, one of the companies which donated the cameras, said in a statement it had given the equipment over in the hopes that it could bring transparency to future investigations. 'The city of Ferguson has gone through an unfortunate series of events and Safety Vision body cameras and flashlight DVR will assist in capturing prima facie evidence for investigations involving vandalism, looting, and shots fired,' the statement said. The death of Mike Brown brought race relations between police and citizens in Ferguson to a head, sparking three weeks of protests that included nightly violence and stores being looted. Police responded with riot gear and moved in military equipment to try to quell the turmoil. A St. Louis County grand jury has begun hearing evidence about Brown's killing and the U.S. Justice Department has opened its own investigation. Ferguson police officer Dan Page (right) has been allowed to retire on a full pension despite being filmed pushing CNN anchor Don Lemon live on air two weeks ago . Page was suspended after a video of him giving a hate-filled speech at a meeting of a far-right group emerged, but has been allowed to retire as he had served for 35 years . Meanwhile a Ferguson police officer who caused outrage after pushing a CNN anchor live on air is set to retire on a full pension, it has been reported by MSNBC. Officer Dan Page drew national media coverage after repeatedly pushing and threatening to arrest CNN reporter Don Lemon during a live broadcast from Ferguson two weeks ago. A video then emerged of Page speaking at a meeting of a far-right group, calling black people 'little perverts', ranting against Muslims and gays, and branding Barack Obama and illegal immigrant. During the hour-long film Page, who was recorded brandishing a bible during a meeting of Oath Keepers, also ranted against women who have abortions and domestic abuse victims. Page was suspended while authorities investigated, but because he served the force for 35 years he was able to retire on a full pension and benefits.","Police officers wore cameras for the first time on Saturday during protest .

"Speculation about Apple’s smartwatch has been circulating for years but its reveal date is now being tipped for next Wednesday. However, those Apple fans anxious to get their hands, or wrists, on the device may be facing an expensive bill when it goes on sale in 2015. Reports from Recode claim Apple executives have discussed charging $400 for the upcoming device - a third more expensive than Samsung’s current high-end model. California-based firm Apple is rumoured to unveil its smartwatch at an event next week and reports now claim the so-called iWatch (concept pictured) could go on sale next year for $400 (£240). This would put it at the high-end of the smartwatch market . This would put Apple’s iWatch at the high-end of the smartwatch market - a strategy that mirrors the firm’s approach to its iPhone business. By comparison, Samsung’s Gear 2 costs $299.99 in the US (£249 in the UK) and the Moto 360 is expected to cost $249.99 (£149). Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5-inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Last week, Samsung launched its curved S watch, but didn’t announce how much it would cost. Apple’s biggest rival could be waiting to see how much the iWatch will cost, if it is unveiled next week, before setting its own price. Apple sent invites out for its upcoming launch event last week. Reports claimed at the time that the iWatch will be unveiled at this event, but won’t go on sale until 2015 to give developers time to write apps for the device. The iWatch is likely to run a modified version of the upcoming iOS 8 software, but the app size and functions will need to be different to accommodate the smaller screen, processing power and watch tools. Timex’s Ironman One GPS+ watch costs $400, but features its own 3G wireless connection, as does the Samsung S. This suggest Apple’s device could have a similar connection option. By comparison, Samsung’s Gear 2 (pictured left) costs $299.99 in the US (£249 in the UK) and the Moto 360 (pictured right) is expected to cost $249.99 (£250 in the UK) when it launches later this year . Apple has already hinted at the wearable in the latest update to its iOS software, which includes health tracking capabilities. Samsung's S watch (pictured) features its own 3G wireless connection. This suggest Apple’s device could have a similar connection option . 'The new device will, predictably, make good use of Apple’s HealthKit health and fitness platform,' Recode said . 'It will also - predictably - make good use of HomeKit, the company’s new framework for controlling connected devices - though it’s not clear how broadly or in what way.'

"Amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone  have been captured by an astronaut on the ISS. The incredible views of tropical cyclone Bansi were spotted in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius, when the ISS was east of Madagascar. The calm ‘eye’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling  clouds as it made its way across the ocean. An Italian astronaut on the ISS captured images of a cyclone on Earth. Tropical cyclone Bansi was spotted in the Indian Ocean by Esa's Samantha Cristoforetti while the ISS was east of Madagascar. The images show flashes of lighting illuminating the eye of the storm (shown) The images were taken by Italian European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti aboard the ISS earlier this month. Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that develop in the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere. They produce gale force winds of about 39mph (63km/h) on average and rotate in a clockwise direction. If the winds reach 73mph (118km/h), the system is called a severe tropical cyclone. The strongest winds are always near the eye, but damaging winds can extend hundreds of kilometres from the cyclone’s centre. Cyclones form in warm oceans when sea-surface temperature exceeds 26.5C and there are favourable wind conditions. They can persist for several days but lose their energy when they move over land or colder oceans, or are disrupted by another wind system. They show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye. According to Nasa, the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds. The low-light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast. ‘It looks like the storm is powering up some sort of weapon!’ said Phil Plate at Slate. One image also shows a thin green line over the horizon known as airglow, which occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun. The camera again accentuates this effect, which is an atmospheric phenomenon frequently seen by astronauts. Stars appear above the airglow layer, and the solar panels of a docked Russian spacecraft jut into the image. Tropical cyclone Bansi formed in the southwestern Indian Ocean on 11 January this year. By the time Cristoforetti's photos were taken, on the following day, Bansi had achieved tropical cyclone strength, with sustained maximum winds over 115 miles (185km) per hour. The cyclone would reach category 4 strength before becoming a weak extra-tropical system on 19 January.

"Law student Florence Sihombing could be facing jail time time over a social media post in which she complained about the service at a petrol station in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta. The postgraduate law student was arrested Saturday afternoon after complaining about the service she experienced at a petrol station. Ms Sihombings lawyer said the 26-year-old tried to bypass a long queue of scooters waiting for subsidised fuel by joining a queue for more expensive unsubsidised petrol, at which point she was refused service. Police claim Florence Sihombing 'incited hatred and defamation' with her offending social media post . The 26-year-old postgraduate law student was arrested after complaining about the service she experienced at a petrol station . Ms Sihombing then posted the following message on social media site Path: . 'Jogja is poor, stupid and uncultured. Friends in Jakarta and Bandung, please don't stay in Jogja.' A video of Ms Sihombing complaining was also posted online, attracting vast amounts of negative comments. A screenshot Sihombing's message preceded to go viral. After a barrage of complaints from locals, Yogyakarta police then arrested the 26-year-old student for allegedly breaching the Criminal Code and the 2008 Electronic Transactions and Information Law (ITE), inciting hatred and defamation, reports Jakarta Post.

Spokesperson for the Yogyakarta police Anny Pujastuti said Ms Sihombing could face six years in jail, while Ms Sihombing's lawyer argues the arrest was unlawful. The Indonesian government spends billions of dollars subsidising fuel. Limits on its availability last month caused long queues at some petrol stations across the country as people feared fuel may run out. President-elect Joko Widodo plans to phase out fuel subsidies, which is a controversial topic amongst locals. Attempts to remove fuel subsidies have resulted in civil unrest in the past.","Florence Sihombing, 26, was arrested after complaining about the service at an Indonesian petrol station .

"The date when the Earth’s atmosphere became oxygen-rich and suitable for life – known as The Great Oxidation Event –  was thought to have occurred around 2.4 billion years ago. But now geologists from Ireland and India have found evidence of an earlier short-lived oxidation event which took place 600 million years earlier. And they say their other research suggests the first oxygen-producing lifeforms began flourishing on Earth 60 million years earlier than first believed. Pictured is a sample of a 3.02 billion years ago ancient soil - or paleosol. Here, they found evidence of chemical weathering of rocks leading to soil formation that occurred in the presence of oxygen . They claim these lifeforms were responsible for adding oxygen to our atmosphere, which laid the foundations for more complex life to evolve. Scientists working in India found evidence of chemical weathering of rocks leading to soil formation that occurred in the presence of oxygen. Using the naturally occurring uranium-lead isotope decay system, which is used to determine the age of substances, geologists claim this took place at least 3.02 billion years ago. The pattern of chemical weathering preserved in the ancient soils - or paleosols - is compatible with higher atmospheric oxygen levels at that time, said scientists at Trinity College Dublin who worked alongside geologists at the Presidency University in Kolkata, India. The soil came from the Singhbhum Craton of Odisha (pictured), and was named the 'Keonjhar Paleosol' There was no oxygen in the atmosphere for hundreds of millions of years after the Earth formed. Today the Earth's atmosphere is 20 per cent oxygen thanks to photosynthetic bacteria which - like trees and other plants - consume carbon dioxide and release the gas. The bacteria laid the foundation for oxygen breathing organisms to evolve and inhabit the planet. The Great Oxygenation Event, also called the Oxygen Catastrophe or Oxygen Crisis or Great Oxidation, is the name given to the first appearance of free oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. The Great Oxidation Event was about 2.4 billion years ago, but some recent evidence from South Africa suggests there was a much earlier short-lived oxygen build-up in the atmosphere and shallow oceans at about 2.96 billion years ago.The latest study from India pushes this back even further to about 3.02 billion years ago. That is 60 million years than the recent estimate from South Africa and 600 million years earlier than the Great Oxidation Event. The soil came from the Singhbhum Craton of Odisha, and was named the 'Keonjhar Paleosol' after the nearest local town. These high oxygen levels could only have been produced by organisms that were capable of photosynthesis. 'This is a very exciting finding, which helps to fill a gap in our knowledge about the evolution of the early Earth,' said Professor Quentin Crowley at Trinity College, who led the study. 'This paleosol from India is telling us that there was a short-lived pulse of atmospheric oxygenation and this occurred considerably earlier than previously envisaged.' The early Earth was very different to what we see today. Our planet's early atmosphere was rich in methane and carbon dioxide and had only very low levels of oxygen. The widely accepted model for evolution of the atmosphere states that oxygen levels did not rise significantly until about 2.4 billion years ago. This 'Great Oxidation Event' event enriched the atmosphere and oceans with oxygen, and heralded one of the biggest shifts in evolutionary history. Micro-organisms were present before three billion years ago but they were not likely capable of producing oxygen by photosynthesis, scientists claim. Pictured is a simplified map of the southern part of the Singhbhum Craton in India. It shows the distribution of sediments overlying the Keonjhar Paleosol . Up until very recently however, it has been unclear if any oxygenation events occurred before the Great Oxidation Event and the argument for an evolutionary capability of photosynthesis has largely been based on the first signs of an oxygen build-up in the atmosphere and oceans. 'It is the rare examples from the rock record that provide glimpses of how rocks weathered,' added Professor Crowley. 'The chemical changes which occur during this weathering tell us something about the composition of the atmosphere at that time. 'Very few of these paleosols have been documented from a period of Earth's history prior to 2.5 billion years ago. 'The one we worked on is at least 3.02 billion years old, and it shows chemical evidence that weathering took place in an atmosphere with elevated oxygen levels.' There was virtually no atmospheric oxygen present 3.4 billion years ago, but recent work from South African paleosols suggested that by about 2.96 billion years ago oxygen levels may have begun to increase. Professor Crowley's finding moves the goalposts back at least 60 million years, which, given humans have only been on the planet for around a tenth of that time, is a significant change. There was virtually no atmospheric O2 present 3.4 billion years ago, but recent work from South African paleosols suggested that by about 2.96 billion years ago O2 levels may have begun to increase.

"The investigation into the death of a New Orleans stripper whose dismembered body was found in Mississippi is now being handled by Louisiana authorities. Authorities found the stabbed torso of Jaren Lockhart, 22, washed up in Mississippi's Hancock County in June 2012, NOLA reported at the time. Her decapitated head and parts of her legs were found in nearby Harrison County. Authorities were able to identify Lockhart based on her neck tattoos. Her fiance reported her missing after she did not return from a shift at a Bourbon Street club. Victim: Jaren Lockhart, 22, was found dismembered in June 2012 by Mississippi authorities . What happened? The 22-yaer-old mother, pictured, was reported missing after she did not return home from her shift as a New Orleans dancer on Bourbon Street . The investigation is now being handled by the Kenner police department and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office, Glenn Grannan, a lead investigator for Hancock County, told WAFB. 'The new information, from a circumstantial point, indicates a higher probability that the killing happened in Kenner,' Grannan said. 'The evidence was strong enough to convince the District Attorney, which is huge.' Terry . Speaks and Margaret Sanchez were the last two people to see Lockhart . alive. They were seen on surveillance video walking with Lockhart down a . street, NOLA reported in 2012. Released: Terry Speaks, left, and Margaret Sanchez, right, were both held by police before being released . The search continues: Kenner police and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office continue to investigate the death of Jaren Lockhart, pictured, who was found dismembered in June 2012 . Both were briefly held before they were released. Sanchez was released due to a lack of evidence, the Associated Press reports, and Speaks is currently in a New York prison for an unrelated charge. Grannan told the wire service that Sanchez has since moved from Louisiana and that Speaks was questioned several months ago. 'Turning it over to Kenner is the logical thing to do,' he said.

"Phil Neville has admitted working as a commentator is harder than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance during England's World Cup opener with Italy. Neville, a former player whose career included stints at Manchester United and Everton, was criticised for his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game. Many viewers took to Twitter to criticise him, with several joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville. Scroll down for video . The BBC has received hundreds of complaints about former England player Phil Neville's commentary . A BBC spokeswoman said there were 445 complaints after Saturday night’s game, which pulled in a peak audience of 15.6 million viewers. Neville, 37, told Radio 5 Live today: 'I think the biggest thing I learned is that co-commentary is harder than what I thought it was going to be. 'I welcome all the feedback you get and it's a welcome to the social media so you come in after a game you're hyped up, its just like playing doing a co-commentary, you're focused for 90 minutes, you turn your phone on and you’re getting some lovely messages. 'But I’m really looking forward to the game on Thursday, I’m back in the co-commentary booth and I will get better. It was my first live gig and I'm just glad I helped everybody sleep back home.' Neville, who said he 'really loved' working as a commentator, said: 'The feedback is [that] the content I put out was quite good, obviously the feedback is I need to show a little more excitement so I think you’ll see that on Thursday night.' Julie Neville has defended her husband, Phil, after his commentary of England's World Cup match with Italy was criticised as 'dull' and 'boring' by fans on Twitter . She told her 21,000 followers that Phil is 'good at talking' and tried to deflect attention onto the pitch . Fellow broadcaster Danny Baker was among his critics, but said the BBC should share the blame . He . said: 'Phil Neville has acknowledged he wasn't great during England . commentary. But what were the BBC doing giving him THAT game to ""learn . his craft""?' The BBC . said Neville, who has received broadcasting training, was 'an important, . well-respected member of our team' and would 'continue to play a key . role throughout the tournament'. His next appearance is expected to be as a studio guest for tonight's game between Iran and Nigeria. On Raheem Sterling: 'It's so important he takes that ball and dribbles it past those Italian midfielders.' On England: 'We want our players to be on the front foot tonight.' On Danny Welbeck miss: 'Danny will be disappointed that he didn't hit the target there.' Before the game: 'I always like looking at people in the warm-up, looking in their eyes.' On Gary Lewin's injury: 'Anything can happen when everyone jumps on top of one another.' The BBC revealed the number of complaints after Neville's wife, Julie, defended her husband on Twitter. The mother-of-two replied to one of the few fans praising her husband, posting: 'ha ha - he is good at talking!!' Tweeting during the game, she then tried to divert attention away from his voice and on to the football pitch, by adding: 'Nerve wracking watching this match though.' When the fan responded by saying the 'Neville brothers are taking over' and predicting an England win, she replied: 'We have everything crossed.' Julie, who runs her own healthy food . website, WinNaturally.com, and has written a book of 50 Top Tips for . Optimum Health, was praised on Twitter for putting up with her husband's . voice. After . England supporters spent nearly two hours listening to his co-commentary . on Saturday night, many suggested she deserves a medal. Wayne French tweeted: 'Dear Julie Neville, I'm putting you forward for an MBE. You deserve so much.' Another website user suggested she might find a health supplement to energise her husband's performance in the commentary box. Some fans linked physio Gary Lewin's injury to Neville's dull performance in the commentary box . Broadcaster Mary Ann Sieghart branded the former Everton midfielder's voice 'talking Temazepam' South Warwickshire police joined others on Twitter mocking BBC co-commentator Phil Neville . Despite also working for the BBC, comedian Danny Baker joined the backlash against the former player . Former Liverpool and Germany star Didi Hamann was among the stars criticising Neville's commentary . Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle also got in on the act, posting this joke to his 1.5million Twitter followers . The couple have been married for 14 years and have two children, a son Harvey, and daughter, Isabella. The . BBC has backed Neville and insisted he will remain in their commentary . team for the tournament, co-commentating on three more live games and . both for England's further group games for their highlights show. The . decision prompted comedian Alistair McGowan to comment this morning: . 'He won't be used for another full England game until the group stages . so we've probably heard the last of him.' Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues have been behind some the biggest controversies for the BBC. Clarkson saw the corporation receive nearly 5,000 complaints in 2011 when he said striking workers 'should be shot' on the One Show. The BBC was hit with more than 2,200 angry emails and phone calls earlier this year when viewers complained of 'mumbling' actors in costume drama Jamaica Inn. Following the European elections last month, the corporation got more than 1,000 complaints about giving too much prominence to Nigel Farage and his Ukip party. And political problems also struck last March when 600 viewers complained about presenter Eddie Mair's 'aggressive' grilling of Boris Johnson, during which the London mayor was branded 'a nasty piece of work'. Neville, providing co-commentary . alongside BBC regular Guy Mowbray, was compared by one viewer to the . computer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey during the game. He was even mocked by the police, with the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string of safety advice based on his disastrous performance. 'At least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a frenzy. Drink sensibly,' read one message, while another claimed officers 'will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep the streets all calm and sleepy'. Some fans asked whether it was possible to fire a commentator at half-time, while former Liverpool midfielder Didier Hamann wrote: 'If Phil Neville reads his Twitter feed he may not come out for the second half.' Neville seems to have taken the comments in good spirits. He tweeted last night: ‘Sometimes you have to take the criticism – it will only make me better. Thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!’","Fans panned ex-Everton midfielder's performance in commentary box .

"The Mr Bean and Blackadder star suffered a shoulder injury in the August 2011 crash but his McLaren F1 supercar took a year to recover at the hands of McLaren's technicians . His accident-prone alter ego Mr Bean is every insurer’s nightmare. But spare a thought for Rowan Atkinson’s real-life broker. The actor has successfully claimed £910,000 to fix his McLaren F1 supercar after destroying it in a crash – the highest repair bill ever recorded in Britain. Atkinson lost control of the 240mph car, thought to be worth more than £3million, in August 2011. After veering off a slippery section of the A605 near Peterborough, it hit a tree and burst into flames. But while the 58-year-old star escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, his vehicle – one of just 64 models in the world – did not escape so lightly. Most of the back of the car was destroyed while the 6.1litre engine ended up 20 yards away. Atkinson’s insurers spent nearly eight months considering the claim, before agreeing the massive payout. Now, after more than a year of specialist repairs at McLaren’s base in Woking, Surrey, it is as good as new. However, Atkinson, who is reportedly worth £71million, has not escaped scot-free. According to experts, the star’s car insurance premium will have risen to up to £60,000 a year as a result of the expensive crash. Ben Stagg, a senior client manager at specialist insurers RK Harrison, said: ‘It costs between £10-15,000 a year just to keep a McLaren F1 insured off-road in a garage. The McLaren F1 supercar was left as a mangled wreck after Rowan Atkinson crashed into a tree in August 2011. It was his second crash in the vehicle, which saw its 6.1 litre engine flung 20 yards away from the rest of it . Atkinson escaped the crash with a shoulder injury but the £910,000 repair bill was painful for the actor's insurers . The supercar, pictured after its August 2011 crash, is one of only 64 roadgoing McLaren F1s built by the British company . 'If you want to drive it - and it . seems Mr Atkinson drives his a lot - your premium could rise to between . £20-40,000 a year because of the added road risk. ‘Now he has crashed it, Mr Atkinson’s insurers may increase the premium by another 50 per cent. ‘They could also insert a limited mileage clause and increase his excess to around half the car’s  total value.’ Expensive: Atkinson, seen with his wife Sunetra, paid £634,500 for the maroon sports car in 1997, but has seen its value soar in recent years . The rare supercar, pictured before the August 2011 crash, can command up to £3.5 million thanks to its limited production of 64 cars . The six-figure payout for the actor's McLaren F1 is the highest insurance bill recorded in Britain . Playing Mr Bean, Atkinson drove a . clapped-out Mini. In real life, he uses his McLaren for commuting . between his Northamptonshire home and acting commitments in London, as . well as family holidays. Atkinson paid £634,500 for the maroon sports car in 1997, but has seen its value soar in recent years. Last year, one model sold for . £3.4million. By the time of the crash, he had recorded 38,000 miles on . the odometer. Atkinson said getting back in the driving seat after 16 . months was ‘like getting into a familiar sweater’. He added: ‘It has . become part of my life. I hope to do 100,000 miles in it.’ The crash was Atkinson’s second accident in the supercar. In 1999, he ploughed it into the back of a Rover Metro. The £910,000 bill is three times as . much as the previous record payout for a repair. In 2010, Aviva paid . £300,000 to fix a Pagani Zonda test car. Cost new: £540,000 (Atkinson paid £640,000 for his in 1997) Value now: Up to £3.5 million . Engine: 6.1-litre V12 developing 627bhp . Acceleration: 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds; 0-100mph in 6.3 seconds . Top speed: 240mph . Seats: Three with driver centrally positioned .","Rowan Atkinson crashed his £3m McLaran F1 supercar into a tree in 2011 .

"A Russian schoolboy watched a drunk man walk onto a frozen lake and drown when he fell through the ice - but instead of trying to rescue him, he filmed the drama and strolled away.

Instead of rushing to help, the youngster carried on filming, hiding the camera as other people who were further away ran towards the lake.

But those who tried to come to his rescue arrived too late - the man had already vanished beneath the surface. Police recovered the body but have not yet identified the man.

"Recovering: Michael Schumacher could recover from his brain injury within three years, says a doctor who treated him just after his ski accident . A French doctor who treated Michael Schumacher after the F1 champ's ski accident has predicted a possible recovery within three years. Jean-Francois Payen, a doctor at the Grenoble hospital that treated Schumacher after his injury in December 2013, visited the Schumacher family at home in Switzerland. The 45-year-old is being treated at home after spending six months in a medically-induced coma following the accident in Meribel, France. Dr Payen, who cared for Schumacher for six months after the crash, said the former race car driver is no longer in a coma and is slowly getting better. 'Life after a head injury is punctuated by stages,' Payen told RTL radio on Thursday. He predicted a convalescence of one to three years. 'We hope, but we have to give him time.' It comes after Schumacher's 15-year-old son Mick earlier this month passed on news that his father was 'waking up very slowly.' French F1 commentator Jean-Louis Moncet told Europe 1 radio station: 'I saw his son and he told me that Schumi is waking up very slowly; very slowly. 'Although things are going at a slow pace, he has a lot of time, I would say he has his whole life in front of him to get back on track.' The seven times world champion returned to his home with his wife and children two months ago after being discharged from a rehabilitation clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland. Schumacher spent time in the rehab clinic after coming out of his medically-induced coma following the accident, which left him with catastrophic brain injuries. Updates on his condition have been few and far between. After he was moved home, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said there was a 'long and difficult' road ahead. Schumacher poses with his wife Corinna: The former F1 champ is being cared for by a team of 15 experts at his home at a cost of £100,000 a month. It is understood he remains immobile and unable to speak . Former Ferrari boss Jean Todt visited Schumacher last month, saying: 'What's important is that he lives and that his family is with him. We really believe that things will get better. He needs time and to be left alone. 'In the past weeks and months, he has made progress in relation to the severity of his injury,' said Todt, now president of the International Automobile Federation. 'But a long and hard road is in front of him. Hopefully things will improve. His family is close to him. He needs time and peace.' Schumacher is being cared for by a team of 15 experts at his home. It is understood he remains immobile and unable to speak. His care is estimated to be costing his family £100,000 per month. At the end of the year his father Rolf is moving from his home in Germany into a specially constructed residence built for him in the grounds of the £35million Schumacher mansion at Gland, on the shores of Lake Geneva.","Jean-Francois Payen treated Schumacher immediately after his accident .

"A BBC radio football commentator who branded Ipswich Town fans the 'great unwashed' in a live broadcast has been forced to apologise for his comments. Brenner Woolley, who has reported on Ipswich games for more than 10 years at the station, scored his embarrassing own goal when he thought he was off air. He made the howler at the half-time break in the clubs' 2-1 win over Wolves at Portman Road on Tuesday night. Brenner Woolley branded Ipswich fans 'the great unwashed'  during a live broadcast at Portman Road . But Woolley's derogatory comment was picked up by supporters listening to the online worldwide live match commentary service provided by team's 'Player' service on the club's website. His comments were not broadcast over the normal airwaves. Nick Gibbs, editor of The Ibiza Sun newspaper, said Woolley blundered as he discussed the post-match telephone call-in show with co-commentator and ex-England star Mick Mills. Mr Gibbs, who was listening in the broadcast, said Woolley spoke the following: 'I'll give you these headphones at full-time so you can hear the great unwashed!' He said their chat, supposed to be private, could be heard for about 10 minutes during the half-time interval. Angry Ipswich fans have called for the broadcaster to  apologise at the next game. One supporter, named Martyn, wrote on Twitter: 'I think Brenner Woolley should be made to stand in the middle of the pitch, at half-time on Saturday, and apologise to the fans.' BBC Radio Suffolk have confirmed that Woolley used the term 'great unwashed'. A BBC Radio Suffolk spokesman said: 'We have spoken to Brenner and made clear to him that these comments are unacceptable. 'Brenner accepts this and has apologised.' Ipswich fans, known as the Tractor Boys, have called for BBC commentator Woolley to apologise . Ipwich's Tyrone Ming (right) shields the ball from Wolverhampton's Michael Jacobs during the game . The station is thought to have launched an urgent investigation into the blunder. Woolley joined BBC Radio Suffolk from Sheffield-based Hallam FM in 2001. Managed by Mick McCarthy, Ipswich Town Football Club was founded in 1878 and play in the Football League Championship. The club's fans are known as the Tractor Boys. Mr Gibbs said he did not take Woolley's comments 'too seriously'. Woolley has angered Ipswich Town fans after branding them the 'great unwashed' during a live broadcast . 'It was good half-time entertainment and, aside from hearing Norwich were losing, was better than the usual half-time round-ups. 'I was hoping Mick Mills would start singing along to the Tannoy music but alas he must have been eating his sandwiches. 'Football call-in shows are renowned for attracting some pretty odd characters and if that's the worst name they get called 'off-air' they've got off pretty lightly,' he laughed. 'That said, if you make a gaffe in the media you deserve a bit of banter back. 'The Ipswich Town Player is a great service enabling those of us around the world to listen to Radio Suffolk's live match commentaries. 'Perhaps in the next broadcast Brenner will say hello to the ITFC supporters branch in Ibiza, all eight of us, and the rest of Ipswich's 'great unwashed' around the world.'","Brenner Woolley has reported on Ipswich Town games for over 10 years .

"The vibrant sounds and smells of Botswana had been calling me back since I first visited the Okavango Delta area in 2011 - the year after I won Olympic gold in the skeleton at the Vancouver Olympics. I was in Botswana filming a survival reality TV show, and after it was over I stayed in touch with Robert Barber, one of the guides who had helped train us for the show. He kept telling me amazing stories of the incredible areas of Botswana that I should come back and visit one day. And here's us in Africa: Amy travelled with her fiance Craig on her second visit to Botswana in three years . I couldn't resist, and three years later he ended up putting together a personalised safari for me and my fiance, Craig. Rob has been guiding safaris in Botswana and throughout Africa for over ten years. He and his partner Charlotte Bennett-Diver run Golden Africa and they specialise in getting to the core of why people go on safari, and what they want to experience. Rob called me one evening and said: 'Right Amy, I'm taking you on a journey, not a holiday.' At Maun airport in northern Botswana - the 'gateway to the Okavango Delta' - Rob and Charlotte loaded us up in their open-sided game-viewing vehicle. I switched off my phone and let the journey begin. Our first destination was Meno A Kwena, in the Kalahari. This quirky, intimate camp, run by David Dugmore and his son Daniel, sits on top of a 90ft-high cliff, looking down on to the Boteti River at exactly the point where animals come to drink. Just hanging out up here: Amy encountered local leopards during her grand journey through Botswana . We were greeted by five bull elephants drinking in the river, with a couple of zebras roaming around close by, and a hippo seeming to watch over all of them from the middle of the river. With a gin and tonic in our hands, we watched a beautiful sunset with the wildlife below. I never realised how alive the bush of Botswana could really be. As we awoke the next morning to the sounds of birdlife surrounding us, hot water arrived for our brass bucket showers. These showers are perfectly positioned overlooking the river, giving the most incredible experience of showering while an elephant wanders by 150ft away on the other side of the river. After a hearty breakfast we were off. Rob took us out to the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, the last remnant of an ancient lake. We arrived at the most incredible setting. As far as the eye could see was endless salt pan. That night, we slept out under the stars, with a view of the milky way all the way to the horizon. In the morning, on our way back to Meno A Kwena, I was excited to hear Rob say he could see some meerkats coming out of their burrow. Meerkats take lots of time to warm up in the early sunshine. We spent quite some time watching them slowly emerge to start their day of foraging. Before leaving Meno A Kwena, Rob took us on a walk with the Khoi San bushmen. The bush is their home, and they gave us a really interesting insight into it. They showed us how they set traps for food, how they make fire, and some of the interesting ways they entertain themselves. They have what I can only describe as a fast-paced version of rock, paper, scissors. We continued our journey to Rob's favourite area within Botswana, Khwai in the north-eastern Okavango Delta. A bird's eye view: Amy and Craig also had close-up glimpses of elephants (and their passengers) in the wild . I vividly remembered Rob mentioning this area three years previously for being a wildlife paradise - and our drive there showed me he was not wrong. What will always stick in my mind is the magical sight of 12 giraffe silhouettes in the road with the sun setting behind them. We were staying at Machaba Camp run by Chris Kruger, a veteran of the Botswana safari industry. It looks like something from the style pages of a glossy magazine, with all the homely warmth of a country manor, and set in the most beautiful surroundings on the Khwai River. Machaba is also incredibly eco-friendly. It recycles everything, and has a practically non-existent footprint, while remaining very luxurious - a perfect balance for me. Machaba is situated among the trees at the edge of Khwai River. There is nothing more peaceful and relaxing than having meals while watching elephants drinking, and nothing more thrilling than watching a male and female leopard wandering along the river bank on the other side. Just incredible! The wildlife that Rob had raved about in Khwai did not disappoint. During our three nights there we saw a big male lion hunting a large warthog, a beautiful female leopard waking after a day's sleep, three honey badgers, a pack of wild dogs on the hunt, and a hyena den with five cute youngsters. Spot me if you can: Leopards are elusive, but there will always be chances to see them on a break in Botswana . The next stop in our journey was a real treat for me. Rob wanted to take me back to near where we had been filming three years ago. This time I was going to be horse riding at the quite wonderful African Horseback Safaris camp, Macatoo, where they have 48 of the best looked-after horses I have ever seen. Rides at Macatoo are more adventurous in the mornings than the afternoons, and we took the opportunity to get some speed up in the open floodplains. It is quite incredible to approach buffalo, giraffe, elephants and zebra (my favourites!) on horseback. Macatoo is set in a beautiful area right in the heart of the Okavango Delta, and is only accessible by light aircraft or helicopter. While I was riding, Rob took Craig off for game-drives, boat cruises or fishing. Every meal was taken out under the beautiful African starry night sky, and all the staff were so welcoming and friendly. We really felt at home here and were very sad to leave. From Macatoo, we flew off to Kasane in the very north of Botswana and then crossed the mighty Zambezi to reach the final destination in our journey, Livingstone, on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls. On our first morning in our very spacious room at Sussi & Chuma lodge, upstream of Victoria Falls, we woke up to the sounds of the Zambezi River. After so much activity and travelling, I was looking forward to a relaxing morning. I went off for a spa treatment overlooking the river and fell asleep in no time. I was ready for this. And here's me doing the day job: Amy won gold in the skeleton at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . And it was heavenly. Rob surprised us at lunchtime with a trip into Livingstone, and before we knew it we were being whisked off in a helicopter for a scenic flight over Victoria Falls. It is very easy to see from that perspective why it is one of the seven natural wonders of the world. It is breathtaking. The date happened to be Friday the 13th, and a full moon was due. Late in the afternoon, Rob took us for a walk around the falls and, after exploring for some time, we were surprised to find a small table set up with snacks and champagne. We sipped and nibbled away as the moon rose in the east behind a small cloud bank and created the amazing effect of a rainbow in the spray of Victoria Falls. It was surreal and amazing all at the same time. Back at Sussi & Chuma we were waited on like royalty. The food was spectacular in taste and presentation. The staff set up a private dinner for us at the edge of the Zambezi River with a fireplace and yet more champagne. We ate to the sounds of hippos grunting in the distance, the flowing water and the crackling of the fire. It was wonderful. On our last full day, Rob took us to Livingstone Island which sits at the very top of the falls. Here we had a very traditional brunch of eggs Benedict and tea, while being a matter of feet away from the edge of the waterfall. Key knowledge: Amy had a demonstration of local skills - including how to make fire - from Khoi San bushmen . Victoria Falls are a mile wide and Livingstone Island sits about halfway along the top. We were guided to the edge of the falls and given the most incredible view over the brink, looking the 360ft down into the gorge. There is so much spray that there are rainbows all over the place. Before we left Botswana, we headed into the Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park for a walk to find rhinos. This didn't take long as the park is very small and rangers follow the rhino around 24 hours a day, to protect them from poachers. Being so close to such a huge animal on foot, was both exciting and terrifying all at once. We saw seven different rhino, including one very cute baby with its mother. It was also heartening to know that I was contributing in a small way to the value of the rhino as a tourist attraction, rather than as a medicine. Rob and Charlotte had introduced us to a different way of taking a holiday. Our trip to Botswana was, in fact, not just a holiday but a journey full of experiences. We will go back on safari to Africa again one day, because I know I will have to feed the piece of my soul that Africa has claimed.

"In the latest of our long-running series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, wetalk to champion golfer Rory McIlroy about his favourite restaurants, and what he did in the hotel pool. Rory McIlroy: Don't dine with him when he's lost . Earliest travel memory? Florida. Mum and Dad took me when I was seven. I remember the sun, the golf course where we were staying and that there was just so much to do. Going to kid-friendly restaurants at night was novel, too. And all of it in shorts and a T-shirt - you don't get that too often at home in July. Favourite restaurant? Deanes restaurants in Belfast. There are a few of them now, and all have different styles, from casual to fine dining. They are about being back home with friends and family. Ideal dining companion? George Best. I'm just such a huge football fan. I can think of a lot of legendary golfers, but I'd love to have chatted to somebody regarded as the best of the best in his day. I think we'd have had great banter. Least favourite? Any golfer in the world after they've had a bad round. What do you never travel without? Headphones and music; clean underwear and good company. Favourite hotel? The Fitzpatrick in New York, where I feel at home. I'm always looked after well, but not in a fussy way or with special treatment. And the breakfasts are great; lots of sausages, bacon and breads from back home. Hands on the trophy: Rory in familiar victorious mode after winning the Open Championship last July . Favourite place? It has to be home, really. There's just nowhere I'm more relaxed. I probably have a very romantic view of home, because I'm not back for more than about six weeks in a year. Naughtiest thing you've done on holiday? As a kid I think I probably did a pee once or twice in a hotel pool. Top travel tip? Take good music and headphones wherever you go. You can escape almost anything (or anybody) with great tunes. And wear sunscreen. What's one place you're keen to see but haven't? I've heard so much great stuff about the Amalfi Coast in Italy, so it's definitely on my list. I just love the sound of Sorrento and Positano. I've heard the food is fantastic and the atmosphere is completely chilled. But it's maybe not somewhere I'd go on a boys' trip.","The current Open champion shares his thoughts on travel and holidays .

"A Cocoa buyer examines beans in Guiglo, Ivory Coast, where 40 per cent of global supply is harvested . The price of chocolate could soar over the next few years as surging demand puts further pressure on the global cocoa crisis – and experts predict the demand could become unsustainable by 2020. Experts are warning that a growing taste for chocolate in Asia – particularly in China – means cocoa farmers will need more help to provide a greater amount to export or manufacturers will be forced to use less cocoa in their products. It is predicted chocolate prices will soar to keep up with the rising demand – otherwise consumers will increasingly be offered products filled with substitutes, such as nuts and fruits, to ‘pack out’ chocolate bars. The news comes as millions of people across Britain are set to indulge in Easter eggs and chocolate treats this weekend. It is estimated that the growing demand for cocoa will be unsustainable by 2020, unless more is done to help cocoa growing communities. Most cocoa farms are situated along the west coast of Africa – where many farmers are said to be living off less than $2 a day. In December, the International Cocoa Organisation said there could be a 150,000 tonne deficit of the amount of cocoa beans produced in 2014. The organisation said global cocoa supplies were heading towards the longest production shortfall in more than five decades. The rising demand for cocoa has already seen prices soar – and its feared prices could continue to rise. The chocolate market in Asia is already worth more than $12billion and demand is continuing to increase. In March, cocoa prices reached a two and a half year high at £1,896 per tonne in London and US$3,031 per tonne in New York. However, unless more is done to help cocoa production, the crisis will continue until it becomes unsustainable. The chocolate market in Asia is already worth more than $12billion and demand is continuing to increase . Mondelez International – a multinational confectionery, food and beverage conglomerate – said it had pledged to invest more than $400 million to help ease the crisis. Over the next ten years, it is set to pump millions into Ghana, Ivory Coast, Indonesia, India and the Dominican Republic to help improve the productivity and life of cocoa farmers. Chris McGrath, head of the Cocoa Life programme at Mondelez, told The Times: ‘We realised that there was a long-term supply shortage. ‘Farmers are ageing and I don’t see the next generation behind them. We have to help transform the chain.’ The International Cocoa Organisation also said plans were in place to help cultivation in Indonesia. With investment in cocoa processing industries growing at a fast rate in the country, the Government is considering cancelling tax on cocoa bean imports as production levels have fallen short in fuelling the country’s domestic grinding requirements.","Price of chocolate could soar as demand puts pressure on cocoa crisis .

"For my first visit to Canada I headed to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick for a ten-day break. I'm not sure what I expected to find: Mounties, of course; the odd moose; perhaps a bear - actually, to be honest, I didn't see any of these. Canada's a big country - the second-biggest in the world, and 45 times the size of the UK. The province of New Brunswick alone is more than twice the size of England, but with a population of just 750,000. As I drove around, I began to wonder why they actually bothered to build roads because there was never anybody using them. It makes driving in Canada a sheer delight - especially where we were, in what they call the Maritimes, on the Atlantic coast. The country is stunningly, stunningly beautiful. Scroll down for video . Riverside living: New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (pictured) are only five to eight per cent populated . I hired a Dodge pick-up, the sort of thing I'd only ever seen in movies, and it was an absolute beast, a massive truck with a five-litre engine. My girlfriend Anna loved it. I was slightly nervous about the cost of filling it up, but I found out to my relief that fuel is a lot cheaper in Canada. It was a journey of surprises, the first being that Eastern Canada was just a five-hour flight from Britain - I had no idea it would be such a short trip. Another pleasant surprise was that the exchange rate with the Canadian dollar is extremely favourable. And, perhaps most importantly for me after all my years as a MasterChef judge, the food is incredible. Lobsters and scallops are luxury items in the UK, but in this part of Canada they are very affordable. You find little wood cabins by the side of the road that do lobster rolls and fresh scallops. A gourmand would gorge himself silly - and we did just that for the first week, eating nothing but lobster. And the people are unbelievably friendly. I'll give you two examples of this. I went to buy some indigestion tablets from the drugstore (it's an anxiety thing - nothing to do with all that lobster!). A gourmand's paradise: Gregg Wallace holds up a lobster, which is part of the staple diet in Canada . An older couple in the shop heard my accent and said to me: 'You don't need to buy a whole tub, you won't be here that long. We're buying some - just take some from our bottle!' These were two people I'd never met before. And what about this? When I was reversing my mighty truck, I accidentally backed into a ditch. Suddenly I was surrounded by people eager to help me. Somebody pulled up in the car behind. A woman came out of her house across the road. They all began making phone calls. I was pulled out by a tow-truck within 30 minutes, and the guy charged me less than £30. I couldn't believe how ridiculously friendly they were. On the road, everyone is so well behaved. I've never been on a road where nobody speeds. There's an official speed limit and absolutely no one exceeds it. I imagine that nobody can get frustrated, or nobody feels the need to go fast, because everyone's moving all the time. The only thing that slowed me down was the need to stop to take photographs. Hitting the open road: A lack of cars makes driving in Canada a sheer delight . In New Brunswick you can feel the French influence in the food. This is where the Cajuns lived before they were expelled by the British and went to live in Louisiana, where they gave the world jambalaya and file gumbo. You can see why the French were reluctant to abandon this part of Canada. I took home so many wonderful experiences. One of the most amazing in Nova Scotia was riding the tidal bore at Bay of Fundy. I don't really understand how tides work, so I can't explain the whole tidal bore phenomenon - all I know is that it's an extraordinary thing to see. The Bay of Fundy is a 170-mile long ocean bay that stretches between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and it's home to the highest tides in the world. Each day 160billion tons of seawater flows in and out of the bay during one tide cycle, more than the combined flow of all the world's freshwater rivers. Surf’s up: Tourists hang on tightly as they ride the 10ft-high Fundy Bay tidal bore on the Shubenacadie river . On the Shubenacadie River, the tide is coming in one way, and the pull of the river is going the other, and it creates what they call the tidal bore - angry waves, up to 10ft high, that can start anywhere in the river and come from any direction. I was put in a lifejacket and taken out to the river in an inflatable boat - and then we sat in the middle of these rapids, with the boat's engine off watching these enormous waves starting to build. It was like riding a big dipper. It's scary at first. The boat fills with water and you all sit at the back to empty it out. Then you all sit at the front so that it stays down. It's the most amazing thing. You wouldn't think 'Gregg Wallace, adrenaline junkie', would you? But I loved it. Another great pleasure - and another surprise - was the wine in this part of Canada. A lot of it is quite sweet for our palate, but you've got to applaud the ingenuity of a country that's warm in the summer and then freezing in the winter being able to produce wine at all. Stunning scenery: A waterfall in New Brunswick and, right, the impressive Hopewell Rocks . I couldn't believe the stunning beauty of the area. As I went along, I was busy posting photographs on Twitter - I just had to share the experience. There's an area called Hopewell Rocks, where you stare down at a seascape with rocks sticking out of it. Within an hour or so, the tide has gone out so far that you can walk along what was the seabed and past these rocks that have been eroded into bizarrely beautiful shapes by the tides. In the last decade of the 19th Century, Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, a wealthy businessman who was president of Canadian Pacific Railways, had a summer home in New Brunswick, on Ministers Island near St Andrews. The island is connected to the mainland by a causeway that's flooded for half the day. His place, Covenhoven, was a sandstone mansion furnished in the most lavish late Edwardian manner, with manicured grounds, scenic roads and greenhouses turning out exotic fruits and vegetables, as well as a breeding farm producing prize-winning Clydesdale horses and Dutch Belted cattle. It was the most spectacular of many palatial summer homes in St Andrews. I was invited to the property by Alex Haun, a local chef, who cooked an eight-course dinner just for me and Anna. He also brought wine to go with every course. Romantic: Gregg had dinner at Sir William Cornelius Van Horne's former summer home on Ministers Island . I've eaten in a fair number of places around the world, but this meal on Ministers Island was one of the culinary highlights of my life. We had local scallops, done ceviche-style and local halibut. Here we were, sitting in what was a Victorian bathhouse, overlooking the sunset, having a chef prepare our dinner. This was not only a culinary highlight, it was also immensely, incredibly romantic. My overriding memory of my time in Canada is of lovely towns and wonderfully empty space. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are only five to eight per cent populated, leaving space for beautiful forests. Canada also represents wonderful value for money. At the moment, a dollar is about 65p, so a main course in the poshest restaurant is going to cost you around £15. Don't go there expecting sophistication. Go there expecting just a rural idyll. I'd go back at the drop of a hat. I will go back. For now I'm making arrangements for chef Alex to come over to London, which he has never visited. Because I was so overwhelmed by what he'd done for me that night, I'm going to take him to Le Gavroche, my favourite restaurant in London, as a thank you.

"It was as Kathy Lette yodelled for the 48th time that I killed her. That is what a summer holiday in Switzerland does to you. I blame the combination of goats, chocolate, mountains and a sunny day. What surprised me about the country - and specifically the Graubunden region - is how it is precisely as you would want and expect the place to be. It is incredibly clean, very picturesque, all the church and town hall clocks tell the right time, and even the buses run to schedule. River deep, mountain high: Penny and Kathy found spa relaxation amid the splendid scenery of Graubunden . 'Train to Bad Ragaz leaving at precisely 13.32,' I say to Kathy, as we run from the airport to the station. 'Laydohlaydolayheyho,' sings Kathy, popping on her straw hat. Actually, just assume this is her response to almost anything, because the only thing that seems to stop her tonsils warbling is food and drink. Bad Ragaz, which sounded to me like a rapper with a low-slung trouser, is a quaint town with a selection of tidy buildings including an obligatory church. We store our baggage in flimsy-looking tin cupboards at the station to take a bus trip to a famous and very old spa bath. The taking of the healing waters at Tamina Gorge began 700 years ago, when Benedictine monks rigged up a medieval bungee jump to swing sick people down to the thermal pools, where they left them sitting in the water for up to a week. Not a low-trousered rapper after all: The town of Bad Ragaz sits framed by glorious mountain scenery . Our guide, Jacqueline Schwitter, says: 'You can imagine how wrinkly they got, but they believed the skin had to open up to allow the illness to come out.' It takes ten-and-half years for the water to travel from its source before emerging through a crack in the gorge, and the temperature and mineral content never changes. In 1535, a local physician wrote about their efficacy and 'elf and safety suddenly got involved, with men being required to remove firearms before entering and guests who committed indecency being banished for 101 years. Our night's accommodation is at the Heidihof Hotel, where our beds have the most gigantic pillows. The hotel food is excellent - as is the local wine - and we sleep like clean, tidy logs. In the morning, we walk over to Maienfeld to see the Heidi village - dedicated to the little mountain girl created by Swiss author Johanna Spyri in the late 19th century. It is the most translated novel in the world. 'Interestingly, her husband, Bernhard Spyri, was a friend of Wagner,' I remark. A very pretty state of affairs: Bad Ragaz is a picture of peaceful Swiss tranquility . Kathy yodels lightly and fingers some Heidi honey, before settling on a postcard featuring a girl in plaits and a goat. We're picked up by Clemens Zehender from the Castle Salenegg, one of the oldest wine estates in Europe and, since 1998, run by a woman. 'She has changed things for the better,' says Clemens. Tell you one thing: the place is immaculate. You could eat your dinner off the floor. Surprisingly, the vineyard also produces vinegar, which is the enemy of the vine because of the bacteria needed to make it. 'Vinegar is actually a refining of wine,' explains Clemens, over a delicious lunch of salad dressed with horseradish and mint vinegars. Later, we dump our bags at the five-star Grand Hotel Hof Ragaz, which has that peculiarly spa thing of people meandering around in dressing gowns, and go for a quick trot up to a ruined castle. We accidentally get lost and Kathy gets propositioned by an old man called Fritz on a bicycle who is wearing Lycra shorts. All the afternoon's worries are massaged away with fragrant melissa oil in the spa before we enjoy more local wine at the Restaurant Zollstube, and Kathy eats what she declares is the freshest trout she has ever tasted. A fragment of literary history: The idyllic village of Maienfeld is the setting for the classic Alpine story Heidi . '9.27,' I point out to Kathy the next morning, as we get the train to Ospizio Bernina (arr: 12.39). Some of the trip is on a Unesco World Heritage railway, following the Rhine and cutting past snow-topped mountains, glaciers and pointy-turreted castles on rocky promontories. 'I have a total head for heights,' says Kathy, 'but I'm more used to social-climbing than mountain-climbing.' We hike past an ice blue lake to Alp Grum where we lunch while gazing at the glacier. The handsome waiter, Fabrice, tries to explain the meaning of Kasespatzliauflauf mit Schinkenspeck Wurfel und Kase. Kathy flirts with him until he tells her firmly that his name is Fabrice, not Febreze like the smell. I have the soup. On the train back, she eventually says: 'I have run out of superlatives for the scenery. I'm going to have to get Stephen Fry to airlift in some adjectives.' We spend that night at rocksresort in Laax, a typical skiers' place, with the most delicious big stone bath and steam room combined, which we plunge into after gorging ourselves on Thai food at Nooba. A very fast form of clockwork: Penny was very impressed by the punctuality of the Swiss railway system . It's a culinary hiking trail the next day, up to restaurants in the mountains, where we get our cards stamped and build up a full meal. At 10.02am, we have a glass of prosecco, at 11.17am we march past meadows and huts bearing geraniums in window boxes to another restaurant for melon and ham. Then, up past a sign pointing to the Crap mountain (oh, how we tittered), we come across a crystal-clear stream which we drink from ('the Dom Perignon of the Alps', says Kathy) and into a blizzard of butterflies, beyond which we have our pasta course. From there, it's a fairly heavy slog uphill to Startgels where we have a splendid repast, with tons of vegetables. We skip pudding and set off home, with me running ahead, having perfected a low-gravity lope which Kathy describes as like a little old man with heavy underpants. Back at the hotel, we elect to unwind in a rather small swimming pool. 'What does this do?' asks Kathy, pressing a button just above water level. A huge dump of water lands on my head. 'Wasserfall probably means waterfall,' I say. Two wheels good: Kathy and Penny explored the meadows and lanes of Graubunden by bicycle . I stand closer to her as she peruses the next one, hoping to avoid any problems. 'Hmmmm. Gegenstromanlage.' She presses. I feel a huge thump in the ribs and with a slight woomph, shoot across the pool propelled by two jets. It's a current to swim against. We don't attempt the Bodensprudel button. At Grandis restaurant that night, we go past the wine racks to get to our table and have a delicious bottle of local red which tastes of black pepper and chocolate. Our final morning is spent on an electric bike, which is now my favourite form of transport ever. We zip with minimum effort past meadows full of lilac scabious, buttercups and daisies. We are tempted by a dip in Lake Cresta, but we have to get back because the bus leaves at 12.22 precisely. I tap my watch as it arrives. 'Spot-on,' I say. 'Laydodelayohdelayayho,' says Kathy. I stab her to death with a Toblerone. It's what she would have wanted. The Heidihof Hotel (www.heidihof.ch/en/welcome) costs from £49pp per night B&B.

Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata weighed just 3 pounds, 7 ounces each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women at 31 weeks on April 11. The sisters have now grown to 11 pounds each and doctors are considering what's next for the girls, who share a liver, diaphragm, heart lining and intestines. Dr. Stephen Welty, chief of neonatology at Texas Children's Fetal Center, told the Houston Chronicle that the twins will likely be separated when they are eight months old. Loved: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata were born in April and doctors hope they will undergo surgery in a couple of months. Their mother, Elysse Mata, is pictured kissing them in a Houston hospital . Growing: They weighed three pounds, seven ounces each when they were born but are now 11 pounds each . Overjoyed: Mrs Mata looks down at her baby girls, who she said are fast developing their own personalities . 'We can make no guarantees,' Welty said. 'We expect it to be technically hard, but that the outcome will be good.' Welty previously said the twins would need respiratory support but 'we don't expect them to have any serious setbacks'. Doctors said the goal for now is for the babies to continue to grow and gain weight. On the family's YouCaring page, they explained that doctors will use tissue expanders to stretch the girls' skin in preparation for the surgery. It will take up to two months for the skin to stretch enough to cover the area after they are separated. After the separation, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk. Their parents, Elysse and John Mata from Lubbock, who have an older son, five-year-old Azariah, found out that they were having conjoined twins during an ultrasound in January. Healthy: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata will be separated when they are about eight months old . Gorgeous: The girls were born at 31 weeks in April and are going from strength to strength, their family said . Proud: Their parents and big brother said the girls - who are joined at the chest, right, and share a liver, diaphragm, intestines and heart lining - are developing their own personalities . 'I was speechless, it was so unexpected,' Mrs Mata told ABC. On their YouCaring page, the family added: 'Their chances of survival were a mere 20 per cent which inspired their middle names, Faith and Hope.' The family moved from Lubbock to be closer to the hospital in Houston, with Mr Mata's job transferring him and helping set his family up with a home and other items. They say they have enjoyed watching their happy girls grow and develop distinct personalities - with Knatalye being far feistier, while her sister is more laid back. 'They love to hear people talk, and they love new people,' Mrs Mata said. Conjoined twins make up one in every 200,000 live births and approximately 40 to 60 per cent are stillborn, while around 35 per cent survive just one day.","Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata were born at 31 weeks on April 11 .

"For a man of vaunting and, at times, unscrupulous ambition, Francois Hollande must have been grateful indeed for the backdrop of yesterday’s Nato summit in Wales. Here, at least, alongside David Cameron, Barack Obama and other leaders, as they gravely discussed the international crises gripping the West, his stature was undiminished. Back in his native France the devastating impact of the excoriating memoir penned in full revenge mode by his scorned first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, has stripped this diminutive, posturing president of his credibility — and his dignity. Scroll down for video . Vengeance: Valerie Trierweiler sent shockwaves through France with her revelations about President Hollande . In public, political friends and even foes have reacted with traditional French disdain, making predictably lofty attempts to rubbish the book as a squalid act of spite. In private, they are lapping it up, with the autobiography already at the top of the bestseller lists and rapidly selling out of its first 200,000-copy print run. Page after crushing page strips Hollande of his amour-propre. His former lover depicts him as a cynical liar who hates the working class, who mocks the disabled, and who pays only lip service to his socialist leanings. Devastatingly, the president emerges as one of the ‘gauche caviars’ or caviar leftists — France’s version of our own champagne socialists. One commentator wrote yesterday of the ‘atmosphere of decadence’ revealed at Hollande’s Elysee Palace home. For while Mme Trierweiler laces her bitter tome with stiletto-sharp insights into the president’s inadequacy as a man and as a politician, the most damaging of the extracts are those that depict him as a cold and heartless snob, a man who refers to the voters who put him into power two years ago as ‘les sans dents’ — the toothless. Not that 49-year-old Trierweiler shies from mixing the personal with the political in her book, wryly titled Thank You For This Moment. She feigns dismay at her ‘rottweiler’ nickname, given to her by former colleagues on the magazine Paris Match. ‘The expression spread. Gossiping is an unfortunate disease,’ she says — but she does not refrain from it. Page after crushing page strips Hollande of his amour-propre. His former lover depicts him as a cynical liar who hates the working class, who mocks the disabled, and who pays only lip service to his socialist leanings . Cold and heartless: The most damaging of the extracts are those that depict him as a cold and heartless snob, a man who refers to the voters who put him into power two years ago as ‘les sans dents’ — the toothless . There is a lurid account of how her discovery of Hollande’s affair with the actress Julie Gayet put her in hospital following an attempted overdose of sleeping pills — and vicious mockery of photographs which showed him on the back of a moped, visiting his younger lover. ‘The first lady in hospital wasn’t a good image for the President,’ she writes. ‘Besides, nothing was very good for his image in this episode. And above all not the photo which was taken in the Rue du Cirque with a crash helmet on his head.’ She also ridicules Hollande’s strange propensity for allowing himself to be photographed in the rain, looking like a drowned rat. ‘He refused an umbrella,’ she says of an excursion on the Champs-Elysees soon after his election, adding that he ‘stayed planted in the wind and rain like an idiot’. And she punctures Hollande’s supposed man of the people posturing with deadly detail of his tastes. He’s a man who ‘prefers to avoid a meal unless it is of premier quality, who doesn’t eat strawberries unless they’re [top quality] Gariguettes, who only eats Noirmoutier potatoes [reputedly the most expensive spuds in the world] and puts boil-in-the-bag meat straight in the bin,’ she recounts. She sprinkles the book with damaging remarks from her former lover. After meeting the disabled French swimmer Philippe Croizon, she writes that Hollande observed: ‘I don’t like handicapped people who commercialise their handicap.’ Croizon, the first quadruple amputee to swim the English Channel, retaliated by asking: ‘He’d rather that handicapped people continued to live below the poverty line?’ The onslaught of the revelations — prepared amid great secrecy and printed in Germany — has hit Hollande like a bolt from the blue. It comes after a week in which his political credibility had already sunk to a new low, after he dissolved the French government over his squabbles with the cabinet. Nothing is spared, even if to mention it reflects badly on Mme Trierweiler herself. She recalls how before one State banquet Hollande asks her: ‘Does it take you a lot of time to make yourself look that beautiful?’ To which she answers: ‘Yes, a bit.’ The President then coldly observes that: ‘Nobody expects any more from you than looking pretty.’ Disdain: Her biting words come after the president left her following an affair with actress Julie Gayet . Now, in revenge, she is merciless in exposing the man with whom she had a nine-year relationship as a shameless opportunist. No aspect of their life together is considered off-limits. Hollande, she says, pestered her ‘incessantly’ about giving him a child. But he was estranged from the four children of his 30-year relationship with ex-partner Ségolène Royal. ‘He missed his children,’ she explains. ‘They hadn’t seen him for months and agreed en bloc to not return while he was with me. I won’t take responsibility for this estrangement. I told Francois that I was happy about a new child, but only if he returned to his own.’ She tells, too, of reading in a biography of the president that he’d ‘confided . . . that he never wanted to have a child with me. I was mortified. He defended himself by saying, “I wasn’t going to discuss our private life.” Another lie and one of the most wounding of all.’ Of course, through it all one person does emerge from these pages, as a paragon of integrity: Valerie Trierweiler. It was she, readers are told, who had to educate her middle-class partner in the lives of the poor. ‘I led him into the suburbs,’ she claims, telling how she took him to discount stores ‘to make sure that he knew the reality of everyday life which confronts a part of France, those who count each euro’. She makes common cause with Carla Bruni, the glamorous model-cum-singer wife of former president Nicolas Sarkozy. ‘Carla Bruni never said anything bad about me publicly and I’ve never criticised her.’ But there is a sly dig when Mme Trierwieler refers to the allegations that Sarkozy was bankrolled by former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, revealing that she and Hollande dubbed a room at the Elysee ‘the Gaddafi room because of its green carpets and curtains’. Trierweiler justifies all the bitchiness, the invasion of her own privacy, because, in the words of that old cliche, she wants to tell the truth. This is despite the fact that she, an ex-journalist, is a notorious litigant who sued over paparazzi pictures of her in a swimsuit, and over allegations that while married she had been the mistress of two politicians. All in all, she wants the world to join in her regrets about sharing a life with a man whose presidential veneer hid a private life of grubby deception. Disdain and disappointment drip from her pen. She threw out Hollande’s old clothes when they moved in together, she relates, giving most of them to homeless charity Emmaus. Laughingly, she notes: ‘Men dressed by Emmaus walking the streets of Paris with suits which once belonged to the President of the Republic.’ For President Hollande it is not just the clothes off his back that have been removed. So, too, has every shred of his personal credibility.","Valerie Trierweiler's Thank You For The Moment comes out on Thursday .

"For at least a decade I have been bombarded with proclamations from friends and strangers that Croatia is the most beautiful place in the world. Having travelled a fair portion of the planet in my 28 years, I denied that anywhere could match Rome, my favourite city. But at last I decided to put it to the test - and found myself sitting at Gatwick Airport, arms tightly folded, marinaded in a light scepticism. Our time was limited, so we chose just three portions of Croatia, starting in Dubrovnik. We landed at 9pm and were taken straight to our hotel, the Valamar President Hotel up in the hills, a ten-minute drive from the popular old town. From the outside it looks like a golf course. From the inside, it looks like somewhere Brangelina would stay. (Cue me immediately looking around for Brangelina. They weren't there.) Coastal beauty: Dubrovnik's beaches are lapped by the perfectly clear-blue Adriatic Sea . To call this hotel grand would be a vast understatement. It had the panoramic views of the ocean and the space and luxury that I've not yet encountered anywhere before. I skipped all the way to my room. My boyfriend was mortified. At £200 a night (although it would have been far cheaper had I not booked about 15 minutes before we left for the airport...), I hoped for something relatively decent. But a lovely kingsize room, with full patio and breakfast table, practically on the beautiful private beach was not what I was expecting. One very inelegant hop over my balcony and I would be feet-on-sand. Morning came after a wonderful sleep and the view was officially ridiculous. Miles and miles of perfectly clear-blue Adriatic Sea, surrounded by untouched islands and peppered with the odd palm tree for effect. A feast for the senses: Jameela, pictured right, loved the restaurants of Split . I headed with caution to the breakfast 'buffet'. I hate the word buffet. You're often greeted by slightly cold, very salty, mass-cooked slop. But not here. Here I walked into the kind of breakfast selection that gives you a panic attack. 'How the hell can I get all of this into my mouth before 11am?' Tailor-made omelettes and pancakes cooked by on-hand chefs. Beautiful fruits, cheeses, fresh smoothies, sausages, vegetables and delicious Croatian cakes. This was simply not conducive to having to wear a bikini. Once I had consumed enough for a small family, and was barely able to breathe, I rolled on to the private hotel beach. Luxury loungers, fluffy towels, perfect, clean, calm sea... Water sports heavily available, lots of water toys for babies and very disabled- and family-accessible. Bursting with character: The famed Dubrovnik old town is hidden within enormous stone walls . One tip: as Croatia is certainly rocky, buy those hideous aqua shoes. Don't go in the sea barefoot. In my first hour I stepped on a sea urchin that gifted me with about 40 spines, wedged deep into my foot. I can't recall that kind of pain before. The pain led me to say the most unbelievable thing out loud: 'Oh God, I wish I had a pair of Crocs' (said by nobody under 85, ever). But seriously, do it. By 8 o'clock we headed out to the famed Dubrovnik old town, which is hidden within enormous stone walls. Everything inside is made of marble, so you walk into what feels like a grand, pristine film set, bursting with character and beautiful architecture. It is insane to think that little over 20 years ago the place was brutally bombed in the 1991 siege. It is therefore doted upon and cherished by its residents. Jameela's top tip for a visit to Dubrovnik? Buy a pair of Crocs if you're planning to take a dip in the sea . Hidden dangers: Jameela stepped on a sea urchin that gifted her with about 40 spines . The restaurants are busy and full of traditional Italian cuisine (pizza, pasta, fish). And the town is packed with young people. The little alleys contain quaint bars with the steps covered in cushions for passers-by to rest and drink. The atmosphere is bustling and alive. It's genuinely one of the most stunning places I have ever been. It takes hours to investigate every nook and cranny and every staggering view at the top of the enormous flights of marble stairs. Full of life: Split is a three-hour scenic bus journey up the coast from Dubrovnik . We went back three nights in a row, each time sampling different alleyway restaurants and bars. They all have pretty much the same food, same price, same menu, same stand-ard, so I won't tell you where to go. Just avoid the main court-yard as the touristic nature diminishes the stan-dard of food. And the pizza looks a week old. Eurgh. After only three days investi-gating Dubrovnik and falling madly in love with the sights, I had shamelessly replaced Rome with this as my favourite city. Already. Unthinkable. Next, on to Split, a three-hour scenic bus journey up the coast. As we drove into town, I was rather concerned that it looked like a lads' holiday destination. The word 'kebab' was written everywhere. But as we got closer to the centre, where our hotel was, the architecture and peace made a strong comeback. We had booked into the Cornaro Hotel. To get in, you walk through a charming pink courtyard, where you are met by staff so friendly and helpful you almost feel suspicious. We Brits are savages in comparison with the service you get in Croatia. On the waterfront: Split's port is home to some of the most incredible yachts Jameela had ever seen . We were taken up to our room through a cute hotel with the decor of a plush luxury yacht on the inside and into our lovely de luxe room. Everything was new and modern but still very elegant. The bed was comfortable and the room very quiet, despite being in the heart of the action. Breakfast was OK. Get there on the early side as the hot food was barely tepid at 10am. But the pastries were fresh and tasty, and I have never seen such a multicultural breakfast in my life. English fry-up, croissants, German cake, and a very casual tray of crayfish sushi. Split is full of life. But I warn you... It's very young life. The average age is between 18 and 24. You need energy. Loud, pumping open-air bars and clubs line the streets. Once you get into the old town, things quieten down and you can have some lovely grilled fish in the courtyards. The hotel staff recommended a restaurant called NoStress, so we went. Terrible name. Mediocre starter and absolutely excellent main course. The kind of chicken and fish that makes you slightly emotional. I highly recommend it. Island retreat: Brac is known for its V-shaped beach, Bol, which is usually rammed with tourists . After that we sauntered along the beautifully preserved palace walls, apparently haunted by ghosts, none of which I was greeted by, thank God. Shops are open till late and you are merely five minutes from the port, which is home to some of the most incred-ible yachts I have ever seen. (I look around for Brangelina again. Not here either.) The next day I decided Split was a little too restless for me. So I hopped on a very cheap ferry (they leave every hour and a half until midnight) to the nearest island, Brac. It was 45 painless minutes, and so worth it. Such a charming place - by far the most family-friendly I have ever visited. Plentiful water activities for children, clean beaches and the prettiest port in Croatia so far. Brac is known for its V-shaped beach, Bol. I didn't bother. It's an expensive cab ride to and fro, there is no shade, and it is rammed with tourists. Instead, walk from the ferry and find your own pretty little coves, visited only by locals and with the kind of views that are completely overwhelming. The kind of views that can make you forget that you have cellulite, or even what your name is. Back in Split, Jameela was able to watch men acting out historical scenes in ancient Roman clothing . For dinner we ventured to a quaint little restaurant called Vila Dora, in a corner by the port. Beautiful, simple, fresh food - it was the best meal in Croatia so far. Bravo. We hopped on the ferry back and had our last sleep in Croatia. It was miserable to be leaving. The final day was spent wandering around Split's lovely old town, full to the brim with people wearing ancient Roman clothing acting out historical scenes in the streets to the delight of the crowds, mostly the women. The soldiers wear very little skirts... And Croatian men are HOT. (Wear sunglasses if with partner to allow you to ogle in peace.) Generally I give what I saw of Croatia five stars. What a beautiful country, what lovely people. What a relaxed and welcoming place that has over-come staggering adversity to become one of the most desirable spots on the planet. I was horrified to be leaving and I booked my next trip there the minute I finished this review. Sorry Rome.

"An Iowa man who was chasing a storm with his son on Sunday survived a lightning strike that knocked him to the ground. . Denny Murphy and his son Derrick had been taking video and photographs of a severe lightning storm that materialized suddenly near Denison, Iowa. Lightning struck within 20 feet of the pair, knocking Derrick against their car while Denny was thrown to the ground, where he lay 'mostly paralyzed', according to the son. Scroll down for video . This image shows the scene just outside of Denison, Iowa, shortly before, as recorded by Derrick Murphy . A few seconds later a series lightning bolts strike in quick succession, one of which knocks Denny and Derrick Murphy off their feet . 'The only thing I can remember is the hairs on the back of my neck standing up', Derrick said. 'I blacked out for about two seconds. I woke up after being thrown four feet into the car... My dad was laying on the ground. He wasn't moving and couldn't speak. His eyes were glazed over.' Denny was hospitalized and experiencing searing pain that prevented him from sleeping for several days but is doing better now, his son said. He continues to feel pain in his left arm. 'He's able to sleep now,' Derrick said. The big risk after a lightning strike, he said, is kidney failure. The lightning injures the muscles and creates a toxin that goes into the kidneys, potentially causing them to fail, he said. The odds of being struck by lightning are 1 in 700,000, according to National Geographic. The spark from a lightning bolt can reach over five miles in length, raise the temperature in the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit and contain a hundred million electrical volts. Just under 3,700 people in the US died 1959 to 2003.","Denny Murphy and his son Derrick were filming dark clouds gathering near their home in Iowa when a lightning strike knocked them off their feet .

"New York is the Big Apple and New Orleans the Big Easy. So it follows that Buenos Aires should be the Big Tango. Pitch up at La Viruta – a dance hall in the Palermo district – at around 10pm, and you need not leave until 4am. After just one night, you realise that Buenos Aires is a city in thrall to tango. No wonder Argentina’s Pope Francis said that the dance had been one of the greatest pleasures of his youth. City of lights: Buenos Aires - which translates loosely as 'Fair Winds' - is an attractive, arty city . Tango is thought to originate with the Italian immigrants who settled in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Much of the capital’s architecture is redolent of the Europe they left behind: leafy boulevards and Belle Époque apartments. More than 40,000 Britons visit each year, most spending a few days in town before moving west to the pampas or south to Patagonia. But many are perfectly happy to stay put, dancing by night and exploring by day. It helps that the food and drink are sublime. Brushstrokes and dancing shoes: Argentina's arty side is visible in the city, with its love of tango always clear . Beef comes straight from the grasslands and wine from the incomparable Mendoza region. Just remember not to book dinner at 8pm – unless you want to eat alone. Restaurants do not fill up until 10pm, and most stay open until 1am. The city can also be extraordinarily cheap - with approximately 14 Argentinian pesos to the pound, we found it hard to spend more than £20 a head. And yet, as we discovered during our week, there is so much more to this exhilarating city than tango and T-bone. With art to rival that of any European capital, Buenos Aires is one of the world’s great cultural cities, boasting no fewer than eight impressive galleries. Remarkably, this wealth of culture is a well-kept secret. Few outside the art world know that the National Museum of Fine Arts (MNBA), for example, has an enviable collection of Degas and Cezanne. Show-stopper: The famous Caminito street in the Boca district of the city is awash with colour . However, with the opening of a new exhibition at London’s Royal Academy, the secret is out. Radical Geometry, a selection of 20th century art from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, showcases the best South American modern art. You might not be immediately familiar with the names of Joaquin Torres Garcia, Jesus Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez, but you will recognize their debt to modernism and to European masters such as Mondrian and Matisse. With Europe in turmoil during and after the Second World War, Buenos Aires became a magnet for creative types seeking artistic freedom. In Germany, the Nazi regime was persecuting not only Jews, but also those who espoused the avant-garde. As Dr Adrian Locke, exhibitions curator at the Royal Academy, says: “Many artists, many of them Jewish, crossed the Atlantic to find refuge here, creating an extraordinary dynamism. There was an atmosphere of freedom and invention.” Urban planning on a grand scale: Buenos Aires boasts the world's widest avenue, Avenida 9 de Julio . Only New York, home to Jackson Pollock and Roy Lichtenstein, could rival Buenos Aires in its post-war artistic energy. For anyone thinking of a cultural break, Buenos Aires offers an alternative to Paris or Madrid. Its museums are delightfully uncrowded, and none of your favourite pictures will ever be out on loan. Because Argentina defaulted on its debt repayments in 2001, none of its national collection can ever leave the country for fear of being impounded. So Degas’s magnificent pastel of Two Dancers, for example, will always be waiting for you. The city can rival Europe not only in art, but also opera and ballet. The great Italian tenor Enrico Caruso crossed the Atlantic to perform at its world-famous Colon opera house in 1917, and it continues to attract the finest performers. On our last night, we returned to La Viruta, determined to tango to the very end. A splendid cityscape: Buenos Aires has its scruffy corners, but it is a city that never fails to excite . Having taken a couple of lessons in London, we felt rather confident: take four steps, pause and flick our heads with a flourish. We soon realised that Argentinian tango looks nothing like its rather weedy English cousin. Seeing our confusion, a young woman took pity on us. ‘It’s easy,’ Paola breathed, as she held my husband close. ‘It’s just like walking.’ Under the spell of her Latin charms, he glided around the room. As for me, left dancing with a stranger, I felt I needed balancing wheels. So while he thought ‘Last Tango in Paris’, I felt more ‘My Left Foot’. Miraculously, we managed one circuit of the ballroom. A small triumph, but one large enough to convince us that we must return soon. But next time, we will pack our dancing shoes.

"As a breakfast show presenter, I spend my life turning down invitations. My alarm goes off at 2.40am every morning and an 'early to bed, early to rise regime' doesn't permit anything like a normal social life. So an invitation from London's Corinthia hotel to test their new sleep programme was obviously just my thing. I am obsessed with sleep. I can fall asleep at the drop of a hat - not just on trains and in cars, but even once during root-canal surgery. But was I getting the right type of sleep? The Corinthia's programme focuses not so much on the amount you get, but the quality. They look at how you can maximise that through what you eat, and how you unwind before bedtime. With the news recently about how women in particular could be putting their health at risk by not getting enough sleep, I wondered if it was time to assess the shut-eye I was getting. Scroll down for video . Switching off: Charlotte relaxes in her bedroom with a drink from the hotel’s Sleep Menu . Before my sleep experience at the hotel, I decided to make a day of it by tiring myself out and visiting a few of my favourite London places, starting at the Natural History Museum. My next port of call was Buckingham Palace, where I checked out the Royal Childhood exhibition, then the National Gallery which has more than 2,000 works of art. This trek around the sights meant I was definitely ready for my Sumptuous Sleep Retreat. It has to be said that the Corinthia is no ordinary hotel. Its prices are certainly pretty extraordinary, but I had little time to absorb the luxuriously appointed reception as I was ushered off to the spa for an afternoon packed with treatments to ease away any aches and pains and make sure I was fully relaxed before my head hit the pillow. This began with a visit to resident osteopath Bhart Shemar. Under his expert treatment, I soon began to feel all my long-held knots of tension disappear. Early risers: Charlotte with Good Morning Britain presenters Sean Fletcher, Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard . Time to relax: Charlotte stayed at the Corinthia Hotel, which has launched a new sleep programme for guests . Before my next treatment, there was just time to unwind in one of the Sleep Pods. The spa takes up an impressive four floors, and has not only a pool, sauna and steam room but heated marble loungers and an ice fountain. The sleep pods are nestled in the middle of the spa in a darkened room, with a flickering fire spilling out a gentle and mesmeric warm light. I already felt more relaxed than I had in a long time - but I was only halfway there. It wasn't long before my next treatments - the ESPA Sleep Ritual designed to balance the body's energies, a Balinese massage to calm the mind and hot stones to ease tension. This was followed by Shirodhara - an Ayurvedic treatment that involves a therapist gently dropping warm oil on your forehead, to soothe the mind. It's a therapy known to induce sleep, which it certainly did with me. I drifted off on the massage bed. Back in my room, I decided it would be too much effort even to change out of my dressing gown for dinner, so I made the most of room service. The Sleep Menu has been specially designed by nutritionist Jeannette Hyde to make sure you have all the ingredients you need for a good night's sleep.

Drifting off: Charlotte tries out Shirodhara - an Ayurvedic treatment that involves a therapist gently dropping warm oil on your forehead, to soothe the mind . Just to make certain you're not peckish during the night, the hotel even supplies a bedtime snack of banana, sunflower seed and pumpkin cookies with hot milk or valerian tea. I started to feel guilty about the biscuits and chocolates I often resort to in the TV studio for that early morning energy boost. My body was now set up for sleep, so it was time to turn to the mind. Sleep expert Dr Guy Meadows advises a routine: half an hour of wind-down time when you switch off all devices, dim the lights and - most importantly - avoid the temptation of using your phone or computer, as the light they emit makes your body think it is daylight. I began to realise you can't cheat sleep. In a busy day, all too often it's the one thing we skimp on to make sure we cram everything in. The few hours spent during my sleep programme really made me think about just how vital my precious night-time hours are if I am to function at my best. I slept like a log that night, and felt more refreshed than I had done in a long time. The Sumptuous Sleep Retreat at the Corinthia Hotel costs from £758 based on single occupancy.

"British travellers suffer some of the highest rates of flight delays in Europe, and are owed up to £185 million in compensation from airlines. Statistics released by passenger rights specialist refund.me reveal that one in every four passengers in the UK are affected by delays of at least 15 minutes, the second highest number in Europe, behind one in every 3 French passengers. It is estimated that as many as 575,000 Britons could be eligible to claim compensation for delays, cancellations, missed connections and overbooking by airlines, but few actually do. Payout: British travellers are entitled to up to £185 million in unclaimed compensation for delayed flights . Across Europe, more than two million delayed passengers could be entitled to claim compensation from airlines worth approximately £665 million, judging by statistics on delayed or cancelled flights. Following France and the UK, one in every five Germans, and one in every six Spaniards suffer flight disruptions. Charles de Gaulle in Paris is the worst European airport for delayed flights, with the highest number of any airport during the month of August.

Heathrow is the worst offender for cancelling flights though, followed by Frankfurt and then Charles de Gaulle. Left waiting: One in four UK passengers are affected by flight delays, according to statistics by refund.me . Worst offenders: Charles de Gaulle in Paris (pictured) and Heathrow are among the worst for disrupted flights . All flights that leave from an EU airport, regardless of airline or destination, are covered by EU Regulations EC 261/2004 which guarantees eligible passengers compensation of up to £475 for disruptions. Likewise, passengers entering the EU on flights operated by EU carriers are also covered. Despite this, airlines often avoid paying out by blaming disruptions on causes such as unspecified technical issues and severe weather conditions. As little as two per cent of eligible passengers successfully receive compensation, meaning that an estimated £185 million per year has gone unclaimed, totally more than £3.5 billion in total since the regulation was introduced ten years ago. 1.Paris - Charles de Gaulle . 2.

In June, the UK courts ruled in favour of a passenger who fought a  three year legal battle with  Jet2 to prove that the low-cost airline was unfounded in claiming that routine technical problems could be considered ‘extraordinary circumstances.’ The airline has now applied to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court. 'The recent ruling of the courts is a positive step that should encourage more passengers to stand up to airlines and assert their rights,' says Eve Buechner, founder and CEO of refund.me. 'Nevertheless, on the whole awareness remains relatively low, something that airlines take full advantage of to avoid paying out.

"From soaking up some culture in Paris and Amsterdam to watching the autumn leaves change colour in New England, the Goldfinger and The Avengers star reveals her favourite destinations and most memorable holidays... WHERE DO YOU HOLIDAY? I adore short trips to Paris or Amsterdam where I can visit the galleries. But my favourite type of holiday is a villa with a garden and a swimming pool with my two grown-up children and grandchildren. Culture: Blackman loves short trips to Paris or Amsterdam (pictured right) to visit the many art galleries . FAVOURITE DESTINATION? Spain, where I have a small place. I do love sunshine. When I was married to my second husband, Maurice Kaufman, we used to cover ourselves in oil and turn over as if on a spit. Now I retire to the shade. MOST MEMORABLE TRIP? I made Shalako in Spain with Sean Connery as well as The Man In The Moon. I took the children to Sydney for eight months when I was appearing in Move Over Mrs Markham. For Goldfinger, made in 1964, we filmed in Kentucky and Miami as well as Pinewood. On location: Honor with co-star Sean Connery while they were filming Goldfinger in 1964 . Heading Down Under: Honor lived in Sydney for eight months while she was filming Move Over Mrs Markham . WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT? I'd love to be in New England when all the leaves are so colourful in the autumn. WITH WHOM DO YOU TRAVEL? Ideally I'd like never to travel without my children and grandchildren. For my recent birthday [Honor turned 89 last month], my son took me on a wonderful short holiday to Sussex. Well-travelled: Honor as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger and, right, looking glamorous at an event in 2008 . Colourful: Blackman says she would love to take a trip to New England in the autumn . HOW DO YOU PASS THE TIME AT THE AIRPORT AND ON FLIGHTS? At the moment any spare time is spent writing my memories of being a World War II evacuaee for a forthcoming BBC TV programme. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Goldfinger, in which Honor played Pussy Galore.","Actress loves short trips to Paris or Amsterdam to visit the galleries .

"For at least a decade I have been bombarded with proclamations from friends and strangers that Croatia is the most beautiful place in the world. Having travelled a fair portion of the planet in my 28 years, I denied that anywhere could match Rome, my favourite city. But at last I decided to put it to the test - and found myself sitting at Gatwick Airport, arms tightly folded, marinaded in a light scepticism. Our time was limited, so we chose just three portions of Croatia, starting in Dubrovnik. Simply gorgeous: Jameela's travels took her across to the fabled Croatian island of Brac . We landed at 9pm and were taken straight to our hotel, the Valamar President Hotel up in the hills, a ten-minute drive from the popular old town. From the outside it looks like a golf course. From the inside, it looks like somewhere Brangelina would stay. (Cue me immediately looking around for Brangelina. They weren't there.) To call this hotel grand would be a vast understatement. It had the panoramic views of the ocean and the space and luxury that I've not yet encountered anywhere before. I skipped all the way to my room. My boyfriend was mortified. At £200 a night (although it would have been far cheaper had I not booked about 15 minutes before we left for the airport...), I hoped for something relatively decent. But a lovely kingsize room, with full patio and breakfast table, practically on the private beach was not what I was expecting. One very inelegant hop over my balcony and I would be feet-on-sand. Morning came after a wonderful sleep and the view was officially ridiculous. Miles and miles of perfectly clear-blue Adriatic Sea, surrounded by untouched islands and peppered with the odd palm tree for effect. I headed with caution to the breakfast 'buffet'. I hate the word buffet. You're often greeted by slightly cold, very salty, mass-cooked slop. But not here. A long-term ambition: Jameela had wanted to visit Croatia for a long time - but was unprepared for its beauty . Here I walked into the kind of breakfast selection that gives you a panic attack. 'How the hell can I get all of this into my mouth before 11am?' Tailor-made omelettes and pancakes cooked by on-hand chefs. Beautiful fruits, cheeses, fresh smoothies, sausages, vegetables and delicious Croatian cakes. This was simply not conducive to having to wear a bikini. Once I had consumed enough for a small family, and was barely able to breathe, I rolled on to the private hotel beach. Luxury loungers, fluffy towels, perfect, clean, calm sea... Water sports heavily available, lots of water toys for babies and very disabled- and family-accessible. One tip: as Croatia is certainly rocky, buy those hideous aqua shoes. Don't go in the sea barefoot. In my first hour I stepped on a sea urchin that gifted me with about 40 spines, wedged deep into my foot. I can't recall that kind of pain before. The pain led me to say the most unbelievable thing out loud: 'Oh God, I wish I had a pair of Crocs' (said by nobody under 85, ever). But seriously, do it. By 8 o'clock we headed out to the famed Dubrovnik old town, which is hidden within enormous stone walls. Everything inside is made of marble, so you walk into what feels like a grand, pristine film set, bursting with character and beautiful architecture. A city of star quality: Jameela was captivated by the history and beauty of Dubrovnik . It is insane to think that little over 20 years ago the place was brutally bombed in the 1991 siege. It is therefore doted upon and cherished by its residents. The restaurants are busy and full of traditional Italian cuisine (pizza, pasta, fish). And the town is packed with young people. The little alleys contain quaint bars with the steps covered in cushions for passers-by to rest and drink. The atmosphere is bustling and alive. It's genuinely one of the most stunning places I have ever seen. It takes hours to investigate every nook and cranny and every staggering view at the top of the enormous flights of marble stairs. We went back three nights in a row, each time sampling different alleyway restaurants and bars. They all have pretty much the same food, same price, same menu, same standard, so I won't tell you where to go. Just avoid the main courtyard as the touristic nature diminishes the standard of food. And the pizza looks a week old. Eurgh. After only three days investigating Dubrovnik and falling madly in love with the sights, I had shamelessly replaced Rome with this as my favourite city. Already. Unthinkable. Youthful vibe: Split is a city with a real party spirit, according to Jameela . Next, on to Split, a three-hour scenic bus journey up the coast. As we drove into town, I was rather concerned that it looked like a lads' holiday destination. The word 'kebab' was written everywhere. But as we got closer to the centre, where our hotel was, the architecture and peace made a strong comeback. We had booked into the Cornaro Hotel. To get in, you walk through a charming pink courtyard, where you are met by staff so friendly and helpful you almost feel suspicious. We Brits are savages in comparison with the service you get in Croatia. We were taken up to our room through a cute hotel with the decor of a plush luxury yacht on the inside and into our lovely deluxe room. Everything was new and modern but still very elegant. The bed was comfortable and the room very quiet, despite being in the heart of the action. Breakfast was OK. Get there on the early side as the hot food was barely tepid at 10am. But the pastries were fresh and tasty, and I have never seen such a multicultural breakfast in my life. English fry-up, croissants, German cake, and a very casual tray of crayfish sushi. Split is full of life. But I warn you - it's very young life. The average age is between 18 and 24. You need energy. Loud, pumping open-air bars and clubs line the streets. Once you get into the old town, things quieten down and you can have some lovely grilled fish in the courtyards. The hotel staff recommended a restaurant called NoStress, so we went. Terrible name. Mediocre starter and absolutely excellent main course. The kind of chicken and fish that makes you slightly emotional. I highly recommend it. After that we sauntered along the beautifully preserved palace walls, apparently haunted by ghosts, none of which I was greeted by, thank God. Away from it all: As well as beaches of varying crowdedness, Brac deals in quiet island charm . Shops are open till late and you are merely five minutes from the port, which is home to some of the most incredible yachts I have ever seen. (I looked around for Brangelina again. Not here either.) The next day I decided Split was a little too restless for me. So I hopped on a very cheap ferry (they leave every hour and a half until midnight) to the nearest island, Brac. It was 45 painless minutes, and so worth it. Such a charming place - by far the most family-friendly I have ever visited. Plentiful water activities for children, clean beaches and the prettiest port in Croatia so far. Brac is known for its V-shaped beach, Bol. I didn't bother. It's an expensive cab ride to and fro, there is no shade, and it is rammed with tourists. Instead, walk from the ferry and find your own pretty little coves, visited only by locals and with the kind of views that are completely overwhelming. The kind of views that can make you forget that you have cellulite, or even what your name is. For dinner we ventured to a quaint little restaurant called Vila Dora, in a corner by the port. Beautiful, simple, fresh food - it was the best meal in Croatia so far. Bravo. We hopped on the ferry back and had our last sleep in Croatia. It was miserable to be leaving. The final day was spent wandering around Split's lovely old town, full to the brim with people wearing ancient Roman clothing acting out historical scenes in the streets to the delight of the crowds, mostly the women. The soldiers wear very little skirts. And Croatian men are HOT. (Wear sunglasses if with partner to allow you to ogle in peace.) Generally I give what I saw of Croatia five stars. What a beautiful country, what lovely people. What a relaxed and welcoming place that has over-come staggering adversity to become one of the most desirable spots on the planet. I was horrified to be leaving and I booked my next trip there the minute I finished this review. Sorry Rome. Prestige .

"Lewis Hamilton won a controversial Italian Grand Prix that conspiracy theorists believe was rigged by Mercedes. Triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart joined fans on social media in questioning whether Nico Rosberg deliberately drove off the track to let Hamilton through to win to atone for causing the pair’s crash at Spa a fortnight ago. Stewart said: ‘I thought, “hello, what’s going on here?”’ He could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he didn’t.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg: I simply messed up at Monza .

Pivotal: By the time the German had negotiated the bollards Hamilton had emerged into the lead . Rosberg and his Mercedes management both flatly dismissed the claims, and the majority of people in the paddock agreed it was extremely unlikely that Rosberg gave way deliberately. The German driver was also quick to deny the claims. He said: 'I just messed up. What would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately? There is no possible reason. ‘If you’re ordered by the team to do it then you would do it, but there is no reason why the team would ask me to change position, or something like that. ‘The only thing in people’s minds could be Spa, but Spa was a mistake I’ve apologised for. It’s not like we are now starting to shuffle our cars.’ How the drama unfolded: Rosberg's odd mistake heading into turn one at Monza . Hamilton’s first win since the British Grand Prix in July, takes him to within 22 points of championship-leader Rosberg, who was booed by British fans, angered by the events of Spa, on the podium after coming second. The two Mercedes drivers stayed apart in the ante-room prior to the presentations. Rosberg spoke to third-placed Felipe Massa in Italian, while Hamilton faced the wall. Jean Alesi, conducting the podium interviews, asked Hamilton if he and Rosberg are now friends. As he answered unconvincingly, the Briton put his arm around Rosberg, who looked uncomfortable as his rival did so. But Hamilton, who had to come from behind after a technical problem at the start, agreed the race was not rigged, saying of the decisive moment in the race: ‘It was the best time to put pressure on him. I did it a couple of races ago and he doesn’t seem to like it, so I’ll try it a bit more. ‘We’ve got a long way to go, but one step at a time. The support I’ve had from the fans and family has been incredible. I’m going to take that energy and try and move forwards.

"Mario Balotelli will fully co-operate with the Football Association after they asked him to explain why alleged anti-Semitic comments appeared on his Instagram account. The Liverpool striker has until 6pm on Friday to provide his observations in relation to a post that sparked controversy on Monday night. Balotelli reposted an image of the computer game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers responds to recent Mario Balotelli controversy . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli posted the image (left) on Instagram on Monday before swiftly deleting it . Balotelli has not impressed at Liverpool since arriving this summer and is yet to score a Premier League goal . Italian striker Balotelli posted a defence for the image on Monday night, saying his mother is Jewish . Balotelli wrote this apology on Twitter on Tuesday morning, claiming his post was meant to be 'anti-racist' Balotelli’s alleged anti-Semitic Instagram post could see him face a claim from Nintendo for both copyright and trade mark infringement, says a leading law firm . Balotelli's post included a picture of Super Mario, which could land him in trouble with Nintendo, according to Irwin Mitchell. 'The use of Nintendo’s image for these purposes could get him into hot water for both copyright and trade mark infringement, especially given the content which could be said to bring Nintendo’s rights into disrepute or be denigrated,' said Georgie Collins of the London firm. But below, it continued: ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’ He subsequently apologised on Twitter on Tuesday for reposting the image and insisted that the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’. His statement read: ‘I apologise if I have offended anyone… I now understand that out of context may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money. ‘I used a cartoon by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive. I am sorry.’ The FA, however, will continue their investigation and they can impose a minimum ban of five matches if they believe Balotelli has ‘brought the game into disrepute by making comments which included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race’. Balotelli was pictured wearing a jacket with a ripped design on a night out in Manchester on Sunday night . Balotelli was spotted leaving The Milton Club in the city centre a day after Liverpool beat Stoke at Anfield . Balotelli will miss Liverpool's match at Leicester City on Tuesday with a groin injury . Balotelli has failed to win over many Liverpool fans due to his poor form since a £16m summer transfer . Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches and fined £80,000 by the FA in February of this year after making the controversial 'quenelle' gesture after scoring for West Brom against West Ham. The Frenchman denied that his 'inverted Nazi salute' was anti-Semitic. Nicolas Anelka, for example, was banned for five matches in February and fined £80,000 after making the ‘quenelle’ gesture when he scored for West Brom against West Ham. It is the same aggravated rule breach for which Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Chelsea’s John Terry were found guilty of on-field abuse of rival players. A Liverpool spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player. We will be speaking to the player about this issue.’ Balotelli's mocked up picture, pretending to show Luis Suarez's biting his arm, was also deleted on Monday . The original picture was taken by a man wearing a USA shirt, and has been adapted by the Italian striker . Balotelli has consulted with Liverpool officials and will be given guidance during the coming days as he seeks to accurately explain his post, but he has not yet spoken to manager Brendan Rodgers. He remained on Merseyside yesterday, as Liverpool’s manager took the team for last night’s 3-1 win at Leicester City. Rodgers said after the game he knew little about an FA racism probe but would get up to speed on the situation today. The FA’s investigation comes on the back of the controversy surrounding comments Wigan owner Dave Whelan made after appointing Malky Mackay, which include him saying in a newspaper interview that ‘Jewish people chase money more than everybody else’. Balotelli is not the first player to find himself in trouble for making remarks on social media. Rio Ferdinand was fined £25,000 and banned for three games after being found guilty of an abusive tweet which contained the derogatory word ‘sket’. Ferdinand was found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 for calling Ashley Cole a ‘Choc ice’ on Twitter in 2012. Balotelli has frequently been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons since he joined Liverpool for £16million in August. He was quizzed by police in October in relation to an allegation that he threatened a woman in Manchester. His form when he has played has also been poor. Balotelli has not scored in the Barclays Premier League, his only goals coming at Anfield against Ludogorets in the Champions League and Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup. Sportsmail takes a look at some of Mario Balotelli's on and off-field incidents during his time in English football. CAR CRASH (August 2010) Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli is found to be carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police ask why, he reportedly replies: 'Because I am rich.' FIRST RED CARD (November 2010) Balotelli scores his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement is marred when he is sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu. WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010) City boss Roberto Mancini says Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award. DART-THROWING INCIDENT (March 2011) Balotelli again hits trouble after it emerges he threw a dart at a City youth team player. No one was hurt in the incident and he escapes punishment. SECOND RED CARD (March 2011) Balotelli apologises to his team-mates after he is sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov. BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011) Balotelli is immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against the Los Angeles Galaxy. FIREWORKS AT HOME (October 2011) Ten firefighters used breathing apparatus as they put out a blaze at Balotelli's  £7,500-a-month house in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, after fireworks were set off in a bathroom. The Italian was left with a repair bill of £400,000. THIRD RED CARD (November 2011) The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrives in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards. BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011) Balotelli breaks a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea. RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011) Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracts negative headlines after pictures emerge of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards. PARKER CLASH (January 2012) Balotelli is charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match. INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012) Balotelli gatecrashes the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach. FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012) Balotelli is sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. Also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song.

"A Mississippi woman was sentenced to life in prison today for murder after injecting a woman with illegal silicone buttocks. Tracey Lynn Garner of Jackson was sentenced Tuesday in Hinds County Circuit Court. Garner was convicted Friday of depraved heart murder and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was sentenced to five years on the wire fraud charge. Garner was charged in the death of Karima Gordon who, prosecutors say, was lured to Jackson by Garner to perform the injections. Gordon, an Atlanta-area resident, died eight days after receiving the injections in 2012.

Prosecutors say Gordon and a friend were referred to Garner by Natasha Stewart, an adult entertainer also known as Pebbelz Da Model. Stewart was convicted of manslaughter in February and is serving a seven-year prison sentence. The prosecution said Stewart told Gordon that Garner was a nurse. During the trial, defense attorney John Colette suggested that Gordon wanted exactly what Garner had to offer. 'She wanted this underground, bargain basement butt enhancement,' Colette said. He . also stated that Gordon had other injections that could have caused her . death, and argued that the silicone found in Gordon's body didn't match . silicone seized from Garner's Jackson home. 'We don't know how much she'd gotten before she ever came to Mississippi,' Colette said. 'What silicone caused her death?'

"Nature is believed to kill off around one in every ten million animals each year. At this rate, for every 10,000 species of mammal on the planet, an entire species will have become extinct in the last millennium. But now that humans are on the scene, species are dying off as much as 1,000 times faster than they did 60 million years ago, according to a new US study. Nature is believed to kill off around one in every ten million animals each year. Pictured is a Sumatran orangutan twenty-four year old female, named Ratna, playing with her female baby, named Global. The Sumatran oranguatan are critically endangered . The study at Brown University analysed genetic variation in the family trees of a number of plant and animal species to look at how they spread over time. It also looked at fossil records. Previous estimates looked only at fossils, which the authors said made previous estimates on extinction rates inaccurate as it didn't consider the exact species. Scientists calculated a 'normal background rate' of extinction of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year. Past estimates for the normal background rate was 10 yearly extinctions for 10 million species. The new study found the pre-human extinction rate was 10 times lower than scientists had believed, which means that the current level is 10 times worse.

Future extinction rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher than nature's rates of extinction. Pictured is a golden snub-nosed monkey in China. The species is on the endangered list . 'This reinforces the urgency to conserve what is left and to try to reduce our impacts. It was very, very different before humans entered the scene,' said Jurriaan de Vos, a Brown University Phd researcher. And they believe future extinction rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher than nature's rates of extinction. 'It's rather like your bank account on the day you get paid,' said Mr de Vos. 'It gets a burst of funds — akin to new species — that will quickly become extinct as you pay your bills.' This paper follows a recent one in Science that tracks where species that are threatened or confined to small ranges around the world. A white-footed sportive lemur in Madagascar (left) and a giant panda (right), both endangered. The main cause of extinctions is thought to be human population growth . In most cases, the main cause of extinctions is human population growth, although the paper also says how humans have been able to promote conservation. 'We've known for 20 years that current rates of species extinctions are exceptionally high,' said Stuart Pimm, president of the conservation nonprofit organisation SavingSpecies. 'This new study comes up with a better estimate of the normal background rate — how fast species would go extinct were it not for human actions. 'It's lower than we thought, meaning that the current extinction crisis is much worse by comparison.' Five times, a vast majority of the world's life has been snuffed out in what have been called mass extinctions, often associated with giant meteor strikes. End-Ordovician mass extinction . The first of the traditional big five extinction events, around 440 million years ago, was probably the second most severe. Virtually all life was in the sea at the time and around 85 per cent of these species vanished. Late Devonian mass extinction . About 375-359 million years ago, major environmental changes caused a drawn-out extinction event that wiped out major fish groups and stopped new coral reefs forming for 100 million years. End-Permian mass extinction (the Great Dying) The largest extinction event and the one that affected the Earth’s ecology most profoundly took place 252 million years ago. As much as 97% of species that leave a fossil record disappeared forever. End-Triassic mass extinction . Dinosaurs first appeared in the Early Triassic, but large amphibians and mammal-like reptiles were the dominant land animals.

"The Pentagon claims that roughly a dozen Americans have joined ISIS forces in Syria. They are just a few of the more than 100 Americans to join one of the numerous rebel groups filing the country. The new figures come as a clarification of recent comments by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The Pentagon has confirmed that roughly a dozen Americans have joined ISIS forces in Syria . Secretary . of Defense Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the problem of 'foreign . fighters' aiding the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham . (ISIS) includes far more Americans than has been previously reported – . at least 100 and counting. 'We . have acknowledged publicly we are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who . have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL . forces,' he said during a televised interview. 'There may be more. We don't know.' ISIL is another term for ISIS. ABC News reports that previously it was assumed only a small number of the Americans believed to be in Syria were fighting alongside ISIS. 'We believe that there are approximately . 100 American passport holders operating inside of Syria, we don’t know . specifically who they are aligning themselves with.  We believe that . there are maybe a dozen that are with ISIL,' Col. Steve Warren said. The Americans are far from being unique. It's estimated more than 12,000 foreign fighters have joined rebel groups across the region over the last three years, an estimated 1,000 of whom are European. Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told reporters: 'many of these foreign fighters have joined ISIL’s ranks, and the group may use these fighters to conduct external attacks.' He added that these groups do not have the ability to launch large-scale attacks on U.S. soil as al Qaeda has. U.S. officials estimate ISIS now numbers as many as 10,000 fighters on both sides of the Syria-Iraq border. A few of the American members . have been killed on the battlefield, including 29-year-old . Somali-American Abdirahmaan Muhumed, was employed cleaning jetliners for . Delta Airlines before he left the U.S. to fight for the terror group. Another, . Douglas McArthur McCain, was killed in Syria weeks ago. It emerged . later that he was a close friend of another foreign fighter, Troy . Kastigar, who was killed in 2009 after joining the al-Shabab terror . network in Somalia. Chuck Hagel said more than 100 Americans are fighting in the Middle East alongside ISIS militants, a dramatic uptick from previous estimates of about a dozen . Foreign fighter: Abdirahmaan Muhumed, pictured in Syria, was killed while fighting for ISIS. He had access to planes at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport before he joined the Islamist terror group . All . three hailed from the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, in an area with a . concentrated Muslim population and at least one mosque tied to radical . anti-American ideology. The New York Times reported . six days ago that according to American intelligence and law . enforcement agencies, 'nearly a dozen Americans' had traveled to Syria . to fight for ISIS. The Economist magazine . put the number at 70 on Tuesday, citing a mishmash of statistics from . the International Monetary Fund, the London-based International Centre . for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, and the New . York-based Soufan Group. But hard numbers have been hard to come by, and Hagel's admission sheds new light on the size of the problem. U.S. officials have warned that Americans who could use their passports to . bring the ISIS fight back home pose one of the greatest homeland . security threats to the United States since the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in . 2001. Speaking . Tuesday at the White House, Obama's chief spokesman said that the U.S. officials 'have been focused on countering the threat' for months. 'The . Department of State in March appointed Ambassador Robert Bradtke as . senior adviser for partner engagement on Syria foreign fighters,' White . House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'So . there’s been an intensive diplomatic effort to coordinate our efforts . to confront and mitigate this threat. There’s been significant . operational collaboration between DHS, FBI and all of their foreign . counterparts, including Interpol, on this effort. President Obama drew criticism Wednesday in Estonia for backing off of his resolve to 'destroy' ISIS with a weaker pledge to make it 'manageable' Douglas McArthur McCain (left), who died fighting for ISIS in Syria this year, was a high school pal of Troy Kastigar (right), who died fighting for al-Shabab in Somalia in 2009 . Hagel said Wednesday that with so many American passport-holders able to re-enter the U.S. after joining the ISIS jihad, 'we can't take a chance ... on saying, ""Well, let's technically define this. Is it a real threat today or tomorrow?""' He reiterated the resolve of U.S. officials including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to wipe the Islamist terror group off the map. America's mission in Iraq, Hagel said on CNN, is 'not ""contain."" It’s exactly what the president said: ""degrade and destroy"".' Obama caught flak on Wednesday morning in Estonia for waffling between hard-line and soft-pedal positions on the Islamist group that has cut a wide and deadly swath through massive portions of eastern Syria and northern Iraq. The primary U.S. objective 'is to degrade and destroy' ISIS 'so that it’s no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States,' the president said during a press conference. But minutes later he said a successful American effort in the region would 'shrink' the group's 'sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.' Obama arrived at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England on Wednesday ahead of a NATO summit . The president was greeted by an American entourage led by U.S. Ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun . Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt was among the lawmakers who lashed out later in the day. 'Terrorists who behead Americans are not ""manageable,"" Blunt said in a statement. 'They must be stopped, and we need President Obama to communicate a clear strategy and goals on how he plans to eliminate this threat.' Hagel, meanwhile, clung to Obama's first statement while ignoring the second. 'You've got to destroy it,' he said of ISIS, 'because if we don't destroy it, it will get worse.' The soft-spoken defense secretary stopped short of offering any guarantees, however. 'Vows are something beyond my mortal capacity of doing,' he said. 'We will do everything possible that we can do to destroy their capacity to inflict harm on our people and Western values and our interests.' The Pentagon will achieve the White House's strategic objectives, Hagel explained, by cooking up a menu of tactical options for Obama to choose from. Steven Sotloff (left) was beheaded in a gruesome video distributed by ISIS this week, following a heart-rending videotaped appeal to the terror group's leaders last week from his mother (right) 'Our mission,' he said, 'is to provide him those options and those plans to accomplish the mission of ""destroy and degrade"" the capability of ISIS.' And speaking of the growing number of Americans who have taken up arms against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East, he conceded that 'this crowd is a dangerous crowd.' 'This crowd is as dangerous a group of people – beyond just terrorists – they are an army,' he said, 'marrying this with an ideology and a capacity to do things.' 'They control half of Iraq today. They control half of Syria today. We better be taking them seriously.' Obama will lead a UN Security Council meeting this month devoted to the question of how to handle foreign fighters and whether to restrict their movements. British Prime Minister David Cameron has called for new anti-terrorism powers to limit their access to the UK and determine where they can and can't go. Kerry said earlier in the day that American might would pursue the killers of two American journalists whose beheadings were captured on video and spread globally through social media. '[T]hose who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria,' he vowed, 'should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.'","Statement came to clarify US defense secretary hint that a growing number of Americans are taking up arms with jihadi army in Iraq and Syria – more than 100, up from just a dozen estimated a week ago .

"In the early years of shirt numbers in football, a player's position determined what he wore on his back. Defenders had two to six, wingers seven or 11, and strikers either nine or 10. But recent decades have seen a considerable shift. Goalkeepers with No 9, midfielders with No 1, and even small mathematical sums have made it on to the back of players' shirts. With Mario Balotelli moving to Liverpool and wearing his favoured No 45 shirt, Sportsmail looks at some of the strangest choices, and the reasoning behind them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mario Balotelli and Ronaldinho . Come in, No 45: Mario Balotelli with his new Liverpool shirt and favoured number . Ivan Zamarano . The Chile forward enjoyed considerable success while in Europe, particularly at Real Madrid where he scored 77 goals in 137 games. But when his form earned him a move to Inter Milan, the No 9 shirt was already taken by Ronaldo. With his second choice, No 10, occupied by Roberto Baggio the former Sevilla man was forced to improvise. Zamorano went for No 18, but inserted a small plus sign in between the two numbers so that it added up to nine. Sums: When Ivan Zamorano moved to Inter his favourite N0 9 shirt was taken, so he opted for one plus eight . This tactic has been copied since by a number of players including Clinton Morrison at Coventry and Ade Akinbiyi at Crystal Palace. Ossie Ardiles . At the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Argentina decided to organise their squad numbers alphabetically. For Ossie Ardiles, this meant enjoying the novelty of being one of the few outfield players ever to wear the No 1 shirt. The only member of the squad that this rule did not apply to was Diego Maradona, who wore his favourite No 10 shirt (he would have been No 12 otherwise). Pantelis Kafes, who wore the No 1 shirt at Olympiacos, said he did so because of his admiration for Ardiles. Alphabetical: Ossie Ardiles (left) wears his No 1 shirt but an exception was made for Diego Maradona . Lucky: Mario Balotelli has worn No 45 at every club he has played for because it is his 'lucky' number . Mario Balotelli . Liverpool's latest signing has worn the No 45 shirt at Inter Milan, Manchester City, AC Milan and now at Anfield. Although there had been rumours that the Italy forward had chosen 45 because the two numbers add up to nine, Balotelli insisted it was because the number brings him luck. He said: 'When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No 45 because the numbers for young players were from No 36 to No 50. 'I took No 45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games. It brings me luck and that's why I've always kept No 45.' David Beckham . A recipient of Manchester United's fabled No 7 shirt for the majority of his career, the former England captain didn't have it all his own way when he moved to Real Madrid in 2003. His preferred shirt number was then occupied by Real's legendary forward Raul. Unperturbed, Beckham opted for the No 23 instead. The reason, Beckham claimed, was that Michael Jordan had worn the same number at the Chicago Bulls. Admiration: When Beckham moved to Real Madrid he chose No 23 because he was a fan of Michael Jordan . AC Milan trio . In 2008, AC Milan signed Andriy Shevchenko, Ronaldinho and Mathieu Flamini. But the preferred squad numbers for all three players were already occupied. As a result they chose to be numbers 76, 80 and 84 respectively - the years in which they were born. Jorge Campos . The Mexican goalkeeper, who played 130 games for his country, opted for the No 9 shirt. Campos had been a striker as a youth player and despite his success at the other end of the pitch he never lost the desire to play outfield. Birthday: Clarence Seedorf wore Ronaldinho's favourite No 10 at Milan so he chose 80 instead (born in 1980) Rogerio Ceni . Sao Paulo's attack-minded goalkeeper has scored more than 100 goals for the Brazilian club. While he normally plays in the No 1 shirt, he has experimented with a slightly more unusual option. In 2005 he broke the appearance record for the Tricolor and wore No 618 - the number of matches he had played for them - in a match against Atletico Miniero. Ronaldo . After an incredible career that took him from PSV and Barcelona to Inter and Real Madrid, Ronaldo moved to AC Milan where he adopted the No 99 shirt. After numerous rumours that his new number was born out of his love for 99 Flake ice creams, the Brazilian striker clarified the situation. He said that Pippo Inzaghi was already occupying the No 9 shirt he wanted, so he chose 99 instead. Ronaldo also played for Corinthians in the No 99 shirt for one match to celebrate the club's 99th anniversary. Bixente Lizarazu . When the French full-back returned for a second spell at Bayern Munich he decided to get a new number on the back of his shirt. After some crude speculation the World Cup winner revealed he had opted for No 69 because he was born in 1969 and was 1.69 metres tall. Speculation:  Bixente Lizarazu said he chose No 69 because it was the year he was born and he was 1.69m tall . Alias: As well as being a footballer Clint Dempsey is also a rapper called Deuce, so he chose No 2 at Tottenham . Clint Dempsey . After spending the majority of his career in England with the No 23, Clint Dempsey was forced to change when he moved to Tottenham. Instead, the American chose No 2. The reason being that in Dempsey's other career (as a rapper) his alias is 'Deuce'. Hicham Zerouali . After moving to Aberdeen in 2000, Moroccan striker Hicham Zerouali became the first and last player ever to wear the No 0 shirt in Scottish football history. Zerouali chose the number as he was nicknamed 'Zero'. Both the Scottish Premiership and Premier League outlawed it the following year. Nicklas Bendtner . The Danish striker predominantly cause headlines for off-field reasons during his time at Arsenal, and in 2009 his name hit the headlines when he changed his shirt number shortly before the start of the new season. Bendtner chose the No 52, which he said was lucky for him - although there was considerable speculation that it was linked to his weekly pay packet. He did at least offer to cover the costs for fans who had bought his old shirt. He said: 'I appreciate that a good number of fans have bought their kits for 2009/10 already with names and numbers printed up so I’d like to personally cover the cost of replacing anyone’s shirt that has my previous number.' Unique: Hicham Zerouali became the first and last player ever to wear the No 0 shirt in Scottish football . Larry Walker . The right fielder who played for the Montreal Expos, Colorado Rockies and St Louis Cardinals was incredibly superstitious. Walker insisted on having the number 33 shirt throughout his career because three was his lucky number. He didn't stop there, though. Walker also insisted his phone numbers had as many threes in them as possible and got married on November 3 at 3.33pm. Dennis Rodman . Five-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman is far from shy when it comes to making a statement. And the former Chicago Bulls man was no different when it came to his shirt numbers. Rodman was the first player in NBA history to wear both the No 91 shirt. Rodman wore it because the two numbers add up to 10, the number he wanted, which was occupied by Bob Love when he moved to Chicago. Obsessed: Larry Walker wanted is many threes in his life as possible, including on his shirt .","Mario Balotelli has always worn No 45 because it brings him luck .

"Humanity, says Brian Cox, could be wiped out by asteroids – and we’re not taking the threat seriously . Brian Cox isn’t a man to mince his words. He famously described the belief that the world is 6,000-years-old as ‘b*****ks’ and those who think the planet would end because of the Mayan calendar as ‘morons.’ But, lately, something far more serious has been weighing on the mind of the Oldham physicist. Humanity, he says, is at risk of being wiped out by asteroids – and we’re not taking the threat seriously. ‘There is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us,’ Professor Cox told MailOnline. In fact, the Earth had a ‘near-miss’ only a few months ago. ‘We didn’t see it,’ says the 46-year-old. ‘We saw it on the way out, but if it had just been a bit further over it would have probably wiped us out. These things happen.’ The bus-sized asteroid, named 2014 EC, came within 38,300 (61,637km) miles of Earth in March - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet. And it wasn’t the only one threatening Earth. Nasa is currently tracking 1,400 'potentially hazardous asteroids' and predicting their future approaches and impact probabilities. The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact. The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact . No one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox tells MailOnline. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it.’ For instance, earlier this year US researchers revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching Earth with nuclear weapons. The Iowa team outlined their vision at a Nasa conference, and say they would need just a weeks’ notice to launch if the system were developed. But ideas such as this aren’t progressing fast enough, says Cox. ‘I think its human stupidity we need to worry about. No one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox tells MailOnline. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it’ Dramatic proof that any of these can strike Earth came on 15 February last year, when an unknown object exploded high above Chelyabinsk, Russia, with 20–30 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic . ‘It’s the way we behave, but also just the way we don’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could.’ ‘We just don’t. I mean, you can see it by the figures. We spend virtually as much on it as everyone else, which is sod all.’ Last year, global spending on government space programs dropped for the first time in almost two decades. The UK now spends nearly £300 million ($500 million) on civil space programmes, while the US, invests $38.7 billion (£23.3 billion) on its space budget. Professor Cox says this is not nearly enough. Highlighting something known as the Drake equation, he said the time is ticking for humanity. The equation was thought up by Dr Frank Drake to bound the terms involved in estimating the number of technological civilisations that may exist in our galaxy. The aftermath of Chelyabinsk. Although Nasa is monitoring the skies, no one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox tells MailOnline. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about that’ In it, he claimed that the time it would take for a technological civilisation to self-destruct would be around 200 years. ‘That might not be a bad estimate, actually,’ says Cox. ‘If you think about it, we almost did it with the Cuban missile crisis. ‘We may almost be doing it again. It’s not clear, the way we’re dealing with the environment. ‘But we’ve been close to wiping ourselves out, only a few hundred years after we became a technological civilisation.’ And it’s not just asteroids we should worry about, climate change and artificial intelligence are also key concerns. The only way to deal with it is to spend more money on research and education, to improve our, he says. Professor Cox is currently working to inspire the next generation of scientists with his involvement in science summer school in St Paul’s Way Trust School (SPWTS) in Poplar, Tower Hamlets. He says our best hope of mitigating threats such as these is to actively pursue more knowledge, bridge the skills gap in science and engineering and increase our spending on research. It’s not just asteroids we should worry about, climate change and artificial intelligence are also at the top of the astrophysicist's list. 'Conscious things are notoriously difficult to deal with,' said Cox. 'Look at humans’ ‘I mean, you are talking about the far future. And things you say about the far future often sound fantastical. But [the threat of artificial intelligence] is a legitimate question. ‘If you think the brain is basically a computing device, but a very complicated one, then presumably it operates according to the known laws of physics and therefore you should be able to simulate them. ‘What do you do? It’s an ethical dilemma. I don’t know. Conscious things are notoriously difficult to deal with – look at humans.’ His views echo that of Tesla-founder, Elon Musk, who earlier this year said that the threat of artificial intelligence is more severe than nuclear weapons. ‘Ultimately I would say, it’s about not being so myopic. We know quite a lot about nature,’ says Cox. ‘Let’s say we’re the only civilisation in the Milky Way, which is possible. ‘If you were to sit there from that perspective, to say, how would we rearrange our affairs to protect ourselves because we are the only intelligent civilisation in the galaxy, it wouldn’t be like this…right?’ The date of Earth's potential destruction has been set at 16 March 2880, when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet. Researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart, but somehow remains intact on its Earth-bound trajectory. They believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as van der Waals - and although this is considered a major breakthrough, scientists still don't know how to stop it. The discovery was made by researchers at the University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville. Previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and friction. The asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles (15km) a second relative to the Earth. It is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour. It is estimated that if 1950 DA were to collide with the planet, it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of TNT. Although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent, this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids.","Professor Cox says we recently had a ‘near-miss’ with a large asteroid .

"As MailOnline Sport prepares to lead the way with more Deadline Day exclusives (we broke Ozil to Arsenal and Fellaini to United a year ago), we ask those at the vanguard of our news operation, our brilliant reporters, what to expect with the transfer window poised to slam shut… . IAN LADYMAN - @Ian_Ladyman_DM . 1. Best bit of business so far… Diego Costa to Chelsea. They needed a centre forward so they bought one. 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? I would like to see Sergio Busquets play in the Premier League. Anywhere. 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Daley Blind from Ajax to Manchester United. Best bit of business? Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman is impressed with Chelsea's capture of Diego Costa . 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? In early April 2009 I wrote that Real Madrid had a deal with Manchester United to buy Cristiano Ronaldo for £75m. United denied it and Sir Alex Ferguson was asked about the story and said: 'Look who wrote it.' It wasn’t meant as a compliment and indeed the story was wrong. The fee – confirmed two months later – was £5m more. 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… I would end it when the season starts. Hard to do, of course, unless all the major European leagues agreed to start on the same day. Penned: Cristiano Ronaldo (next to Alfredo di Stefano and Eusebio) signed for Real Madrid five years ago . ROB DRAPER - @draper_rob . 1. Best bit of business so far… Gylfi Sigurdsson from Spurs to Swansea: good player who will thrive back in Wales. Not showing it yet, but Mauricio Isla could be excellent for QPR. 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Radamel Falcao joins Arsenal for £60m - just to make it a three-way title race. 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Daley Blind to Manchester United . 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? The most significant was the transfer of an unknown 16-year-old to Arsenal. It got about 50 words in the paper. I told the desk Cesc Fabregas would be good. 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… Transfer deadline day to become like the NFL draft. All the chief executives to be herded into the NEC Arena, watched by a crowd to do all their business in public. A fleet of helicopters on standby to fly players from around the country for medicals and grand unveilings. Sitting, waiting, wishing: Sportsmail's Rob Draper expects Ajax defender Daley Blind to move to Man United . Young Gun: Cesc Fabregas' move to Arsenal in 2003 went almost unheralded but was noted by Rob Draper . DOMINIC KING - @DominicKing_DM . 1. Best bit of business so far… Manchester City smoothly concluding the contract extensions of their star players. The deals to re-sign David Silva, Vincent Kompany, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero happened during the window. You don’t have to buy players from elsewhere to make your squad stronger. 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Liverpool making a £10million bid to take Petr Cech and being successful with it. Brendan Rodgers needs a keeper, Cech has been ditched by Chelsea. It won’t happen as the clubs won’t do business with each other – as proven by Ryan Bertrand – but it would help Liverpool considerably if it did. 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Danny Welbeck joining Tottenham on loan. Fantasy: Sportsmail's Dominic King wants Liverpool to succeed with a bid for Chelsea's Petr Cech . You're not going over there? Sergio Busquets would be a seen as a major coup for the Premier League . 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Lucien Mettomo to Manchester City from Saint-Etienne in September 2001. I was 23, had the story confirmed by Kevin Keegan one Friday morning and got the tale in print in the old ‘City final’ edition, in the days when evening papers were still published in the evening. Mettomo wasn’t the biggest name, he wasn’t a City great but it was the first time I’d had ‘exclusive’ next to my byline for a transfer story. 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… It doesn’t need changing now. Everyone knows how it works, everyone looks forward to the drama of the final day; let’s just leave it as it is. CRAIG HOPE – @CraigHope_DM . 1. Best bit of business so far… Chelsea identifying what they need – a goalscorer and central midfielder – and duly bringing in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabgreas at a cost of £62million, less than what Manchester United paid for Angel di Maria. Newcastle’s acquisition of £5m Holland right back Daryl Janmaat also looks very shrewd. He’ll no doubt be sold for £12m within the next 18 months, however. 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Newcastle sign a goalscorer, for a half decent side will go to waste without someone to put the ball in the back of the net. To that end, Loic Remy for £10m from QPR would make a lot of sense. Makes sense: Sportsmail's Craig Hope believes Newcastle should shell out £10m for QPR's Loic Remy . Expected: Reading's Alex McCarthy should make the £6m switch to QPR before Monday's deadline . 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Fabio Borini to Sunderland on a season-long loan. The Liverpool striker is still playing a waiting game with the Black Cats - who have had a £14m bid accepted - but the arrival of Mario Balotelli at Anfield could make his mind up and a loan move is more likely. 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? When I was nine years old I saw Sunderland midfielder Paul Bracewell in a restaurant next to St James’ Park. It was close-season and he was with two men in suits. I went home and told all of my friends he was signing for Newcastle, which the very next day he duly did. Today, I would have posted a selfie on Twitter with Bracewell and it would have been on MailOnline within half an hour. As it was back in 1992, I had my exclusive for 24 hours. 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… One?? Undisclosed fees for a start. But while we’re at it, the window should shut on the Thursday before the Premier League season starts. SAMI MOKBEL - @SamiMokbel81_DM . 1. Best bit of business so far… Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea . 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Edinson Cavani to Arsenal . 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy to QPR. £6m. Four-year deal . 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Mesut Ozil to Arsenal, September 2013, and Thierry Henry back to Arsenal on loan. 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… Scrap the winter one and end the summer window the day before the start of the season. Leader of the pack: Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel's biggest exclusive was Mesut Ozil's £42m move to Arsenal . LAURIE WHITWELL - @lauriewhitwell . 1. Best bit of business so far… Diego Costa for £32m will end up looking a snip if his goals win Chelsea the league. 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Arturo Vidal to Manchester United - finally bringing some steel to midfield. 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe to Derby County on loan. 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Georgios Samaras to WBA on a free this summer. Don’t smirk. 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… That it gets smashed into a thousand shards and doesn’t exist. Why don't you come on over? Arturo Vidal should make the move to Manchester United this weekend . JOE BERNSTEIN - @RedJoe31 . 1. Best bit of business so far… Chelsea, Diego Costa . 2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Arjen Robben to Arsenal . 3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Javier Hernandez to Juventus as make-weight in deal to bring Arturo Vidal to Old Trafford . 4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Robbie Keane leaving Liverpool for Spurs after six months . 5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window….

"Guilty: Brenda Charlestain has been sentenced to a year and a half in a federal prison after committing food stamp fraud totalling nearly $24,000 . A former exotic dancer and paralegal accused of spending nearly $24,000 worth of federal aid on plastic surgery, a car stereo system and a pink paint job for her car has been jailed for food stamp fraud. Appearing in Florida courtroom, Brenda Charlestain, 28, testified to being homeless and unemployed when she applied for the aid to help her and her five children. Thanks to her later work dancing, however, she made over $85,000 a year in tips. Charlestain argued that of the accused total a large portion were gifts from male customers at various adult entertainment clubs in Southern Florida, the Sun Sentinel reports. She said $9,187 was gifted to her for cosmetic enhancements and $1,100 for a sound system for her 2008 Dodge Charger - made a bright pink with government money according to prosecutors. Between March of 2010 and June of 2012, court records show she was provided $900 to $1,100 in government aid every month. She said out of her aid and tips she paid $1,200 a month in rent and $326 in monthly car payments. Having pleaded guilty to the federal fraud charges earlier this year, as well as in providing a firearm to a convicted felon, her husband, on Thursday she was sentenced to 1 1/2 years in a federal prison. Begging for leniency from the judge, Charlestain asked for a downgraded sentence to house arrest while stressing various obstacles she has overcome in life, starting with her father's death when she was 10 and becoming pregnant at the age of 14. She said that despite her rough childhood she went on to become a paralegal, though it was a job she said she lost this week with her criminal charges. Two days after her firing she said she obtained a new one working as a receptionist at a medical office. Her attorney earlier this year also fought for her rights to get back to work dancing during her trial, while wearing an ankle monitor if needed. Well spent? Of the accused government aid, a portion was used to paint her 2008 Dodge Charger a bright pink, and several thousand for cosmetic enhancements and her car's sound system (file photo) Dancing denied: Charlestain allegedly attacked another dancer with a high heel at the Sugar Daddy's Cabaret in West Palm Beach preventing her from continuing dancing during her trial . Voodoo: Last week Charlestain was accused of making a threat over her husband Josny Charlestain's arrest, pictured, which was ruled to be only an attempt to block Voodoo . 'Even with an electronic [ankle] monitor the defendant will be able to work and earn income as an adult entertainment dancer sufficient to support herself and her five children, attorney Jack Fleischman wrote, according to the Sentinel. According to prosecutors though, they . said that the environment was no place for her having previously struck . another dancer on the head with 'the heel of a heavy high-heeled shoe' while at Sugardaddy's Adult Cabaret. Staying . in the spotlight, Charlestain made news last week as well after a . prosecutor accused her of threatening a federal employee in a phone . call. Charlestain said . she was only warding off a Voodoo attack her priest had suspected had . been placed on her now mutually jailed husband Josny Charlestain, 28, by . one of his ex-girlfriends. Charlestain said prosecutors had misunderstood her in the court's admitted confusing call that captured her using expletives. In the end, the judge ruled on her Voodoo alibi. 'I think her version makes more sense, . based on what I heard,' Judge Lurana Snow said according to the . Sentinel. 'If you don't believe in Voodoo, this conversation makes no . sense; if you do, it makes perfect sense.'","Brenda Charlestain, 28, sentenced to 1 1/2 years in federal prison .

He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career. ‘I'm lucky I don’t send text messages but I do get silly message with sick jokes on them from time to time.’ Mackay was set to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the FA. Moody, meanwhile, resigned from his position as Palace’s sporting director. On Thursday, the League Managers Association issued a poorly-worded statement on behalf of Mackay - before a backlash forced them into a humbling apology. The original statement read: ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures.

That was certainly not our intention.

"After one false start, the final frontier has finally become open territory for the commercial world, after the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched from Cape Canaveral this morning. The private space cargo firm's historic launch to the International Space Station blasted off at 8.44BST, carrying with it a capsule loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions. Also on-board are the ashes of Star Trek legend James 'Scotty' Doohan, fulfilling his final wish to spend eternity resting in space. Scroll down for video: . Off we go: The Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket is seen during a time exposure as it lifts off from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday, flying off to the ISS . Another timelapse photograph show the rocket's trip into space, as another shuttle sits outside the Cape Canaveral site . Space goes commercial: SpaceX successfully launched this morning at 8.44BST, three days after an aborted attempt . Up, up and away! Sparks fly as the rocket leaves the launch pad and heads to the horizons . The rocket is lost against the inky-black sky during the pre-dawn launch at Cape Canaveral, but the flames light up the surroundings . The mission is the first by a private company to the $100billion orbital outpost, a project of 15 countries. NASA is investing in SpaceX, as well as four other companies, to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles last summer. The first attempt on Saturday stalled, as the countdown reached all the way to practically zero before there was an automatic shutdown by on-board computers. So instead of blasting off from Cape Canaveral on a delivery mission to the International Space Station, the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust. The engine ignition sequence had started up, but there was an automatic shutdown by on-board computers. The unfortunate delay caught even NASA's most seasoned launch commentator off guard. '... 3-2-1, zero, and liftoff,' announced commentator George Diller, his voice trailing as the rocket failed to budge. 'We've had a cutoff. Liftoff did not occur.' Billionaire rocket designer Elon Musk attributed the problem to slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine No. 5. 'Will adjust limits for countdown in a few days,' he wrote via Twitter. Standing tall: Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft, pictured a day before its first launch, are in the final stages of preparation for their historic flight . Along with ISS supplies, SpaceX has one additional payload - sending James 'Scotty from Star Trek' Doohan and 307 other people's ashes into orbit. Having failed to launch the Star Trek acting legend's remains into orbit in August 2008 when Space X's Falcon 1 exploded after take-off, this is the second attempt to put a seven gram capsule of his ashes into space. But friends and relatives of Doohan, who died in 2005 aged 85, who gathered at Cape Canaveral will have to wait until Tuesday for the next attempt after Falcon 9 stalled on lift-off. Paying a minimum of $2,995 to Celestis, Doohan and 307 other people's capsules will be launched from the Falcon 9 rocket nine minutes into the flight. Once there Doohans capsule will begin a decaying orbit of the Earth that will last between 10 to 240 years, 'until it reenters the atmosphere, harmlessly vapourising like a shooting star.' Only governments have completed such a feat to date, with the SpaceX voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm. Ferrying the Dragon capsule into space, the mission to the ISS will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days. If successful in its first-of-a kind mission, the company behind the venture SpaceX would collect the remaining payments on the $396 million contract it has with NASA and then enter into a $1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the ISS. The first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms, SpaceX is hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 rocket suffers from an 'instantaneous launch window' which means that if they don't take off at the exact scheduled moment they will have to wait till 3.44 a.m on Tuesday for the pad and the ISS to line up again. This will be the Falcon's third flight as SpaceX have already sent the projectile into space on two previous occasions. But this will be the first time it will dock with the ISS - signalling the first time a commercial enterprise has ever hooked up with the orbiting space station. However, this mission from a private contractor is not without risk and could very well end in failure, something which SpaceX have been upfront and honest about. 'Demonstration launches are conducted to determine potential issues so that they might be addressed and – by their very nature – carry a significant risk,' said a statement by the private space firm according to the Guardian. 'All spaceflight is incredibly complicated, and this flight introduces a series of new challenges – it is only the third flight of the Falcon 9 rocket, the second of the Dragon capsule, and the first for a number of all-new components necessary to berth with the International Space Station. 'If any aspect of the mission is not successful, SpaceX will learn from the experience and try again.' If all goes well though on the next launch, Falcon 9 will carry the Dragon capsule into space and match orbits with the ISS. Flashback: The launch of Falcon 9 Flight 1 from the SpaceX launch pad at Launch Complex 40, Cape Canaveral, Florida in 2010 . The full flight-ready Falcon 9  (left and right) with Dragon capsule onboard stands on the launch pad at SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, Florida . There it will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly. If that checks out OK, the ISS will allow the Dragon capsule to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph. Staying on board the space station for a week and a half, it will then be re-loaded and sent back to Earth where it will land in the Pacific and be retrieved. The launch and subsequent mission will be nerve-wracking for SpaceX and Elon Musk, the PayPal entrepreneur who founded the space exploration firm. An artists view of the space station's robotic arm reaching out to grab SpaceX's Dragon capsule which will happen if all goes according to plan after this Saturday's launch . 'We have to allow for the fact that this is an extremely complex and tough flight. It's a test flight, not a standard milk run,' said Alan Stern, a U.S aerospace consultant and former associate administrator in charge of science at Nasa according to the New York Times. 'Elon Musk and SpaceX have a tremendous track record, and when Falcon 1 failed, they stuck with it and made it work. 'They will have a failure again, because everyone does, but a test flight is a learning experience. SpaceX tested the Dragon capsules ability to parachute safely (left) and to splash down in the Pacific (right) 'Regardless of how successful the flight is, whether it's complete or partial, it's a big step forward. This is a sea change.' Originally, the plan was for SpaceX and their capsule to have docked with the ISS by 2009. 'Certainly, we would have hoped to have been further ahead,' said Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX  to the New York Times. 'But I wouldn’t have expected that with great confidence.'","Launch was delayed last week after 'computer problems' on board commercial rocket .

"'Narcissist': Notorious serial killer Dennis Nilsen is serving life for six gruesome murders . One of Britain’s most notorious serial killers has had his self-serving and ‘pornographic’ autobiography published while he is in prison – in defiance of a government ban. Dennis Nilsen, a former civil servant and police officer, is serving life for murdering six young men and attempting to kill two others in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Nilsen, who has been told he will never be released from jail - has spent more than a decade fighting for the right to publish his memoirs. But the authorities, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett and the European Court of Human Rights, have repeatedly banned publication, claiming the lurid details of the killings would be distressing to the victims’ families. But now excerpts from his autobiography are being serialised online. Chapters posted over the past few days include material about Nilsen’s early life and his dead grandfather - which is used to justify his later crimes. Postings suggest further material is due to be placed online today and over coming weeks. It is known that copies of the autobiography have been taken out of prison, but it is not clear who is responsible for putting the material on the internet - or whether they are acting on the instructions of the killer. Nilsen is denied access to the internet at Full Sutton maximum security prison near York. Publication of the memoirs are sure to cause further pain for his victims’ families. And last night a leading criminologist condemned the development. Locked up: Nilsen is denied access to the internet at Full Sutton maximum security prison near York . Professor David Wilson, who has met Nilsen and read some of his writing, confirmed that the posts appear to ‘genuinely be the work of the serial killer’. He said he had reported the internet material to the governor of Full Sutton as soon as he became aware of it. Prof Wilson, himself a former prison governor, added: ‘I received two volumes of his autobiography around seven years ago and read them. Then I destroyed them as there was no way they should be made public. I would describe them as pornographic in the manner they presented his crimes. ‘The man is a narcissist and is looking for attention. Whoever has posted this material is entirely wrong in their belief there is educational or criminological value in it. There is not. Genuine: Professor David Wilson, who has met Nilsen, confirmed the posts appear to 'genuinely be the work of the serial killer' ‘It’s worrying that there’s a promise of even more material being published, especially if it describes his crimes. That would be very upsetting for any friends and relatives of his victims.’ Nilsen, 67, grew up in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. After leaving school, he worked as a cook in the Army for 11 years before joining the Metropolitan Police for eight months, then taking a job in the civil service. Between 1978 and 1983, he is believed to have killed at least 15 men and boys. The first was 14-year-old Stephen Holmes, who was last seen on his way home from a rock concert. Targeting mostly homosexuals or the homeless, Nilsen lured his victims to his North London home with offers of food, alcohol or shelter. Having strangled or drowned them, Nilsen kept the bodies, sometimes placing them in his bed for company. Eventually, he would dismember them and hide the remains, storing these under floorboards, in bin bags stuffed into a wardrobe, and even mixed with salt in a tea chest. In 1983, Nilsen was found guilty of six murders and two attempted murders. He is believed to have killed nine other men but always claimed he could not remember their names. The Home Office has said Nilsen will never be released. In 1996 Nilsen wrote his life story, Nilsen: History Of A Drowning Man. A copy was taken out of jail by his then solicitor, but publication was vetoed and the manuscript was not returned. In 2003 Nilsen went to the High Court in London, claiming the book was his property and insisting that any proceeds from publication would go to charity. But the then Home Secretary David Blunkett banned publication. Nilsen went to the European Court of Human Rights two years ago claiming his writings ‘stimulated much academic and medical debate’ – the case was dismissed. The Prison Service said: ‘The Court of Appeal upheld it was lawful for the Prison Service to withhold Dennis Nilsen’s manuscript so that he could not work on it for publication. This remains our position. ‘Prisoners also have no access to the internet other than in controlled circumstances when supervised by staff, and it is a criminal offence to have a mobile phone in prison.’","Dennis Nilsen is serving a life sentence at Full Sutton prison near York .

"Mitt Romney is now tied with Barack Obama in Wisconsin, one of the 'firewall' states the president hoped would protect him against defeats in Florida and Virginia, according to a new poll. Rasmussen found that Romney and Obama were tied on 49 per cent in the state, which Obama won in a 14-point landslide in 2008. Buoyed by internal polling which shows similar numbers, Romney is to head to Wisconsin next week, as first reported by MailOnline last Tuesday. Romney will be campaigning in West Allis on Monday evening. I WILL do that: Romney, pictured here on stage with Meatloaf and Randy Owen in Defiance, Ohio, is catching up with Obama in surprising areas . Countdown: Romney's whirlwind tour of the country will see him go to Winsconsin next week . Crucial: Polls indicate Wisconsin could become the decisive state if Obama holds Ohio . Shining light: Romney wouldn't be wasting his time with a visit to Wisconsin unless he really believed he could snatch the state from Obama . We're with you: Romney is mobbed by supporters at Defiance High School . Romney advisers believe that Governor Scott Walker's recall victory this year gives them an organisational edge in the state. In addition, Representative Paul Ryan, Romney's vice-presidential running mate, is from Wisconsin and the Obama campaign has not spent there on the negative advertising that has been so effective in Ohio. Scott Rasmussen, who conducted the poll of likely voters, said that Wisconsin could become the decisive state in 2012 if Romney takes Florida and Virginia - as current polling suggests - but Obama manages to hold out in Ohio, where he has a wafer-thin poll lead. 'If Ohio goes for the president, Romney has a few perilous paths to victory available to him. All require him to carry Wisconsin and its 10 Electoral College votes,' he wrote on his website. 'The simplest path without Ohio would be for Romney to win Wisconsin, Colorado and one other swing state. It's plausible, but an uphill struggle.' Obama has long believed that Ohio, Nevada and Wisconsin is his firewall. Even if Florida, Virginia, Colorado and New Hampshire topple, victory in those three states would secure him re-election. Now, however, that firewall is under threat. A Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey released on Thursday gave Obama a six-point lead, up from two points three weeks ago, but the Romney campaign points out that PPP is a Democratic firm and the swing of four points towards Obama when almost all other trends are towards Romney is implausible. Candidate time is the most precious resource for a campaign in the closing day and Romney's foray into Wisconsin - his first since August - is an indication his team believes he has a real chance there. The Romney campaign also believes Obama is very vulnerable in Iowa - a favourite state for the president because his caucuses victory there in 2008 was the first step on his road to the White House - and Colorado but in a slightly better position in Nevada. Romney is advertising in Wisconsin and also New Hampshire, which Obama won in 2008 by 10 points. Asked last week whether Romney himself would be visiting Wisconsin in the closing days of the race, Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney adviser, said: 'Yes. Paul Ryan was just in Pittsburgh. We'll be back in Wisconsin, sure. Wisconsin is definitely in play.' Turbulence: President Barack Obama takes the stage at a campaign event at Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland, Ohio, on Thursday night during his punishing campaign tour as he battles to shore up his support . Holding on: Obama believed that Wisconsin was one of three states that would act as a firewall and secure him victory . Comfort: President Barack Obama pauses to greet people as he leaves a campaign office in Chicago, Illinois on Thursday . Fehrnstrom held out the possibility of Romney competing seriously not only in New Hampshire and Wisconsin but also in the big prizes of Pennsylvania and Michigan, which Obama won by 17 points four years ago. Asked about Pennsylvania and Michigan, he said: 'There's places we're going up for the first time,' he said. 'We just bought Boston TV so we can beam into southern New Hampshire because the battle is tightening there. 'All I would say to that is stay tuned. You've seen the polls coming out of those states. It does show a narrowing of the gap and we're watching those very closely.' Another aide predicted that Obama would be travelling to Pennsylvania to protect his turf there. No decision has been made within the Romney campaign about whether to spend money in Pennsylvania or send the candidate there. Good times: The presidential candidate enjoys a laugh with Meatloaf during a rendition of God Bless America at the football stadium at Defiance High School . Fireworks: The whole face of the campaign changed after Romney's first debate with Obama that re-ignited the race . In addition, the candidates have been travelling to Colorado, where Obama defeated Senator John McCain by nine points in 2008, Nevada, where he won by 13, Iowa, where he won by 10, and North Carolina, where he eked out victory by less than one per cent. Laura Bush, the former First Lady, is to campaign for Mitt Romney in Michigan this weekend. Her appearance on the campaign trail is part of a Romney push for female voters. Mrs Bush has indicated she is in favour of abortion rights and has a much more positive image than her husband the former president George W. Bush. It also marks a foray into what has been assumed to be a safe state for Obama. No Republican presidential candidate has won Michigan since 1988 and President George W. Bush lost Michigan it twice even though he competed for it vigorously, especially in 2004. Romney, however, was born in Michigan and his father was governor there. Some polls have shown a relatively close race but Obama has been consistently ahead and neither campaign has spent on television advertising in the state. Obama last visited Michigan in April while Romney was there in August. Strikingly, all nine states currently being contested were won by Obama in 2008 and Romney is not having to defend any states McCain won. In addition, Indiana, which Obama won by one point, has been surrendered. Obama beat McCain by seven points and 192 electoral college votes nationally in 2008 so Romney is clearly the one who needs to make up ground. But in a race where Obama was long viewed as holding an advantage in terms of the electoral map, the shift towards Romney is marked. 'Something structural changed in the race after that first debate and nothing has happened since to change the new structure of the race,' Fehrnstrom said last week. There are dangers, however, in attempting to expand the map. Resources poured into Wisconsin, New Hampshire or Pennsylvania are resources taken away from Ohio and other swing states. The bottom line for both the Romney and the Obama campaigns is that whoever wins Ohio will almost certainly win the election. Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, made clear last week he felt the election would be exceedingly close. 'Look, Here's the deal. This is a fight for 270 electoral college votes. In all the battleground states we either lead or are tied. It's a very close election. I always told you guys it was going to be very close.' The election, he intimated, might very well come down to Ohio, as it did in 2004 when President George W. Bush was re-elected.","Obama won there by 14 points in 2008 .

"Most people on a day trip to enjoy the picturesque beauty of the Isle of Wight would hop on a ferry. But when Princess Beatrice paid a visit she avoided the queues and bustle of Portsmouth sea terminal – not to mention a £17.20 return fare – by hitching a ride with the Royal Navy. The 25-year-old’s decision to hop aboard HMS Ranger, an Archer-class patrol boat, when she travelled to the island last week raised eyebrows, with one resident saying: ‘Why couldn’t she come on the ferry like everyone else?’ It is not known whether Prince Andrew, a former Navy Commander, pulled any strings to help his daughter hitch a lift, but insiders were quick to insist that the boat-ride did not place an additional burden on the taxpayer.

'Prince Andrew must have pulled some strings with his old Navy chums.’ However a Navy source said that it was not a case of ‘Oh, you’re going Cowes, we’ll do a mission especially to suit you’. Despite the planned training in the area, sources declined to say whether the vessel was actually due to stop-off at Cowes, if Beatrice’s officials requested the stop or if the Royal Navy chief had offered one. A source told the Mail that the costs of the royal sightseeing visit – which was at the request of the local Lieutenancy – were covered by the Duke of York. ‘Princess Beatrice has a full-time job in the business sector, from which she was on annual leave.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the boat was on a ‘regular exercise’.","Princess Beatrice avoided bustle of Portsmouth - and the £17.50 return fare .

"A 25-year-old former math teacher who had sexual contact with two students at a Tacoma high school has been sentenced to six months in jail. The News Tribune reports that former Lincoln High School teacher Meredith Powell cried and apologized Friday in court. Pierce County Superior Court Judge Frank Cuthbertson says he believes Powell is remorseful, which is why he suspended all but six months of a five-year sentence and ordered her into a sex offender program open to first-time offenders. Prison time: Meredith Powell, 25, was arrested in February after students came forward accusing her of sending inappropriate texts and engaging in sexual activity . She pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree child rape and one count of communicating with a minor for immoral purposes, all felonies. Powell cried after her sentencing and told the court she prays every day for the two teenage boys and is heartbroken at the suffering she has caused the boys and their families, reports the News Tribune. 'I feel like words can’t even express how sorry I am,' Powell said. 'I wish I could take back what happened to the students that I failed. Sorry doesn’t take away anything that happened, but I hope they can move forward with as little impact as possible.' She told the court that a series of problems, including molestation in her own youth, contributed to her behavior. The judge, Frank Cuthbertson, said sentencing was difficult because Powell's behavior was 'out of character.' 'This is difficult, this is different, this is not what we usually see,' the judge told Powell. 'Everything suggests this is out of character for you. But again, you need to understand the severe impact that this has had not just on the victims but on their families.' The families of the victims were upset by the short jail sentence. One stormed out and several others cursed. The attorney for Tacoma Public Schools, Shannon McMinimee, said the district was also disappointed by Powell’s sentence. 'Ms. Powell repeatedly talked about letting her students down,' she said after the hearing. 'The reality is she committed child rape.' Misconduct: She will serve six months of a five-year suspended sentence for engaging in sex acts with two teenage boys . Inappropriate: Powell told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated and sent a text to the students . Powell was arrested in February after being accused of having sexual contact with several students. She later admitted she'd engaged in sex acts with two boys between the ages of 14 and 16. Both were students at Lincoln High School. She told police she had performed sex acts with multiple students, one as young as 15 years old, inside her locked classroom, as well as sending them sexualized pictures of herself. She resigned and surrendered her teaching certificate shortly after her arrest. The Lincoln High School teacher from Tacoma, Washington, admitted two counts of rape of a child in the third degree and one count of communication with a minor for immoral purposes in July. Tacoma Schools representatives said they were grateful she finally admitted to her wrongdoing that ultimately affected students and her colleagues. Tacoma Schools General Counsel Shannon McMinimee said: 'Ms Powell was well-liked by staff and students and they were devastated that she had violated the trust that they had placed with her.' Powell's attorney Wayne Fricke told King5.com his client has shown remorse over what happened. 'She was going through a difficult time in her personal life and obviously made a lot of bad choices, regrettable choices,' said Fricke. A fourth count of sexual misconduct of a minor was dismissed. She was held without bail until her sentencing on Friday. Tacoma police initially began investigating Powell after learning that she wrote a letter to one of the boy’s girlfriends apologizing for 'promiscuous' and 'unprofessional' drunken text messages she exchanged with one of the boys. Powell was arrested and placed on unpaid leave. Police said Powell began a relationship with the two students - who are between the ages of 15 and sixteen - in January. Powell told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated and sent a text to the students, saying they were 'hot', following back-and-forth communication. Scene: Meredith Powell was accused of engaging in sex acts with students in her classroom here at Lincoln High School in Washington . Powell said she apologized to the students the next morning, and also sent a letter to one of the defendant’s girlfriends in an attempt to explain what happened. After interviewing the victims, who said they had sexual contact with Powell behind a lock door in her classroom, police again interviewed Powell. She then admitted to engaging in a sex act with one of the students and other sex acts with another at different times in late January. Powell also sent at least one of the victims a Snapchat photo of her in the bathtub. She told police she knew her actions were wrong, and that she would apologize to the student’s parents if she could. Powell was hired by the Tacoma Public School district in September 2012 and was described as an excellent teacher and family-oriented.","Meredith Powell, 25, has been sentenced to six months jail .

"Angel di Maria, James Rodriguez, Diego Costa and Manchester City’s Eliaquim Mangala are among his clients, moving clubs in the past two months alone in permanent transfers worth £208.5million. And that does not take into account the potential £51.3m final transfer involved in Colombian striker Radamel Falcao’s move from Monaco to Manchester United. No wonder, the charming 48-year-old Portuguese ‘super agent’ Jorge Mendes, friend and adviser to footballing stars from Cristiano Ronaldo to Jose Mourinho, has been hailed for ‘winning’ the transfer window. And not just one. VIDEO Scroll down to see Falcao and Rodriguez practice one-twos in Colombia training . Super-agent: Jorge Mendes, pictured with Radamel Falcao, boasts some of the world's best players as clients . Top clients: Following the transfers of Angel di Maria and Falcao, Mendes earned £20m from Man United . Discussions: Mendes chats with Monaco's sporting director Vadim Vasilyev at a Ligue 1 game this season . The Mail on Sunday have calculated Mendes has negotiated transfers totalling £1,068,370,548. So far. With a typical ‘take’ of 10 per cent commission per deal, he will have cleared some £20m-plus this summer, and £100m-plus in commissions alone in his career. But his earnings do not stop there. Via his company GestiFute he also owns stakes in many players. Mendes, married with five children, carries four mobile phones, is fluent in English, Spanish, French and Italian, and also acts as a consultant to other agencies who own and trade in players. Big deal: Mendes has negotiated many transfers . As such he represents what many fans see as the good, the bad and the ugly of modern football. He is, simultaneously, a key figure in a dynamic marketplace where you can rise on hard work and talent; a major player in a parasitic industry where hangers-on prosper; and a key figure in the often murky waters of vested interests where just a few people control many of the players and, arguably, the clubs. That is not to traduce Mendes. Those who know him say he is engaging and provides good pastoral care. ‘He’s with players for the long haul, not the quick buck,’ says one associate. Ronaldo says Mendes is a ‘fair and honest man’ who he trusts ‘completely’. Mourinho said of him in 2010: ‘When I was told there was to be an award for the best agent in the world, I was immediately convinced that the award had to be Jorge Mendes.’ The Chelsea boss also says Mendes encourages players to ‘respect their commitments’ to clubs. Sir Alex Ferguson says Mendes is ‘the best agent I dealt with, without a doubt’. Also not in any doubt is Mendes’s increasing influence. GestiFute’s client list contains 58 names, two of them managers, Mourinho and Valencia’s Nuno Espirito Santo, the former goalkeeper known as Nuno. On target: Chelsea striker Diego Costa, another Mendes client, has already scored four Premier League goals . The best: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was convinced Mendes should be named the best agent in the world . Club: Real Madrid . Age: 23 . Nationality: Colombian . Position: Midfielder . Total move value: £101.50m . Last move: £63m to Madrid in 2014 . Real Madrid’s Pepe and Fabio Coentrao are also on the list, as are United’s David de Gea and Anderson, and Monaco’s Ricardo Carvalho and Joao Moutinho. Eighteen players are aged 23 or under, most of them in Portugal and Spain. Spotting potential and following it through is a hallmark of Mendes’s business. He grew up in Lisbon, the son of a gas plant worker for Portugal’s biggest petrol company, Petrogal. By 20 he was playing semi-professional football as a left winger. He ran a video store, then opened a bar and club in coastal town Caminha. There he met Nuno, then 22, and helped him move to Deportivo La Coruna. Eighteen years later, Nuno has been handed three young Mendes clients on loan this summer in a loan intake that also includes (non-Mendes clients) Alvaro Negredo and Bruno Zuculini, both from Manchster City. By helping the young Nuno, Mendes was on his way, a fledgling agent at 30. He next helped midfielder Costinha get his break, from lowly Nacional to Monaco, then took winger Capucho from little Vitoria Guimaraes to Porto. His contacts grew, as did his rivalry with the then dominant Portuguese agent Jose Veiga. The pair had a scuffle over Luis Figo in Lisbon airport in 2002. On the move: Defender Eliaquim Mangala joined Premier League champions Manchester City this summer . Big reputation: Gestifute's client contains 58 names thanks to Mendes' increasing influence in the game . Meeting: Mendes helped Valencia manager Nuno move to Deportivo La Coruna when the boss was 22 . Club: Real Madrid . Age: 29 . Nationality: Portuguese . Position: Forward . Total move value: £92.24m . Last move: £80m to Real Madrid in 2009 . Mendes didn’t land that client from Veiga but he did bag Hugo Viana, Ricardo Quaresma and Ronaldo. Crucially, he charmed a client from another agent, Jose Baidek; the client was Mourinho and the truly big time beckoned. By Euro 2008, Mendes was representing every major Portuguese footballer. He was agent to 16 of the 23-man squad, and to Portugal’s manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who he then took to Chelsea. In such a high-stakes environment it is inevitable Mendes has upset people. He was accused of poaching Nani (in 2007) and Bebe (in 2011) from their respective former agents Ana Almeida and Goncalo Reis, just before those players made moves to United. They said he pinched their players; he said they wanted his help to make progress. Reis said of his muscling in on the Bebe deal: ‘When Mendes arrived I was out of the transaction. It’s a sad thing that the one who discovers a player is not able to stay with him when big clubs are interested.’ Star names: Real Madrid's deadly duo of James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo are also Mendes clients . Club: Manchester United . Age: 26 . Nationality: Argentinian . Position: Midfielder . Total move value: £89.08m . Last move: £59.7m to Man United in 2014 . The Bebe transfer also highlights another aspect of Mendes’s business — owning players. His firm GestiFute earned about £2.87m from the £7.4m United paid for Bebe for their share of his ‘economic rights’. Another of Mendes’s recent client moves took Spanish striker Adrian Lopez from Atletico Madrid to Porto, with Porto paying £8.7m for 60 per cent of the player and the other shareholding an unspecified third party. Another Mendes client, 21-year-old Portuguese midfielder Andre Gomes, on loan at Nuno’s Valencia from Benfica, is owned — entirely separately from his loan move — by Valencia’s Singaporean billionaire owner, Peter Lim. Third-party ownership (TPO) is a regulatory minefield. In England it is prohibited by FA rules and opposed by the Premier League, whose spokesman said: ‘It threatens the integrity of competitions, reduces the flow of transfer revenue contained within the game, and has the potential to exert external influences on players’ transfer decisions.’ Good move: Adrian Lopez celebrates a goal with new Porto strike partner Jackson Martinez . Club: Manchester City . Age: 23 . Nationality: French . Position: Defender . Total move value: £42m . Last move: £42m to Man City in 2014 . A report last year by auditors KPMG said there were about 1,100 TPO footballers at work around Europe, in total worth about £1bn. Sources say four — among them Mangala — and perhaps more of the 100-plus players coming to the Premier League this summer were third-party owned — before the English clubs took 100 per cent ownership. Liverpool’s Lazar Markovic and United’s Marcos Rojo were among them. Chelsea’s parent company, via a subsidiary firm, is believed to own a group of TPO players, but none in England, so no rules are broken. Mendes has been linked to that fund as consultant. Mendes didn’t own Mangala, he is ‘just’ the player’s agent and worked with several parties as City paid about £40m for the player. The £40m was split between Porto, an ‘ownership fund’ called Doyen and another called Robi Plus, with agency fees on top. No wonder Mendes, pictured so often with his clients recently, is always smiling.

"British hostage David Haines was kidnapped by 'professional' ISIS gunmen in a 'pre-planned' ambush that took just seconds, a witness today revealed . British hostage David Haines was kidnapped by 'professional' ISIS gunmen on an isolated road in northern Syria in an attack that took just seconds, an eyewitness today revealed. A Syrian translator, who worked for the same charity as Mr Haines, said they were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo as part of a four-strong group when the militants struck. Travelling in two cars, the masked gunmen ambushed their vehicle, before ordering them to 'get out' and restraining Mr Haines and their Italian colleague Federico Motka. They then threw the pair into the boots of their cars, while one placed a gun to the translator's head and threatened him with death if he told anyone what he had seen. Finally, they shot out the tyres of the victims' car, before driving off with Mr Haines and Mr Motka, who was released by the terror group in May. The witness, who did not wish to be named, told The Independent: 'Two . very fast cars came up behind – one overtook and the other stayed . behind. They shouted at us to get out of the car in formal Arabic. They . were wearing black masks and were so professional. 'They put [Mr Haines and Mr Motka] in the boot of their car and shot out the tyres of our car. One of them put a gun to my head and threatened me not to tell anyone what I had seen.' The translator said the attack took place 'in seconds' and the militants, at least one of whom was a foreigner of African origin, appeared to have known that Westerners were travelling the car. 'They knew that two of us were Syrians and they knew who else was in the car,' he said. The group, all of whom worked for the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED), had been travelling back from a three-day tour of potential new locations for Syrian refugee camps in March 2013 when they were attacked. They had been taking a shortcut down an isolated farm road near Atmeh refugee camp and were just miles from the Turkish border. The camp houses more than 30,000 . refugees and is less than a mile from the hilltop of a village. Scene: A Syrian translator, who worked for the same charity as Mr Haines, said they and two others were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo when the militants struck. They had just left Atmeh refugee camp (pictured) Terror group: Travelling in two cars, the masked gunmen ambushed their vehicle, before ordering them to 'get out' and restraining Mr Haines and their Italian colleague Federico Morta. Above, ISIS rebels march in Syria . It has . become a rallying point for foreign jihadists who have targeted aid . workers, journalists and members of the Syrian Free Army. The translator's account will raise questions over whether ISIS was tipped off as to the whereabouts of Mr Haines by . someone known to him in Syria. It comes as David Cameron is preparing to personally brief a member of the Haines family on the latest developments in the case. On Tuesday, the 44-year-old was shown kneeling in the sand wearing an orange jumpsuit on a video of the beheading of a U.S. hostage. Family man: Mr Haines is pictured with his four-year-old daughter in an image posted on Facebook by his wife . The Prime Minister, who is coming under . growing pressure to unleash a military response, said Britain would use . 'everything we have in our armoury' to squeeze ISIS out of existence. Yesterday, he told fellow Nato leaders not to pay ransoms for hostages as . it only increases kidnappings and funds further terrorism. Born in Yorkshire but raised in Scotland, Mr Haines is a veteran of front line aid work in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled out paying a ransom for Mr Haines' release . Mr Haines's former landlady in Croatia, . where he worked for the German aid agency Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund, last . night described him as a 'good man' who was 'loved by everyone'. Nena . Skoric, 67, whom Mr Haines affectionately called 'Mama', told The . Telegraph: 'To me, it was like God had sent David to this place. 'It . didn't matter to him whether people were Croats, Serbs or Muslims, as . long as they needed help. There were many families who had lost . everything, but they all loved David. For years after he left, they . would come here and ask how he was.' Mrs Skoria added that she . has been crying for two days since finding out about Mr Haines's plight, . and has been having nightmares of him 'kneeling in the desert in an . orange suit.' Her comments came as Mr Haines's wife Dragana, 43, revealed she cries for her husband 'every . day' and maintains she will not reveal any details of his plight to . their four-year-old daughter. Mrs Haines, who lives in Sisak, Croatia, said the toddler asks about her father on a daily basis, but she has not yet told the girl that he is missing. She told The Times: 'His safety means everything to us. My daughter is only four-years-old and she does not know the situation. ‘We . have not told her that her daddy is missing. I am trying to protect . her. When he is safe and here [at home] we will be . happy.'

"The pilot Prince: William at the controls of a helicopter before his son George was born . He always said giving up his flying career would be a wrench. But even Prince William’s closest friends are surprised by quite how strong the pull of piloting his own helicopter has proved to be. Little more than eight months after quitting the Armed Forces and his role as an RAF search and rescue pilot, it emerged this week that the Prince is itching to get airborne again. Plans are being drawn up that could see him joining the East Anglian Air Ambulance service, based near his country home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk. Some will doubtless see this as perverse, but then William has always been something of a ‘reluctant royal’. Even with last year’s announcement that he wanted to devote himself to conservation and charitable projects, it was also made clear that he had no wish to become a full-time working member of the Royal Family. From his military career to wanting to be a farmer, to full-time dad to hankering after a return to the helicopter cockpit, all have crossed the Prince’s mind — anything that delays the inevitability of his royal role. Yet when the Prince has carried out public duties — as he and the Duchess of Cambridge did in Scotland on Thursday — he has done them with great aplomb. His visit with Kate to Australia and New Zealand last month was such a success and PR coup, thanks partly to the winning presence of son George, that anti-monarchy support Down Under slumped to its lowest level for 35 years. To the frustration of royal aides the issues that now cloud the mind of this young man — who is, surely, with his wife and son the House of Windsor’s greatest asset — have turned the clock back to another period of uncertainty in William’s life, the time when he dated but seemed reluctant to marry Kate Middleton. They are asking if Prince William is now wobbling over his career in the same way he once wobbled over his choice of wife. It may be hard to picture now but almost exactly seven years ago the relationship between William and Kate was almost dead and buried. After more than four years together, they split up after William was photographed in a nightclub with his arm around a pretty young woman, his hand apparently cupping her right breast. Kate, who was already enduring the barbs of her ‘Waity Katie’ nickname was not looking for a ring. She simply wanted to know where she stood and that he was committed to her. Faced with what he saw as her demand for his long-term commitment, William declined to give it. And on that sad and uneasy note the romance was abruptly ended. As we know it was not terminal. Kate resolved to show William what he was missing, partying in thigh-skimming skirts. Three months later, William, in the words of one of her friends, ‘came crawling back’. Now it seems similar uncertainties have come crowding in as William struggles to adjust to a life that demands an increasing commitment to royal duties, and puts him more firmly in the limelight than he enjoys. The Duke, pictured receiving a teddy bear in Perth, Scotland, on Thursday, has always been a 'reluctant royal' Should he — having first obtained a commercial pilot’s licence — take a role with the air ambulance? The decision would expose the question that lies at the heart of William’s hesitant attitude to his role in the monarchy; just what kind of prince does he want to be? Like his mother princess Diana, he is a man of contradictions, capable of exhibiting a common touch. Palace aides, for example, to the fact that whether they feel obliged to or not, William does not expect staff to bow to him or curtsey to Kate, and deny that, like his father, he possesses a short temper. So what has brought on this problem? According to a friend he has missed the camaraderie of his air-sea rescue days in North Wales more than he realised. ‘He genuinely loves flying and he loved being part of a proper working team in which he could be pretty anonymous and not given any special privileges,’ the friend explains. ‘I think he has now found his royal life rather boring and feels he is worth more than just shaking hands.’ William has always been something of a 'reluctant royal' There is no doubt that being in uniform gave William a structure and routine that allowed him and Kate to live as ‘normal’ a life as possible. Since moving from their simple whitewashed Anglesey farmhouse to their grand Kensington Palace apartment so much has changed. The couple’s altered circumstances have coincided with a growing number of official engagements being passed to Prince William as he and the Prince of Wales take on more of the ageing Queen’s duties. So the idea that he might return to flying will not thrill courtiers who fear a spanner is being thrown into the well-oiled royal works. But then William, 32, next month, has always been a headstrong young man intent on doing things his way. It was he who chose the moment to announce his engagement — and the date of the wedding, ignoring officials who wanted the nuptials to be held in the summer. It was he who from the outset included Kate’s parents in all the plans — unlike previous royal in-laws. And it was William who decided to give his fiancée his late mother’s iconic sapphire and diamond engagement ring. ‘He likes to be doing things — but not being told what to do as he is for royal duties,’ says a friend. ‘Talking to him the other day he was enthusing about the farming course he had gone on at Cambridge earlier this year. It gave him a purpose. ‘There is no doubt he misses the adrenaline rush of flying his own helicopter. Saving lives piloting an air ambulance would be the kind of excitement he has been missing. And he would be making the decisions rather than being told what to do by someone else.’ There is one other crucial factor — privacy. According to a close friend, the publication this week in Germany of a tasteless picture of Kate’s bottom, snapped in Australia when a gust of wind caught her flimsy dress, has infuriated William. ‘He cannot bear that every time they perform public duties they are being scrutinised for everything they say and do,’ says the friend. ‘It is how he remembers his mother being treated and he is determined neither he, Kate nor George will suffer the same way.’ On Thursday he will visit an air ambulance team during a trip to Crieff, near Perth, with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge . The Duke of Cambridge shows the Prince of Wales one of the Sea King helicopters, as Prince Charles visits RAF Valley on Anglesey in July 2012 . After Diana’s death William was given considerable privacy at school and university and he managed to prolong this by choosing a military career. Since his teenage years, William’s single-mindedness to do things his way has marked him out. It is why he did not join in when he might have been persuaded to fall in with roistering friends and do foolish things —– drugs, for example —– which characterised the growing-up years of his brother Harry. This self-control and assurance was something prized within the Royal Family. The Queen in particular knew how much stronger willed William was than his father, and appreciated that he was more positive than Charles who so often seemed to be wringing his hands about this or that. ‘William was seen as a young man who makes up his mind about something and then he does it,’ says a Palace figure. But now, just as the royal roadshow needs to shift more towards Charles and his sons, William’s stubbornness suddenly appears not to be such an asset. ‘The Queen is 88 and quite simply the younger royals, like William and Harry, will have to do more royal engagements, not fewer. Equally, the popularity of William and Kate in particular cannot be overstated.’ Quite how these increased royal demands could be met by the Duke of Cambridge if he started to fly air ambulances — which might involve him working ten-hour shifts on a rota of five days on and three days off — is unclear. ‘There are bound to be some misgivings,’ says the figure. Charles is sympathetic to his son’s wishes because he always regretted leaving the Royal Navy and losing his action-man life when he was still young. For William, however noble the intention, the danger remains that such a move will be seen as an attempt to postpone his royal destiny. It may be that William, who didn’t realise what he had with Kate until he had almost let her go, needs to apply the same cool head that allowed him to swallow his pride then, and make up his mind. Queen and country deserve that.","William stepped down as a rescue pilot with the RAF a year ago .

"For a girl born into a council semi in Accrington, you can understand why Pamela Northampton — Pamela, Marchioness of Northampton to be precise — doesn’t want to let go of Lady’s Secret Court, her Californian home for the past three years. Its seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms (the master en suite has his-and-hers bathtubs) have marble floors. There is a cinema, games room, and an arts and crafts room. The house, in Rancho Santa Fe, is surrounded by a pool and a lake and rose gardens. Microsoft’s Bill Gates is a neighbour. Battle: Lady Northampton (pictured left with Lord Northampton before their bitter divorce in 2012, is taking the lover she left him for, Dan Stoicescu (right), to court claiming she was wrongly evicted from a Californian mansion . Pamela’s . problem is that the owner of the beautiful estate, pharmaceutical tycoon . Dr Dan Stoicescu, for whom she left the hapless Marquess of Northampton . in 2010, is selling it from under her and has served her with an . eviction notice. He has placed it on the market for just over . £8 million, and has given her 60 days to leave. Lady . Northampton — born Pamela Haworth, daughter of a Lancashire tool-maker — . is responding with the kind of defiance her previous husband knows only . too well. Although she and Dr Stoicescu were never married, she is . claiming ownership of the estate, based on intimate emails he sent her . while they were together. The . 6ft 4in Marquess — Spenny to his friends — had to fight hard to . restrict his own divorce settlement with her to £17 million, and that . was despite her beginning an affair with one of his friends. She and the . Marquess had been married for nearly 20 years. ‘She got £850,000 for . each year of their marriage,’ snaps one of his close chums. Lavish: Lady Northampton returned to Rancho Sante Fe, San Diego, in March to find an eviction notice . At . 62, Pamela is still something of a temptress. Like the Duchess of . Cambridge’s mother, Carole Middleton, Pamela — Mela to her friends — . started out as an air stewardess. Before Dr Stoicescu came along, she . had been married three times. She . wed a Scots businessman when she was 18, and then a wealthy . Greek-American shipping financier when she was 31. When that marriage . ended in the late-Eighties, her property interests began. She was left . with the £2 million marital apartment near the Royal Albert Hall in . Kensington, which today would be worth in the region of £20 million. Now . Pamela, who has no children, has filed a ferocious legal claim on the . Rancho Santa Fe property, into which she was moved by Dr Stoicescu in . December 2010 after Spenny Northampton ordered her out of his . magnificent home, the 84-room Tudor mansion Compton Wynyates, in . Warwickshire. She . swiftly returned with removal vans to take her things, say friends of . the Marquess, and took the opportunity to have the artworks hanging on . the walls photographed for valuation through her solicitors. Pamela’s . claim to Lady’s Secret Court is based on what she says are promises . from Dr Stoicescu that the estate would be hers for ever. In . documents lodged at the Superior Court of the State of California in . San Diego, she claims he promised that she ‘would reside there and that . LSC [Lady’s Secret Court] together with all furniture and furnishings . would belong to her’. She . quotes a series of affectionate emails from him, for example: ‘Thank . you so much for giving me back my soul and my life, nothing I’ll do in . the future will ever compensate that!’ And: ‘Do not worry a bit about . money, as I’ll support you all the way, my beloved.’ Certainly no one foresaw such an acrimonious ending to what had been an affair of unusual passion and secrecy. The . slender honey-blonde had become Old Etonian Spenny’s fifth wife at a . register office wedding in Stratford-upon-Avon before Christmas 1990. Dubbed . the ‘mystic Marquess’ because of his fascination with spirituality and . Freemasonry, he’d been introduced to Pamela at a party by friends. They . married within months and he declared: ‘She is the centre of my life. I . call her “Stregissima — Great White Witch”. She is a healer, very good . at relaxing me.’ Perhaps they might still have been married had they not . met Dan Stoicescu at a Freemasonry convention in Cyprus in 2006. Worth . £200 million, the balding scientist and entrepreneur was soon invited . to Compton Wynyates. The couple were both intrigued by Dr Stoicescu, . whose main home was by Lake Geneva in Switzerland, because of his . ‘transhumanist’ beliefs — the conviction that technology can overcome . human limitations. He . was interested in immortality and anti-ageing therapies, convinced that . life can be ‘extended through nano-technology and artificial . intelligence’. He . told the couple he was only the second person ever to have his genome . mapped — charting a body’s DNA and genetic make-up — at a cost of . £220,000 and generously paid double that for both of the Northamptons to . go through the process at a clinic in the U.S. The . divorced father-of-one, whose fortune came from cancer care products, . was also generous to Pamela’s father Jim, buying him a £1,300 bottle of . wine from Harrods and a Rolex watch. But . in 2009, the Marquess began to suspect that his wife was having an . affair with the Romanian. Pamela had been to New York for meetings with . Dr Stoicescu — he had made her president of one of his pharmaceutical . companies. On . her return to Compton Wynyates, Spenny noticed that she was not wearing . her wedding ring. Her explanation was that during the flight her . fingers had swollen and she’d had the band cut off. Her . trips abroad became more frequent, and Spenny realised that she now . possessed a Roland Cartier gold and diamond necklace. In fact this was . just one of several pieces of jewellery that Pamela, then 58, had been . bought by her lover. The . affair was finally exposed when Lord Northampton was given tapes of . phone conversations between his wife and her father Jim, now 89. They . had been secretly recorded by Jim’s then partner Suzanne, who was fond . of Spenny and upset at Pamela’s deceit. The . Marquess was heartbroken and threw his wife out. Their divorce dispute . over a financial pay-off was heading for the High Court when the . settlement of £17 million was arranged just over a year ago. They have . never met since. But . just as he was being named in court as Lady Northampton’s lover, Dr . Stoicescu, 62, was embarking on another affair behind her back. By late . 2012 he was married to Maria Torres, 50, from Santa Domingo in the . Dominican Republic. Unsurprisingly, . some of Spenny’s friends can hardly conceal their glee at the break-up . of Pamela’s relationship with Dr Stoicescu. ‘After . what she did to Spenny, I can’t pretend I wanted her to live happily . ever after,’ one admits. ‘But she is tough, and Dan Stoicescu is in for a . fight.’ T . hat certainly seems to be the case. In her affidavit, Pamela is not . only claiming that the ownership of the Rancho Santa Fe house and its . contents should be transferred to her, but is also claiming $10 million . (£6 million) ‘special damages’, representing the value of other property . and the financial support that was allegedly promised but not paid. She . is also seeking general damages of $25,000 (£14,600) for her ‘severe . emotional distress . . . anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and . humiliation’. She . maintains Stoicescu ‘verbally promised’ her that he would transfer the . property into her name once her divorce was final. In the court papers, . she produces an email from Stoicescu dated June 22, 2012, which says: . ‘. . . right now, the only thing I can tell you is that LSC is yours and . will remain yours for ever, and I’ll do all the paperwork needed to . provide you with security.’ Other . emails are documented to show what she claims was the depth of their . relationship. ‘Your honesty and beautiful mind and warm, good vibes can . only mean shared fulfilment of these crazy objectives,’ she quotes him . as saying. The . papers also disclose how Stoicescu had promised to keep her in the . style to which she had become accustomed, including £30,000 a month to . cover her ‘personal girlish stuff’. Pamela . has added one additional and highly personal reason why she does not . want to leave the estate. She scattered her mother’s ashes there. This . means, she claims, she has a ‘personal, emotional and permanent’ investment in it. In . a counter-claim, Dr Stoicescu insists Lady Northampton has no . ‘enforceable contract supporting her claim’ beyond a memorandum which . outlines a number of options for the future of the property.Pamela . remains at the disputed property, while Dr Stoicescu is dividing his . time between his home near Geneva, a skiing lodge in Verbier and a house . in Bucharest. Lord . Northampton, a mere spectator to this domestic wrangling, is reluctant . to say much but told us: ‘It doesn’t surprise me that this is going on.’ His . friends are less restrained. ‘Pamela is one of the most diabolical . bitches I have had the misfortune of knowing,’ says one. ‘There’s no . sympathy for either her or Stoicescu.’ Since . the divorce, the ever-optimistic Spenny has married for a sixth time, . to psychotherapist Tracy Goodman. ‘I am very happy now with a very . special person,’ he says. As for his colourful ex-wife — well, she is very much available, should the right man come along . . . Interior: Dr Stoiescu bought the lavish property in 2010.

"Alone with Camilla at Birkhall, the home he inherited from his grandmother, Prince Charles was praying that the healing balm of Scotland would work on his wife as it did with him when the Queen Mother died 12 years ago. It was where he retreated from the world after the unbearable sadness of the Queen Mother’s Westminster Abbey funeral. And, more importantly, it was where – long before their dream of marriage – the then Camilla Parker Bowles had helped to cajole and ease the Prince of Wales out of the black depression in which he slid after his beloved grandmother’s death. Comfort: The Prince of Wales will do anything for Camilla as she reels from the shocking death of her brother . Devastated: Her beloved brother, Mark, became something of a father figure in recent years . And for much of yesterday the magic was working as Charles offered succour and comfort to his wife, still reeling from the shocking news of the unexpected and tragic death of her only brother Mark Shand in a bizarre accident in New York. Utterly bereft at the loss and robbed by distance and the sheer suddenness of his accident from being able to say farewell to the man who had so often rushed to her side in the crises that have punctuated her life, the Duchess of Cornwall was said to be ‘inconsolable’. Together with her sister Annabel Elliot, Camilla and Mark were united by more than just the bonds of family life that siblings share. Camilla’s extraordinary elevation from mistress and public pariah to a royal highness and the next Queen in all but name, have at times put unbearable strain on the Shand family. That they survived such pressures remarkably intact, Camilla has often ascribed to the liberating and impulsive nature of her brother. Where Annabel was competitive and enjoyed what she saw as the reflected royal limelight – and indeed profited from it – Mark shunned it. ‘He was a steadying influence for Camilla and, as the years passed, he became more of a father figure than a brother,’ says a close friend. Without him the dark days when she was accused of wrecking the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana – and especially the languid manner in which he debunked many of the wilder fantasies weaved about her – would have been near to intolerable. Her rock: Camilla will be able to lean on Charles to soothe her 'inconsolable sadness' as they retreat to Birkhall . Birkhall, their home on the Balmoral estate, is where they stayed after the death of Charles's grandmother . ‘They are a remarkable unit, the Shands,’ says a family friend. ‘They haven’t had the protection of palaces and the privileges of royalty to fall back on or to keep them out of the public eye.’ When Charles’ affair with Camilla was first made public by author Andrew Morton – and then by the execrable ‘Camillagate’ tape – the Prince could hide away while Camilla had the paparazzi camped on her doorstep. In fact, as I revealed it was the ‘outing’ of Camilla which incensed the prince more than any other aspect of the whole sorry saga of his break-up with Diana – and he held her personally responsible for it. Diana later told me how, ignoring her own despair at the unravelling of their lives, Charles had pointedly complained about ‘poor Camilla’ being thrust into the spotlight. The irony remained with Diana for the rest of her life. Now Charles must stand by his wife, providing the emotional support as she battles despair and misery as he once did. Ten years after their Windsor wedding, their marriage is more secure than ever . Surprisingly, the omens are good. The prince has been a steadfast and generous supporter to friends in times of trouble. Lord Brabourne, grandson of Earl Mountbatten, for example, has never forgotten the kindnesses he showed when his five-year-old daughter Leonora died from an aggressive form of kidney cancer more than 20 years ago. The family had tried to keep Leonora’s illness private, but it became front page news after the prince was pictured embracing Brabourne’s wife Penny under the misleading headline ‘Charles hugs his old flame’. In fact he had been consoling Penny after she had just told him of Leonora’s illness. Not long afterwards the couple were invited on what was to be Charles and Diana’s final summer holiday, an ill-conceived attempt to resurrect their honeymoon cruise around the Mediterranean. He showed similar characteristics over the death some years earlier of his friend and former royal equerry Major Hugh Lindsay in a skiing accident in the Swiss alps above Klosters. An avalanche swept down on the royal party killing Lindsay and leaving the prince’s friend Patty Palmer-Tomkinson critically injured. Lindsay had not long been married and his widow Sarah was expecting their first child. Charles did not forget his friend and undertook to meet the cost of helping to educate their daughter Alice. He is also her godfather. Strong: Ten years on from their Windsor wedding, their marriage is stronger than ever . Charles is doing everything for his wife after the loss of the man who made her often absurd royal life bearable . Camilla will now be hoping those princely qualities will be devoted to her. In recent months she had begun finding that her role as a full-time royal, taking on more duties as the Queen reduces her workload, had placed a barrier with her existence beyond palace life. Her friends found it harder and harder to see her and, according to a close aide, this had made her lonely. ‘It was no criticism of Charles, it was just a fact of life of the system,’ says the friend. The only people she saw regularly were the family: her children Tom and Laura and her grandchildren, and Annabel and Mark. Annabel and her husband, businessman Simon Elliot, had been an indispensable part of her transition into royal life after Diana’s death in 1997. It was Annabel’s 50th birthday party at the Ritz hotel in 1999 that was chosen for the prince’s official ‘coming-out’ with Camilla. And ever since, her sister has occupied a central part in her life. To Camilla, at times of personal . fragility Mark was a rock. His sense of humour was a relief against the . absurdities her royal life presented . She and Simon even accompanied Camilla on her honeymoon to Scotland in 2005. Interior designer Annabel, meanwhile, has picked up a number of lucrative contracts refurbishing Duchy of Cornwall properties and sourcing products the prince likes to sell in his Highgrove shop. Ever since the death of their mother Rosalind at 74 from the bone-wasting disease osteoporosis, Camilla, 67 in July, and Annabel have, understandably, worried about their own health. Mark, who’d had his own set-backs with hip replacements and the like, had a much more relaxed attitude. After their war hero father Bruce Shand died in 2006, it was Mark who assumed the role of head of the family. To Camilla, at times of personal fragility he was a rock and his sense of humour was a relief against the absurdities her royal life sometimes presented. ‘You need to remember that there were times when the prospect of life at Charles’s side was not only remote but unwelcoming and Major Shand was someone she could turn to. Mark immediately took on that role. ‘Now there isn’t really anyone. Charles will simply have to make more time for her.’ A friend of the royal family tells me: ‘The Windsors always seem immortal and not only do they have that incredibly strong set of good health genes, but they are to some extent protected from accidents, so in a way this is a wake-up that others are not. Mark's humour and vibrant attitude was a relief for Camilla, who now needs every inch of Charles's support . The siblings were incredibly close and shared their lives. Here, Mark shows Camilla an elephant sculpture in 2010 . ‘I do think they have an odd sense, which is perhaps understandable, that they’ll all live forever. That’s why Sophie Wessex’s child-bearing trials were a bit of a shock to them and why when Diana had awful pregnancy sickness, Princess Margaret couldn’t understand it – because she and Lillibet [the Queen] never had it.’ For the prince the peace and serenity of the hills above Balmoral offer the perfect location to mourn. It was to Birkhall that he flew to after his grandmother’s death because it was the one house that held his happiest memories of her. It was also at Balmoral where he broke the news to William and Harry of the death of Diana and where the two boys were allowed to grieve away from the public gaze as thousands massed for her funeral in London. But for Camilla, as the reality of the death of a brother she thought of as ‘indestructible’ was sinking in, the urge to do something, anything, was drawing her south to be with her sister and children. She has become the most valued figure in . the life of the prince, one who has helped to soften him and soothe away . those princely anxieties . Last night she was making arrangements to fly back to her other great refuge, Raymill House, her home in Wiltshire, 17 miles from Highgrove. Charles, says friends, will do ‘whatever she wants’. As one close friend says: ‘He loves her and he is a very kind and caring man. He does feel things keenly and he will be both shaken himself and hate watching her grief. 'So he will have to try and balance all the usual duty stuff with looking after her. Actually he is good at showing loving kindness – much more so than his parents.’ Ten years after their Windsor wedding, their marriage is more secure than ever. In a few short weeks it will be 20 years since Charles’ television confession about his adultery with the then Mrs Parker Bowles, the third person in the Wales’s crowded marriage. Two decades on the woman once described as the ‘most reviled in the country’ occupies a position of affection with large swathes of the country. We have come to appreciate the deep and affectionate relationship which exists between her and the Prince of Wales. She has become the most valued figure in the life of the prince, one who has helped to soften him and soothe away those princely anxieties. Now in the depth of the loss of her brother, it is Charles who must put aside other distractions to be the dependable figure in her life.","Royal couple retreated to Birkhall after tragic death of Mark Shand .

"Nobody that day at the High Court will forget it. The screams of abuse and sobbing relatives in the public gallery as the jury returned its verdict, and actress Gillian Taylforth collapsing in a Victorian swoon of despair and being wheeled to an ambulance. It was January 25, 1994, and Taylforth, who at that time was playing cafe owner Kathy Beale in the BBC1 soap opera EastEnders, had sued The Sun for libel, and lost. Fundamentally, it was a simple issue. She challenged the red-top tabloid after it published a report that a policeman saw her performing a sex act on her fiance in their car while parked in a  lay-by. Her story was that he was not well and she was simply soothing his tummy. Gillian Taylforth and her then boyfriend Geoff Knights, who sued the Sun for libel . Even in the richly endowed annals of High Court libel actions over the years, this one produced evidence that was uniquely colourful and stark, including film taken at a party some years earlier of the actress simulating sex acts, using a bottle and a sausage. Added to this was the diminutive, intriguingly soft-voiced figure of the late George Carman QC, representing The Sun, a man about whom it was said in legal circles ‘doesn’t clear his throat for less than £10,000’. So it is hardly surprising that a reconstruction of this hotly contested libel action has been chosen to be the first in a series of court reconstructions, The Trial, starting tonight on Channel 5. As the jury heard, it all began 18 months earlier, in June 1992, when Taylforth and her fiance, Geoff Knights, went to Royal Ascot, where he drank champagne. As she drove them home in her Range Rover, they stopped in a lay-by on the A1, near Trotters Bottom in Hertfordshire. As luck would have it, a police patrol car came by at that moment, and PC  Terence Talbot stopped to check the parked vehicle. Peering through the Range Rover window, he saw Taylforth with her head on Knights’s lap. He was in no doubt she was performing a sex act, ‘lying prone’ across the front seat ‘with her head moving slightly up and down in Mr Knights’s lap’. Knights was taken to the police station — Taylforth went to collect their daughter — where he accepted a caution for gross indecency. According to another policeman, Knights said they’d had ‘a good day at the races, the urge got hold of us on the way home — you know how it is’. That might have been the end of the matter — except a story about the arrest later appeared on the front page of The Sun under the banner headline ‘TV Kathy’s Sex Romp Fury’. A furious Taylforth and Knights denied there had been a sex act, but the tabloid refused to back down. So the couple sued for libel. When the verdict was announced the actress collapsed and had to be taken away by ambulance . This was the state of play as the warring parties assembled in Court 13 at the High Court on January, 11, 1994, with a jury of eight men and four women. Taylforth’s barrister was rangey Old Etonian Michael Beloff QC. He told the court that the officer’s reaction to the A1 lay-by incident was ‘a simple misunderstanding’. What he had, in fact, seen — Knights with trousers undone and Taylforth leaning across him — was simply Taylforth trying to comfort Knights after he had suffered an attack of  pancreatitis. She was massaging his stomach because he felt sick after drinking too much champagne. In the witness box, the actress wept and said she felt ‘disgusted’ and ‘ashamed’ of the sex act allegation. She shouted at Carman, The Sun’s barrister, when he accused her of making up her story about Knights being unwell ‘to cover your tracks’. ‘I would never have been able to make up any such lies like that,’ she snapped. ‘How could anyone think that you could stop on the A1 for oral sex with cars going by?’ Asked by her own counsel to describe how The Sun’s story made her feel, she replied: ‘It is so cheap, it makes me feel sick to the stomach.’ For his part, wheeler-dealer Geoff Knights was much more relaxed in the witness box, agreeing he undid his trousers in the lay-by when his girlfriend was comforting him. There was an amusing moment when Carman asked him to list his criminal convictions and prison sentences. ‘What, all of them?’ was his reply. After which he read aloud a lengthy list including assault and breaking a man’s jaw. At the time, Miss Taylforth played Kathy Beale in the soap Eastenders and has also starred in Hollyoaks and Footballers' Wives . So the battle raged — outside the courtroom as well as in. For, to allow the jury to see how the alleged sex act took place, everyone trooped out into the West Green car park of the Gothic courtroom complex in The Strand. Led by Mr Justice Drake, jurors, barristers and members of the Press all formed a circle round a metallic blue Range Rover — the very car at the heart of the case. Already sitting inside were  Taylforth, then 36, and Knights, 38. This time, they were about to perform what they claimed really happened in the car — but this time in front of a circle of some 30 people. Knights sat bolt upright in the front passenger seat. Taylforth, wearing a tight black suit with white stitching, leaned towards him and gently patted his stomach. On this occasion, Knights did not undo his trousers. As she went through her patting procedure, Taylforth’s face was, according to witnesses ‘a picture of concern’. Moments later, two lookalike stand-ins — Sarah Stephens and Sean Rayment, both journalists on The Sun — were directed into position in the car by PC Talbot to re-enact what he insisted he saw. This time, the woman’s face could not be seen as she buried it in her companion’s lap while the solemn circle of observers took turns to peer in. As the young pair emerged, pink-faced, Carman declared the second enactment could not be ‘exact’ because the stand-in’s penis had not been exposed. The brilliant QC hadn’t finished. On the opening day of the second week of the action, he calmly tossed into the case an unexpected bombshell that had been delivered to his legal team over the weekend. This was a 35-minute home-video that had been obtained — for a fee — by News International, the publisher of The Sun. It had been filmed six years earlier, in 1988, at the 20th anniversary daytime party of the Anna Scher Theatre School in Islington, north London, and among the guests were the stars of popular TV shows including Grange Hill, The Bill, Casualty, London’s Burning and EastEnders. Carman believed the video contained important character evidence the jury should see. Beloff, for  Taylforth, argued it should be inadmissible as court evidence. With the jury told by the judge to be absent, they each argued their case. Eventually, the judge ruled in favour of Carman. At first, as the film was played, the actress occasionally  giggled and pointed out people on the screen to Knights. In one . clip, the jury saw Taylforth standing in a street, opposite a . playground, apparently simulating masturbation with a wine bottle . between her legs, and saying: ‘I could sell my services down the road.’ Another . showed her surrounded by friends and holding a large German sausage, . intermittently in her mouth. She was smiling at the  camera and saying: . ‘I’d like to state I give good head (a slang term for oral sex). I give . very good head.’ She . then asked if anyone ‘has a battery for it’. After the jury had watched . the film, Taylforth went back into the witness box, where she explained . she was pretending the sausage was a vibrator. More recently Miss Taylforth appeared in Strictly Come Dancing and partnered Anton du Beke . ‘It was only a joke with a sausage — nothing more than that,’ she said, ‘just a joke between friends.’ Replying to her counsel, she said her sister, a police constable, was also at the party. How had she felt, Beloff asked, when Carman accused her of lying to the jury? ‘What can I say? I just think it’s totally unfair,’ she said. In the closing speeches, Carman accused Taylforth of ‘acting’ to the jury, while he himself was accused of trying to influence the jury with ‘magician’s tricks’. Then, after almost two weeks, the jury went out. Almost five-and-a-half hours later, the jury foreman rose to announce the verdict, and Taylforth’s left hand could be seen tightly gripping Knights’s wrist. ‘Oh God,’ she gasped, and then she began to sob amid shouts and abuse from friends and family in the public gallery towards the police and even at the judge. As Carman asked for the couple to pay The Sun’s legal costs (a crippling £500,000), the actress’s mouth opened and she finally collapsed, was carried out to an ambulance, and taken to hospital, where she swiftly recovered. The jury’s decision, it must be said, was not unanimous. They found for The Sun 10-2. Carman had suggested Taylforth — the Cockney daughter of a printer and a cleaning lady — sued to prevent the story damaging her career. In fact, although she lost, it seems to have had no impact at all. In the 20 years since, Taylforth has scarcely been out of work. She has appeared in Footballers’ Wives and The Bill, partnered Anton Du Beke in Strictly Come Dancing in 2008 and was in Celebrity Big Brother last year. For several years she has starred in Hollyoaks, which she is leaving this summer for ‘family reasons’. She and Knights were together for 23 often stormy years and had two children. They parted in 2009 and he died last year aged 58 from cancer.","Trial of Gillian Taylforth who sued The Sun is being reconstructed .

"Prince Andrew is said to be furious at being relegated to a walk-on bit part in the family. Edward is exasperated that his wife Sophie is no longer the Queen’s favourite. But one of the royals is overwhelmed by relief as crowds continue to swarm around William, Kate and baby George on their tour Down Under: the Duchess of Cornwall. As she enters the tenth year of her marriage to the Prince of Wales, the former Mrs Parker ­Bowles ‘couldn’t be happier to see Kate ­taking all the limelight’, says one of her ­closest friends. The Queen is said to have grown fond of the Duchess of Cornwall and has been impressed by her 'un-showy' way . For she knows that it deflects attention from what many now see as her remorseless progress towards becoming Queen Camilla alongside King Charles. Carefully laid state plans currently rule this out, of course, and she has to settle for being called Princess Consort. But she has triumphed before. She was said to have had no wish to destroy Princess Diana’s marriage to Charles — yet it was destroyed. She felt no need to be more than Prince Charles’s ­mistress as long as she had him to herself — yet she married him. She had no desire for the unnecessary trappings of a royal title — yet these days we know her as HRH the Duchess of Cornwall. She never expected to be mentioned alongside the Queen, Prince Philip and Charles in Sunday prayers for the Royal Family in churches, yet this is under discussion. Oh yes, and for years friends have said she has no wish to be Queen . . . Of course, the driving force behind her inexorable royal progress is Prince Charles. And who could doubt the success of his softly-softly strategy as Camilla took her place at the ­historic State Banquet for the ­President of Ireland last week. She looked for all the world like a Queen-in-waiting — her carefully dyed fair hair swept up and crowned with the late Queen Mother’s favourite, glittering Greville tiara. She sat graciously at the heart of matters, on the right of diminutive Irish President Michael Higgins, while the Queen was on his left. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge along with Prince George are seeing a surge in popularity as they continue their Australian tour . Today, it would seem churlish for anyone in royal circles to harbour resentment against a woman who is approaching her 67th birthday in July and who has, quite obviously, settled comfortably into the public role that arrived late in life. But friends and admirers of Diana continue to find the ease with which Camilla has been welcomed into royal life as the Princess of Wales’s replacement very hard to swallow. It will be even harder for them to learn that the Queen herself — who once memorably dubbed Camilla ‘that wicked woman’ — is understood now to ‘genuinely like her’. ‘Why should anyone be surprised?’ says one of Camilla’s circle. ‘They have a lot in common, after all. They love horses and the countryside. ‘And the Queen has been impressed with Camilla’s un-showy way of going about her duties. Just like the Queen herself, Camilla doesn’t like grand appearances for their own sake and doesn’t have to be competitive like the rest of the family.’ Though Camilla was divorced from her first husband, the security of her position ironically owes much to the Queen’s own happy marriage and belief that it has taken two ­people to create the brilliant success of her reign. The Queen thinks that, for Charles to be a successful ­monarch, he will need someone to support him as Philip has done so wonderfully over six decades. Timing, they say, is everything, and Camilla was conveniently at the Prince of Wales’s side as the Queen noticeably began scaling back her role last year following the triumphant, but tiring, Diamond Jubilee. The Duchess looked very much at home sitting with Charles on two mini-thrones alongside the Queen and Philip at the State Opening Of Parliament last May. And in November when, for the first time, Charles represented the Queen, who will be 88 on Monday, welcoming Commonwealth heads of government at their get-together in Sri Lanka. So just what is it that gives Camilla such confidence? After all, she knows that many still blame her for destroying Diana’s marriage. The answer may come as a ­surprise. According to one of her closest friends: ‘Camilla knows the Queen is now depending on her.’ This is an extraordinary turn of events. Not so many years ago, the Queen feared that Charles’s mistress was putting the throne in jeopardy. So anxious was she about the public’s reaction to the Prince marrying Camilla, that she distanced herself from the ceremony at Windsor’s Guildhall in April 2005, only attending the blessing afterwards. Yet last week the couple sailed through their ninth wedding anniversary apparently without a care in the world. ‘Camilla’s value to the Queen lies in her ability to manage Charles’s moods and frustrations,’ explains a palace aid. Sophie, the Countess of Wessex was said to be the Queen's favourite daughter-in-law . She performs the key function of ‘propping up’ the man who has been heir to the throne for a record 62 years as he goes through what an aide describes as ‘one of his ­periodic bouts of gloom over where he is heading’. ‘At such times,’ says the aide, ‘the Prince feels he is an insignificant figure trapped between an immensely popular monarch and a glamorous young couple. Only Camilla is capable of bringing him out of these glooms.’ After the Queen’s Jubilee in 2012, Charles established an ‘understanding’ with his aged parents giving him special responsibilities to ­fashion the monarchy in his own way when he accedes. ‘Despite this, he still has a habit of periodically becoming preoccupied with being the longest-running understudy in history,’ says one close figure. ‘And it doesn’t help him that the world’s attention on, and fascination with, William, Kate and baby George is growing by the day as crowds swarm around them Down Under. ‘I don’t know how he would have coped without Camilla. It’s probably why he needed her as his ­mistress for all those years. She knows how to keep him going.’ Little wonder the Queen wants her mentioned in Church of England prayers. Not everyone, however, is as enthusiastic about the changing pecking order in The Firm. The break-up of Charles’s marriage to Diana, and Prince Andrew’s with Fergie, meant that for several years Prince Edward’s wife, former public relations girl Sophie Rhys-Jones — the Countess of Wessex — was the royal woman next in line of precedence to the Queen. Out of her daughters-in-law, Sophie is her favourite. ‘Sophie had a taste of being the woman next in line to the Queen and quite liked it,’ says one who has observed her at close quarters. ‘Then Camilla married Charles, pushing her down a notch, and after this Kate Middleton arrived as Duchess of Cambridge, pushing her down the list even further. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall attend the Most Noble Order of the Garter service together . ‘She doesn’t like it. Heaven knows how she’ll react if Andrew ever gets round to remarrying Fergie.’ Camilla has no such worries. As the wife of the Prince of Wales, her position as second only to the Queen is unassailable. ‘She lets people think this sort of thing matters not a jot to her,’ says an aide, ‘but the truth is, attention is addictive. Everyone in the Royal Family likes the limelight.’ Brotherly harmony has been replaced by bitterness and a sense of ‘Princes at war’ behind palace walls. Charles continues his policy of slimming down the monarchy, although his ‘magnificent seven’ of royals who really matter in the ­Succession — the Queen and Philip, himself and Camilla, William, Kate and Harry — is now eight with its youngest star, George. ‘Camilla’s enhanced importance is petrol on the flames,’ says one close figure. ‘Andrew in particular will never get used to being permanently upstaged, and he is fuming about his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie being pushed to the margins of royal life. He is constantly reminding ­people they are the only two ‘blood Princesses’ of their generation. He thinks it is is disgraceful. ‘Edward is furious that Sophie now has to curtsey to Camilla. Anne, though, couldn’t care less.’ Through all this, the former maitresse en titre glides effortlessly beside the Prince of Wales, soothing his brow one moment, cajoling him the next. If she is eventually crowned Queen Camilla, will it be his triumph, or hers?","Duchess of Cornwall is said to be pleased Kate is taking all the limelight .

The squash-playing, keep-fit enthusiast had a heart attack that was sudden and unexpected. A unique aspect of the tributes to the much-loved actor and TV sitcom star was the paucity of wicked anecdotes about him. There were none of those villainous tales that are normally whispered back-stage about major stars. As his biographer Guy Adams observes, Rossiter approached acting ‘as a job, as solid and practical as book-keeping or car mechanics’. Now, 30 years after the actor’s death in 1984 at the age of just 57, an anecdote of unique wickedness has finally emerged. What’s more, it is as potentially destructive to the memory of the star of TV’s Rising Damp and The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin as an unexploded bomb discovered under the floorboards — and just as distressing to his 87-year-old widow Gillian Raine. In the continuing fall-out of the sordid Jimmy Savile affair, a 66-year-old fellow actor is alleging that in 1968, when he was 18 and working as an extra on a BBC2 drama in which Rossiter was starring, he was sexually abused twice while an ‘excited’ Rossiter watched. They were making the ground-breaking sci-fi story The Year Of The Sex Olympics. It depicted a dystopian world in which the media is controlled by an elite few who keep the masses docile by pumping out pornography and reality-TV shows. As part of the plot, the young actor — as well as a girl extra, also allegedly attacked — was covered in gold paint. He claims that he endured two rape attempts by three men in a rehearsal room, and was shouting for help as Rossiter looked on. ‘He obviously found it a big turn-on,’ he has claimed. ‘He was watching with glee.’ The claim is being investigated by police officers from Operation Yewtree who are working their way through hundreds of post-Savile allegations of historic abuse by BBC stars. Some famous names have been jailed, but there has been only mixed success in obtaining convictions. In the case of Rossiter — an allegation that dates back 46 years — they will interview up to ten former BBC staff involved in the drama’s production. Unsurprisingly, friends of the family are appalled that three decades after his death, attempts are being made to bring about what one describes as ‘the rise and fall of Leonard Rossiter’. Messages of support and goodwill have been pouring into the little terraced house near Chelsea’s football ground in Fulham, southwest London, into which Leonard and Gillian (his second wife) moved just two years before his death, and where she — also an actress — still lives. ‘It’s terrible for Gillian to have to go through all this when Len isn’t here to defend himself,’ declares one friend of the family. ‘It’s hardly justice. Everyone’s very upset.’ One of the complainants claimed the abuse occurred on the set of a drama, which was filmed at BBC Television Centre, pictured, in 1968 . Inevitably, that includes the couple’s . only child, Camilla, 41, who is married and lives in Kingston, . Surrey, and is a stalwart protector of her father’s memory. ‘Camilla . is very angry,’ says one close figure. ‘Her dad’s memory means . everything to her. She can hardly believe that anyone can even think he . behaved like that. He wasn’t a pop star or a disc jockey, but a serious . actor, for goodness sake. His family was everything.’ The . family ethic was certainly important to Liverpool-born Rossiter, who . began his working life as an insurance clerk. His father, a barber and . illicit bookie, was killed by a bomb during the Second World War while on duty . as a volunteer ambulance driver, and young Len’s pay helped out his . widowed mother. But he . reached a point where, he said, he was ‘bored out of my mind’ with the . insurance business and chucked it in to become an actor. Ever a . perfectionist, he took elocution lessons which resulted in the clear and . concise voice that made his characters so real. Outside . acting, his passions were his family, good wine, sport (as a boy he was . a spin bowler for Lancashire Colts), Everton FC and playing chess . against an electronic machine. But as a star, he lived a quiet life, finding fame ‘a bit tiring’. The reason was he could never avoid people identifying him with his roles and calling out to him in the street. He . had created two of the finest TV characters of the times, and the . public recognised him as Rigsby, the lecherous, snivelling landlord of . Rising Damp, and as Reggie Perrin, the disillusioned executive who fakes . his own death and returns in disguise to take up his old job. People . also loved the smugly self-satisfied bore he played in those memorable . Cinzano advertisements, soaking Joan Collins on a passenger jet. Collins . wept bitterly at his death. ‘He was such a wonderful man,’ she said. The . incidents of alleged abuse in 1968 predated his fame by several years, . although he was already a character actor, having not been born with . conventional, leading-man good looks. But women found his energy and . humour very attractive – in his early acting years one of his conquests . was a young Judi Dench. He . met his first wife, the actress Josephine Tewson — best known as . Hyacinth Bucket’s long-suffering neighbour in Keeping Up Appearances — . while both worked at Salisbury Rep. Their . 1959 marriage lasted a mere three years, Ms Tewson lamenting that in . their brief time together ‘Len was always going off with other women and . being uncaring’. He married Gillian in 1964, and apart from describing . their marriage as ‘up and down’ — in other words, fairly normal — she . has shed no light on any problems they may have had in their private . life, certainly not his weakness for other women. If . Leonard Rossiter was indulging in extra-marital activities, they were . carried on with remarkable care and discretion on both sides. Certainly, . the acting world was never buzzing with any gossip. As . for his years at the BBC, the only gossip was about him being . professionally ‘driven’, a demanding ‘monster’ and a ‘tetchy . perfectionist’. Nothing very sexy there. But . in 2002, 18 years after his death, a letter fell on to his widow . Gillian’s doormat, the contents of which were every bit as shocking, say . friends, as the allegations now being made against her late husband. The . writer of the letter was Sue MacGregor, the Radio 4 presenter whose . measured voice and unflappable professionalism have been familiar to . listeners (particularly during her years on the Today programme) across . middle-England for getting on for half a century. Her . reason for writing was that she had written her autobiography, and she . felt she had to warn Gillian that she intended to describe (in some . detail, as it turned out) her secret affair with Leonard that had gone . on for five years until his death. It . transpired that at the height of his fame, in 1979, she had interviewed . him on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. The next day he phoned and suggested . they meet for a drink. ‘I . was intrigued,’ wrote MacGregor in her book. ‘Could this be simply a . postscript to our meeting of the day before . . . Or was he interested . in something more?’ This . was the beginning of an extraordinarily clandestine affair, their . meetings always taking place at MacGregor’s Primrose Hill apartment. Being instantly recognisable, whenever he climbed the steps to her front . door, Rossiter covered his face with a white handkerchief as though he . was blowing his nose. As for . MacGregor, she said she wondered what her neighbours were making of . this gentleman caller who always seemed to have a cold. It . was a regular, farcical scene that might have come straight out of a . Rossiter sitcom, but this was serious. MacGregor, then aged 37 to his . 52, found him ‘quick, clever, funny and an enthusiastic bon viveur . . . I found him immensely attractive’. From . the start, however, he had made it plain he would never leave Gillian. Meanwhile, MacGregor, as with her close relationship with television inquisitor Sir Robin Day, assured him she was ‘a determinedly . single soul’ — as she still is today at the age of 72. But she was in love with him, admitting: ‘I did see other men from time to time but none of them seemed quite as attractive.’ For . MacGregor, the secret visits were not enough, but, despite her tears, . he could give no more. So she accepted the limitations. Rossiter . continued to visit her once a week, right up to his death. ‘I’m not . proud of my relationship with Leonard,’ she said when promoting her . memoir. ‘But I don’t regret it, because I loved him.’ Asked . this week for a view on the allegations being made against Rossiter, . MacGregor said: ‘I’m going to be really boring and say “No Comment”. I . had hoped that [our affair] had, by now — if I may use the . expression — gone to bed.’ Gillian . has never commented on the broadcaster’s revelations. And the couple’s . daughter, Camilla, who, at the time was as ‘horribly shocked’ as her . mother, has loyally dismissed the saga of her father’s infidelity as . something simply made up by Sue MacGregor in order to sell her book. Camilla . remembers him as a devoted father who enjoyed playing games and taking . her to the park, a man so worried by reports of crashes involving school . buses that he refused to let her join a school coach trip to Hastings . but drove her there himself — and waited all day until it was time to . bring her home. So what does she think about these abuse claims against her father? ‘When . someone’s dead,’ she says, ‘people can say what they like about them, . can’t they? And the person can’t say anything to defend themselves.’","Operation Yewtree officers have been told the actor was involved in abuse .

"David Cameron was at Chequers preparing for a difficult trip to defend the Union in Scotland when the bombshell dropped. Alerted to an ‘important’ Ukip announcement at 11am, Cameron was reading official papers – with the television on in the background – when to his horror he realised that Douglas Carswell was defecting. Such was his party’s ignorance of the coming earthquake that only yesterday an invitation to party donors was circulated saying: ‘You’re invited to a drinks reception and discussion with Douglas Carswell on Tuesday September 23 at Conservative campaign headquarters.’ Scroll down for video . UKIP leader Nigel Farage with Douglas Carswell during a press conference in central London where the Conservative MP defected to his party . It seems that Ukip, famously derided by Cameron as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’, has pulled off one of the biggest political surprises for years. Despite the shock, Cameron has only himself and his advisers to blame for not taking Ukip – and Douglas Carswell – more seriously. The Tory whips – who impose discipline – had washed their hands of Carswell, who has rebelled against the government line 62 times since the election. Now, he has paid them back in kind. I have learned that Carswell has been in constant talks with Nigel Farage for more than a year, both face to face and regularly on the telephone. One of the masterminds behind yesterday's brilliantly stage-managed political theatre was Stuart Wheeler, the former Ukip treasurer . Since June, the conversations between the pair have become deadly serious, and were conducted in a private house owned by a wealthy Ukip supporter. Worryingly for the Prime Minister, Farage has also held lengthy discussions with a number of other disaffected Tory MPs. Another of the masterminds behind yesterday’s brilliantly stage-managed political theatre was Stuart Wheeler, the former Ukip treasurer. The mild-mannered Wheeler, who made a fortune through the spread betting firm IG Index, gave a record £5million donation to the Tories shortly before the 2001 election because they were committed to keeping the pound. Over the past year Wheeler, who lives in the Jacobean Chilham Castle in Kent, has been quietly holding court with potential Tory defectors over lunches in London’s Mayfair. He’s wined and dined nine MPs. The lunches are usually in the luxury five-star Brown’s hotel, which is owned by Rocco Forte – who is a Tory donor – or Serafino, an Italian restaurant, which has been a landmark in Mayfair for more than 40 years. He entertained Carswell twice at Brown’s. Wheeler, who is 80 next year, was a lifelong Tory until he was expelled in 2009 after giving £100,000 to  Ukip. He learnt of his suspension from a journalist, and was bad-mouthed by Tory sources as ‘yesterday’s man’. Another spectacular misjudgment from the party apparatus. ‘The nine Tory MPs were happy to talk to Stuart because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty to the party,’ says one  senior source. ‘Stuart understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey. Stuart is quietly confident that more may follow Douglas.’ The optimism of Wheeler is in contrast to the black mood within Downing Street: put simply, the PM’s advisers haven’t a clue whether any more will follow. In the short term, they have one big problem – and it’s not one that is easily surmounted, because it’s the Prime Minister himself. There are at least 50 un-reconstructed Cameron haters on the backbenches, including Euro-sceptics like Peter Bone, the MP for Wellingborough, who is seen as a potential defector. Mr Carswell   addresses a press conference in London after being introduced by the UKIP leader Nigel Farage . It’s little secret that Nadine Dorries, who had the Whip withdrawn after she went into the jungle with ITV’s I’m a Celebrity..., has been linked to Ukip, too. They both have safe seats which the Tories can’t afford to lose. Dozens more backbenchers feel aggrieved they have been overlooked for promotion, or dismissed from government jobs, or simply ignored. ‘Cameron rarely sets  foot in the Commons tea room,’ says one Tory MP. ‘On the occasions he graces us with his presence, he is flanked by his praetorian guard to protect him. The chickens are coming home to roost.’ As for 43-year-old Douglas Carswell, it’s interesting to note that he has not been subjected to the personal attacks which would usually follow such a devastating betrayal. He is popular in the party, with few enemies. While many Tory MPs expect the party to lose the coming by-election, the manner of his going offers them one small but important crumb of comfort. It is understood that Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by millionaire Ukip donor Stuart Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair . Carswell could simply have switched his allegiance and remained as an MP for the rest of this Parliament at least. But he chose to do the decent thing and resign so he can fight for the seat under Ukip’s banner. His resignation means other Tory MPs tempted to follow him will feel obliged to go down the same route. How many will be willing to risk losing their seat in a by-election? Perhaps Carswell had the courage to jump ship because four years ago he romped home in Clacton with a 12,500 majority. A gangly six-footer, he grew up in Kenya, where his parents worked as doctors. His father, Wilson, a surgeon, diagnosed the first case of HIV in Uganda in the 1980s. Douglas went to St Andrews School in Kenya, then the exclusive Charterhouse School in Surrey. He studied history at the University of East Anglia and King’s College, London, and worked in television and investment banking before politics. He finally became MP for Harwich in 2005 with a narrow majority, but was far more successful when the constituency was redrawn as Clacton in 2010. Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister's policy on Europe . No one should doubt that Carswell has physical as well as political courage. In January, the hardliner on law and order lived up to his rhetoric when he chased a 29-year-old shoplifter and pinned him against a wall until the police arrived. ‘I collared him literally,’ he said. When the police led the man away in handcuffs, Carswell tweeted: ‘Police response time pretty effective. Arrested. Now off to my advice surgery.’ The MP, who has been criticised for billing the taxpayer £655 in expenses for a super-sized ‘love seat’, was initially overwhelmed by the heritage of Westminster when he arrived, but the feeling didn’t last. ‘Parliament is supine, spineless, dominated by spivery and spivs, it doesn’t hold the Government to account,’ he said in an interview. ‘Our primary function is to provide the cheerleader chorus for the frontbench. Parliament is one giant conspiracy against the electorate.’ After rejecting the usual blandishments from the party leadership to stop rebelling, such as the hint of ministerial office, he said: ‘I felt this incredible sense of liberation when I realised that I wasn’t going to play the game.’ Thoughtful and intellectual, his defection is all the harder to dismiss by the Cameroons. Carswell is one of a growing number of Tory MPs and ministers who doubt the PM’s ability to claw back powers from Brussels ahead of a 2017 referendum on whether should Britain should stay in the EU. Last summer, the Foreign Office’s review into the extent of Brussels’ influence – as part of Cameron’s supposed renegotiation – reported back that the relationship between Britain and the EU was broadly fine. Carswell’s response was characteristically blunt: ‘Europhile Whitehall elite says EU membership is a good thing – SHOCK.’ If the Prime Minister now wants to stop more defections, he will have to spell out for the first time that like Nigel Farage he, too, could lead Britain out of the EU – and he will have to say it like he means it.","Douglas Carswell resigned from the Conservative Party and Parliament .

"The United States is concerned that the Islamic State group and other terrorists could get a hold of chemical weapons if Syria is hiding any stockpiles, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Thursday. Samantha Power spoke to reporters after the Security Council received a briefing from Sigrid Kaag, who heads the international effort to rid Syria of its chemical weapons. The joint mission of the United Nations and the Organization for the prohibition of Chemical Weapons will end at the end of the month after destroying nearly all of Syria's declared stockpile. But Kaag said the OPCW is still working with Syria to resolve discrepancies in its declaration, which she said range from outdated records to discrepancies on the volume of materials. Power said the U.S. is concerned not only that President Bashar Assad's regime still has chemical weapons but that any stockpiles left behind could end up in the hands of the Islamic State group, which has seized large swaths of Syria and Iraq. Scroll down for video . Ambassador: Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador the the United Nations, said the U.S. is concerned not only that President Bashar Assad's regime still has chemical weapons, but that any  left behind could end up in the hands of ISIS . 'Certainly if there are chemical weapons left in Syria, there will be a risk that those weapons fall into ISIL's hands. And we can only imagine what a group like that would do if in possession of such a weapon,' Power said, referring to the militant group by one of its known acronyms. She said the 'Security Council intends to stay very much on top of this.' Power stressed, however, that the immediate concern is that Assad's regime still possesses chemical weapons, saying that 'there is one actor that has actually used chemical weapons.' There was no immediate reaction from Syria's U.N. Mission to Kaag's briefing or Power's remarks. Syria agreed to give up its chemical arsenal last year when President Barack Obama threatened missile strikes in retaliation for a chemical attack on a rebel-held suburb of Damascus, believed to have killed more than 1,000 people. Assad's government had denied involvement in the attack, blaming the rebels. The weapons, tons of them, were destroyed aboard the U.S. cargo vessel MV Cape Ray in international waters. Kaag said 96 percent of Syria's declared chemical weapons and related material has been destroyed, including 100 percent of the country's 'priority weapons.' Kaag said it will take five to six months to destroy 12 remaining production facilities. Doubt: Syria agreed to give up its chemical arsenal last year when President Barack Obama threatened missile strikes, but it is not clear if President Bashar Assad (pictured) is hiding undeclared poison gases . Fighting: In this August 28 photo, smoke rises following an explosion as Syrian rebels clashed with Assad's forces. The US has said it is concerned a stockpile of Syrian chemical weapons may end up in the ends of ISIS . Questions persist over whether Assad is hiding undeclared poison gases and there is an investigation into reports of alleged chlorine gas use in some Syrian towns. Chorine is not specifically classified as a chemical weapon. The OPCW will oversee the pending tasks after the joint mission ends, including revisions to Syria's chemical weapons declaration. Kaag said work on amending the declaration has been a 'very constructive and very cooperative' process between the Syrian government and the international authorities. OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu has previously acknowledged that Syria could be hiding some of its arsenal, but he has said Syria's declared stockpile was close to estimates made by outside experts. Power said the U.S. and other Security Council members remain suspicious and still want monthly updates on the elimination effort. 'The international community must continue to press for the resolution of all discrepancies and omissions in Syria's original declaration,' she said. 'We must ensure that the Syrian government destroys its remaining facilities for producing chemical weapons within the mandated time frames and without the repeated delays by the Assad regime that plagued earlier removal efforts.'","Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spoke after the Security Council received a briefing on the international effort to rid Syria of its chemical weapons .

"The UK will continue to honour Scotland’s huge debts even if it votes for independence, the Treasury said yesterday. In a surprise intervention, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the move was essential to prevent investors being spooked by the independence referendum and charging a 'separation surcharge' for lending to the UK. It follows concerns over debt being transferred to a newly-independent country with no credit history. The Treasury denied that London was letting Scotland ‘off the hook’. First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted he will only take on a share of the UK's debt if an independent Scotland can keep the pound . It said an independent Scotland would . inherit a ‘fair and proportionate’ share of the UK’s £1.4trillion debt . and would still be required to pay the money back. But Scotland’s First . Minister Alex Salmond hailed the move as a victory, which he said made a . mockery of the Government’s claims that an independent Scotland would . be barred from keeping the pound. Some . Tories questioned whether the deal was fair on English voters. MP . Philip Davies warned it would fuel resentment about ‘preferential’ treatment for the Scots. A spokesman insisted the move was designed to provide reassurance to investors looking to buy gilts, or government debt, this year. It was feared that global investors would turn their back on the UK if there was uncertainty about who would take responsibility for the repaying the debt if Scotland became an independent country. The Treasury paper published today said: ‘In the event of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, the continuing UK Government would in all circumstances honour the contractual terms of the debt issued by the UK Government. ‘An independent Scottish state would become responsible for a fair and proportionate share of the UK's current liabilities.’ Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the move was designed to provide certainty to the bond markets . However gilts sold by the UK would not be transferred, instead an independent Scotland ‘would need to raise funds in order to reimburse the continuing UK for this share’. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander, . who is an MP in Scotland, said the UK Government's new position should . reassure the financial markets. ‘We want to make sure people who lend us money continue to do so at very low interest rates,’ he told BBC News. ‘Everybody . knows that an independent Scotland would be likely to face considerably . higher interest rates, less credibility in the international finance . markets. ‘What we want to . avoid is any sort of idea that the rest of the UK - taxpayers across the . whole of the UK, including in Scotland between now and in September - . pay any sort of separation surcharge, an extra cost on debt that causes . uncertainty in the financial markets. ‘But . an independent Scotland would still be required to take its fare share . of the debt, were Scotland to vote to separate from the rest of the UK.’ The pro-independence campaign seized on the announcement as proof it was setting the agenda and would demand a currency union – allowing Scotland to continue using the pound – in return for accepting a share of the debt. British ministers have so far refused publicly to ‘pre-negotiate’ terms of independence for Scotland. But Mr Salmond said the decision by the Treasury shows that UK ministers are coming to terms with ‘reality’. He added: ‘These documents make clear that we remain prepared to negotiate taking responsibility for financing a fair share of the debts of the UK provided, of course, Scotland secures a fair share of the assets, including the monetary assets. ‘Any market uncertainty in the gilts market has been caused by their own refusal to discuss the terms of independence before the referendum and it is their own insistence that Scotland would be a new state that lands them with the unambiguous legal title to the accumulated debts of the United Kingdom. ‘That position is now beyond argument and today's announcement makes clear that Scotland would be in an extremely strong negotiating position to secure that fair deal.’ Voters in Scotland will have their say on a referendum on independence on September 18, 2014 . He said opponents of independence must end the ‘bluff and bluster’ and ‘listen to the overwhelming majority of the people of England who, polls indicate, see the common sense of sharing a common currency’. However, UK Chancellor George Osborne has ruled out allowing an independent Scotland to continue using the pound if voters choose to go it alone. The Scottish Government set out two possible positions on debt sharing in its formal White Paper on independence last November. It explored the historical balance of public spending and tax since 1980, when figures became available, or a population-based share. It calculates a historical share of debt interest could be £3.9 billion in 2016-17 or £5.5 billion based on a per head share.","Treasury guarantees all £1.4trillion in debt over fear of interest rise .

"Militants have forced a college to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils. The U-turn came in the face of a planned mass demonstration against ‘Islamophobia’ and an online petition signed by 9,000. The niqab ban had been in place at Birmingham Metropolitan College for eight years without protest. But an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper, saying she was being discriminated against. Birmingham Metropolitan College had banned students from wearing burkas for eight years before the turn around this week . When the story broke it sparked claims of racism and even rumours that the college was planning to ban prayer on its premises. Late . on Thursday, the college climbed down and ‘modified’ the ruling against . veils, hoodies and hats, which had been brought in to ensure students . were always ‘easily identifiable’. Aaron Kiely, the left-wing . student activist who organised the 9,000-name petition, is best known . for opposing the extradition of hate preacher Abu Hamza. He was . also forced to apologise for defending the London rioters of 2009 and . has suggested the police are institutionally racist. Last night . Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who is championing a law to ban face coverings . in public, said he was sorry the college had ‘caved in’. And . Downing Street stepped in to the row to reveal that David Cameron would . back a ban on Muslim veils at his children’s school. The Prime Minister . is being pressured to give headteachers more protection against similar . backlashes. The college, which is the third largest in the UK, with 44,000 students, insisted the policy was designed to protect students. Staff at Birmingham Metropolitan College, pictured, said in the past the rules were in place for 'security reasons' It . stopped female Muslim pupils from wearing the niqab, the full facial . veil in which only the eyes are visible, or the burqa where the eye area . is covered in mesh. The policy was attacked by local councillors, MPs and the NUS Black Students’ Campaign, headed by Mr Kiely. Mr Cameron had backed the college’s original decision to enforce the uniform code. But . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg admitted on Thursday he was ‘uneasy’ about the ban and believed the bar had to be set ‘very high’ to justify . any prohibition on wearing a veil. More than 800 people were . expected to attend a protest yesterday, however late on Thursday night . the college posted a statement on its Facebook page. It said . teachers were concerned that media attention was ‘detracting from our . core mission of providing high quality learning’. It added: ‘As a . consequence, we will modify our policies to allow individuals to wear . specific items of personal clothing to reflect their cultural values. ‘The . college will still need to be able to confirm an individual’s identity . in order to maintain safeguarding and security.’ The college said it was . confident this would ‘meet the needs of all of our learners and . stakeholders’. Mr Kiely, 24, yesterday thanked supporters, adding: . ‘We can’t be complacent though as Prime Minister David Cameron . signalled that he supported the college’s decision to ban students from . wearing veils. ‘That is why we must always be ready to unite . together to defend our fundamental human rights to freedom of thought, . conscience, religion and cultural expression.’ However, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said the Government would defend the right of headteachers to decide on school uniform. Two Muslim students at the Birmingham Metropolitan College campus in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, pictured before the ban which ruled students to keep their eyes, nose and mouth visible at all times . He . added: ‘There’s an important point here around headteachers and their . leadership teams being able to take the decisions that are right for . their schools and we will continue to support that. It’s a very . important principle.’ When asked if Mr Cameron would be happy to . see a ban on the veil in his children’s schools, he replied: ‘That would . apply to every school, every single one, including the ones that his . children may attend. What’s important is to back the right of schools to . set their own uniform policy and that’s what the Government will keep . doing.’ Mr Cameron’s nine-year-old daughter Nancy, and . seven-year-old son Arthur, attend a Church of England junior school in . West London. In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class. Afterwards, . the Department for Education issued guidance that enabled headteachers . to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning. Mr . Hollobone, who refuses to meet constituents who wear the veil, said . stronger guidelines need to be introduced to help schools. Split: David Cameron backed schools and colleges . to enforce uniform rules but Nick Clegg said he felt 'uneasy' about . telling people what they should wear . ‘The . Government should republish them,’ he added. ‘The shame is that this . school have done a U-turn when their original decision would have been . roundly supported by most people who read the Mail. ‘I recently . read about a teacher who sent home those pupils who were not dressed . properly. That’s the kind of robust leadership we need in our schools.’ Birmingham . Metropolitan College is believed to be the only college in the UK to . have banned the niqab. Some 43 per cent of its students come from ethnic . groups that are non-white. Of these, 14 per cent are from Muslim . Pakistan. This week, the college refused to be drawn into . discussion on why the ban was introduced, but one student’s story is . that it was brought in after a group wearing niqabs entered the college . and attacked a pupil. The 17-year-old who started the protest told the Birmingham Mail the veil ban was ‘disgusting’. She . added: ‘It’s a personal choice and I find it absolutely shocking that . this has been brought in at a college in Birmingham city centre when the . city is so multicultural and so many of the students are Muslim. ‘It . upsets me that we are being discriminated against. I don’t think my . niqab prevents me from studying or communicating with anyone.’ Tension . quickly spread across the college’s eight campuses. A group of white . male students at one of the sites said they were worried. ‘This is . causing tension, not just with the Muslim girls, but with the boys too,’ said one. ‘The lads are proud to be Muslim and feel this is discrimination against the girls. The situation is getting out of hand.’ But . one of his friends said: ‘I support the ban. I have no problem with . people of other cultures coming to this country – I just think they . should play by our rules.’ Another young man said: ‘How would people like it if I came into college wearing a balaclava?’ Mr . Kiely lives in Thurrock, Essex, where he is a local councillor as well . as being the full-time black students’ officer for the National Union of . Students on £20,000 a year. Case by case: Schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation . Headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases. In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class. Although the 12-year-old’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in Buckinghamshire, teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her. They said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention, engaged with her work or distressed. After the case, the Government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning. It said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils. Schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders, it added. But rather than a French-style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces, the Department of Education said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation. Updated Government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face-coverings. It says it is ‘still lawful’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘health, safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’. And religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘at any time, in any place, or in any particular manner,’ the  guidance adds.","Birmingham Metropolitan College has changed its rules which previously banned students from wearing niquabs on campus .

"Labour peer Lord Mandelson has taken up a controversial role as an adviser for energy giant BP . Former business secretary Lord Mandelson has taken up a controversial role advising energy giant BP just months after criticising Ed Miliband’s plans to cap gas and electricity bills. The Labour peer, who has resisted calls to reveal the names of clients of his Global Counsel advisory firm, is providing advice to BP, the oil major confirmed last night. Mandleson, who was twice forced to quit the Cabinet, has followed in Tony Blair’s footsteps by setting himself up as an international ‘consultant’. In 2012 the House of Lords passed new regulations that required peers to set out who they advised to avoid conflicts of interest but the former EU Commissioner has managed to exploit a loophole in the new rules that were intended to force peers to reveal their business clients. But BP told the Mail last night: ‘Global Counsel have done some work for BP, for instance on the Southern Corridor (the gas line project from the Caspian).’ The development will raise eyebrows as in September last year Labour MP Tom Watson demanded the peer reveal his connections after Mandleson waded into the debate on energy bills. The Labour MP said Miliband’s plan to cap gas and electricity bills could undo much of the work he and Blair had undertaken on the party’s industrial policy. Watson said at the time: ‘Lord Mandelson has become a lobbyist now and if he wants to pass comment, he can. ‘But he also sits in the House of Lords and he needs to come clean about where his interests lie.’ Global Counsel said, at the time, it does not provide services to energy companies that would be affected by Labour’s new policy. BP has been struggling to turn itself around after the oil spill at Deepwater Horizon in America. Mandleson is not thought to be giving advice connected to that crisis, but offering his views on European regulation. In September last year Labour MP Tom Watson (pictured) demanded Mandelson reveal his connections after he waded into the debate on energy bills . Mandelson is chairman of Lazard International, an investment bank, and has delivered various speeches for Coca-Cola, Lloyds Bank and Kazakhstan’s investment fund. Global Counsel was set up with former Sun journalist Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, who was also a former Downing Street adviser. The firm builds on Lord Mandelson’s contacts in Russia, China and Africa, which were built up during his time as European Trade Commissioner and as Business Secretary. He is friends with the Russian metals oligarch Oleg Deripaska and with the well-connected financier and former hedge fund boss Nat Rothschild.","The revelation comes months after the former business secretary criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband's plans to cap gas and electricity bills .
Follows in Tony Blair's footsteps by becoming an international 'consultant'"
"To be in Colombo these last few days as England prepare for the first one-day international against Sri Lanka on Tuesday has been to marvel at a group of men who seem to be telling each other that the sky’s the limit. At least that’s what they keep implying in public. In private, they may be rocking back and forth, muttering darkly about seven-match one-day series and six-week World Cups. But, for the consumption of their supporters, England’s 50-over side is saying all the right things. No-fear attitude. Positive brand of cricket. Exciting times. Honestly, you’d have to be a curmudgeon not to give them full marks. Ian Bell drives one through the covers during England's net session in Colombo on Monday . For more musings on England’s tour of Sri Lanka and other matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter @the_topspin. And yet. Both this tour and the Tri-series in Australia ahead of the World Cup will tell us whether England can turn theory into practice – and even whether they really believe they can. Years of building a platform for the first 35 overs can take its toll. It’s back-breaking work, and doesn’t always come off. Occasionally, you’re left with a solid enough structure. But the flourishes – the loft conversion, the solar-panelled roof, the stained-glass conservatory – feel like a luxury. They’re for David Warner and Glenn Maxwell. Even amid the clarion calls from batting coach Mark Ramprakash, and the enthusiastic words of support from the top order, a sense remains that England don’t quite dare go for it. Last week, coach Peter Moores explained why totals of 300 were – to sum up crudely – over-rated. It depends on the surface, he said. And in New Zealand – co-hosts of the World Cup and venue for three of England’s six group games – it is a rarity. If par is 270, said Moores, and you make 290, you are doing your job. There is some logic in this. James Taylor (right) plays an audacious reverse sweep shot while being watched by Ben Stokes . Yet take a look at New Zealand’s one-day series at home to India at the start of the year. New Zealand’s totals were 292 for seven, 271 for seven, 314 (match tied), 280 for three (batting second), and 303 for five. There were runs aplenty, and England need to be in the right frame of mind to seek them out. The omission from Friday’s warm-up game of Alex Hales felt too clever by half. Few top orders around the world would dare to leave out a player capable of scoring 116 not out off 64 balls, as Hales did against Sri Lanka at the World Twenty20 in March. England believe he was exposed by India’s bowlers in the one-dayers at the end of the summer, and are concerned about his ability against spin. If this were the criteria for selection, the entire top six would struggle to get a game. Eoin Morgan dances down the track and smacks one straight down the ground as Jos Buttler (right) watches . Moeen Ali’s six-fours-in-an-over heroics on against Sri Lanka A felt like the perfect riposte, but attitudes do not change overnight. Besides, Moeen’s inclusion is not the problem: he’s bowling well, and England need some proper overs from their top six. The problem is an apparently widespread belief that a strike-rate of 80 from the top order will win you games. It is if you want to score 240 in 50 overs. But few sides do these days. Recently, Rohit Sharma made 264 all by himself. To expect things to change now, only a couple of months away from the World Cup, is to be reminded of the last five World Cups. Each time, England arrived unsure of their strongest team. Each time, they failed to get beyond the first meaningful hurdle. Alex Hales, who was left out against Sri Lanka A, plays a more conventional sweep shot . The suspicion remains that other countries treat 50-over games like extended Twenty20 matches, while England are more inclined to view them as shortened Tests. Four successive one-day series defeats under Alastair Cook – the only victory, in the Caribbean, came when Stuart Broad was captain – suggests the approach needs some work. Monday afternoon’s session of power-hitting at the Premadasa felt more like it. For England, it may well be alright on the night. They may even stun Sri Lanka, assuming the rain goes away. But hope and expectation converge less often than cricketers would like. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Eyeing the future . England assistant coach Paul Farbrace wearing the Google Glass during training in Colombo . England’s assistant coach Paul Farbrace took to the nets at Colombo’s R Premadasa Stadium on Monday sporting a Google Glass (right), an OHMD (optical head-mounted display, as if you didn’t know) which among other things allows users to film what’s going on in front of them without the bother of brandishing an iPhone. The back-room staff will use the footage to decide whether the Google Glass can add to the array gizmos already at their disposal. One possibility is that will allow batsmen to determine how closely they really watch the ball. The technology was used earlier in the year by Sri Lanka, when Farbrace was their coach. And it yielded a curious finding. When Lasith ‘the Slinger’ Malinga wore it to bowl during net sessions, the OHMD showed that, during his delivery stride, he looks at the batsman for only a split second. As Farbrace put it: ‘It’s impressive enough that he manages to bowl such a good line with the arm coming round at that angle. But to do it without looking at the batsman is just amazing.’ Cook’s literary tastes . It was surprising to see Cook poolside at Colombo’s Taj Samudra hotel reading the book they’ve all been talking about. You know the one: temperamental star does it his way, upsetting people en route and staring out from the cover like some misunderstood genius. We can only hope he enjoyed Roy Keane: The Second Half as much as the critics. Murali’s advice for KP . A trip to the home of Muttiah Muralitharan at the weekend yielded some surprisingly trenchant views on Kevin Pietersen’s love of social media. The gospel according to Murali is quite simple: ‘Don’t text, don’t tweet, don’t use Facebook. Just leave it. The public doesn’t need to know what you do and what you eat. ‘If you want to put your opinion about anything, have a press conference. Just leave it and enjoy your cricket. Why are you playing? To enjoy yourself. Show your talent rather than show other things.’ The fear is that particular ship may already have sailed. Muttiah Muralitharan meets Lawrence Booth - aka The Top Spin - for an interview in Colombo . Right man for the job . It must be great being a BCCI bigwig. The Supreme Court queries your probity, and you retort by reciting your CV. Sundar Raman, the IPL’s chief operating officer, was said by the Mudgal Report, investigating alleged corruption at the 2013 IPL, to have known ‘a contact of a bookie and contacted him eight times in one season’. Raman’s response? ‘I hold a PG degree in management and prior to working with the BCCI, I was employed by a multinational media and advertising agency. In all, I have 20 years of experience as a professional with high integrity.’ And so on and so forth. Why didn’t he say so earlier! When you think about it… . There are whispers that MS Dhoni, who has a finger injury, will miss more than the first Test of India’s series in Australia. He could, suggests one rumour, miss the entire series. MS Dhoni is definitely out of India's first Test against Australia and could miss the entire series . This would have three benefits. India can blood Virat Kohli as their Test captain without saying he has deposed Dhoni. Dhoni would be spared the possibility of equalling the world record for the number of overseas Test defeats as captain. His tally stands at 13. New Zealand’s Stephen Fleming and Brian Lara of West Indies both led their teams to 16 away losses. And he could prepare for the World Cup, unencumbered by a form of the game he has never truly enjoyed. But those are all cynical theories… .","England are saying all the right things but have to perform .

"Ruling: A Muslim woman has been allowed to enter a plea without removing her full-face veil (library image) A Muslim woman has been allowed to appear in court as a defendant and enter a plea without removing her full-face veil. The woman, who denied a charge of witness intimidation, had previously been told by Judge Peter Murphy that she would have to show her face to enter a plea so she could be conclusively identified. The same judge today backed down and allowed her to enter the dock to plead not guilty while wearing a niqab at Blackfriars Crown Court. Judge Murphy will give directions on Monday as to whether the woman can stand trial while wearing a veil that shows only her eyes. The woman, from east London, who cannot be identified for legal reason, had argued that she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons. But compromise was met today when a female police officer, who saw . her face when she was photographed after her arrest, had a private . viewing with her in a room at the court. The officer then swore on oath that it was the same woman. Judge Murphy said: 'I would be satisfied for the officer giving evidence, having seen the defendant backstage so to speak in a private setting, saying she could identify her.' The defendant's barrister, Susan Meek, argued that she had a right to wear the veil during today's proceedings and her trial in November under Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which safeguards religious beliefs. She also highlighted the 'tolerant' approach taken to Islamic dress in the UK. Ms Meek said: 'She is entitled to wear it in private and in public. 'That right to wear the niqab also extends to the courtroom. 'There is no legislation in the UK in respect of the wearing of the niqab. 'There is no law in this country banning it.' She added that the same rules would apply to witnesses or victims of crime who appeared in court. She . also pointed out that the defendant's only active participation in her . trial would be giving evidence, if she does so, and suggested the jury . would be able to make a judgment based on her answers and body language . despite the veil. Ms Meek added: 'Ultimately it's the choice of the defendant if she wishes to wear it. 'If . she chooses to remain with her face veil on when giving evidence that . is something she will no doubt be spoken to about by the judge in front . of the jury. Hearing: The woman, who appeared before Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, was charged with witness intimidation . 'To ask her to remove it, if that is the court's opinion at the end of it, what consequences follow? A court order and proceedings of contempt? Is that right and fair?' The defendant today pleaded not guilty to charges of intimidating a witness in Finsbury Park, north London, in June. She will appear back at Blackfriars Crown Court on Monday at 11am, ahead of her trial due to take place on November 4. After the woman had entered her not guilty plea, Miss Meek and Judge Murphy continued to debate the wearing of the veil for the trial. Judge Murphy pondered whether the wearing of a veil could affect the jury 'to a significant degree by them being unable to see her reaction to questions being put'. Miss Meek said: 'Whether the jury would find it more difficult is really where the question begins. 'Jurors could look at her body language and eyes to evaluate her character.' 'There is always going to be a photo of her. 'The jury could be shown that.' On Tuesday, Muslim students were banned from wearing religious veils into a college because of fears regarding security. Teenagers at Birmingham Metropolitan College were told to remove any items of clothing covering their faces so they are 'easily identifiable at all times'. The French caused controversy back in 2011 around the world when they moved to ban women from wearing the burkha in public. Politicians moved to ban the veil because they argued it was a security risk and said it was a social hindrance. The . law - which sparked protests in Pakistan - was brought into effect in . 2011 under the leadership of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. British politicians are also no stranger to controversy surrounding the burkha. In . 2006, former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sparked outrage when . he said he had ask Muslim women to remove their veils when talking to . them in his constituency surgery. Three . years ago Conservative MP Philip Hollobone tabled a private members' bill which would have made it illegal for anyone to cover their face in . public. However, the bill . fell by the parliamentary wayside following claims that bringing in such . a law could be in breach of the Equality Act.","21-year-old, from East London, facing charge of witness intimidation .

"Demands: Andrea Leadsom MP is leading a Tory backbench attack on Brussels . Britain should have the power to give a ‘red card’ to EU proposals and existing laws and limit the right to freedom of movement across the Continent, according to the leader of a group of 100 Eurosceptic Tories. Andrea Leadsom, co-founder of the Fresh Start group of  Conservative MPs, said that without such changes there would be overwhelming calls for Britain to exit the EU. Her intervention comes ahead of a major speech tomorrow by George Osborne on Britain’s future in a reformed Europe. David Cameron is struggling to maintain Tory unity on the issue, with more than 90 backbenchers this week backing a call for  Parliament to gain a unilateral veto over new EU laws. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday dismissed that idea, saying it would undermine the single market and make even a Swiss or Norwegian-style trading relationship with the EU impossible. But he suggested the Government is ready to back the idea of allowing a bloc of ten or fewer EU states to veto unwelcome laws in the renegotiation talks promised by Mr Cameron to claw back  powers before an ‘in/out’ referendum on membership. Mrs Leadsom, writing for MailOnline, argued Britain should demand the creation of a ‘permanent means by which a group of member states’ can reject EU proposals or existing laws which undermine their interests or are no longer necessary’. Other reforms suggested by the Fresh Start group include the rejection of the EU’s founding principle of ‘ever closer union’, which she says is ‘no longer relevant or necessary’. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday dismissed the idea of a unilateral veto, warning it would undermine the EU single market . Free movement legislation, which . enshrines the right of all EU citizens to move to other countries and . work and settle there, should be amended to eliminate ‘unintended . consequences’, she adds. Ministers . are backing the idea that the right of citizens of new member states to . migrate elsewhere should be blocked until average incomes reach a . certain point. The group of . MPs also wants to scrap EU quangos, introduce ‘severe penalties’ for . fraud and error in EU budgets and see Brussels agree to a ‘full review . of how taxpayers’ money is used by the EU’. ‘The . way the EU works now fails to meet the aspirations of the British . people on crucial levels. If the EU is not fundamentally reformed, the . clamour for UK withdrawal may become overwhelming,’ Mrs Leadsom said. ‘The . EU is at a fork in the road. If there is not meaningful reform of the . EU over the next few years it will continue to lose out against . emerging, more competitive countries. As an organisation, it is . over-regulated and bureaucratic and it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of . many citizens in EU countries.’ Mr . Hague yesterday said the idea of every nation being able to go it alone . and reject any Brussels edict would be unworkable ‘in any system which . relies on common rules’. Mr Hague clashed with Kenneth Clarke - who dismissed suggestions the EU is to blame for unsustainable levels of immigration . But . he suggested Tory plans to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership before . an in-out referendum would include a ‘red card’ system that would allow . fewer than ten nations to reject EU laws outright. ‘We do want a much . bigger role for national parliaments,’ the Foreign Secretary said. ‘It’s . common ground not only in the Conservative Party but in the country . that the powers of the European Union have increased too much, that they . are too great, that they must be diminished.’ Mr . Hague clashed with former Tory Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who dismissed . suggestions that the EU is to blame for ‘unsustainable’ levels of . immigration. Mr Clarke, who . sits in the Cabinet as the prime minister’s trade envoy, said: ‘I just . don’t think it’s true that the European Union is responsible for . unacceptable waves of migration. The idea that you can have some . fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here . is rather typical right-wing, nationalist escapism.’ Mr . Hague insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern . European countries who joined the EU had triggered ‘large-scale . migration’ and had been a ‘mistake’. But . Laszlo Andor, the EU’s social affairs commissioner, suggested Britons . were ‘emotional and misguided’ over the issue and would ‘pay more . attention to the facts’ in the absence of a big influx from Bulgaria and . Romania. Chief Secretary to . the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said the idea of a national veto against . EU proposals was ‘potty’. Labour peer Lord Wood, one of Ed Miliband’s . closest advisers, agreed. He said: ‘The impossible Tory demands of . Europe must leave EU allies thinking: “The Conservatives don’t want EU . reform. They want to wreck it or leave it”.’ By Andrea Leadsom MPThe way the EU works now fails to meet the aspirations of the British people on crucial levels. If the EU is not fundamentally reformed, the clamour for UK withdrawal may become overwhelming. The next few years present a unique opportunity for such reform. The eurozone crisis means that the status quo in the EU is no longer an option—those countries who use the euro are moving towards closer fiscal and financial integration. So where does that leave the wider EU, and the 175 million citizens of countries who are not euro members? Even without that elephant in the room, the EU is facing a crisis of competitiveness and a crisis of legitimacy. Mr Cameron is said to be struggling to maintain party unity on the issue . The EU is at a fork in the road. If there is not meaningful reform of the EU over the next few years it will continue to lose out against emerging, more competitive countries. As an organisation, it is over-regulated and bureaucratic and it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many citizens in EU countries. The UK can be pivotal in securing profound and necessary reform. The Prime Minister is rightly leading the debate on EU reform with calls for greater competitiveness, flexibility and democratic accountability. However, there are many on the continent who continue to regard the UK with deep suspicion. On a recent visit to the Netherlands to discuss EU reform with Dutch Parliamentarians, they showed how wary they are of British motives: ‘We are your allies, but don’t hug us too close,’ they say. Mr Osborne is set to delivery a major speech on Britain's future in a reformed Europe tomorrow . As British politicians, we need to engage better with our European colleagues to understand where their interests are, and to persuade them of the merits of the case for reform. This week, I am co-hosting a conference in London to discuss detailed proposals for reform of the EU. It will bring together participants from over 30 countries, including all 28 EU member states, and will feature keynote speeches from ministers, Commissioners; MPs; MEPs; and leading business figures. My discussions with MPs from other European member states often start with a degree of scepticism on their part—they say ‘you are just cherry-picking the best deal for the UK’ or ‘you just want to leave the EU, so why should we bother.’ Following discussion of specific proposals however, we discover there is a great deal of common ground. We are pressing for: . • incorporation into the EU's fabric acceptance of the principle that ever closer union is no longer relevant or necessary . • the creation of a permanent means by which a group of Member States' Governments can reject EU proposals or existing laws which undermine their interests or are no longer necessary . • far-reaching reinforcement of the Single Market, particularly in services, which is a British strength . • strengthening of accountability between voters and those who represent them at European level . • strong commitment to improving the performance of the EU through scrapping EU quangos, agreeing severe penalties for fraud and error in EU budgets and committing to a full review of how taxpayers' money is used by the EU . • elimination of the unintended consequences of the free movement legislation. Of course not everyone will agree with everything. The art of negotiation is to craft a deal that will satisfy most people. The challenge is to develop a reformed EU that is globally competitive and democratically accountable. If we do this, we will have a union that is fit for the 21st Century, and one that the British people can be comfortable with at last.","Group of Eurosceptics want to limit free movement across continent .

"When, on Monday morning, James Taylor reflected on his 90 the day before at the Premadasa, what lingered was not his answers to the inevitable questions about his height or about the patronising dismissal of his talents by one or two. No, it was his frustration. Built like a pole he may not be, but in that moment Taylor was nothing less than totemic. His frustration lay in his treatment by the selectors, who had previously granted him only two one-day internationals in Ireland and a couple of Tests against Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander. Thanks, in other words, a bunch. Alastair Cook (right) and Eoin Morgan are both viable options to lead England in one-day intrnationals . England's squad are preparing for the fifth ODI against Sri Lanka in Pallekele on Wednesday . Cook returns to lead the team after serving a one-match ban for England's slow over-rate in the series . Yet in Colombo’s stultifying heat and humidity he did for England what he has been doing for some time for Nottinghamshire. To express surprise at the power of his hitting was to admit to being out of touch. Frustrated, James? Then join the club. For it took England until the fourth one-dayer of this series to stumble across the batting line-up most likely to unnerve opponents at the World Cup. Alas, no sooner has something promising been unearthed than it will be put back in its box: Alastair Cook returns on Wednesday after serving his over-rate ban, and the selectors will be almost back to where they started, agonising over Alex Hales and trying to convince themselves that the captain really is the answer. For more musings on England’s tour of Sri Lanka and other matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter @the_topspin. The problem England have is that the retention of Cook is not completely devoid of logic. In 66 one-day internationals as captain, he averages nearly 40, with a strike-rate of 80; his win/loss ratio of 1.25 is better than England’s overall 1.02. To point this out is not to be part of some conspiratorial nexus between the ECB and the press. But an average of 40 and a strike-rate of 80 are reasonable figures only when compared to the England one-day captains and openers who came before him; England’s fans want them to keep pace with a changing game. And that ratio of five victories for every four defeats will not win you a World Cup – let alone get you beyond the quarter-finals. Morgan has thrived with the bat in Cook's absence and is presenting a case to be captain at the World Cup . James Taylor (right) is another player who made the most of Cook's ban, scoring 90 in Colombo . The ECB top brass think it is too late to change, while promising to change should England flop in Australia and New Zealand. They admired the resilience Cook showed during the Test series against India, and think there is more chance of him repeating the trick with the one-day team than there is of new-look side lifting the trophy. Again, there is logic here. You may not agree with it – and most do not. But the thought process is not quite the finger-crossing exercise some have discerned. The problem – and it has held English cricket back at various stages over the years – is conservatism. Yes, a late change of plan could end up backfiring. But the safety-first option – and that is what Cook, for all his qualities, represents – is less likely to take the rest of the world by surprise. On February 14 in Melbourne, Australia's opening bowlers would rather be faced with Cook than Hales. They know what they’ll be getting. In fact, England should consider one or two of the so-called risks they have already taken this year. Critics said Gary Ballance should not have batted at No 3 in the Test side. They said Joe Root was being messed around. They weren’t convinced by Moeen Ali at the top of the one-day order. The selectors can be bold. But when it comes to the captain, they lose their nerve. One argument has been that Eoin Morgan has been in no sort of form to replace Cook as captain. Yet his 47-ball 62 on Sunday took his record as one-day leader to 427 runs at 71. The armband acted as an adrenaline shot. An on-song Morgan will be central to England’s chances at the World Cup, and so far the evidence suggests he’s more likely to be singing sweetly if he’s captain. This columnist wrote a few months ago that Cook should have quit one-day cricket after the Test win against India, put his feet up, and prepared for 17 Tests in nine months starting in April. Instead, his own stubbornness (both a strength and a weakness) and the ECB’s fearfulness have recreated the mood that characterised the summer, when Cook’s leadership filled the back pages and blogs on an almost daily basis. We keep hearing that conditions in Australia and New Zealand are different from those in Sri Lanka, as if a change of scene will automatically benefit England. Last time they played a one-day series in Australia, earlier this year, they lost 4-1. Anything else is just wishful thinking. WIN ALL EIGHT ISSUES OF THE NIGHTWATCHMAN!

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . England too clever by half . It made some kind of sense for England to omit James Tredwell from the third one-day international in Hambantota. The boundaries had been brought in, there was rain in the air, and England knew what he brought to the perennial party. Victory there meant the decision attracted little scrutiny. But to leave him out of Sunday’s match in Colombo was too clever by half. England knew in advance that the Premadasa pitch would be slow and low, but were swayed by the desire to have another look at Ben Stokes, who was duly out for six and bowled two overs for 21. The best way of preparing for the World Cup is to start winning a few matches. On a turning track, Tredwell is in England’s best team. Instead, they put the needs of a struggling all-rounder ahead of the best interests of the side. No wonder Eoin Morgan sounded nonplussed in the post-match press conference. James Tredwell has been left to bowl in the nets by England - but the spinner deserves a place in the team . Michael Clarke, all-Australian hero . When Michael Clarke walked off the Adelaide Oval earlier on Tuesday, having retired hurt on 60 during the opening day of the delayed Test series against India because of his bad back, he was treated to a standing ovation. One of the many touching aspects of Australia’s response to the death of Phil Hughes has been the way in which Clarke – previously regarded as a bit too metrosexual for some Australian tastes – seems finally to have been accepted, no questions asked. They probably shouldn’t have been asked in the first place. Michael Clarke walks back to the Adelaide Oval dressing room after retiring hurt against India . Fred fed up with KP . Last week, you’ll be aware, Kevin Pietersen described Peter Moores on Twitter as a ‘woodpecker’. Moores’s incessant coaching style, implied KP, was to blame for Eoin Morgan’s recent struggles (this was before Morgan made 62 in 47 balls in Colombo). If a journalist dares to criticise Pietersen, it is apparently because he or she has got an axe to grind. So let’s hand over to Andrew Flintoff. ‘I like Kevin,’ said Flintoff on his podcast. ‘But he just has to let it go. Just move on. ‘We know you don’t like Peter Moores, we know you got sacked and we know you don’t play for England any more. But it must be exhausting sat in front of the television hating everyone.’ Quite.

The video, one of many made by the group is thought to be an attempt to boast of their young recruits. It also shows youngsters taking an oath pledging an allegiance to the Islamic State and an even younger boy being asked what he would like to say to infidels. He replies: 'Infidels.. you are to be killed.' One boy, who managed to flee from one of the training camps told CNN how he was just 13 when ISIS tried to recruit him. He says that his father tried to stop him but militias threatened to behead him if he didn't let his son go.

The boy, who has not been named, eventually went to the camp, where he said they exercised, learned about the Quran, took courses on weapons, while some were forced to watch gruesome videos. He added: 'When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings. 'We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned [to death] because she committed adultery.' The boy managed to escape the camp after his father pulled him out and he and his family fled to the safety of Turkey. The jihadists issue their warning in a video yesterday that the beheadings will continue if the U.S. continues to support the Kurds . Footage of another fifteen members of Kurdish militia captured by the brutal jihadists has been released . The Islamic State also released a decapitation video yesterday threatening America for the second time and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate. It came just hours after Islamic State released shocking footage of the mass execution of 300 Syrian national army soldiers in the Syrian desert. The grainy video, accompanied by the hashtag '2ndAmessagetoAmerica', shows the vicious beheading of a Kurdish soldier, who was part of a group of 15 fighters likely to have been captured by Islamic State during the fighting in Iraq. The group's first warning ten days ago was entitled 'A Message to America' and showed the decapitation of American journalist James Foley. The video comes after David Cameron announced yesterday that more armed police will patrol Britain’s streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria.

Yesterday David Cameron announced that more armed police will patrol Britain's streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria . He warned that the return of hundreds of murderous extremists posed a greater threat to our security than Al Qaeda or the IRA ever did.

The extremists have declared a self-styled caliphate, a Sunni regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme interpretation of Sharia law. It has opened up three fronts in the fighting in Syria, which is already home to a bloody and long-running civil war between President Assad's forces and anti-government rebels.","Video reportedly shows children at an Islamic State training camp .

"A Muslim woman was allowed to take to the dock while wearing a face covering veil yesterday . A judge yesterday allowed a Muslim woman to wear a full face veil in the dock for the first time. Peter Murphy stopped proceedings last month when she refused to lift her niqab to confirm her identity at a plea hearing. The 22-year-old woman, who is accused of witness intimidation, said she would not lower her full-face covering with men in the room. She claimed it was against her beliefs to allow any man other than her husband to see her face. But district judge Murphy said that being unable to identify the defendant was contrary to the principle of open justice, which overrides religious belief. He refused to let her submit a plea on the grounds that he had no way of knowing whether she was the person she claimed to be. But, after the case was adjourned for legal argument this week the judge backed down, allowing her to enter a not guilty plea after she agreed to lift her veil in front of a female police officer in a room next to the court. This confirmed her identity. Judge Murphy agreed to the proposal but he indicated that she may have to remove the full-face covering in front of the jury when the case comes to trial at Blackfriars Crown Court in November. The judge said he feared jurors would not be able to see the defendant’s facial expressions, adding: ‘I will not have the defendant dictating to the court how she wishes to appear.’ Susan Meek, defending, argued that the right to wear a niqab was protected under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides the right to freedom of religion. Hearing: The woman, who appeared before Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, was charged with witness intimidation . In 2007, guidelines issued by the . Judicial Studies Board urged judges to remain sensitive when asking . defendants to remove veils, suggesting there should be ‘no sense of . obligation’. Yesterday’s decision was welcomed by human rights charity Liberty. James . Welch, its legal director, said: ‘Credit to the judge for taking time . to produce a common-sense ruling that delivers both necessary . identification and respect for the convictions of the defendant. ‘These . matters require balance and ongoing discretion, but the UK has a long . history of tolerance and is capable of setting an important example to . others in Europe and beyond.’ The . defendant, from Hackney, East London, cannot be named for legal . reasons. She is facing an allegation of intimidating a witness in . Finsbury Park in June. In . March last year a Muslim woman was barred from serving on a jury in an . attempted murder trial because she refused to remove her veil. The woman was about to take the oath when the judge intervened and summoned a replacement. On Tuesday, Muslim students were banned from wearing religious veils into a college because of fears regarding security. Teenagers at Birmingham Metropolitan College were told to remove any items of clothing covering their faces so they are 'easily identifiable at all times'. The French caused controversy back in 2011 around the world when they moved to ban women from wearing the burkha in public. Politicians moved to ban the veil because they argued it was a security risk and said it was a social hindrance. The . law - which sparked protests in Pakistan - was brought into effect in . 2011 under the leadership of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. British politicians are also no stranger to controversy surrounding the burkha. In . 2006, former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sparked outrage when . he said he had ask Muslim women to remove their veils when talking to . them in his constituency surgery. Three . years ago Conservative MP Philip Hollobone tabled a private members' bill which would have made it illegal for anyone to cover their face in . public. However, the bill . fell by the parliamentary wayside following claims that bringing in such . a law could be in breach of the Equality Act.","22-year-old, from East London, faced charge of witness intimidation .

"Manchester United face a battle to hold on to teenager Andreas Pereira with Paris Saint-Germain poised to make a move. The Brazilian starlet is out of contract in the summer and United are struggling to agree new terms after the youngster and his advisers rejected their opening offer. PSG, who have already tried and failed to sign Adnan Januzaj from United, are now keen to take Pereira in the summer. Andreas Pereira, in action for Manchester United's Under 21 side, is being courted by Paris Saint-Germain . Pereira began his career at PSV Eindhoven and soon drew attention from scouts at Arsenal and Chelsea . They are not alone though as AC Milan and Roma have also shown a keen interest in the 19-year-old. Pereira was born in Belgium to Brazilian parents and plays as an attacking midfielder. He began his career at PSV Eindhoven in Holland and soon drew attention from scouts at Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea. However, a personal visit from Sir Alex Ferguson ensured he chose United and he signed for the club on turning 16. He has continued to impress in Milk Cup tournaments, the UEFA Youth League and with United's Under 18s and Under 21s. He was selected for Brazil Under 20s and made his senior United debut under Louis van Gaal as a substitute in the 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by MK Dons. The Brazilian is pictured in training earlier this month, but has found first-team opportunities hard to come by . Talking about his contract to Brazilian media earlier this season, Pereira said: 'My agent is in charge of everything. I asked him to do his job without telling me anything, to keep my focus on the pitch. Van Gaal told me to stay calm. He wants to give me a chance because I have plenty of talent. When he arrived at the club, I talked with him. He always does so.' Pereira has failed to progress since though with United well covered in his position at first-team level and he is ready to leave. There are similarities to the situation preceding Paul Pogba's departure to Juventus but United are unable to offer guarantees and Pereira and his father, former midfielder Marcos Pereira, will weigh up offers from other clubs. Chelsea have offered Mohamed Salah to Fiorentina again as they continue discussions over the £26.8million transfer of Juan Cuadrado. Wolfsburg delegates will be in London today (Monday) discussing the £23m departure of Andre Schurrle with his father Joachim and the finalisation of that deal will allow Chelsea to take stock of what finance they wish to push into the Cuadrado deal. Talks are ongoing with Shakhtar Donetsk over the possibility of Douglas Costa also coming in but the likelihood is only one will arrive at Stamford Bridge. Juan Cuadrado, in action for Fiorentina against Roma on Sunday night, is wanted by Chelsea . The Blues have offered Mohamed Salah to the Italian side as they continue discussions over Cuadrado . Salah was close to a deal with Roma last week but when the clubs failed to agree, the Italians turned their attention to Yevhen Konoplyanka of Dnipro and Luiz Adriano of Shakhtar. Konoplyanka was a target for Everton this month but they were told the player was due to join Tottenham instead. Tottenham would prefer to do a deal in the summer when the player is out of contract. Dnipro were pushing for £7m in January but are now leaning towards allowing him to see out his deal. Wolfsburg delegates are in London  discussing the £23m departure of Andre Schurrle with his father Joachim . Marcus Nilsson is currently on trial at West Ham . West Ham have extended the trial of Swedish centre back Marcus Nilsson. The 26-year-old spent last week training with Sam Allardyce's first-team squad and impressed the coaching staff enough to be invited to stay for another week. Nilsson, who has been capped once by Sweden, is 6ft 4in tall and decent on the ball. He now hopes to do well enough to earn a contract. West Ham are hopeful of signing Darren Fletcher from Manchester United. The 30-year-old is keen on a move to Valencia but they have so far failed to get rid of the players they need to accommodate Fletcher on the wage bill. A West Ham deal for Hamilton's 20-year-old left-back Stephen Hendrie is also still possible. Stoke manager Mark Hughes has asked about the availability of Sandro Ramirez from Barcelona B after watching the teenager in action against Osasuna on Sunday. Hughes, who is in discussions over a new two-year contract extension at Stoke, was at the Mini Estadi to take in Barcelona B's 1-0 defeat in the Spanish Segunda Division. Stoke manager Mark Hughes has asked about the availability of Sandro Ramirez from Barcelona B . Winger Adama Traore and 19-year-old Sandro Ramirez have been watched before by Stoke staff as well as talented forward Jean Marie Dongou. Barca are reluctant to allow Traore to move to England just yet and have also fielded interest from Everton. Asked afterwards if he had any interest in signing Traore and Ramirez on loan during this transfer window, he told Catalan radio station RAC1: 'They are two options.' Stoke's more expensive option is Tottenham's Aaron Lennon. Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi watched Alexandre Lacazette (right) as Lyon cruised to a 2-0 win over Metz . Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi watched French league leaders Lyon beat Metz 2-0 on Sunday. Grimandi has been keeping a close eye on Alexandre Lacazette and Nabil Fekir, two players admired by Manchester City, while Metz winger Yeni N'Gbakoto has also been earning rave reviews. However, the other notable performance on Sunday came from Maxime Gonalons the defensive midfielder who has been on Arsenal's wishlist for the past two seasons. The France international, 25, has been a key figure in Lyon's rise to the top of Ligue 1. Lyon need money but are reluctant to sell while four points clear of Marseille and PSG. Chelsea and Hull scouts, meanwhile, watched Rennes against Caen. Wigan have expressed an interest in Burnley striker Lukas Jutkiewicz but the Premier League strugglers won't let the striker go unless they bring another in. They have plenty of interest in Danny Ings but the striker is still intent on seeing the season out and taking stock of his situation in the summer. Ings has offers from Germany, Spain and England with Manchester City one of the clubs to have shown an interest as they consider their homegrown quota. A number of clubs have expressed an interest in Burnley striker Danny Ings, in action against Crystal Palace . Burnley would still be able to gain £3m compensation and that is worth the gamble if Ings' goals between now and the summer keep them in the Premier League. Tottenham would like to freshen up their attack but would prefer to sell a player first before bringing Ings in. Wigan's Shaun Maloney has finally completed his £750,000 move to Chicago Fire. Charlton meanwhile, are talking to Sporting Lisbon about a loan deal for 6ft 5in France Under-20 international defender Naby Sarr. Crystal Palace and Reading are among the clubs showing an interest in Nemanja Nikolic of Videoton. The Serbian-born Hungary international striker has been in prolific form this season with Videoton, scoring 16 goals in just 15 games yet is available for a bargain £500,000. It is no flash in the pan either as his statistics prove. He has been consistent throughout his career with a record of 154 goals in 172 starts in all competitions for Kaposvar and Videoton, a goal every 99.8 minutes. Celta Vigo and Bordeaux are also showing an interest as Videoton brace themselves for offers. Palace have offered £3.5m for Rudy Gestede at Blackburn but will have to offer closer to £6m to tempt owners Venky's to sell. Free agent Shola Ameobi also remains an option for Alan Pardew but other clubs have shown an interest in recent days. Real Madrid have stepped into the race for Athletic Bilbao's Aymeric Laporte. The 20-year-old France international has been on Manchester United's radar also for the past couple of seasons but with Pepe getting older and Sergio Ramos debating a new contract, Madrid have made the first steps to taking him to the Bernabeu. Real Madrid have entered the race to sign Athletic Bilbao's 20-year-old Aymeric Laporte (right) The deal won't be cheap though with Bilbao refusing to negotiate and typically pointing to his buyout clause of £31.5m plus the VAT. Laporte has potential and is a great athlete but is still a little raw. Another option for Madrid is Inigo Martinez at Sociedad. David Moyes' side are keen on Madrid's former Sociedad midfielder Aser Illarramendi and a deal could be done in the summer unless he opts to go abroad. Liverpool had scouts at St Etienne against Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday night. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the only goal with Liverpool reportedly checking on Ezequiel Lavezzi. The Argentine is available for £12m but wants Champions League football. He came on as a late substitute for Edinson Cavani getting nine minutes on the pitch. Manchester United target Marquinhos again played at right back. Liverpool were reportedly checking on Ezequiel Lavezzi (left), who is available for £12million . Liverpool were impressed by goalkeeper Adam Bogdan on Saturday, as reported by Sportsmail, and Neil Lennon is willing to offer him a new contract to stay at Bolton. Lennon will sign Adam Le Fondre from Cardiff on loan this week. Bolton winger Lee Chung-yong Lee is expected to see out the season and move on a free in the summer despite interest from Crystal Palace.","Manchester United face a battle to keep hold of starlet Andreas Pereira, 19 .

"As England near the end of their one-day series in Sri Lanka, and with the World Cup less than two months away, there remain as many questions as answers. Here are a few – less obvious ones – to be getting on with… . Why does Moeen Ali not face the first ball of the innings? On the first day of the tour against Sri Lanka A, Alastair Cook played out a maiden at the start of England’s run-chase. In the next over, Moeen Ali hit six fours. A decision should have been made there and then to give Ali first strike. When I asked a member of the dressing-room why this wasn’t happening, he raised his eyebrows as if to consider the question, and replied: ‘Yeah, I don’t know.’ The folly of slowing down the innings almost before it had started was exposed – almost cruelly – during the first one-dayer, when Angelo Mathews twice won lbw shouts against Cook in the first over. Cook successfully challenged both, but England’s policy was being made to look ridiculous. And guess what? It was a maiden. Moeen Ali should face the first ball for England and be allowed to attack from the start . Why was James Tredwell dropped? There was at least some logic to leaving out England’s best one-day spinner in Hambantota, and it was backed up by a five-wicket victory. But to omit Tredwell for the next match, on a dry turner at the Premadasa, felt too clever by half. England said they wanted to have another look at Ben Stokes, as if his rock-bottom confidence was going to stage a miraculous recovery in a single game (in the event, he made six and bowled two overs for 21). They also argued, in private, that Tredwell hadn’t turned it much during the second match, also at the Premadasa. But, while Sri Lanka’s spinners picked up nine wickets in that fourth game, a Tredwell-less England lacked any sense of threat. What this team needed after pulling one back in Hambantota was to win again and engender some self-belief. Instead, they left out their best spinner on a bunsen. James Tredwell is England's best ODI spinner and should be in the side, especially on turning tracks . Why was Alex Hales not tried at No 3 from the start? Alex Hales should be part of England's top three . OK, OK, he should have been opening with Ali, but England weren’t budging on Cook, so first drop was Hales’s only option. But the selectors went for Ian Bell, who is their best Test batsman but has never really cracked the one-day malarkey. By the time the penny dropped, Hales was a man under more pressure than he should have been. England had discerned various technical ailments during his four one-dayers against India at the end of the summer, whereas most observers reckoned the more salient point was his ability to destroy world-class limited-overs attacks. He was iffy in Hambantota, then nicked a half-volley first ball at the Premadasa. His part in the run-out of Ali, plus a dropped catch at third man, did little to dispel a suspicion of occasional doziness. But it feels all too English to worry about what might go wrong. And Hales will, sometimes, go very, very right. Why do England keep bowling wides? In the warm-up game at the SSC, England sent down 14 wides in 43 overs. Ah, a bit of rust, we thought. They’ll sort it out. They didn’t. The first six one-day internationals produced 64 in wides, compared with 25 from Sri Lanka (by contrast, England have bowled only one no-ball, Sri Lanka five). Once or twice, the umpires’ interpretation of what constitutes a wide has not always favoured England. But not 64 times. Generally, the malaise has been two-pronged: misdirected bouncers, and leg-side indiscipline. Both should be avoidable. A list of the miscreants ahead of today’s seventh one-dayer: Woakes 12 wides, Ali 10, Jordan 10, Finn7, Gurney 7, Root 7, Stokes 6, Tredwell 3, Bopara 2. Why doesn’t Ravi Bopara bowl more? For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin . Going into Tuesday’s final match in Colombo, Bopara was England’s meanest seamer in this series, with an economy-rate of 5.46 (which tells its own story). Yet he had been given 15 overs in six matches, and never more than four in one. Cook plainly doesn’t trust him. Perhaps he should. What on earth has happened to Eoin Morgan? If the Morgan who hit 62 in 47 balls during the fourth game turns up at the World Cup, England will have a sniff. If it’s the Morgan who has otherwise scraped together 24 runs in five innings, they are doomed. There is a theory that Morgan is at his best a) when England are chasing, and he has a goal to aim for, and b) when, batting first, he doesn’t need to rebuild an innings. But these conditions do not always apply. Morgan says he neglected his own game while the new back-room staff bedded in at the start of the summer, and admits he was out-thought by India’s bowlers at the end. Whatever the reason, his decline has been one of the most alarming aspects of England’s one-day cricket since they returned from Australia. Eoin Morgan (left) knows what's coming as Suranga Lakmal successfully appeals in the sixth ODI . Why can no one mount a convincing case for the leadership of Cook? He’s the captain. It can’t be that hard. Paul Downton, the managing director, had a crack on Monday evening, even while admitting the selectors had thought long and hard at the end of the summer about Cook’s presence in the one-day team. Downton made the best case yet: Cook emerged from the Test win over India as the leader of a dressing-room that was fully behind him, and experienced openers will be needed against two new balls in Australia and New Zealand. The trouble was, his explanation will continue to lack conviction while Cook is failing and England are losing. The selectors have dug themselves into a hole. Now they’re reduced to crossing their fingers about a way out. Alastair Cook has had a horror series but England have stuck with him as ODI captain . Whither Ben Stokes? The buccaneer who slammed 164 for Durham in the semi-final of the Royal London One-Day Cup against Nottinghamshire has lost his way in England colours. Oh my century at Perth and my six-for at Sydney long ago… . Some of this is self-inflicted? He never regained his international equilibrium after breaking a wrist punching a locker in the Caribbean in March. But what exactly is his one-day role for England? No 8 seems too low, while fourth- and fifth-change (which is what he was in his two games here in Sri Lanka) felt like a slap in the face. Stokes will come again. But he needs a defined role – and a bit of TLC. Ben Stokes is low on confidence and doesn't seem to have a defined role in the England side . NIGHTWATCHMAN COMPETITION WINNER .

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . To live or die by the sword? A few days on from India’s heroic failure in Adelaide and this column is still torn. It was great that Virat Kohli urged his men to go down swinging: as a subconscious up-yours to the sterile cynicism of MS Dhoni’s leadership, it was hard not to love. But once Wriddhiman Saha and Kohli had fallen in quick succession, it didn’t need Dhoni to tell you that the only reasonable option was to go for the draw. And if Dhoni’s return means India revert to their cautious ways abroad, it may all come to nothing anyway. Virat Kohli (right) urged his India players to go down swinging against Australia in Adelaide . No escape for Captain Cook . Alastair Cook has repeatedly made a virtue of his absence from social media, where he is not exactly flavour of the month. But the newspaper shoved every morning under the doors of the England team here in Colombo – the hopelessly pro-government Daily News – may be harder to avoid. According to this morning’s edition, Sri Lanka ‘must continue to go hard at Alastair Cook’s British Lions and make them fly back with greater embarrassment and humiliation by winning the final bash’. Not only that, but Cook’s dropping of Kumar Sangakkara on 41 during the sixth one-dayer in Pallekele was a ‘COOK(up) for England’. With puns like that, who needs enemies? Cook leads England out in Colombo ahead of the seventh and final one-day international against Sri Lanka . Wot no KP?

Not once did the subject of Kevin Pietersen crop up. I say this not as evidence that no one cares – plenty do.

"The former Ku Klux Klan leader who is charged with killing three people at Jewish community sites in Kansas City has previously been arrested for soliciting a male prostitute who was black. The new revelation about Frazier Glenn Cross' past shows how the anti-Semitic gunman had a criminal history that runs against the hate-filled speech that he has spewed for decades. ABC reports that Frazier Glenn Cross was originally named Frazier Glenn Miller, rising through the ranks of the anti-Semitic and racist groups, founding the Carolina Knights of the KKK and the paramilitary White Patriot Party. Facing his actions: Frazier Glenn Cross, who is accused of killing three in an anti-Semitic shooting spree, was in and Olathe, Kansas courtroom on Thursday for a scheduling session . Past connections: Cross, pictured today, was given a new identity in 1990 but new reports have unveiled a history of having sex with male prostitutes and ratting on his friends in exchange for leniency . His name changed after he struck a deal with authorities by becoming a paid informant and got a lessened jail sentence for a separate slew of charges. Investigators only later realized that Miller had an earlier arrest involving a male prostitute. 'It was pretty shocking, because of his personal stances that he had taken and what he was now accused (of) engaging in,' J. Douglas McCullough told ABC. Mr McCullough is now a judge on the North Carolina state court of appeals but in 1987 when investigators were looking into Miller, he was a federal prosecutor. No public record of the 1986 arrest could be found by ABC but the situation was confirmed by Miller-who now goes by Cross- during a recorded call with the Southern Poverty Law Center- though he explained the arrest as his own effort to catch the prostitute gone-wrong. History of violence: Cross originally went by the name Frazier Glenn Miller (pictured in 1985) and created two racist and anti-Semitic groups and was once caught with a black prostitute who was a man masquerading as a woman . Miller said that he purposefully 'lured' the male prostitute who was dressed as a woman to the spot where they were caught because he planned on attacking the prostitute. The situation did not fit that description when police arrived, however. Mr McCullough said that the details of . the arrest are 'rather salacious. I think the facts speak for . themselves and people can draw their own conclusions about how . incongruous that is.' The . prostitution case was folded into the host of other charges lined up . against Miller who became the subject of a nation-wide manhunt after he . started sending out racist and anarchist literature, calling for an . uprising. Arrests: Miller was first arrested in 1987 and was in jail until 1990 before being arrested again this month (pictured) following the shootings . 'I realize fully that I will be caught quickly... but I will die with contempt on my lips and with sword in my hand. My fate will either be assassination or the death penalty,' he wrote in the letter, which he titled 'Declaration of War'. Miller fled from North Carolina and was caught by the Marshalls and the FBI in a early morning raid on a cabin in Ozark, Missouri on April 20, 1987. The sentiment behind the written bravado quickly dissepated after he was put behind bars and faced the prospect of more than 20 years in prison for his accumulation of charges. 'He stated that it was ""all a bluff that got out of hand,”' and FBI agent wrote in the case file obtained by ABC News. 'Having spent eight days in jail and having the opportunity to dry out from excessive alcohol consumption, he has learned to develop tolerance. He stated emphatically that he would never hurt anybody.' Taking that claim and his value as an informant who could move easily within the KKK community and report on his friends' activity, Miller was released from jail in 1990 and given a new name and social security number. 'I joined the family in Sioux City, Iowa... I enrolled in truck driving school…and I’ve been trucking ever since. And I love it. After prison, the freedom of the open road is gloriously exhilarating,' he wrote in a self-published autobiography. Being held: Frazier Glenn Cross (pictured on April 15) was arrested for the shooting deaths of three people in Kansas City but it has since been revealed that he was given that name after becoming an FBI informant and had a criminal past . Hate crime: The 73-year-old who goes by his new name of Frazier Glenn Miller now faces three first-degree murder charges and is expected to have hate crimes added to it . So far, the 73-year-old has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder but hate crimes charges are expected to come soon. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at an interfaith service following the shooting and indicated that the prosecution will be taking the case very seriously. 'Every alleged hate crime, no matter who the intended target, is an affront to who we are... both as a country and as people. These acts cannot be ignored,' Holder said at the April 17 service.","Frazier Glenn Cross was arrested on April 14 for shooting three at Kansas City Jewish centers .
Previously worked as a government informant after he was arrested under his original name, Frazier Glenn Miller .
Had a history of arrests- including one following a tryst with a black male prostitute posing as a woman- that led to his 1987 capture .

"QPR misfit Adel Taarabt has had hopes raised that he could yet secure a return to AC Milan. The Italians are looking for replacements after Stephan El Shaarawy broke a metatarsal in his right foot. The Milan forward, who was linked with a surprise move to Everton last week, will miss the next two months of the season. Taarabt had a productive loan spell at the San Siro last season and has been keen to return. QPR rejected an approach from Torino last week and there has also been interest from the Middle East. However, they want around £3million for the 25-year-old Morocco international. Adel Taarabt is keen on securing a move back to AC Milan after a successful loan spell last season . Taarabt has been frozen out at Queens Park Rangers by manager Harry Redknapp, but the club want £3million . Milan are also considering a move for Roma's Mattia Destro who has been offered to English clubs but none have taken up the bait so far. Wolfsburg have also been offered Destro as they stall over Chelsea's asking price for Andre Schurrle. Despite Schurrle's father Joachim and his agent Ingo Haspel visiting London for talks, Wolfsburg sporting executive Klaus Allofs has continued to play down the prospect of Schurrle signing for them with Borussia Dortmund also interested in the 24-year-old. AC Milan are considering a move for Roma's Mattia Destro, who has also been offered to English clubs . Destro, pictured scoring for Roma against Palermo, could be set for a move away from the club . Allofs said on Monday: 'There's nothing to [the speculation]. Even if we were interested, we'd certainly not be alone.' Chelsea want around £30m for Germany World Cup winner Schurrle and have had interest from four other clubs but the valuation is proving an obstacle. Wolfsburg are continuing to field enquiries for Kevin de Bruyne. They know Manchester United and Manchester City have watched the Belgium international while Bayern Munich have also expressed an interest to the player's camp. Meanwhile, QPR will ask for Frazier Campbell to be part of any Jordon Mutch deal with Crystal Palace. West Ham have revived their deal for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie. The 20-year-old is poised to fly down to London and undergo a medical later this week ahead of finalising terms. Reading and Bournemouth have also shown an interest in the Scotland U21 international but he had his heart set on a move to Upton Park. The deal looked to be off last week when Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham for stalling over seeing the deal through after making an initial offer to club and player. However, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations and a transfer is back on for one of Scotland's most promising defenders. Stephen Hendrie looks set for a move to West Ham, and will undergo a medical at the club later this week . Hendrie is a left-back, currently at Hamilton, but the 20-year-old is poised for a move to the Premier League . Hamilton had shown an interest in West Ham's Dan Potts but Blackpool are hopeful of clinching his signature instead. The 20-year-old left-back is the son of former West Ham captain Steve Potts. West Ham are also continuing talks with Darren Fletcher. Manchester United will allow the 30-year-old to leave on a free transfer and will contribute to his salary but there is still some negotiating to be done to reach the desired contract. It may take until the weekend for it to be resolved. Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis and is looking to make up for lost time with his next move. The Scotland international is a popular figure at Old Trafford but wants to play regular first team football. West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is due in Rome on Tuesday ahead of a medical with Lazio. The 21-year-old has agreed to join the club in the summer and is due to sign a pre-contract if all goes to plan. Morrison has been offered a four year contract.

The deal was agreed on Tuesday morning as Neil Lennon looks to add some pace into his attack. The 27-year-old Traore, a Burkina Faso international, was also on West Brom's extensive list of potential targets. He can play as a forward or attacking midfielder and on the left wing. Apart from pace and good technique, Traore is adept at taking free-kicks which will provide extra ammunition for Emile Heskey, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Co.

Striker Traore (centre) can play as an attacking midfielder, left winger or forward, and takes a good free-kick . Wigan manager Malky Mackay was among spectators at Leigh on Monday night as Manchester United U21s beat Liverpool U21s 2-1. Mackay is keen to see what is available on loan with United's Nick Powell and Jesse Lingard among those being considered. Powell, who scored in the game, has had loan spells at Wigan before and has also drawn interest from Derby and Bolton in recent weeks. However, his loan at Leicester was cut short amid concerns over his attitude and Mackay will consider that as he faces a relegation scrap. Liverpool are ready to allow winger Sheyi Ojo to go out on loan too. Liverpool U21 manager Michael Beale said: 'There’s a lot of interest around him in terms of loan. We’ve got to make sure it’s the right thing for Sheyi and if he goes out that he’s going to play.' Nick Powell (centre) was being watched by Malkay Mackay on Monday as Manchester United took on Liverpool . In the Under 21 match, Jesse Lingard was also under observation as Mackay considers a loan deal . Crystal Palace have been offered Togo forward Serge Gakpe from Nantes.

"Borussia Dortmund are laying the groundwork for the potential departure of Mats Hummels to Manchester United. Hummels has underlined in recent days that he intends to see out his contract but it is understood meetings have taken place outlining a price to United of around £37million. Dortmund have also earmarked a potential replacement in Dinamo Kiev's Aleksandar Dragovic and have made contact this week. Dortmund are laying the groundwork for the potential departure of Mats Hummels to Manchester United . Dortmund have been looking at Aleksandar Dragovic (right) as a replacement for Hummels . Hummels has shown signs of frustration at being constantly asked the question of whether he will depart for Old Trafford, snapping at reporters, and it has not helped Dortmund's cause. They are staring relegation in the face as they prepare for the second half of the Bundesliga season and Jurgen Klopp has called for the group to close together with Marco Reus also the subject of interest from Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea as his release clause kicks in. United have not denied interest in Hummels but have asked about other players in his position too. Kiev's Dragovic, 23, is one of those who has been watched by United also but has had mixed scouting reports. West Ham were also keen but his value is out of their budget at £15m. Leicester City did make a bold attempt to take him on loan this week, offering a fee and to cover his wages, but the player declined. Sadik El Fitouri impressed Manchester United coaches in a trial game and could join the club . Manchester United are ready to offer a contract to Salford City trialist Sadik El Fitouri. Sportsmail revealed how the 20-year-old right back, who only joined Salford in December, had impressed staff during a game between United's Under 21s and first-team fringe players. He has continued to impress in training and in games and United are willing to offer an 18-month deal. El Fitouri was a junior at Manchester City but apparently fell out of love with the game and his limited prospects of breaking through. He joined Salford but was encouraged to try for United and that now looks to have paid off. He won't necessarily jump straight into the first-team squad but will help boost numbers and quality in Warren Joyce's Under 21 set-up. Paris Saint-Germain remain the most prominent club chasing the signature of United teenager Andreas Pereira who is out of contract in the summer. Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah is still being discussed as a potential makeweight in the Juan Cuadrado deal . Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah is still being discussed as a potential makeweight in the deal that brings Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea from Fiorentina. Talks were ongoing last night and this morning with Real Sociedad and Roma also in the frame. Jose Mourinho is keen to help Moyes in particular but the Egyptian is keen on Italy. As revealed by Sportsmail, Chelsea will sell Andre Schurrle, are in talks over Cuadrado and have tabled a parallel bid for Douglas Costa at Shakhtar Donetsk. Fiorentina have so far refused to budge form their valuation of Colombian midfielder Cuadrado . Swansea City are trying to sign Southampton midfielder Jack Cork. The 25-year-old was given an ultimatum by Southampton manager Ronald Koeman to sign a new contract this week as his deal ends in the summer and the club want to protect themselves against losing him for nothing. Koeman has enquired about Feyenoord's Tonny Vilhena and is down the line in talks with Benfica over the loan of Filip Djuricic. Looming large is the expected bids from Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool for Morgan Schneiderlin. His departure could give Cork more opportunities but the likelihood is Southampton will buy another replacement with Jordy Clasie in Koeman's sights. Swansea will offer around £3m for Cork and see how the next few days shape up. Swansea will offer around £3million for Cork and see how the next few days shape up . Aston Villa have joined Newcastle by showing interest in MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli. Newcastle are willing to pay £4m rising to £5m and allow the 18-year-old to return to Dons on loan for the rest of the season. Villa have discussed a similar deal with slightly more up front for the England Under 19 international who has scored 12 goals this season. Manager Karl Robinson re-iterated: 'We know there has been communications with clubs. We hope we can do right by Dele and the club as well. I can't see him not wearing our shirt for the rest of the season. Part of the deal would be him staying with us for the rest of the season and joining whoever it is in the summer. 'There's no deal completely confirmed yet.' Alli, who has also been watched by Liverpool and Bayern Munich, made his MK debut as a 16-year-old in November 2012, and has gone on to play 75 games, scoring 20 goals, and signed a contract until 2017 in September. Aston Villa have joined Newcastle by showing interest in MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli . Villa are giving a trial to Michael Jordan Nkololo. The 22-year-old striker is hoping to impress Paul Lambert after playing at French side Chateauroux this season. They have also declared an interest in Besiktas striker Demba Ba who will be considerably more expensive. West Ham hope to have an answer from Darren Fletcher with a two-and-a-half year deal on the table and the option of an extra year. The Manchester United midfielder, who is now cured from ulcerative colitis following surgery, has had further talks with West Brom and Valencia but the latter has slipped away with Spain's deadline tomorrow night and Valencia unable to move out three players. Fletcher has been allowed to leave on a free transfer and United will pay a contribution towards his wages with the 30-year-old at pains to point out he has had no dispute with Ed Woodward or Louis Van Gaal who he says have both been supportive in his move away. Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie underwent his medical today at West Ham's training ground ahead of agreeing a pre-contract for the summer. Ravel Morrison has agreed his move to Italian side Lazio and will wear the number four shirt. West Ham hope to have an answer from Darren Fletcher with a two-and-a-half year deal on the table . Ravel Morrison posted this picture on Instagram showing his name on the back of a Lazio shirt . Wigan are taking a look at Icelandic goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsen.

Wigan are also taking a look at Olympiacos left-back Gaetan Bong. The 26-year-old Cameroon international is training with the club ahead of a potential deal.

"Valencia remain the preferred choice of Darren Fletcher despite West Ham's overtures to the Manchester United midfielder. Key to his move is the departures of Manchester City loanee Bruno Zuculini, Filipe Augusto of Rio Ave and Javi Fuego. Zuculini has been offered to Getafe on loan while Augusto is ready to return to Portugal and Fuego, an influence in the dressing room, is looking for a better contract elsewhere. Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher is keen on sealing a move to La Liga outfit Valencia . Fletcher's representatives have been in talks with Valencia over his potential move to the Mestalla Stadium . An added complication is that Valencia coach Nuno and sporting director Francisco Rufete are slightly at odds over what the team needs but they are pressing to lose those three to make room for Fletcher. Fletcher has been asked to stay at Manchester United where Louis van Gaal and Ed Woodward see him as an important member of the current squad and the club's future off the pitch. Despite the emotional pull though he wants to play and at 30 believes, health permitting, he has a lot still to give. West Ham have pushed hard to sign him and he has offers from West Brom and Celtic plus another Premier League side. Louis van Gaal is keen on keeping hold of Fletcher as he sees him as an important member of his squad . Valencia have been talking to Fletcher's representatives since before Christmas and have picked up the thread of those early conversations in recent weeks, convincing Fletcher they want him to play a significant role. They splashed out on Benfica's Enzo Perez which shed some doubt on the need for Fletcher but now Fuego has asked to go. The 31-year-old has even been offered to West Ham in recent weeks and wants to move as he is on a relatively poor contract compared with that of his team-mates. Fletcher likes the idea of a move to a different league and the lure of Valencia with their history and new business project is the most appealing. Chelsea have sounded out Fiorentina over Juan Cuadrado's availability. The move comes as they consider offers for their first-team fringe forwards with Wolfsburg still in the race for Andre Schurrle and Roma and Fiorentina discussing deals for Mohamed Salah. Cuadrado has a £26.8m release clause and Fiorentina are reluctant to deal for anything less. The 26-year-old Colombian has not been in the best form but was an option for Jose Mourinho when he was at Real Madrid. The clubs have held discussions in recent days and Chelsea winger Marko Marin has cut short his loan at the Italian club, leaving Fiorentina to join Belgian champions Anderlecht. Mourinho will look for a new signing should Wolfsburg and Roma come up with concrete bids for his players and Cuadrado is in his thoughts. Jose Mourinho may decide to make a move for Juan Cuadrado (left) if Andre Schurrle leaves for Wolfsburg . West Ham have been quoted £4m for Nigeria defender Azubuike Egwueke and will need to restructure their offer for Scotland Under 21 international Stephen Hendrie. The club had a £500,000 offer rejected last week for the 25-year-old who they see as a potential replacement for wantaway centre-back Winston Reid. West Ham have also been told they will need to revise their offer for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie. Hamilton have turned down an initial offer in the region of £2m for the 20-year-old who is regarded as one of the best young prospects to come out of Scotland in years. Hendrie is expected to follow a similar path to Hull's Andy Robertson who joined in the summer from Dundee United and has been a big success in his first season prior to injury. Celtic, Swansea and Crystal Palace have all watched Hendrie but West Ham have made the step of making an offer as they want back-up to Aaron Cresswell. Norwich City, managed by former Hamilton boss Alex Neil, are also keen as Martin Olsson has asked to go in a bid to push through a move to Swansea. The Hammers are interested in signing Azubuike Egwueke and Stephen Hendrie . Stephane Mbia is looking to return to the Premier League on a free transfer. The Cameroon international holding midfielder is on a short-term contract with Spanish side Sevilla but has an agreement with the club that he can leave in this window. Crystal Palace and Everton have already had tentative talks with his representatives and the 28-year-old is ready to make the move back to England where he has retained a flat in Chelsea. Mbia had a spell at Queens Park Rangers in 2012 after joining in a swap deal that saw Joey Barton go on loan to Marseille. Rangers suffered as their large influx of new players failed to gel and they were relegated. However, Mbia went on loan to Sevilla where he showed his ability and helped guide Sevilla to Europa League victory over Benfica, scoring his penalty in the shootout. Crystal Palace and Everton target Stephane Mbia is keen on a move back to the Premier League . Mbia, pictured with Arsenal's Theo Walcott, had a brief spell at Queens Park Rangers in 2012 . He was named in the Europa League team of the year and was nominated for best African player in the Spanish league. His agent Jean-Paul Ndoumin said: 'Stephane signed a short-term contract with Sevilla as he wanted the opportunity in this window to discuss a return to the Premier League. It is a league that excites him and one he believes is the most challenging and he likes a challenge. 'He feels the Premier League didn't see the best of him at QPR and he wants to put that right. He doesn't want to wait until the last minute he is ready to move now.' Several Premier League sides are searching for a holding midfielder and Mbia has the attributes. He can also sign a pre-contract for the summer. Tottenham are close to agreeing a deal with Swansea City for defender Kyle Naughton. Talks have been ongoing over recent weeks and now look close to drawing to an amicable conclusion. Swansea remain in the market to bring in a striker on loan amid concerns over the future of Bafetimbi Gomis. They are awaiting an improved offer from Crystal Palace for Neil Taylor and will wait on that before pressing ahead in a deal for Norwich's Martin Olsson. Palace are continuing to discuss a bid for Rudy Gestede at Blackburn although the striker trained alongside team-mates on Tuesday morning as he waits for the deal to be struck. Palace had a £3.5m offer rejected last week. Tottenham Hotspur have agreed a fee with Swansea City to sell defender Kyle Naughton . The agent of Arsenal target Marcelo Brozovic has confirmed interest from 'major English clubs'. Everton . Talking to Europacalcio.it, Miroslav Bicanic dismissed reports the Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia midfielder would be joining Napoli. He said: 'I deny what has been said in the last few days, it’s not true that he will go to Napoli. I have not heard anything from the club. 'There are offers from major English clubs, but right now I will not name names.' Dinamo Zagreb's Marcelo Brozovic has offers from 'major English clubs', according to his agent . Leeds United are showing an interest in Celtic striker Anthony Stokes. The former Arsenal and Sunderland forward is keen to move back to England and Leeds want him to help steer them out of their current malaise. The difficulty is that they are under a transfer embargo so any deal would have to be done on an initial loan. The 26-year-old has scored eight goals this season and also attracted interst from Cardiff. Leeds United target Anthony Stokes would jump at the chance of sealing a move back to England . Wolves club captain Sam Ricketts has been made available for loan by manager Kenny Jackett. The 33-year-old has only made five appearances this season with his last game against Brentford on November 29. Asked about allowing him out on loan, Jackett said: 'Yes we would, but no-one’s come in for him and Sam hasn’t been jumping up and down to go out. 'Sam’s been out of the picture and, with younger players showing the form they have, first-team prospects are slim.' Wolves captain Sam Ricketts (centre) has been told he can leave Molineux by manager Kenny Jackett . MK Dons and Rotherham are showing an interest in Chesterfield's Charlie Raglan. The 20-year-old defender, who was playing for FC United 18 months ago, only joined in April last year and was seen by Paul Cook as one for the future. However, his performances have attracted attention from other clubs who also see potential in the former Port Vale trainee. Meanwhile, Chesterfield midfielder Romuald Boco has left the League One club to join Indian side Bharat FC. The 29-year-old Benin international joined the Spireites in the summer on non-contract terms and scored one goal in 19 appearances. Chesterfield defender Charlie Raglan (right) is being tracked by MK Dons and Rotherham . Everton teenage striker Chris Long has joined Brentford on loan. The England Under 20 international is highly rated at Goodison but manager Roberto Martinez wants him to pick up more experience. Long, born in Huyton, has been at Everton since he was five. He came on as a substitute in Everton's Europa League tie against Krasnodar at the end of last year and has impressed in pre-season but his only other league experience came at MK Dons last season when he scored one goal in four games. Long is quick and composed and likes to take a shot on from outside the box as he proved in pre-season against German side Paderborn. He joins high-flying Brentford on a youth loan and manager Mark Warburton is looking to add further signings before the window closes to bolster his promotion push.

"Manchester United have recalled Reece James from his loan spell at Rotherham United amid interest from Premier League and Championship clubs. The 21-year-old has impressed under Steve Evans at the New York Stadium where he has played eight games since joining on an emergency loan at the end of November. However, his form has alerted other clubs who are looking to strengthen their defence in the January window. Manchester United youngster Reece James (second right) has been recalled from Rotherham United . Evans said: 'He is an outstanding young left back or indeed can be utilised further forward as and when needed.' James had a successful pre-season with United on their US tour, notably scoring twice against LA Galaxy, and excited coach Louis van Gaal, but he has been pushed down the pecking order after injury and the subsequent return of England international Luke Shaw. He is out of contract in the summer and is now considering his options with the next step an important one in his career. James is unlikely to get a chance in the United first team due to the return of Luke Shaw (pictured) from injury . Norwegian side Sandefjord have opened the door for controversial striker Ched Evans to join them - although the Ministry of Justice have said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for him to play abroad, unless he is successful in the appeal against his conviction. This is due to the terms of his licence, which state Evans needs to meet regularly with their offender manager which would be difficult to do abroad.. The convicted rapist is struggling to get a club in England as the adverse publicity and public reaction puts off clubs and sponsors alike. However, former Nottingham Forest and Derby County midfielder Lars Bohinen is manager of Sandefjord and has confirmed he would give Evans a chance. Convicted rapist Ched Evans may be given route back into football in Norway - but only if his appeal succeeds . Bohinen said: 'I believe that when you have served your sentence, then a person should not be punished anymore. You should not be charged for it later. 'Yes, I would not have any problems [signing Evans if he performed during a trial]. It would be terrible if we would not let convicted people get back into the workforce.' Talking to Dagbladet, he added: 'In theory, there should not be any issue with the club's sponsors. But the mechanism of football is such that you can quickly become influenced by sponsors today. 'It will cost society more should convicts not go back to a job. If you have you made a mistake there should not be any obstacle [to returning to work].' Norwegian side Sandefjord's manager has revealed he would consider giving Evans a trial . Roma are weighing up an offer for Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. Coach Rudi Garcia is looking for alternatives as striker Mattia Destro is in talks with various clubs but particularly AC Milan. Adebayor is a player Garcia knows well and Roma have a good relationship with Tottenham. His wages are a concern but Roma are the calibre of club Adebayor would like to join. Roma are weighing up an offer for Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor . Tottenham have potential targets in the shape of Burnley's Danny Ings and Carlos Bacca at Sevilla should Adebayor go. They are awaiting bids for Aaron Lennon from Everton, Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion. Spurs also expect more talks with Juventus over Paulinho and offers for captain Younes Kaboul but most of their incomings are being considered for summer. Spurs captain Younes Kaboul (right) could be heading out of White Hart Lane if offers come in . Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah is wanted on loan by Bundesliga side Hamburg but the Egyptian is holding out for a better move. It is understood he has also been offered to Fiorentina, who want to send back Marko Marin and are trying to offload big-earner Mario Gomez in the process, but the Italians have other priorities. Marin is wanted on loan at Wolfsburg, who could look to make the move permanent. Mohamed Salah (right) of Chelsea is wanted by Hamburg on loan but he wants to hold out for a better move . Fiorentina are also looking to offload former Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani. The 30-year-old playmaker is available on a free transfer. Meanwhile, Chelsea youngster Nathaniel Chalobah's proposed loan move to Bordeaux has broken down. Similar to the position of Hatem Ben Arfa, Chalobah had already played Chelsea's Under 21 side, which counts as an official match before going on loan to Burnley. Therefore Bordeaux would be the third, which is against FIFA regulations. The breakdown of the move has been confirmed by Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud. Ben Arfa's case is the subject of an emergency meeting called by France's Legal Affairs Committee of the LFP (Professional Football League) on Thursday afternoon. Nathaniel Chabolah, who has been loaned to Burnley this season, has seen his move to Bordeaux threatened . Lille have had an offer rejected for Ajax’s Icelandic forward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson. The deal is of significance in the Premier League as, should it go through, it would allow Liverpool to bring forward the signing of Divock Origi from Lille. That would then trigger West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace to renew interest in Rickie Lambert. Lille, who are also pursuing Benfica’s Derley, have offered around £4million for Sigthorsson, who was a target for Queens Park Rangers before their budget was slashed. Lille forward Divock Origi's move to Liverpool could be quickened if the French club sign another forward . Stoke City defender Robert Huth is a target for Fulham and Watford. The combative centre back wants to move to a Premier League side but Stoke like the idea of him going to the Championship as it will allow them to recall the 30-year-old should they pick up injuries. The Berlin-born former Chelsea defender would prefer a permanent move however to a Premier League side. Stoke City defender Robert Huth is a target for Championship sides Fulham and Watford . West Bromwich Albion have been mentioned but manager Tony Pulis is reluctant to go back for players from his former club. Fulham boss Kit Symons wants experience to aid the youngsters in his side as they look to jump up the Championship table. West Brom are also among clubs considering a £4m bid for Lokomotiv Moscow's Vedran Corluka. West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis is unlikely to move for his former defender Huth . Santos made a late move to sign Samuel Eto'o on Wednesday night but the Everton striker seems intent on a return to Italy with Sampdoria. The Brazilian club offered five-million euros (£3.8m) over two seasons for the 33-year-old. But, despite the lure of joining such a famous club, he is keen on a return to Italy. Santos made a late move to sign Everton's Samuel Eto'o but he wants to return to Italy with Sampdoria . Brighton & Hove Albion are showing interest in Tranmere Rovers midfielder Max Power after he turned down the offer of a new contract. Power has been at Tranmere since the age of eight but is out of contract in the summer and has drawn attention from various clubs with some eye-catching performances and 10 goals this season, including one against Swansea City in the FA Cup. Celtic, Rangers, Burnley and Sheffield Wednesday have all sent scouts to watch him but Brighton are now also in the race for his signature. Tranmere could sell in this window or take the option of compensation when the 21-year-old leaves in the summer. Brighton & Hove Albion have joined a host of clubs chasing the signature of Max Power from Tranmere Rovers . Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill has confirmed his interest in signing George Saville on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers and will also look to add James Tavernier on loan from Wigan Athletic.

Legia Warsaw have accepted a revised offer from Arsenal and it's now up to the 17-year-old to decide.

"President Obama is putting a symbolic . twist on a time-honored tradition, taking the oath of office for his . second term with his hand placed not on a single Bible, but two - one . owned by Martin Luther King Jr. and one by Abraham Lincoln. The inclusion of King's Bible is . particularly significant since the inauguration comes on Jan. 21, the . federal holiday in honor of the civil rights leader, who delivered his . 'I Have a Dream' speech 50 years ago at the Lincoln Memorial. Obama will . be facing the memorial as he takes the oath. King's Bible, which his . children say he used early in his career as a preacher, has never been . part of a presidential inauguration before. Swearing in: The First Lady Michelle Obama holds the Lincoln Bible as President Obama takes the oath of office in 2009, this time he will use two Bibles . The inclusion of MLK's Bible in President Obama's inauguration is particularly significant as it is 50 years since the civil rights leader delivered his 'I Have a Dream' speech at the Lincoln Memorial .

Washington began the tradition with a Bible hastily grabbed from St. John's Masonic Lodge No. 1 for his swearing-in on April 30, 1789, in New . York. Since then, presidents have typically chosen Bibles with . historical or personal significance, many using family heirlooms. Obama . is not the first president to select two Bibles - Harry Truman did so . in 1949, Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 and Richard Nixon in 1969. The selection of the pair of Bibles by . Obama is richly symbolic of the struggle for equality in America, . beginning with Lincoln's emancipation of the slaves through King's civil . rights movement and ultimately to Obama becoming the nation's first . black president. Inaugural planners say Obama plans to place his left . hand on the stacked Bibles held by first lady Michelle Obama as he . raises his right hand to repeat the oath administered by Supreme Court .

His daughter . Bernice King says her father marked the pages with several dates from . May 1954, the same month he delivered his first sermon. 'We know our father would be deeply . moved to see President Obama take the oath of office using his Bible,' King's children said in a statement provided by the inaugural committee.

"Leicester are in discussions about taking Andrej Kramaric on a permanent deal after Chelsea failed to guarantee that the player would return to them at the end of the season. HNK Rijeka striker Kramaric wanted to sign for Chelsea and had agreed personal terms but did not want to spend his time on loan elsewhere next season. Leicester are now exploring the possibility of offering extra bonus payments to entice Kramaric for them. VIDEO Scroll down to see Chelsea target Kramaric in action for Dinamo Zagreb . Andrej Kramaric looks set to join a Premier League side with Chelsea and Leicester chasing his signature . Chelsea had planned to loan Kramaric to Leicester, here's why they can't... Premier League Rule V.7.1 . 'A Temporary Transfer to a Club may not take place in the Transfer Window in which the Transferor Club acquired the Player's registration.' This PL rule wrecked the plan for Chelsea to sign Kramaric from Rijeka then loan him to Leicester and complicated the move. But the rule only covers loan deals between PL clubs. It would not have stopped Chelsea signing Kramaric and then loaning him abroad, as they did with Kurt Zouma last January. Chelsea now seem to have backed out of the deal altogether, leaving Leicester to pick up negotiations to sign him permanently. The player travelled to London on Monday and is in discussions with both clubs. Chelsea had initially outlined an £8million deal that would see the player loaned to Leicester for the rest of the season. But this has been complicated as Premier League Rule V.7.1 states the loan deal between the Premier League clubs would not be allowed, preventing him from joining Leicester immediately after signing for Chelsea. Leicester, who signed Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea last week, have been keen to back manager Nigel Pearson in his bid to salvage their Premier League status. That is evident in their pursuit of a striker. Apart from their efforts to sign Kramaric, they have made an offer to Toronto for Jermain Defoe and have tabled an £8m bid for Mainz forward Shinji Okazaki. The Japan international has scored eight goals in 16 games this season but Mainz want £10m for the 28-year-old. Leicester have also made a £7.5m offer for Danny Ings at Burnley and have had a £750,000 offer for Wigan's Shaun Maloney rejected. Mark Schwarzer has joined Leicester as the club look to stay in the Premier League . West Bromwich Albion do not need to sell Saido Berahino to fund new signings. The 21-year-old has been linked with Tottenham and Liverpool but the London club have no intention of bidding for the striker in January while the Reds are not planning to spend at this stage. West Brom don't need to sell striker Saido Berahino (top) to fund new signings . Albion have not had an offer for Berahino, who is valued at £25million, and he will stay at West Brom barring any late change of plans but Tony Pulis still wants to add around three players. Club record striker Brown Ideye could leave, however, as Sunderland, Newcastle and Hull have retained an interest despite his lack of goals since his £10m summer move from Dinamo Kiev. Lille have played down the prospects of Divock Origi joining Liverpool early from his season-long loan. Liverpool need a striker and have clubs showing interest in Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert but Origi has scored just four goals this season and is struggling to find the form that earned him a starting place for Belgium at the World Cup. Divock Origi is unlikely to join Liverpool in this transfer window . Being thrust into the spotlight at Anfield where the pressure is greater is not seen as the wisest move. The player is keen to join but much may hinge on how Daniel Sturridge looks on his return to Melwood this week and how his thigh holds up to training and games. Lille director Jean-Michel Vandamme said: 'Origi to Liverpool now? It would cost at least £4.7m but at the moment it is not possible.' Origi (left), in action for Belgium at the World Cup, has scored four goals for Lille this season . They have been searching for a replacement for Origi with QPR target Kolbeinn Sigthorsson of Ajax one of their options. However, they have clubs hiking up the price thinking they are due more money from Liverpool. Liverpool have yet to step up interest in Xherdan Shaqiri of Bayern Munich who is talking to Inter Milan and Juventus but are on the lookout for a cheap goalkeeper if they can find one. Liverpool have not stepped up their interest in Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri . Southampton are interested in Porto defender Bruno Martins Indi. The Holland international was a target for Ronald Koeman in the summer but had already agreed a move to Portugal. Now Koeman is back in for Indi, a target for Everton and Liverpool in the past, who can play at centre-back and full-back. He has been capped on 26 occasions by his country and Southampton will see if a deal can be done this month with Porto keen for cash. Porto's Holland international Bruno Martins Indi (left) is attracting interest from Southampton . Manchester United are poised to offer a professional contract to young Belgian Indy Boonen. The left-back has impressed in two trial spells and has recently been joined by his younger brother Seppe, 13, at United's Carrington training complex. Indy left Genk last summer but is now set to realise a dream by joining United's youth ranks. Meanwhile, Chelsea this week hope to beat Liverpool, Arsenal and United to St Etienne starlet Rayan Souici, 16. The defensive midfielder is already being compared with his idol Paul Pogba of Juventus. Arsenal target and St Etienne captain Loic Perrin has confirmed that he has been contacted over a move to the Emirates Stadium. Speaking after St Etienne's French Cup victory over AS Nancy, he said: 'I have been contacted personally. Arsenal is interested, but for now there is still no contact with Saint-Etienne.' St Etienne captain Loic Perrin (left) says he has been contacted by Arsenal over a possible move . Saint-Etienne-born Perrin, 29, who made his professional debut with his hometown club in 2003 and has made 235 top-flight appearances for them, was one of seven reserves named by Didier Deschamps for France's 2014 World Cup squad, and has been named in recent Les Bleus' squads. He is valued at £6m and can play at centre-back, right-back and defensive midfield. Iain Hume is on the lookout for a new club. The 31-year-old striker has returned from India where he was voted ISL Player of the League following his exploits with David James's Kerala Blasters. Oldham had been showing interest before controversially switching their attention to Ched Evans. Hume also has interest from the MLS and Bundesliga. Iain Hume is looking for a new club after returned from a spell in India . Barcelona are to offer new terms to defender Dani Alves. The right-back, who has been offered to Manchester United among others by intermediaries, is out of contract in the summer and free to talk to foreign clubs. Barcelona are set to offer Dani Alves a new deal at the club as his current contract runs out in the summer . He maintained last week that he has yet to be offered a new deal but club officials insist an offer is coming. Barcelona have had to re-evaluate their recruitment and contracts after CAS upheld their transfer ban until 2016. Alves, 31, says he will not make a decision on his future until the summer though. Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis is still weighing up potential moves this month. L'Equipe reported on Monday that the France international remains unsettled at Swansea despite Wilfried Bony's call-up to the Africa Cup of Nations allowing him more game time. Crystal Palace have lodged an £8m bid while Leicester, West Ham, Newcastle and Aston Villa have also shown an interest in the 29-year-old. Bafetimbi Gomis is looking at a potential  move away from Swansea this season . Millwall have signed Dan Harding on loan from Nottingham Forest. Millwall midfielder Josh Wright is joining Orient. Derby have signed Isak Ssewankambo on a free transfer from NAC Breda. The 18-year-old former Chelsea trainee can play right-back or midfield.

"Xherdan Shaqiri and his brother Erdin will be in Munich on Wednesday to hold crunch talks with Bayern Munich about a move to either Inter Milan or Liverpool. The forward is well liked by Brendan Rodgers but the Reds are reluctant to spend now and would prefer to look at a deal in the summer instead. Inter have offered £2million for a loan deal, similar to the one proposed to Arsenal for Lukas Podolski, but Bayern want to sell outright and would like Liverpool to come to the table. Xherdan Shaqiri and his brother, who is his agent, will be in Munich on Wednesday to decide his future . The forward is wanted by both Liverpool and AC Milan and could be allowed to leave Bayern Munich . Erdin, Xherdan's agent, wants to see if Bayern will accept a loan deal to Inter now with the prospect of joining Liverpool in the summer. Bayern are still on their winter break but the player's immediate future should come to a conclusion after Wednesday's meeting. Everton have drawn up a list of goalkeeping targets which includes Cardiff City's David Marshall and Alex McCarthy of Queens Park Rangers. Manager Roberto Martinez wants a keeper who can play at first-team level straight away as Tim Howard is out for the month - and possibly longer - with a torn calf. Current deputy Joel Robles has interest from Spain and could return but there is also interest in Howard from the MLS, who see the US goalkeeper as not only a good player but a very marketable one following his World Cup exploits. Cardiff City's David Marshall has emerged as a target for Everton as they search for a goalkeeper . Queens Park Rangers stopper Alex McCarthy (centre) is also among the targets for Everton . Cardiff rejected big offers for Marshall last year with Arsenal among his suitors but he has been one of the most consistent goalkeepers in England's top-two divisions over recent seasons. Norwich City's John Ruddy, Ali Al Habsi of Wigan Athletic, Sergio Romero of Sampdoria and Erwin Mulder of Feyenoord have also been mentioned. Ujpest goalkeeper and Serbia Under 21 international Marko Dmitrovic, 22, has also been invited to come in on trial. Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles has interest from Spain and could return to ply his trade there . The agents of Liverpool midfielder Suso were in Milan on Monday to broker his end-of-season transfer. Spaniard Suso was playing for Liverpool's Under 21 side in their 2-0 victory against Shrewsbury on Monday. Suso, who has not played for the Liverpool first team since their Capital One Cup penalty shoot-out win over Middlesbrough at Anfield on September 23, impressed during a 45-minute run-out as he eased his way back following a groin injury. Liverpool midfielder Suso's (right) agents were in Milan on Monday to attempt to broker a transfer . However, his appearances in a Reds shirt will be less frequent after his representatives agreed a four-year contract with AC Milan, to kick in from July. The 21-year-old is out of contract at Anfield in the summer so he is free to talk to European clubs, although initial approaches from Milan were made last August. What remains is whether Liverpool wish to negotiate letting him go now for a small fee. Milan are also discussing whether to allow Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel to return to Stamford Bridge and go out on another loan elsewhere. Suso's (right) contract is up at the end of the season and he is hoping to secure a move to AC Milan . Real Sociedad manager David Moyes will continue to take stock of possible loans from England this month but has ruled out moves for Everton's Arouna Kone and Mohamed Salah of Chelsea. Moyes, whose side beat Barcelona 1-0 on Sunday, has lost only one game since moving to Spain and is keen to build on the feelgood factor surrounding Sunday's victory. His staff are working on targets in Spain but he is also keen to add some experience if he can find it in January - with Arsenal's Joel Campbell one potential target from the Premier League. 'I’d like to add one or two to the squad, but on loan if it can be done,' said Moyes. 'I’ve got one or two in mind and maybe some from back home who would like the opportunity to come and play in Spain. If there’s one market I know best at the moment then it’s the British market.' Real Sociedad manager David Moyes is looking to make signings in January, possibly from England . The former Everton boss has ruled out a move for Toffees striker Arouna Kone (left) though . Newcastle United have been rebuffed in an initial attempt to sign M'Baye Niang from AC Milan. The former Caen forward has been courted by Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and West Ham United over recent seasons but has a poor reputation off the pitch which has often influenced clubs to not see a move through. The 20-year-old would like to join a Premier League side with Milan willing to let him leave - and wanting to add an option-to-buy clause to the deal - but Niang is also waiting to see if any other offers come in. Newcastle United have been rebuffed in an initial attempt to sign M'Baye Niang from AC Milan . Sheffield United have made a surprise enquiry for Dundee United's Gary Mackay-Steven. The 24-year-old Scotland international, formerly of Liverpool and Fulham, has five months left on his contract and has attracted scouts from Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion in recent weeks. Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson said: 'We did turn down a verbal offer last week. It's a very difficult one, we'd like Gary to stay. We've made him an offer to stay but there's only so much you can do. 'It's a very difficult one with Gary because he's only got about 20-21 weeks left on his contract but what difference will he make on the park in those weeks? We'll see how it goes and hopefully he's still playing here for a while yet.' Sheffield United and Wolverhampton Wanderers are among clubs also looking at West Ham striker Sean Maguire.

"If I’m not mistaken, Zlatan Ibrahimovic perpetrated a Marie Antoinette moment just after Paris Saint-Germain’s defeat of Rennes nine days ago. During the 1-0 win, which prepared them perfectly for Sunday’s top-of-the-table visit to leaders Lyon, the Parc des Princes fans once again whistled and ‘rhubarb-rhubarbed’ their unhappiness with PSG’s lack of ‘élan’. Asked about it, Zlatan declared that the peasants were revolting. Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic reacts during the match against Rennes last month . Ibrahimovic vies with Lille midfielder Rio Mavuba for the ball during the match last week . ‘Maybe they ate caviar before we came,’ he sneered dismissively from on high, perhaps forgetting the word for cake. ‘We don’t know what they want. We play good, they whistle. We play bad, they whistle.’ And the concept that PSG’s has become a self-obsessed, out-of-touch court, revolving around the foolishness and self-indulgence of Zlatan the Sun King (or should that be ‘sinking’?) forced its way through on Tuesday night, too. PSG won at Lille to reach the League Cup Final. But had Lille piped ‘Hi-ho, hi-ho it’s off to work we go’ from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs through speakers in their post-match mixed-zone, they would have scored a victory for the people. Certainly the fans and the media. Led by Zlatan, players like Maxwell, Zoumana Camara, Marquinhos, Edinson Cavani and Lucas, all in red-hooded sweatshirts, cravenly trotted behind the self-appointed Roi Soleil as he barked the order: ‘Follow me, follow me... nobody talks!’ ‘Why nobody talks?’ demanded a reporter. ‘Because I’m the boss’ tossed back Zlatan over his shoulder. Just another brace of incidents in Zlatan’s descent into physical decrepitude and then irrelevance? Or emblematic of PSG in isolation from the rest of French football? Ibrahimovic (right), David Luiz and their PSG team-mates are being seen in France as pompous . In that sense, Sunday night at the Stade Gerland is the beginning not only of the entertaining three-way push for the title (including Marseille) but a hint at a wider referendum on French football. PSG have not won hearts or minds. Not only in their own stadium, but more widely. Obviously, given their wealth, the blue-collar mass of French football want to knit by the side of the demise of the aristocracy. That’s only natural. But Laurent Blanc, and now Zlatan, are symbols of the first era of Parisian mega-wealth - and how it’s in decline. Blanc will be super fortunate to survive past this summer given that neither his personality nor his football convince. Ibrahimovic has played magnificently but won’t stay beyond the end of his contract and is quite evidently in physical decline. Equally, many in French football used to feel similarly about Lyon. Having never won the title before 2002, they repeated the feat seven times until 2008. Lyon midfielder Corentin Tolisso (right) celebrates with Mouhamadou Dabo after scoring against Metz . Lyon head coach Hubert Fournier reacts during his side's draw against Monaco in Ligue 1 . They even reached the Champions League semi-finals as recently as 2010 having often excelled in that competition - winning three and drawing four of their first seven competitive meetings with Real Madrid. But Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas saw the lie of the land long before Qatar money bought PSG. After a 5-2 thrashing by Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in March 2009, he announced to the French media that the country’s domestic football was pathetic - ‘third division’ in European terms. He savaged the pitches, the stadia, the development but, above all, the investment of intelligence, forward-planning, marketing and awareness of the football public. So, six-years on, meet a man of his word. That rarest of breed: a visionary, open, ambitious, ‘judge my words by my actions’ kinda guy. Aulas has ripped up not only the squad but his club’s philosophy of buying foreign stars. He set out on what has been a thorny and debilitating project to construct a new, larger stadium and has continued to both speak out, and act, on the need to modernise and re-construct almost all of French club football. Lyon defender Lindsay Rose runs during a training session ahead of the PSG clash this weekend . He has helped push through FFP, argues for an 18-team Ligue 1, the scrapping of the League Cup and harangues the short-sighted. Creditably, during Lyon’s rebuilding since their last title win, the club has dropped out of the top three just twice in six seasons. But if Hubert Fournier’s team can win on Sunday night, then push on to the title, many will view it as a huge and just reward for a strategy of cleverly calculated risk and putting money where the mouth is. Aulas says: ‘Stadium construction has taken a little longer than expected. It should be ready by the end of this year. Suddenly we’ll have nearly 60,000 capacity, up by 20,000, so filling it is a worry. But it will be easier to fill a stadium custom-built for families and businesses.’ Ibrahimovic (right) views with Lille defender Marko Basa (centre) during the French League Cup match . During a process which has nearly ruined big clubs in the past (Chelsea, Valencia), Aulas has cut the player salary bill by 40 per cent. Partly achieved by selling stars, partly by using home-bred youth, partly by recruiting cheaper players, it’s an equation which can lead to the ‘big stadium, poor team, low attendance’ nightmare. Hence the importance of how Lyon are performing this season. To move onward and upwards, the team must make the new stadium magnetic. Now they have to stop selling. ‘We’ve invested €400million in this project,’ he said. ‘More than Monaco and PSG combined have spent on buying players recently! ‘But we project it should initially generate €40/50m, rising to €64/80m if we consolidate. Then eventually to €200m. That’s without selling players. Figures like this would put us back in the European top 10.’ And they would be welcome.

Tiago Mendes opened the scoring for the reigning champions at a raucous Vicente Calderon after 13 minutes and substitute Saul Niguez doubled the lead with an acrobatic goal just moments after replacing Koke.

"There aren’t many coaches whose team barely musters a noticeable support for home games and has the measly total of only five home goals all season — whose predecessor was just ‘sold’ for €4million to a Chinese team — who is sufficiently confident the day before facing the reigning European champions to claim: ‘I really don’t think I’m far off coaching Real Madrid’. But the fact is that Quique Sanchez Flores is a bit special. A quality which will need to be flooding out of him like a river in spate if the beleaguered mob he’s just taken charge of, Getafe, are not to feel the whiplash of a displeased Madrid side facing their third derby match in less than a fortnight. Perhaps, if your memory is elephantine, you may recall Quique for his Getafe side beating the Galáctico Real Madrid of Iker Casillas, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Michael Owen just short of 10 years ago during his previous single season in charge of this club. Much more likely is that you know Quique for having seeded the Atletico Madrid revolution. Goalkeeper David de Gea was given his big break at Atletico Madrid by Quique Sanchez Flores . He gave Diego Costa his debut, was brave enough to establish 19-year-old David de Gea as first-choice keeper, won the Europa League in 2010, knocking out Sporting, Valencia, Liverpool and then beating Fulham in the final — plus his Rojiblancos then defeated treble-holders Inter Milan for the European Supercup. It ended in tears. Doesn’t it always? But notwithstanding Diego Simeone’s brilliance, the Argentinian largely inherited a ‘made’ squad when he succeeded Quique three years ago. So, the 49-year-old carries a bit of Madrileño football baggage into this lunchtime’s derby match at the Alfonso Pérez Coliseum (Sky Sports 5, 10.55am). But the fact is that he’s actually a minor royal in the Real Madrid dynasty. To explain. Quique’s father (Isidro) was a quadruple Spanish title-winner with the almighty Real of di Stéfano, Gento, Puskas and del Sol. Quique’s mother (Carmen) and aunt (‘Lola of Spain’) were both massively famous singers, flamenco dancers and movie stars. Chelsea striker Diego Costa was another player to flourish under Flores at Atletico Madrid . And as far as children of the 1960’s go, there could barely be a better Godfather than Don Alfredo di Stéfano — the legendary Blond Arrow himself. Quique’s cousins all became famous in music, television or cinema, such that the family Sanchez/Flores must, at times, have felt that ‘Spain belongs to us ... Spain loves us’. Little wonder that Quique isn’t short of some natural assurance. His stock is both gypsy, and thoroughbred — his life has been spent in the elite. Not spent without trials and tribulations however. Just as he was performing well enough as a full-back to be picked for Spain [he went to Italia ’90] Atlético tried to sign him from Valencia — coached by none other than di Stéfano. Things went a bit Pete Tong as di Stéfano warned Valencia he’d quit if they sold the boy. It became a national cause célèbre as Quique’s mother Carmen put in a two-footed, studs-up challenge — demanding to her husband’s best pal, di Stéfano, that her son should be allowed to better himself (and return to the family home in Spain’s capital). ‘That row over Atlético trying to sign me really stunned me,’ Quique revealed years later. ‘My mother got involved in the furore because I wasn’t around and she felt someone had to say something. Because she’s so famous, it had more repercussions. I felt embarrassed. Getafe coach Quique Sanchez Flores will seek to beat Real Madrid in Sunday's derby match . ‘I try to dodge the celebrity magazines which are meat and drink to the rest of my family.’ Then, when Quique won his only trophy as Madrid’s starting right-back, it was blemished with family tragedy. It was 20 years ago and Real were about to break Barcelona’s ‘Dream Team’ run of four straight championships under Johan Cruyff. Just at that theoretically sweet moment his aunt, Lola, died of cancer. Massive parts of the nation just adored her, so Spain had barely finished mourning, 15 days later, when her son Antonio (Quique’s cousin) was found dead at home from a drug and alcohol overdose. The Spanish title which Madrid and Quique lifted the following week was a sombre triumph for him. Perhaps being pitted against the biggest club of his career at this stage is too soon to expect a win. But if he really expects to coach Real in the near future, then what better way to attract their attention?","Quique Sanchez Flores takes charge of Getafe for Sunday's derby match .

"Some would brand it decline, some would argue it's just transition. It's the process taking FC Barcelona from the middle of their first season under the late Tito Vilanova (August-December 2012) when their football showed absolutely no deterioration from the Pep Guardiola era until January 4, 2015 and a humiliating defeat to David Moyes' Real Sociedad. When you are in the middle of what was often a maelstrom, either as a player, coach, director, fan or writer, it can be hard to accurately chart the causes and cures. Events? No problem. They are chronicled one after the other. Luis Enrique (right)  is changing the identity of Barcelona but the transition has been a slow process . Barcelona boss Enrique talks Pedro during the Liga BBVA defeat to Malaga at the Camp Nou . But patterns? Reasons? Solutions? It's not simple to get right. One of the symptoms of Barcelona patently going through either decline or adaptation, even reinvention if you want, has been a loss of personality. For a long time Guardiola's teams were as spiky, belligerent, dynamic and confident away from home as they were at the Nou Camp. The front three of Neymar, Messi and Suarez gives the Catalan side a different dimension . Then, suddenly, they weren't. There was a hint of it in Guardiola's final weeks when his world and European champions lost away to Getafe, Osasuna and Chelsea (in a game they should have won at least 4-1). Champions League football, often played without a safety net, long since a place where the top teams carry identical win expectations away from home, is where this loss of muscular mentality showed most. Since Barcelona were last within a millimetre of the Champions League Final — on that mad evening of April 24, 2012 (2-1 up on aggregate to 10-man Chelsea and then 2-2 but with a penalty) — until this week's tie in Manchester against City, they have suffered some painful and humiliating reverses on the road. Malaga players celebrate the victory at the end of the La Liga match which saw them shock the home side . From then until now the Catalans have lost away to Chelsea, Celtic, Milan, Bayern, Ajax, Atletico and PSG, and have drawn at Milan (twice) and PSG. Despite the fact that Tata Martino's Barcelona won 2-0 at the City of Manchester stadium at this stage last year, you could ally that really horrible drop in away form with the club's historic record of playing in England (lost 14 and drawn eight of 29 visits) and suggest that the Premier League champions need to be regarded as decent favourites on Tuesday. However, La Liga's second-placed side, who surprisingly went down 1-0 at home to Malaga on Saturday, have largely shed their chrysalis form and become butterflies. Dani Alves (centre) has been an ever present since the Pep Guardiola days but looks set to leave the club . Sergio Busquets (left) was linked with a move away but committed his future to the transtitional club . Despite the fact their worst humiliations this season have almost all come away from home — Real Madrid, Málaga, Real Sociedad in particular — Luis Enrique's side were thrilling in winning at Ajax and APOEL and it was then that confidence was sparking and Luis Suárez was beginning his process of reshaping how this team attacks. Since losing in San Sebastian in January, the Blaugrana have scored 22 away goals while winning, with brutal authority, at Atlético, Bilbao, Elche, and La Coruña. This week Lionel Messi concluded: 'From that day onwards we've changed our approach totally. We are hungrier, we go out with a different attitude, we attack better, we press better.' Lionel Messi (left) believes Barca changed their style when they beaten by David Moyes' Real Sociedad . Luis Enrique, who doesn't see football in quite the same manner as his superstar, disagreed. In fact he wasn't pleased with the idea, insisting: 'All we are seeing is the normal process of a team's evolution during a season. I continue to insist that we are doing the same things now as we were before.' But they are both right. The coach's ideas have found their maturity — daily work, which is intense, disciplined, and aimed at making the team play with less midfield filigree, has made the team tough and confident. An identity is emerging. Luis Suárez is having something of a Henrik Larsson impact. Luis Suarez is helping change Barca's identity and is forming a deadly partnership with Messi and Neymar . Having taken a little time to adapt to not being the perpetual dominant striker reference point, and to adapt to their goal flows dropping (which is also what happened when the Swede arrived in Barcelona in 2004), their football intelligence has cascaded out. Just as it's easy, but short-sighted, to point out that the Uruguayan is scoring less freely than at Liverpool, it's easy — and one-dimensional — to add that his goal-assist flow is absolutely stellar. The superb 'extra' is his movement, his awareness of fellow strikers Neymar and Messi and the fabulous way in which he'll either harass defenders into mistakes or make runs in such a way that space is created for the Brazilian and Argentinian to raise havoc. Although Suarez hasn't been as prolific for his new side, he's been the perfect foil for his striker partners . Given how dangerous, mobile and smart these three brilliant technicians are, given that the Xavi era has now gone, it has made sense for Enrique to retouch the Barcelona identity. City will face a team which, just as Martino tried to evolve them, is now happier to move up the pitch in shorter amounts of time using far fewer passes. Instead of pulling teams this way and that, the boxing equivalent of wearing them down with dozens of jabs to the torso, they now unleash flurries of quick, 'knockout' punches. Aimed at the head. According to what Manuel Pellegrini told the elegant Spanish writer Santi Segurola this week, that should make for a fine old spectacle. City's Chilean commandante promised: 'Last year our tactic was to try to 'contain' Barcelona at our stadium, to shackle them, because the away goal is almost always a crucial factor in Champions League knockout football. Manchester City no longer fear Barcelona and will take the game to them at the Camp Nou this time . 'But this year we'll 'go for the game' right from the outset — albeit with due respect to Barcelona's quality.' Pellegrini also conceded that his process of establishing a City 'identity' has faltered — in the opposite way to Barcelona's recent problems. 'We've 'lost' our season at home,' he admitted. 'Newcastle put us out of the League Cup, Middlesbrough out of the FA Cup and in the title race we've lost the seven points which Chelsea has as an advantage to Stoke, Hull City and Burnley. 'The same in Europe. We give away home advantage too often.' Champions League music to Barcelona's ears. City face a team which, at last, loves life on the road. Sergio Aguero will be the man Barcelona will need to watch when the two side meet in the Champions League .","Pep Guardiola's Barcelona has moved on as Luis Enrique continues to change the clubs identity - with the help of Luis Suarez .
