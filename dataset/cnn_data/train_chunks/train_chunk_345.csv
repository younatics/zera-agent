"Washington (CNN) -- If you met Nicole Lynn Lewis when she was in high school, you never would have thought ""statistic."" Lewis was raised by college-educated parents. She was an honor student and the president of several clubs. She sang in a gospel choir. And her sister was a graduate student at Yale. But Lewis' life was far from perfect. ""I grew up in an emotionally turbulent household,"" she said. ""What was going on at home made me feel really uneasy and really insecure about my life. So I was looking for that security and stability in a relationship."" And then, at 18, she became pregnant with her daughter. ""When people found out I was pregnant, I was treated completely differently,"" Lewis said. ""People stopped talking to me. I lost all of my friends. It didn't matter that I was an honor roll student, people pretty much wrote me off."" Lewis' mother even had doubts. ""I said, 'No matter what, in one year, I'm going to go to college.' And she looked at me and said, 'I don't think you're going to be able to do this,' "" Lewis recalled. Lewis went on to graduate with honors, earn a master's degree and do consulting work for nonprofits, all while raising her daughter. But she never forgot the uncertainty and isolation she felt in college, despite having great friends. So in 2010, Lewis made it her mission to help other teenage parents become college graduates. Her Washington-based nonprofit, Generation Hope, provides tuition assistance, mentoring and life skills training to dozens of teen mothers attending area colleges. ""It's all about supporting our scholars in the ways that they need to be in order to succeed,"" said Lewis, now 34. Fighting the stigma . For Lewis, it's about helping teen parents beat the odds. Less than 2% of teen mothers finish college by 30, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. ""It's easy to say that teens shouldn't get pregnant. But it's important to understand that a lot of the young people we work with have come from some very difficult living situations. They have absentee parents, are in abusive relationships. There are so many reasons,"" Lewis said. ""We're not just dealing with sex-crazed teenagers here."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . It's also about helping to break the cycle of poverty that runs rampant in the community. Many of the students in Lewis' program are the first in their families to go to college. By empowering the mothers, Lewis says, they become role models for their children. ""Our scholars are some of the most ambitious, determined students you will meet. They completely fly in the face of the stereotypical teen mother,"" Lewis said. ""I think that speaks to the tremendous potential that young parents have if we believe in them."" From statistic to 'Scholar' Students apply to be ""Generation Hope Scholars."" Once accepted, they are paired with a mentor who provides advice, emotional guidance and up to $2,400 in financial assistance each year. ""It's someone who genuinely cares about you and your success, and that's what makes the difference,"" Lewis said. ""We're a family, we really are."" It's that kind of commitment and sense of family Angeline Palmer found when she joined Generation Hope. ""We can talk to another scholar or a mentor or Nicole, who have gone through exactly what I've gone through and can directly relate,"" said Palmer, 23. The single mother of two is studying chemistry at George Mason University. She plans to pursue a master's or doctoral degree in chemical education. ""Generation Hope has really helped me believe in myself,"" she said. ""They prepare us to have the skills for the future, and we can pass those skills onto our kids."" Lewis and her group have also reached hundreds of high school students through college-readiness workshops, helping them realize that furthering their education is a viable option. This year, Generation Hope plans on accepting teen fathers into the program. ""I'm motivated by the potential out there that's being untapped. The future doctors, lawyers, teachers who are just in need of someone who says, 'You can do it,' "" Lewis said. ""I want to be able to help each and every one of them achieve their own success.""

"(CNN) -- As scientists from around the world gathered in San Francisco for the American Geophysical Union meeting, the success stories are pouring in. On Monday, the Mars Curiosity mission team released a new study showing that the former lake bed in which the Rover landed could once have supported microbial life. The Cassini mission to Saturn released a spectacular video of mysterious hexagonal clouds whirling over the planet's pole. But the question on everyone's mind is: Will these missions be allowed to continue? The answer may well be: No. Next year's NASA budget is poised to force premature cancellation of either Curiosity or Cassini -- the agency's flagship missions. Funding decisions get made behind closed doors, but projected figures reduce Cassini's budget in 2014 by almost half, and half again in 2015, making it impossible to fly. Even funding for analyzing data will be ""restructured,"" according to NASA. These cuts are not only devastating for scientists; they are also potentially harmful for our economy, and our leadership in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). When most people think of spacecraft, they think of hunks of metal flying or driving around, alone in the far reaches of the solar system. Some are cute and personable, like the Opportunity Rover or Voyager; some, like Cassini, are less well known. People might also recall the gorgeous photos spread across the front pages of the New York Times or on the cover of National Geographic. A few might even think of the famous scientists who have brought these pictures to life, like Carl Sagan, Steve Squyres, or Carolyn Porco. The robots' stories and adventures captivate us. But what about the people who created and operate the robots? Behind the scenes, largely invisible to the public, are many of America's best scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA centers, and research facilities who work on these missions to make space exploration possible. The budget cuts will affect America's most experienced and most promising engineers and researchers. They may have to join the legions of the unemployed. Do we really want to put someone like Bobak Ferdowksi, NASA's famous ""Mohawk Guy,"" out of a job? Some may think that space engineers can simply move to the private sector. After all, companies like Space X or Virgin Galactic are looking for talents. But private ventures involve different motives and skills. And private companies do not fund planetary science and experiments. Moreover, private and public research institutions from Cornell to Ohio State University rely partly on NASA grants to support their graduate students, post-docs, and other staff in STEM fields. In other words, NASA funding not only expands the frontiers of our knowledge, it also trains the next generation of STEM leaders in our country. The budget cuts would deprive our young scientists and engineers the resources to continue their studies and, in turn, contribute to America's innovation. Seen in perspective, the looming budget adjustment along with all the cuts in recent years sentences America's planetary exploration program to death by starvation. Cassini, for one, is already operating on a shoestring. And NASA has put plans for future missions to the outer solar system on ice, despite efforts by the planetary community to plan cost-effective and exciting opportunities. The continuous gutting of NASA and its planetary science programs should outrage all Americans. If we end the Cassini or the Curiosity mission, it would be a crisis not just for science but for America's leadership in STEM. At a time when our math and science students are getting left behind, and the public is looking to our high tech and scientific sectors to power innovation and economic growth, we should invest in our sciences and continue to inspire the next generation. Let's make sure our current best and brightest working on the cutting edge don't get the pink slip. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Janet Vertesi.","NASA budget may force premature cancellation of either Curiosity or Cassini .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- It's a regular Monday morning in one of Delhi's city slums and 14-year-old Chandni is getting ready to face the day ahead. Just as she's about to step out, a frantic voice calls out her name -- it's a friend from her local neighborhood in West Delhi. Chandni's face turns pale as her friend whispers urgently into her ear. Eventually she reaches for the nearest telephone. Her call, which turns out to be to the police, results in a raid on a wedding ceremony in the neighborhood shortly after. But this is no ordinary union because the bride is a child. Fortunately she's rescued -- a rare success story on this occasion. According to Save the Children India, an estimated 50,000 children live on the streets of India's capital and do what they can to survive, from selling their wares at busy roadsides, begging, rag-picking and even performing street acrobatics. And these children, often as young as seven or eight, face constant danger -- more than 50% have suffered verbal, physical or sexual abuse, sometimes at the hands of policemen, according to the children's rights group. Dealing with the darker aspects of Indian society is far from easy for these kids -- especially in the city's heaving slums. Pen power . So what gives one teenage girl the courage to do so? According to Chandni, it's the power of the pen. She's not just any other teen from Delhi's slums; she's a journalist. To be precise, she's a crime reporter who documents life on the streets for the neighborhood children through her articles in Balaknama, a free newspaper published every quarter in Hindi. To her friends and family, Chandni is no less than a star. Anybody and everybody who faces a problem in the area comes to her. It's a far cry from the way things were four years earlier when she worked as a domestic helper. Too poor to attend school, she was forced to scrape a living with other family members: she'd wake well before dawn, feed her younger siblings and then join her mother to clean other people's homes until late at night. It was a tough life. And then Balaknama happened. Through a friend, she heard about a group of people from a similar background who were organizing a newspaper -- but not just any newspaper. It told stories -- their stories -- of the harsh existence on Delhi's streets. Despite reservations from her mother, Chandhi saw this as a chance to break out and make a difference, to tell her story in her way. ""Now I can study and contribute to the newspaper,"" she says. ""I felt like a superstar when my photo first appeared in the newspaper with my name on it. I became popular overnight. I've never looked back."" Eventually she hopes to become a teacher and educate underprivileged children like her. Govind, also 14, has a similar story. He used to wander aimlessly on the streets of the city with his friends before he too discovered the power of the pen. He was only nine when he heard about the newspaper. Despite opposition and derision from friends and family, Govind decided to give it a chance. ""When I joined Balaknama, my friends used to make fun of me. But now when they read my articles and see me grow in my life -- they wish they too had done so,"" he said. Like Chandni, he puts the spotlight on issues that affect daily life for some of India's most impoverished and forgotten people -- from abuse to poverty and healthcare. Anniversary edition . Founded in 2003, Balaknama is an initiative of Badhte KadamÃ­, a federation of street and working children in northern India, in association with Delhi-based NGO, Childhood Enhancement through Training and Action (CHETNA). It aims to give a voice to the most underprivileged and marginalized sections of India's society. Here, young people can write about the afflictions and suffering they witness on a daily basis in a sympathetic environment. Subhash, who also spent years battling to survive on the unforgiving streets, is one of the founders. He has big plans for the paper. ""With the growing popularity of our newspaper, we want to increase its circulation and turn it into an eight-page edition from the existing four pages,"" he said. They recently published a 10th anniversary edition in color for the first time. Every contributor to the paper has a compelling story. Eleven years ago, Subhash was himself a school drop-out forced to move to Delhi to make a living on the streets. He sold magazines on busy traffic intersections, earning barely US$2-3 a day. It was at one of these intersections that one of CHETNA's activists noticed the skinny youngster hiding nervously behind another teenager selling magazines and offered him shelter and the chance to make a life. Subhash feared it could be a trap laid by human traffickers, but eventually decided to take a leap of faith and accompany this stranger. Pride and self-confidence . The newspaper idea offered Subhash a new lease of life -- his daily existence was given direction, while his pride and self-confidence was restored. He is now pursuing a Masters degree in Sociology and plans to do a PhD in the future. Sanjay Gupta, director of CHETNA, feels the newspaper experience not only gives the children a chance to talk about some of the harrowing things they've seen, it is also empowering. ""Children associated with Balaknama are much more aware about their rights than the average school-going child,"" he said. ""They're also shown how to deal with some of the emergencies that may come their way."" The kids also benefit from CHETNA-sponsored services, from access to support groups and workshops that help them deal with the issues they've experienced, to health clinics, drug rehabilitation and counseling. Back at the newspaper, the sight of Chandni and her colleagues completely absorbed in their work is inspiring, an example of how even the most forgotten members of Indian society can blossom if given the chance.","Chandni, 14, was a street child but is now reporting for a community newspaper .

"Washington (CNN) -- The 2014 midterm elections brought a historic victory for Republicans, handing the GOP its largest congressional majority since World War II. But Tuesday night also tallied an impressive list of historic firsts at the individual level. Tim Scott became the first African-American from the South elected to the Senate since Reconstruction, according to the Charleston Post and Courier. The last black Senator was Blanche Kelso Bruce, who left the chamber 133 years ago. Scott also became the first African-American to be elected to both the House and the Senate. Mia Love became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress -- ever. Love, who is a first-generation American, will also become the first Haitian-American to serve in Congress, according to the Washington Post. Joni Ernst smashed a couple of glass ceilings of her own, becoming the first woman to represent Iowa in either house of Congress and the first female combat veteran ever elected to the Senate, according to the Washington Free Beacon. Shelley Moore Capito cruised to victory in West Virginia to become the first woman elected to the Senate from her state. Tom Cotton is the first Iraq War and the first Afghanistan war veteran to be elected to the Senate. But he won't be the first Iraq War veteran to serve in the Senate: Sen. John Walsh, who led a combat battalion in Iraq, was appointed to fill Montana Sen. Max Baucus' Senate seat earlier this year but dropped his bid for a full term after a plagiarism scandal killed his campaign. The North Carolina Senate race was the most expensive Senate race ever after outside groups dropped more than $81 million on top of more than $32 million spent by the candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The number of women in Congress will reach 100 for the first time in U.S. history. Gina Raimondo will be Rhode Island's first female governor. The Democrat was elected after some high-level campaign stumping with President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary -- not all at the same time, of course. Elise Stefanik, who is 30, became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress after snagging the seat representing New York's 21st Congressional District, according to ABC News.","Buried in the midterm news were several historic firsts among newly elected legislators .

"Washington (CNN) -- If presumptive Democratic 2016 front-runner Hillary Clinton decides not to run, at least one party strategist and CNN contributor thinks the Democrats' presidential bench isn't that deep. ""No one,"" said Paul Begala, a longtime Clinton ally, when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if there were other party leaders who could lead the party in 2016. ""No one."" While Republicans have a full bench of presidential hopefuls, Begala, who worked for President Bill Clinton and was an early Hillary Clinton supporter in 2008, said Clinton is the Democrats' best and perhaps only hope to capture the White House in 2016. ""It's not fair,"" Begala said. ""There are impressive people who I think could be good presidents, but they don't have I think the electoral prospects that Hillary does."" Vice President Joe Biden has said he'll consider a run for the presidency after sitting in the No. 2 spot for six years, and parts of the party's progressive wing is clamoring for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run. CNN political commentator Van Jones, who served in the Obama administration, said Clinton hasn't yet proven that she can excite the Democratic base. ""We have to have a nominee that can excite our base and I don't know if Hillary Clinton can do that,"" Jones said. ""I know one person can, it's Elizabeth Warren."" While Clinton was a favorite surrogate for Democrats running in the midterms, Warren also took her high-energy persona and populist message on the campaign trail. Warren has said earlier this year that she ""hopes"" Clinton will seek the presidency and she was reportedly one of all sitting Democratic female Senators who signed a letter last year urging Clinton to run. Amid the speculation, Clinton has sought to make nice, praising Warren on the stump in Massachusetts as ""a passionate champion for working people and middle class families."" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick have also been floated as potential contenders. But their prospects might have dimmed after the Democratic candidates to succeed them in both states lost their bids in blue state upsets.","Paul Begala is a Democratic strategist who worked for Bill Clinton during his administration .

"(CNN) -- Israeli police have stepped up their search for a New Jersey man who went missing while hiking in a forest outside Jerusalem. Aaron Sofer was reported missing on Friday by a friend who he was hiking with in the Jerusalem Forest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN. Sofer, 23, from Lakewood, New Jersey, is a Yeshiva student studying in Israel. ""We are looking in a number of directions,"" Rosenfeld said. ""It is not clear if the disappearance was personal [or a] kidnapping. It's not clear at all."" Police are searching the forest and have questioned a friend of Sofer's who was ""the last man who saw him face-to-face, eye-to-eye,"" Rosenfeld said. The friend ""lost contact"" with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to the police, Rosenfeld said. Sofer's parents arrived in Israel on Monday. His brother, Joel Sofer, told CNN on Tuesday that family members are ""just praying hard and doing everything we could do."" He said he had visited the area where his brother went missing. ""I actually was over there today on site,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And you know, there's nothing. They have no evidence. They can't find anything."" Binyomin Isseeman, Sofer's rabbi in Lakewood, called the missing man a ""very normal, a very healthy boy."" ""His mind is clear, no problems at all,"" Isseeman said to CNN affiliate WCBS reported. Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said the U.S. Department of State was helping Israeli authorities in the search for Sofer. ""There are concerns, as we all know, about the possibility of abduction,"" Smith said, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. Sofer's disappearance comes two months after what Israeli authorities have called the revenge killing of Palestinian teen Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16. His body was found in the Jerusalem Forest on July 2, just miles from where Sofer went missing. Two minors and an adult were indicted in the killing. Prosecutors allege the killing was retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank in June. One of the Israeli youths also had American citizenship. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","NEW: The missing man's brother says the family are ""praying hard""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Navy SEAL who says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden says he is worried the Pentagon might prosecute him for publicly telling his story of the May 2011 raid on the al Qaeda leader's compound in Pakistan. But Robert O'Neill said the value of sharing the details of the mission for the families of the September 11, 2001, victims and military veterans killed in the ensuing wars makes that risk worthwhile. ""I think I did this in a way that doesn't violate any tactics or any rules,"" he said in an interview on CNN's ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper. Being prosecuted, he said, ""does concern me, and if it comes up, I'll address it."" In his most extensive live television interview to date, O'Neill said he realized the power of his story while speaking with a group that included about 20 families of victims of the September 11 attacks. He said it was the first time he'd really spoken about the mission, and that men and women cried and told him ""it was closure for them."" At that moment, he said, he realized the importance of sharing what he could -- and that he needed to find a way to do so ""with respect for the tactics, for the safety of our troops and for the Department of Defense."" Responding to criticisms from former administration officials and current servicemembers that he shouldn't be talking publicly, O'Neill said, ""I think it's important historically for this to get out there."" ""We were the end of a long, long time of grieving,"" he said. ""We were everybody on that mission. You know, we were the Port Authority, the police department, the NYPD, the FDNY, we were the American people, the 9/11 families, and we were able to go there -- and just that I was able to be a part of that is just the greatest honor that's ever been asked of me."" O'Neill described many of the details of the mission -- and his preparation beforehand. SEAL who says he shot bin Laden details leadup to raid . He said he believed there was ""about a 90 percent chance that we weren't going to come back."" Among the possible threats: Pakistan's military, unaware of the mission, could shoot the two helicopters down. Bin Laden's house could be wired with explosives. Others in the house could be wearing suicide vests. ""The house getting blown up, possibly getting shot down, suicide bombers, and then possibly running out of gas was a concern,"" he said. ""The chances of us not coming back were a lot greater than the chances we were coming back."" He said he called his family members beforehand -- not offering details on what he was doing, but knowing that they'd soon find out no matter how the mission ended. He also wrote letters to his young children, only to be delivered if he didn't survive at a later date when, for instance, he wasn't there for their weddings. After the mission started, O'Neill described landing outside bin Laden's compound on the second of two helicopters, after the first one had crash-landed. He said he was the eighth SEAL in line as they moved from the compound's first floor to its second. On that floor, six ahead of him split off to take out bin Laden's son, clear other rooms and identify potential threats. He was now second in line headed to the third floor, where they expected to find bin Laden. Opinion: Did Robert O'Neill really kill bin Laden? As the group reached the third floor, he said, the SEAL in front of him dove on top of an ""unknown"" person -- it turned out to be a woman -- to absorb what they feared could be a blast from a suicide vest. He said he thought ""let's get this over with"" as he entered the room expecting to be blown up by bin Laden. That's when O'Neill identified the al Qaeda mastermind. ""I shot him twice in the head, he fell on the floor,"" he said. ""I shot him one more time, and I killed him."" The magnitude of what he'd done didn't register immediately. O'Neill first worried about eliminating other potential threats -- moving a woman and child out of the way, and then clearing the room. ""It wasn't until the room was cleared and there were more SEALs in the room that it kind of hit me. I had a moment of pause,"" he said. A friend put his hand on O'Neill's shoulder. ""I said, 'Hey, what do we do now?'"" O'Neill said. ""He said, 'Now we go find the computers.' I said, 'OK, I'm back.'"" The 90-minute flight back to the U.S. air base in Afghanistan was stressful, too, as the SEALs counted down the time until they exited Pakistan's airspace. Then, they could exhale. One SEAL laid next to bin Laden's body to measure his height -- part of confirming his identity. The group hadn't brought a tape measure. Later, O'Neill sat feet from bin Laden's body, eating a breakfast sandwich and watching a flat-screen television, while watching President Barack Obama announce to the world that the United States had killed bin Laden. ""I think,"" he told CNN, ""I was part of a team full of heroes."" SEAL commander to SEALs: Seal it .","Ex-Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill says he fired shots that killed Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- The early winter storm that socked much of the United States with cold weather last week is expected to make an encore performance. The mercury will plummet on Monday and Tuesday in the Northeast and Southeast, the CNN weather team reported Saturday. In Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama; and Memphis, Tennessee, the highs may not even reach 40 degrees on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Many areas in the Southeast could experience highs 25-30 degrees below normal. New York City and Washington, D.C. will see highs in the mid-30s on Tuesday, the National Weather Service predicted. The Plains and Midwest should get ready for another big dose of cold, very much like the early winter storm that struck last week, CNN meteorologists said. Some places in the Plains, Midwest and Great Lakes could see 4-6 inches of snow, the meteorologists said. The western side of Michigan could get up to 8 inches. While not the snow maker of this past week, the storm could drop 1-3 inches on bigger cities such as Kansas City, St. Louis and Minneapolis. Minneapolis is expected to remain below freezing until at least late next week. Chicago will have highs in the mid-20s on Tuesday, the weather service said. Don't worry about Miami. While the rest of the nation shivers, temps in that city will drop to 73 degrees on Wednesday. The weather should head back to normal by next weekend for the South, Southeast and Rockies.","Winter will reassert itself early next week, CNN meteorologists say .

"(CNN)  -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has apologized for his remarks about gay fans attending the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Blatter was heavily criticized for saying they should ""refrain from sexual activity"" if they go to Qatar because homosexuality is illegal in the emirate. ""It was not my intention and never will be my intention to go into any discrimination,"" he told a press conference in Abu Dhabi Friday. ""If somebody feels hurt, then I regret and present apologies,"" added Blatter. The original remarks were made Monday in Johannesburg and the 74-year-old was quick to add that ""in football we have no boundaries. Blatter went on: ""We open everything to everybody and I think there shall not be any discrimination to any human beings."" But despite the qualification, his comments provoked fury among gay rights groups. Former NBA basketball star John Amaechi -- himself gay -- told APF that the  FIFA president was quilty of ""epic, archaic, neanderthal, ignorance."" Blatter, in Abu Dhabi for FIFA's Club World Cup, also gave his support to the notion of the 2022 World Cup being played in January rather than the traditional mid-summer slot. The move, to avoid the blistering 50 degrees centigrade heat in Qatar in June and July, was first suggested by Germany's FIFA executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer and is gathering momentum. ""I definitely support (the idea) to play in winter here,"" Blatter said. ""It is important to play when the climate is appropriate and I'm thinking about the footballers, not only the fans but the actors."" Organizers in Qatar have said they will provide air-conditioned stadiums and training grounds to combat the stifling heat. They have not made an official request to switch dates which would bring clashes with major club leagues in Europe such as the English Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Serie A in Italy.","Sepp Blatter apologizes for remarks about gay fans attending 2022 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- It's arguably the toughest job in sports. Hockey enforcers earn the undying devotion of fans -- but not much else -- for their ability to punch and get punched on skates. They usually bounce from team to team, barely managing to get a contract for a role few can perform well and no one else wants. ""I did it because it was my job but I hated it,"" said Georges Laraque, one of the most successful hockey heavyweights in his 12-year NHL career. ""I hated to fight. I hated the pressure. I hated to be called a goon, and an animal. I hated promoting violence."" Laraque spoke to the Cybulski & Company radio program in Canada after the news Wednesday that another former enforcer, Wade Belak, was found dead in his Toronto apartment at age 35. Authorities described the death as nonsuspicious. It was the third death of a current or former National Hockey League enforcer this summer, an almost unfathomable statistical anomaly. There are 30 NHL teams, and not all of them employ a so-called ""hired gun"" these days, both to intimidate opposing players and keep them honest. Derek Boogaard was found dead at age 28 in his Minneapolis home in May, the result of a toxic combination of painkillers and alcohol ruled an accident. Boogaard, one of the most feared NHL fighters at 6-foot-7 and 265 pounds -- he was known as the Boogeyman, hadn't played in months while trying to recover from concussions sustained in on-ice bouts. In August, 27-year-old Rick Rypien was found dead in his home in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta, Canada. No official cause has been announced, but Rypien had a history of depression and was on personal leave from the Vancouver Canucks for much of last season. He signed a contract with the Winnipeg Jets for the coming season. SI.com: Full coverage of the NHL . Belak's death this week stunned former teammates, who described him as a happy-go-lucky man always cracking jokes, even at his own expense. At 6-foot-5 and well over 200 pounds, Belak developed into a feared heavyweight over a 14-year career with five teams. He retired from the league last season and was trying to start a broadcasting career. He was chosen to participate in the coming season of ""Battle of the Blades,"" a Canadian version of ""Dancing With the Stars"" on skates. While few answers regarding Belak's death have emerged so far, Laraque provided some insight in describing the life of the hockey enforcer. The worst part is not the fighting itself, he said, because the adrenaline kicks in and you don't feel the blows. Instead, what weighs heaviest is the constant pressure of knowing you will have to fight another enforcer such as Boogaard or Belak, game after game, according to Laraque. ""It's the night before, the day of the game, before it starts,"" he said. ""It's the shivers that it gives you, the worry in the head and the brain. It's when you go to a movie and you can't watch it because you're thinking the next game about having to fight Derek Boogaard or someone like that. Or you don't feel well, but something happens and you have to go out there. ... It's that pressure that's nonstop that you live with."" For that reason, he said, enforcers past and present have ""demons"" they live with, and often turn to alcohol to deal with them. In addition, enforcers don't earn the multimillion-dollar salaries of top scorers, defensemen or goalies, Laraque noted. ""For as many years that they played, many of those guys didn't make much money, so there are not options for them afterwards,"" Laraque said. ""You have to fight to live when life after hockey is over, and there's nothing for you."" To Daniel Alfredsson, the longtime captain of the Ottawa Senators, ""it's an adjustment from the high-profile life you live to go back to everyday (life), I guess."" Such a spate of deaths among former enforcers, however, raises questions about whether such players are particularly vulnerable to the pressures of life -- either the physical grind of concussions and punches to the head, or the mental strain described by Laraque. When former NHL enforcer Bob Probert died suddenly last year at age 45, researchers discovered he had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease. Probert, a legendary tough guy who had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, died of heart failure while on a family boat outing. A joint NHL/NHL Player's Association behavioral program exists to help players dealing with personal problems, including substance abuse and other issues. After Rypien's death last month, described by Canadian police as a ""nonsuspicious sudden death,"" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he expected the program to be reviewed. ""My guess is we'll talk at the appropriate time with the players' association, making sure that we're comfortable with all of the mechanisms and programs we have in place, which are extensive,"" Bettman told The Canadian Press then. ""I don't think any sports league does more than we do, but maybe there's more, as we focus on it, that we need to focus on. I know it's always hard for people to accept, but sports is a microcosm of society in general. And life isn't always easy."" Especially for hockey enforcers. Despite his hatred for the brawling in his career, Laraque said he would always support allowing fighting in hockey. Hockey is the only team sport that allows two players to fight without getting ejected for the rest of the game, and Laraque said that element allows players to police themselves and prevent more violent stick fouls and other mayhem. ""Guys like me, if there's no fighting, we won't be making a living,"" he said. ""As tough and as hard as it is, I'll always be defending that job."" Removing fighting from the game means denying opportunity for kids who dream of an NHL career, just as he did. To realize his dream, he became an enforcer, explaining: ""I did that because I knew that's what I had to do.""","Wade Belak, who retired this year, is found dead at age 35 .

"(CNN) -- The Arkansas attorney general is opening an investigation into what caused last week's pipeline rupture that allowed thousands of barrels of heavy crude oil to flow into a residential area. Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said Tuesday he asked Exxon Mobil, the owner of the 60-year-old Pegasus pipeline, to preserve all documents and information related to the spill and cleanup efforts. ""This incident has damaged private property and Arkansas's natural resources. Homeowners have been forced from their homes as a result of this spill,"" McDaniel said in a news release Tuesday. ""Requesting that Exxon secure these documents and data is the first step in determining what happened and preserving evidence for any future litigation."" Pipeline brings crude reality to Arkansas . About two dozen homes in Mayflower, in central Arkansas, were evacuated Friday as the crude oil, which originated in Canada and was bound for Gulf Coast refineries, crawled through yards and down streets spilled from a 2- or 3-inch gash in the underground Pegasus pipeline, officials have said. The evacuation could last for several more days as crews work to clean the spill. Mayflower resident Amber Bartlett, who left her home after the spill, told CNN on Tuesday that a cul de sac in her neighborhood last week was ""just covered ... nothing but oil."" ""It looked like a river flowing down the road,"" she said. Bartlett said her yard wasn't affected as badly as others -- ""a little bit of oil got just in the very front of the front yard,"" she said. But the smell is ""very intense."" ""I went back in for a few minutes to get some things yesterday, and (the smell) ... was more intense than it was on Saturday,"" Bartlett said Tuesday. Asked if she had been worried that the underground pipeline could leak, Bartlett said she hadn't even known it was a possibility. ""I can't say that I was concerned, because I do not recall being told that it was there,"" she said. Keystone pipeline fight explodes (behind the scenes) The Pegasus pipeline carries Canadian crude from Illinois to Texas, a state transportation engineer said. Exxon Mobil met with displaced residents over the weekend to explain how they can make claims for losses. ""If you have been harmed by this spill then we're going to look at how to make that right,"" Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing told them. Resident Darren Hale complained to CNN affiliate KHTV on Saturday that being forced to leave his home was frustrating. ""I've heard three contradictory answers as to when I will be able to go back home,"" Hale said. He was first told it would be two days, but later that it would be up to two weeks, he said. An around-the-clock cleanup operation began Saturday, with workers scrubbing streets and driveways in the Northwood subdivision, CNN affiliate KATV reported. None of the estimated 12,000 barrels of oil that spilled has made it to nearby Lake Conway, a local drinking water source, Faulkner County Judge Allen Dodson told KATV Sunday said. Bartlett told CNN on Tuesday that Exxon ""has been great in aiding the residents in information."" She and other residents still are in shock, she said. ""I think there are probably some homes that will not be livable, which that makes the rest of us in the neighborhood wonder about the value of our homes,"" she said. The Pegasus pipeline, which could carry up to 90,000 barrels of crude each day, was built more than 60 years ago, an Exxon Mobil spokesman said. Leaks are not uncommon, but the company's recent inspections showed no red flags for this section, he told CNN affiliate KARK.

"(CNN) -- Police in New York City are looking for a suspect they say pushed a man to his death from the subway platform into the path of the D train on Sunday. Police have little to go on. Lt. John Grimpel says a male suspect was wearing a dark jacket. The act is ""believed to be random,"" he said. Bronx resident Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was killed by the incoming subway train, police said. Kwok's wife was with him and was taken to the hospital for trauma, police said, though she was not physically injured. Kwok was standing on the platform at the subway station at 167th Street and Grand Concourse, when he was apparently pushed. First responders arrived at about 8:45 a.m., and Kwok was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect then fled the station but has not been identified or located, police said. The incident is being investigated as a homicide, but a motive was lacking at the outset. Police would not speculate whether there was an altercation between Kwok and the suspect or whether there are any indications of a hate crime. Sunday evening, police released surveillance video of a person wanted for questioning in connection with the homicide but did not call the person a suspect.","A man dies after being pushed onto the subway tracks at a Bronx station, police say .

"(CNN) -- In preparation for co-hosting next summer's Euro 2012 football championship, Poland has been transforming itself. With help from EU funding, new airports, roads and impressive stadia are all set to be completed well in time before the first match kicks off in Warsaw on June 8. From the infrastructure to the event itself, organizers are now focusing on the matches that will be played in four of Poland's cities. ""Now we are looking at organizational issues and the most important in that is safety. Poland is not more dangerous than other European countries, ""said Adam Giersz, Poland's Minister for Sport and Tourism. Great strides have been made in eradicating violence and hooliganism from football matches across Europe, but it remains a concern and on-going problem in many countries, including Poland. The Polish Cup final in May between Legia Warsaw and Lech Poznan was marred by violent scenes and UEFA, European football's governing body, warned the Polish Football Association after hooliganism during the country's international match against Lithuania in March. However new laws on assembly and who can enter stadia were passed earlier this year and led to numerous arrests. ""They are already frightened because they were already arrested,"" said Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Warsaw's mayor. ""They were punished, some of the leaders were already punished by the courts and so I think (Euro 2012) will be ok."" Poland has looked to the UK for examples of how to improve safety around football matches. ""Our new safety law is based on the British system,"" said Giersz referring to the way English football clubs and UK government enacted numerous measures to remove a violent minority from attending football matches. ""The main points are to get rid of anonymity. Everyone at the stadium must be recognized by name and surname."" It is hoped that the face-recognition technology being trialed that can identify banned hooligans will be ready in time for the competition and augment other security measures, such security cameras and restricting access around stadia to ticket-holders. The country will be under the spotlight in June, but many believe the planning and measures taken by Poland's government and the event's organizers will leave a positive legacy. ""I think new the stadiums in themselves will create more interest in football,"" said Krzysztof Dowhan, coach of Legia Warsaw. ""Fans will be able to enjoy the sport in more comfortable surroundings. Also I think more players from abroad will come to play in Poland which will in turn raise the standard of our game.""

"(CNN) -- The author William Doyle caused a stir last week with reports about his finding of White House Situation Room recordings of President Ronald Reagan making telephone calls to foreign leaders. The President made these recordings, according to Doyle, to make sure the historical record was accurate. The conversations are fascinating to hear. In one, Reagan is desperate to apologize to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for not having informed her about the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983. ""I'm sorry for any embarrassment we caused you,"" Reagan says. He explains to her that it was nothing personal, but rather a result of his own frustration with the inability to keep secrets in the U.S. political system. In another tape, we can hear President Reagan trying to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to wait on pulling out his military forces from Lebanon until Lebanese troops can be brought in. In a third tape, we hear Syrian President Hafez al-Assad angrily waiting for Reagan, who keeps him on hold as he is finishing a horseback ride. The translator simply tells al-Assad that the President is on the ""farm."" The recordings have caught most people by surprise. Until now most experts thought the last private presidential audio we would hear was of President Richard Nixon, whose infamous recordings became part of the Watergate scandal that resulted in his resignation in 1974. The White House tape recordings of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Nixon have offered some of the most riveting and revealing looks that we have into the private world of American politics, where negotiations, confrontations and deliberation have been conducted in closed rooms, outside the public purview. The tapes provided an unequaled glimpse into the workings of American political power. One of the great tragedies of Watergate for historians and for the public was that because the tapes became part of the evidence that brought down Nixon, presidents were thought to have stopped compiling such historical treasure. Six presidents secretly recorded meetings and telephone conversations between 1940 and 1973. They all had different systems. Different presidents used the recording system in different ways, but the result was a close record of these kinds of conversations. The tapes have provided an eye-opening treasure trove for historians (I recently used the Lyndon Johnson tapes as the heart of a forthcoming book on the Great Society). For John F. Kennedy we have been able to hear incredible conversations at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when President Kennedy and his advisers wrestled with what to do about the Soviet buildup in Cuba. We hear Kennedy pushing back against hawkish officials who were determined to use force as a solution to the problem. After the President outlined the challenges the United States faced, Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay said ""You're in a pretty bad fix, Mr. President."" The tapes record the President responding, ""You're in there with me."" We can also hear that the decision-making process was much more tumultuous and dynamic than earlier analysts led us to believe. The Lyndon Johnson tapes cover everything from civil rights to Vietnam to sex scandals. Among them are conversations between Johnson and Richard Russell of Georgia, the most powerful Democrat in the Senate, about the dangers of involvement in Vietnam and questioning whether the war was necessary—in 1964 and 1965. During one conversation, Russell, who was a Cold War hawk, admits the war ""scares the life out of me. ... We just got into the thing and there's no way out and we're just getting pushed forward and forward and forward."" We can hear Johnson firsthand as he becomes increasingly frustrated with the urban riots in 1967 and understands how they will undermine his political coalition. Richard Nixon's tapes can be shocking, far beyond the expletives. Through these tapes we can hear a truly Machiavellian politician constantly plotting ways to undercut his Democratic opponents and often thinking of policy in the crassest political terms. One tape provided the shocking revelation that Nixon extended the war in Vietnam until after the 1972 election for political gain. Frustrated with the negotiations over a peace in Vietnam, Nixon tells Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on April 6, 1971, that he is willing to unleash brutal military force if necessary. ""Well, things better start to happen or—you know, I'm—you probably don't believe me, but I can perfectly turn, I'm capable of turning right awful hard. I never have in my life. But if I found that there's no other way—in other words, hell, if you think Cambodia had flower children fighting, we'll bomb the goddamn North like it's never been bombed ... we'll bomb those bastards, and then let the American people—let this country go up in flames."" Unfortunately, White House taping became politically toxic after Watergate. Once special assistant Alexander Butterfield revealed the taping system to the Senate Watergate Committee on July 16, 1973, from what we know, everything went dark. No longer would presidents record their conversations. No longer would they allow tape recorders into the hidden rooms of the White House. As scandal politics made every conversation even more dangerous, with congressional investigators, independent prosecutors and reporters looking at everything possible as ammunition in the scorched earth game of politics, from what we know, less and less of anything was recorded. Even emails became toxic after National Security officials desperately erased electronic correspondence in November 1986 as part of the Iran Contra cover up. There have been frequent reports that presidents since Clinton have been discouraging people in the White House from recording anything for fear that it would be subpoenaed. The Reagan tapes offer a glimmer of hope that the situation was not so bleak. In the spring there were also reports about the possibility of tapes from the Clinton era. Perhaps somewhere in the National Archives and presidential libraries there are more recordings than we know of. Given that the presidents we know about had different kinds of recordings—from the Oval Office telephone conversations of LBJ to the more limited White House Situation Room tapes of Reagan—it is possible that there is more data than we know about, even with George W. Bush and President Obama. Nor do we know what kind of tapes exist as a result of our new era of intense surveillance. Perhaps the NSA, for instance, has been amassing more of a presidential archive than we know. Let's hope that the Reagan release creates some pressure on presidents to think again about the costs of going dark. While the appeal of not recording anything is obvious in this age of bitter polarized warfare, the long-term costs are immense as they greatly diminish the ability of historians to understand what took place in Washington and to provide Americans with the most accurate understanding of our political past. Indeed, this kind of documentation becomes all that more important as so much of our media coverage of politics is tainted by a partisan lens. In the end, the most important part of the ""legacy"" of a president has less to do with their approval ratings or the ongoing polls that people conduct, ranking them like top 10 music, but rather with the continual conversation that writers will have as they keep digging into the archival record and putting together a more accurate history of the period. Without recordings in a political world that often revolves around private conversation, we are always limited in what we can understand. Hopefully the release of the Reagan tapes might provide some impetus to make sure the White House encourages its staff to make the best record possible of their time in Washington.","President Reagan recorded sensitive conversations with foreign leaders .

"(CNN) -- What do you do when your baby lies limp in your arms, staring blankly into the distance while never crying? What do you do when tests show signs of liver damage and your baby's seizures won't stop, but doctors can't tell you what's wrong or how to fix it? Thanks to the Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003, identifying new genetic mutations has gotten easier and cheaper. But geneticists often struggle to find patients who share these rare DNA quirks. Studying multiple patients with the same gene mutations and similar symptoms is crucial to identifying a new genetic disorder. That's why a paper published Thursday in the journal Genetics in Medicine is so remarkable. The paper identifies NGLY1 deficiency as an inherited genetic disorder, caused by mutations in the NGLY1 gene. The researchers have confirmed eight patients with these mutations who share several symptoms, including developmental delays, abnormal tear production and liver disease. And they credit an ""Internet blog"" with bringing the patients and scientists together. Grace's genome . Grace Wilsey's parents knew something was wrong right away. Their newborn daughter was lethargic. Her eyes seemed hollow and unfocused. She refused to eat. Doctors at the hospital ran multiple tests, but couldn't come up with a diagnosis. Eventually, the Wilseys took Grace home. As she grew older, Grace continued to exhibit troubling symptoms. Her cognitive and motor development were far behind other children her age. She had hypotonia, a condition that made her constantly limp like a rag doll. Tests revealed she had high levels of AST and ALT liver enzymes, a sign of liver damage, but no one could figure out why. The Wilseys traveled the country with their baby girl to find an answer. They visited Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Institutes of Health on the East Coast, and several children's hospitals on the West. ""We've probably seen over 100 doctors,"" Matt Wilsey said. ""We've seen the best clinical minds in the United States."" Not one of whom knew what was wrong with Grace. When Grace was 2 years old, the Wilseys started doing whole genome sequencing at Stanford University near their home in the San Francisco Bay area and at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. It was at Baylor that they first met Matthew Bainbridge, who was working on his doctorate in structural and computational biology and molecular biophysics in Baylor's Human Genome Sequencing Center. 'One was very bad, and one was pretty bad' The first thing geneticists look for when searching for the cause of mysterious symptoms is known DNA mutations, Bainbridge said. ""Your first instinct shouldn't be 'I'm going to find something new. (It should be) 'I'm going to find something someone has already discovered.'"" Once he's crossed known disorders off the list, he looks for unusual mutations. All of us have mutations in our DNA that don't affect us in any noticeable way; if you sequence 500 healthy people's genomes, the same mutated genes would likely come up time and again. But unusual mutations -- like those Bainbridge spotted in Grace's NGLY1 gene -- are a sign that a particular gene may be causing a problem. Think of your DNA as a recipe, Bainbridge said. Some gene mutations are like little typos in that recipe. Maybe your body adds a bit too much flour or an extra teaspoon of sugar. Other gene mutations are more destructive; they make your body leave out an entire ingredient, or delete half the recipe. Grace's mutations of the NGLY1 gene were the destructive kind. ""One was very bad, and one was pretty bad,"" Bainbridge said. The scientist knew he was onto something. He began searching online for any references to the NGLY1 gene. Some work had been done in fruit flies and mice, showing the gene's mutations could cause the lab animals to function improperly. Then he came across a paper published in the Journal of Medical Genetics that mentioned a young boy who had a genetic disorder that may be related to NGLY1 mutations. Bainbridge dug deeper and found a blog written by a man named Matthew Might, an assistant professor at the University of Utah. ""My son Bertrand has a new genetic disorder,"" Might had written on May 29, 2012. ""Patient 0."" Scientists at Duke University had used whole-exome sequencing to discover Bertrand had two different mutations on the NGLY1 gene, which encodes the enzyme N-glycanase 1. N-glycanase 1 is typically found in a healthy person's cells. It helps break down defective proteins so they can be reused throughout the body. ""My son is the only human being known to lack this enzyme,"" Might wrote. Bainbridge read Might's previous posts about Bertrand's symptoms. They were similar to what Grace's parents had described. But the key seemed to be Bertrand's inability to cry. Could Grace produce tears? Bainbridge asked Kristen Wilsey via e-mail on February 26, 2013. Not really, came Kristen's reply. She'd seen a large tear once or twice; Grace's eyes would become moist, but multiple tears rarely fell. It was one of those moments as a scientist, Bainbridge says, where everything falls into place. You know, the one where you would run down the street yelling ""Eureka!"" if that was something people actually said. ""You start shaking a little bit. You force yourself not to tell anyone for 24 hours,"" Bainbridge said. ""Then you make a Powerpoint presentation and see if you can convince other people."" Finding others like 'Patient 0' When the scientists at Duke University first identified the mutations in Bertrand Might's NGLY1 gene, they didn't know for sure that the mutations were causing the 4-year-old boy's symptoms. With only one patient, they had nothing to compare it to. Still, ""it was a huge relief,"" Might told CNN in an e-mail. ""It meant that we'd reached the end of a long and painful diagnostic odyssey... Being the only patient in the world was shocking, but we knew there must have been other NGLY1 patients out there that were undiagnosed, just like Bertrand."" Bainbridge e-mailed Might through his blog, and the Wilseys put the geneticist and others on Team Grace in contact with the scientists working on Bertrand's case. Others discovered Might's blog, as well. Clinicians and genetic researchers around the globe who had sequenced the genomes of six isolated patients and found mutations in the NGLY1 gene did the same thing Bainbridge had. They searched for ""NGLY1"" online and found hope. ""I think cognitively it's really nice to have a label,"" Kristen Wilsey said. ""Once you do have a name, you can then start looking for a cure."" Matt Wilsey teamed up with Matthew Might to write an editorial accompanying the Genetics in Medicine journal paper. In the editorial, the two fathers propose a new model for genetic researchers. Their model uses a Silicon Valley approach of sharing successes and failures, and asks scientists not to underestimate the power of social media or a parent's need for answers. ""In order to diagnose patients, we must admit the limitations of our medical knowledge,"" they write. ""Sometimes the best ideas come from individuals 'outside the box' (i.e. patients and parents)... Sometimes the least likely gene candidate is the answer."" Thanks to the ""relentless digging"" of the families, five treatment approaches are being studied, the fathers say. And the list of confirmed patients with NGLY1 deficiency is up to 14, according to Wilsey. ""This represents a complete change in the way we're going about clinical medicine,"" said Gregory Enns, co-lead author of the paper and a geneticist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford. ""This is happening so quickly because... so many people are coming at this from so many angles.""","A new genetic disorder called NGLY1 deficiency is identified in eight patients .

"New York (CNN) -- Vandals defaced a statue of Jackie Robinson outside the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball stadium, marking racial slurs and symbols on it, park and police officials said Wednesday. A swastika, ""anti-Semitic comments"" and the N-word were written in black marker on the statue and its base sometime between the end of the Cyclones game Tuesday night and 7 a.m. Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the New York City Police Department. The NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the matter as a possible bias incident. The Cyclones and police are reviewing security camera video, hoping it will lead them to a suspect or suspects, said Brooklyn Cyclones director of communications Billy Harner. No arrests have been made. The parks department has already managed to remove the majority of the graffiti, Harner said. The statue is a likeness of Robinson and teammate Pee Wee Reese. ""Almost every Saturday morning I stop by the statue on my bike, and am deeply moved each time,"" U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""Defacing the Jackie Robinson statue is a dagger in the heart to everything America stands for, and I hope those who are responsible are caught, punished, and taught why what they did is so disgusting and offensive.""

"(CNN) -- When most people look at ISIS, they see the incarnation of evil. Among its many horrific acts, the Islamic militant group beheaded American journalist James Foley and posted the video this week in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. The Pope typically protests violence, but he implied that he supports the use of military force to combat ISIS. Even al Qaeda says ISIS is too violent. Across the political spectrum, public officials and pundits have characterized them as ""savages,"" a ""cancer"" and the ""face of evil."" Is ISIS evil? The problem with that question is that the answer is as easy as it is useless. Yes, ISIS is evil and must be stopped. Saying so over and over again could very well make it harder to stop them. There is only one good reason to denounce a group as evil -- because you plan to injure them, and calling them evil makes it psychologically easier to do so. ""Evil"" is the most powerful word we have to prepare ourselves to kill other people comfortably. The flip side is that ""evil"" is also a word that stops us from thinking. There is no point in trying to understand evil because it is, in the most typical phrasing, ""inhuman,"" ""senseless"" or ""beyond comprehension."" It is a fool's quest to analyze the local realities and strategic imperatives of unthinking savages. There is something almost offensive about trying to understand such evil. National Review's Jonah Goldberg tried to shame those who are trying to think seriously about ISIS. In a recent tweet, he mocked the attempt to understand ISIS in its social and political context, suggesting that we should focus instead on one fact: ""They're evil. They do obviously evil things for evil ends."" The fact is, there are few things more dangerous now than allowing ourselves to think that way. To resist ISIS and, perhaps more importantly, the larger social forces it represents, the U.S. will need more than a collective psychological readiness to injure, and more than bombs. The Wall Street Journal editorialized that this evil ideology will only be stopped when ""enough of its fanatics have been killed."" But if we've learned anything as a nation since our ""shock and awe"" campaign in Iraq, it is this: While invasions and bombing can be effective in the short term, they are not durable solutions to terror-based violence. Even if U.S. military force could effectively destroy ISIS, there will be similar groups waiting in the wings. If we are to have any hope of preventing the spread of extremist ideologies, we must do more than bomb the believers. We must understand them. We must be willing to continue thinking. How is ISIS able to achieve the support it needs? What drives people into its ranks? What social pressures and needs, what political and regional vacuums, make it possible for a group like this to thrive? We can choose to answer these questions in two ways. We can say they are evil people doing evil things for evil ends. Or we can do the hard work of understanding the context that made them, so that we can create a context that unmakes them. We can analyze the ways its violent tactics are effective for its purposes given the local power dynamics, so that we can also better understand its weak spots. And we can ask how it is that normal men -- men who were not born evil -- get turned into monsters, so that we can work to change the structures that produce terrorists over the long term instead of locking ourselves into an endlessly repeated, short-term policy of ""killing fanatics"" until they are gone. Trying to understand something isn't the same as trying to justify or excuse it. That's a basic mistake, and a costly one. As Jane Harman, president of the Woodrow International Center for Scholars, recently wrote: ""We can't counter radical narratives if we don't understand the motives of the radicalized."" Nonetheless, trying to understand evil is an offense. It is an offense to everything we hold dear, because understanding -- that is, true and effective understanding -- must bring us close to the other, must help us see the world through their eyes. That is a painful, offensive process, and that is exactly what we must do.","James Dawes: Evil is the strongest word we have to prepare ourselves to kill others .

"London (CNN) -- In the broader frame, Vladimir Putin's decision to stand again as Russian president is no big surprise. Batman returns, though the idea of Robin (Dmitri Medvedev) becoming prime minister may not work out for long. Sure, the timing was unexpected. There were good reasons for making the decision later -- last time around Medvedev was revealed as Putin's choice for president only after the parliamentary (Duma) elections in December 2007. Medvedev now becomes an early lame duck -- the Kremlin has not dealt with that problem simply by saying he will be prime minister under Putin. By making the announcement before the Duma elections, Putin has guaranteed a majority for his new '""Popular Front"" -- but that will also create problems. Russian voters quickly cottoned on to the fact that the old United Russia party was just a roadblock: it could stop opponents winning elections, but had no role in government or in the generation of policy or strategic thinking. The corporatist behemoth Popular Front will be even worse. Russia has a ""managed democracy,"" but the campaign for the presidential elections next March will now be even longer, and in a long campaign not everything can be easily managed. Comment: Putin and Medvedev, trading places . There are other obvious downsides, even once the timing issue is out of the way. Western leaders who invested time and political capital in engaging Medvedev will be asking loudly what the interregnum was all about. The idea of a Kremlin-approved but reformist new liberal party has been squashed. So have the rumors that Russia's liberal conscience and enforcer of fiscal discipline, Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin, would be the next prime minister. But Kudrin would have been a much better choice than an ineffective Medvedev, and could have taken Russia back to the long-forgotten era of real reform when Putin first came to power in the early 2000s -- before the Yukos affair in 2003 and the oil price explosion that sucked the life out of the reform impulse. What does Kudrin do now to stop the markets freaking out? And how long will the mild-mannered Medvedev really last as PM, given that he is unlikely to transform himself overnight into a fire-breathing CEO? The Russian government can't be run on Twitter. Then there are much bigger strategic questions. Will Putin 2.0 be any different from Putin 1.0? Can Putin dismantle Putinism? Putin always hoped the history books would treat him well, which is why he chooses court historians to write them; but even many of the supposed achievements of his first two terms of office (2000-08), such as Russia's much-vaunted ""stability,"" the restoration of state authority and victory in Chechnya, may now be under threat if Putin comes back in much more difficult economic circumstances and with real anarchy looming in Russia's North Caucasian ""internal abroad."" Even stagnation is not an easy option. Will Putin 2.0 be able to stop the growing torrent of capital flight out of Russia, which reached $21 billion in the first quarter of 2011? Putin's ideologue Vladislav Surkov once coined the term ""offshore aristocracy'"" to abuse the ""cosmopolitan"" oligarchs and Western advisers of the Yeltsin era; but this is precisely what Putin's oligarchy has become. The ruling elite is not investing at home -- many of them don't even live in Russia. And capital flight is no longer just for oligarchs, as genuine entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) despair of red tape and corruption. Will Putin be able to curb the bloated state that has grown so unwieldy under oil money? The budget only balances at an ever higher oil price -- currently reckoned to be about $125 a barrel. How high will the necessary price be in a few years? Putin has so far failed to build a new narrative. The same old guys still sit beside him. Even his old image as the ""good tsar"" reigning in the ""bad boyars"" is suspect. Putin has not cleansed the stables, and the oligarchs close to him may get bolder and more brazen once he comes back to power. Putin's favorite foreign policy initiatives will be pushed further forward, like the idea of a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan, with Ukraine under pressure to join. If Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili ""does a Putin"" and makes himself prime minister after his second term runs out in January 2013, Saakashvili and Putin could then be squaring off for years. The ugly youth group Nashi and its skinhead hinterland will still be around. Periodically, Putin's PR machine has pushed out the idea that he is tired of office and looking forward to retirement. We can now put that myth to rest. He has now guaranteed himself another six or even 12 years of hyperactivity, with an overflowing in-tray.","Putin's decision to stand again as Russian president is no big surprise, says commentator .

"(CNN) -- Like misery, failure loves company. Look at the immigration debate and how both liberals and conservatives -- and elected officials in both parties -- bungle it. President Barack Obama has failed on immigration policy. But now that he appears to be poised to take executive action to fix some of what's broken with the country's immigration system, Republicans in Congress sound like they're about to overreact and join him in that failure. Conservatives love to stir their flock by pushing the narrative that Obama is a staunch supporter of ""amnesty"" and that the President has always been in lockstep with immigration reform advocates. That's fiction. It's been a rocky relationship. That's because Obama belongs to that wing of the Democratic Party that hasn't been interested in legalizing the undocumented and creating more competition in the job market for U.S. workers. Obama broke his campaign promise to make reform a top issue and eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by expanding 100-fold the program known as Secure Communities, which ropes local police into enforcing federal immigration law. He tried to fend off critics who wanted him to slow deportations by claiming that he didn't have the power to act ""as a king,"" only to later flip-flop and do just that during his 2012 re-election campaign when he unveiled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Obama deported a record 2 million people in five years, divided hundreds of thousands of families, failed to deal effectively with thousands of child refugees who streamed across the U.S.-Mexico border last summer and then broke another promise when he said he would take executive action on immigration before the midterm elections but blinked. Now, according to news reports that look like a trial balloon from the White House, Obama might, as early as this week, take unilateral action to offer several million illegal immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation and perhaps even give some of them work permits. If it materializes, I'll be proved wrong. A few months ago, I said this would never happen and now it looks like it might. Options include some common sense items: Eliminating Secure Communities; broadening DACA by eliminating restrictions on how old applicants can be and when they had to have arrived; restating that the enforcement priority should be to remove violent criminals and not housekeepers and students; and expanding visa programs for immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens. But it's the final item on the list that could really upset the apple cart: deferred action for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, which could result in as many as 4 million to 5 million people getting a temporary reprieve from deportation. When those undocumented college students known as DREAMers first argued for special treatment, the claim was based on the simple idea that they were brought here as children and thus didn't intentionally choose to break the law. Fair enough. But the same thing can't be said of their parents, who did intentionally break the law. Now what? Is there a new argument? Besides, if Obama offers deferred action to parents, it will validate what conservatives have always insisted about how the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants can be used to keep their parents from being deported. That has never been the case. Parents get deported all the time, and their U.S.-citizen kids either go with them or stay on this side of the border and get put in foster care. Republicans have been wrong all along. Now, if he goes too far, Obama could prove them right. If the President follows through on the proposed course of action, both sides will need to calm down. Those on the left should hold their applause. By ending the deportation juggernaut, the President would merely be putting out a fire that he started. Besides, this is just a temporary reprieve that would require the undocumented to surrender to law enforcement officials, get fingerprinted and all the rest. And it could all be revoked by the next president. Finally, this is not what Obama promised way back when -- that he would work aggressively with Congress to pass legislation that would permanently improve the lives of millions. This isn't reform. It's ""reform lite."" Yet at the same time, those on the right need to rein in their scorn. In the post 9/11 era, conservatives shouldn't need a reminder of something they've been telling us for years: how sweeping can be the executive power of the president. As head of the executive branch, Obama naturally has the power to set priorities for the enforcement of immigration law. Republicans have no trouble deflecting criticism by reminding Latino voters that Obama is in charge of deportations. So, instead of threatening the suicidal tantrums of a government shutdown or impeachment, conservatives should pipe down and let him be in charge of deportations. That doesn't just mean deciding who goes but also who stays. Besides, Republicans like to talk tough about illegal immigration and the need to uphold the ""rule of law"" but that slogan would mean more coming from them if they didn't always run away from enforcing those laws that target the root of illegal immigration: U.S. employers who hire the undocumented, many of whom contribute to the re-election campaigns of Republican lawmakers. What Obama has in mind isn't some kindhearted miracle or the coming of the apocalypse. It's just a legitimate exercise of the power that any president would have under the Constitution and our system of government. I know that isn't sexy, or inspiring, or inflammatory. It won't help the parties fundraise. But it does have the advantage of being true.","Ruben Navarrette says executive action on immigration would be legal, warranted .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday outlined his foreign policy vision and defended his record to date. What caught our experts' ears was as much about what he didn't address as much as what he did. Obama lays out foreign policy challenges . Here are their takeaways: . 1. Partner in Yemen still has problems: Obama's call for a new $5 billion counter-terrorism fund to ""train, build capacity, and facilitate partner countries on the front lines"" may find it tough going to achieve quick results. ""These resources will give us flexibility to fulfill different missions, including training security forces in Yemen who have gone on the offensive against al Qaeda; supporting a multinational force to keep the peace in Somalia; working with European allies to train a functioning security force and border patrol in Libya; and facilitating French operations in Mali,"" the President said. But the challenge in Yemen alone may be significant. Some U.S. officials believe the problem there is that neither the Yemeni forces nor al Qaeda operatives have fundamentally changed the territory they hold on the ground. Both sides are maneuvering, both attack and counterattack, but even with Yemeni military efforts, the basic power on the ground doesn't shift for either side. The problem with Yemen's military remains its inability to sustain itself in the field for a long period of time. There are additional challenges. In Libya, a training program is running into delays over how to ensure those being trained are not extremists. There is a similar challenge in training Syrian opposition forces. And in Nigeria, the U.S. military is legally banned from working with some Nigerian units because those units have been accused of human rights abuses. -- Barbara Starr, CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent . Transcript: Obama's foreign policy address . 2. Looking through the right lens?: The President spoke very little of the three-year civil war in Syria, addressing it primarily as a counter-terrorism challenge. He referenced support for the moderate opposition, a nod to a plan to increase training for rebels now fighting both forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and extremists linked to al Qaeda. But Obama made scant mention of efforts to strengthen the political opposition and glossed over the year-long effort to bring the regime and opposition to the table for peace talks that broke down months ago and now seem dead in the water. Libya and Iraq were also treated mostly as a counter-terrorism challenge. The United States helped rid Libya of Moammar Gadhafi, but the country is now in the throes of a political crisis that is driving the current violence, which requires sustained diplomatic engagement. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq has also seen a lessening of high-level diplomatic attention while sectarian violence is again on the rise. The reduction of the U.S. military footprint must be matched with a redoubling of U.S. diplomatic engagement, and such a vision was lacking in the President's speech by viewing these countries through a terrorism lens. -- Elise Labott, CNN Foreign Policy Reporter . Five foreign policy headaches for Obama . 3. What about Syria? Syria was going to be the headline today. I think what we got was this partnership fund with other nations that needs to be approved by Congress and we'll look for supporting the moderate opposition on the ground more. Even if that does substantially change the situation down the road, the way it comes across here falls a little flat, especially with some of the buildup we've seen leading into it. ""Defensive"" is kind of the word here. Some of what has tainted or dampened the stance that the administration has taken even in the briefing room day-to-day is that it has been pushed into a defensive stance. This was a sweeping speech that kind of covered everything and was a chance for the President to list what seemed like every accomplishment of his administration. But it came across at times as a defensive, lawyerly answer to critics. -- Michelle Kosinski, CNN White House Correspondent . 4. Military action as a last resort: Administration officials were aware that Obama's now infamous ""singles and doubles"" comment during his recent trip to Asia struck many critics as small-minded. And they intended for his West Point address to place his recent foreign policy moves in the context of broader goals and values. On that count, the speech fell short of its target. The President instead delivered a familiar defense of current strategy with virtually no new policy announcements. At the core, he argued that after ""costly wars and continuing challenges at home,"" military action must be a last resort. ""I would betray my duty to you and to the country we live in if I sent you into harm's way simply because I saw a problem that needed fixing,"" he said. The President's strategy will instead continue to emphasize international partnerships and institutions. And he presented two of his most recent foreign policy challenges -- Ukraine and Iran -- as examples of where this strategy has worked, deterring a Russian invasion in the first, and bringing Tehran to the negotiating table in the second. -- Jim Sciutto, CNN Chief National Security Correspondent .","U.S. officials still have questions about the Yemeni military's ability .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama said Monday he will attempt to block bonuses to executives at ailing insurance giant AIG, payments he described as an ""outrage."" President Obama says AIG ""finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed."" ""This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed,"" Obama told politicians and reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, where he and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner were unveiling a package to aid the nation's small businesses. The president expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG, which has received $173 billion in U.S. government bailouts over the past six months. ""Under these circumstances, it's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay. I mean, how do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?""  Watch why Americans have a right to be angry » . Obama was referring to the bonuses paid to traders in AIG's financial products division, the tiny group of people who crafted complicated deals that wound up shaking the world's economic foundations.  See a snapshot of facts, attitudes and analysis on the recession » . The president said he has asked Geithner to ""pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole."" Obama spared AIG's new CEO, Edward Liddy, from criticism, saying he got the job ""after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year."" But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics. ""It's about our fundamental values,"" he said.  Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses » . ""All across the country, there are people who are working hard and meeting their responsibilities every single day, without the benefit of government bailouts or multimillion-dollar bonuses. You've got a bunch of small-business people here who are struggling just to keep their credit line open,"" Obama said. ""And all they ask is that everyone, from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, play by the same rules. That is an ethic that we have to demand."" Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again. Then, coughing, he added in jest, ""I'm choked up with anger here."" Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa didn't appear to be joking, however, when he spoke with Cedar Rapids, Iowa, radio station WMT. ""I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little better toward them [AIG executives] is if they follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, 'I am sorry,' and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide,"" he said. ""And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide."" Under pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or ""retention payments"" -- by at least 30 percent. That has did little to temper outrage over the initial plan, however. Obama received support from fellow Democrats, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. ""This is another outrageous example of executives -- including those whose decisions were responsible for the problems that caused AIG's collapse -- enriching themselves at the expense of taxpayers,"" the Democrat from Connecticut said. He noted in a written statement that executives at other companies that received bailout funds have volunteered to forgo bonuses. ""There's no reason why those at AIG shouldn't do the same,"" he said. Later, Dodd told CNN he is considering an unusual approach to get the bonus money back. ""One idea we're kind of thinking about is a tax provision,"" the Connecticut Democrat said. ""We have a right to tax. You could write a tax provision that's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses. That's a way maybe to deal with it."" Dodd said the notion is in the ""earliest of thinking"" and has not been settled on as a way to resolve the issue that has set off outrage in Washington and across the country. In the House, Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses. They're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses, a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday. The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses, which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September, according to the committee aide. Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses. Complicating the issue, said the committee aide, is that the first infusion of cash to AIG was authorized by the Federal Reserve before Congress passed the $700 billion bailout bill, also known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program, which included some restrictions on executive pay. Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. On the floor of the Senate on Monday, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, issued a stinging rebuke of AIG, calling executive bonuses ""beyond outrageous."" ""Our financial sector will never heal unless the financial companies who helped create this economic crisis begin to regain the public trust. The actions of AIG do just the opposite, and every American is justified in their outrage at this breach of public trust,"" he said.  Who's insured by AIG? » . New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said in a letter to Liddy that was distributed to the news media that he was ""disturbed to learn"" of the bonus plan. And he threatened to issue subpoenas if the company failed to send him detailed information about who received bonuses and for how much. Read the letter to AIG (PDF) ""Previously, AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool,"" he said. He said he had already asked for the names and titles of the people who are to receive the payments, ""and it is surprising that you have yet to provide this information."" ""Covering up the details of these payments breeds further cynicism and distrust in our already shaken financial system."" He added that he also is seeking ""whatever contracts you now claim obligate you to make these payments"" and the names of whoever negotiated them. ""Finally, we demand an immediate status report as to whether the payments under the retention plan have been made,"" he said. The information was needed, he said, to determine whether bonus recipients ""were involved in the conduct that led to AIG's demise and subsequent bailout""; whether the company is ""truly required"" to pay them; whether the contracts ""may be unenforceable"" because of fraud or other reasons; and whether ""any of the retention payments may be considered fraudulent conveyances under New York law.""

"(CNN) -- Britain's Andy Murray battled long and hard to make it to the ATP World Tour Finals but he may wish he hadn't following one of the most humiliating defeats of his career. It came against a Roger Federer who was a mixture of majestic, imperious and brutal as he battered the home favorite 6-0 6-1. With Kei Nishikori having won earlier on Thursday, Federer came into the match knowing he had already made the semifinals -- and that freedom allowed a performance of flair and firepower. Fifty-six minutes later, he had another exquisite win to reflect upon, a result that sent the Japanese through to the last four. ""I am clearly very happy to have played a good match,"" Federer said on court. ""I knew I was qualified so I went into the match more relaxed. It's not the way I thought it was going to go."" The Swiss almost won without dropping a game, only for Murray to salvage a morsel of pride in front of the London crowd by winning the 12th game of the match. Having been just two points away from the first 'double bagel' of his career, his appearance on the scoreboard brought up one of the biggest cheers of the night. But despite some shaking of heads from the locals in the London crowd, most left feeling they had watched a masterclass from one of the game's greatest practitioners. ""I can say I'm disappointed in my level but if I played well, he would probably still have won anyway,"" said Murray afterwards. ""He played exceptionally well."" ""It was a tough night. I've lost (grand) slam finals and stuff, which has been very tough, but in terms of the way the match went, it was not ideal from my side of the court. Far from it."" As he hinted, this was an understatement. The 17-time grand slam champion needed just 23 minutes to reach set point, and he wrapped up the set for the loss of just eight points. Winning the set qualified Nishikori for the semis, with the debutant having won 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 against David Ferrer, who replaced Milos Raonic after the Canadian pulled out with injury. It also eliminated Murray, who had needed to win in straight sets, from the competition. The Scot kept on losing games -- the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh -- in one of his most humbling experiences and his worst defeat since losing 6-1 6-0 to Novak Djokovic in 2007. He would not have heard the advice the watching Jose Mourinho gave to Sky Sports television after the first set, but Murray may take some solace from the Chelsea coach's words should he ever hear them. ""There are some matches where we feel it is not our day,"" said the Portuguese. ""Sometimes a bad defeat is the beginning of many, many victories and hopefully next season will be great for Andy."" Murray is one of the 'Big Four' but Federer, who can still finish the year as world No. 1, put the two-time grand slam winner in his place. ""It was good fun,"" Federer told Sky Sports television later. Incredibly, the world No. 2 only got 39% of his first serves in but he won all 14 points when he did. He has now reached the semifinals of the tournament for a twelfth time, so equaling the record of Murray's former coach Ivan Lendl, as the 33-year-old seeks a seventh Tour Finals title. He is also in contention to finish the year as world no. 1 but he needs Tomas Berdych to provide a major upset by stopping Novak Djokovic in both players' final Group A match on Friday. Asian Gains . Federer's victory in straight sets continued the theme of the finals but the introduction of Ferrer resulted in the tournament's first three-setter. The gritty Spaniard, who had practicing at the O2 Arena as the first reserve, came in after Raonic revealed he suffered a slight tear in his thigh when losing to Murray on Tuesday. ""I would be unfair to fans if I was to go out and play a mediocre match,"" said the big-serving Canadian. ""If I was to step on court, I could lose up to 6-8 weeks. That was a significant factor in my decision."" Nishikori, who lost this year's U.S. Open final, only found out shortly before walking on court that he wouldn't be playing Raonic. ""It was really difficult to make this adjustment (to face Ferrer),"" said the Japanese. ""They told me one hour before the match."" He took a while to settle, losing the first set but then fighting back in a performance where he hit 41 winners. Group A concludes on Friday, with Stan Wawrinka also in action against Marin Cilic, who has lost both his games so far.","Roger Federer inflicts joint worst defeat of Andy Murray's career .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney celebrated his 100th cap for England by scoring the equalizer in a 3-1 victory over Slovenia in an Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley Saturday. A lackluster England was trailing to a Jordan Henderson own goal just before the hour mark when skipper Rooney changed the course of the match. The Manchester United striker almost immediately won a penalty after being tripped and converted from the spot to draw his team level. It was his 44th goal for England, drawing him level with the great Jimmy Greaves, but more importantly sparked his spluttering team into action. Strike partner Danny Welbeck put the home side ahead with as scrappy goal as his scuffed shot beat visiting keeper Samir Handanovic. But the third was a well worked move, the Arsenal man exchanging passes with Raheem Sterling before converting neatly. Four wins from four in Group E puts England well on the way to qualification for the finals in France in two years time. In the same group, one of the themes of the weekend continued with minnows San Marino, ranked 208th and joint-last in the FIFA rankings, holding Estonia to a 0-0 draw at home. The unlikely point came a day after the Faroe Islands stunned former European champion Greece 1-0 in Athens. Liechtenstein, population 40,000, was also in fine form, upsetting Moldova 1-0 in Group G. Its captain Franz Burgmeier scored the goal, for a first competitive win since June 2011. But there was no such luck for 2018 World Cup hosts Russia, beaten 1-0 in Austria in the same group, a result which leaves coach Fabio Capello's future under the spotlight. Rubin Okotie scored the decisive goal in the 73rd minute as Austria opened up a five-point lead at the top of the group standings. Reigning European champion Spain was boosted by a superb opening goal from Real Madrid's emerging star Isco in a 3-0 win over Belarus in Group C. Making is first start for Spain, Isco picked up the ball just outside the penalty area and curled a fine shot into the corner of the net. Barcelona pair Sergio Busquets and Pedro Rodriguez were also on target in a comfortable win which is Spain's third win from four matches. It is tied with Ukraine on nine points, three adrift of table topping Slovakia, who won 2-0 in Macedonia Saturday.","England beats Slovenia 3-1 at Wembley .

Pooley's: Madison, Wisconsin . You watch sports at Pooley's, of course, but you can also play them. ""I have 80 teams in leagues Monday through Thursday nights and a private league on Fridays,"" says Geoffrey Poole of the bar's two volleyball/basketball courts, which are otherwise available for drop-in patrons. A local fixture since 1993, Pooley's is not only Madison's largest sports bar but also a museum with more than 1,600 signed photos, 400-plus football helmets (including three from Heisman Trophy winners) and more than 75 jerseys. The biggest crowds turn up for the Badgers NCAA basketball games, when the bar runs a shuttle to and from the stadium for $10. Cask 'n Flagon: Boston, Massachusetts .

Thirteen televisions, six sports packages, and 80 out-of-market games shown every week are gravy. Nellie's Sports Bar: Washington, D.C. ""I'd say we put equal emphasis on being a gay bar and a sports bar,"" observes owner Douglas Schantz, who named it for his great-grandmother. You'll find a large portrait of Nellie in a fur hat amid a mishmash of antique tennis rackets, old oars and vintage advertisements. Twenty-four televisions and a giant projection screen belong firmly to this millennium, as does the super-fun weekend Drag Brunch, which often books up a month in advance. As for game days, ""football is our number one sport here, followed by March Madness,"" says Schantz. ""A lot of fans love our rooftop after-parties."" Tag Sports Bar: Las Vegas, Nevada . In Vegas, even sports bars are over the top. Tag counts a whopping 43 TVs streaming sports from nearly every country, 24 hours a day.

On Tuesdays, regulars turn up for more unusual competition: goldfish racing, with a 64 single-elimination bracket. ""Everyone competing gets a goldfish from our giant aquarium to race down these tiny water tracks,"" explains McGuffin. ""The winner goes home with concert tickets or some similar prize."" Banter Bar: Brooklyn, New York . Kick off your day with a bacon, egg and cheese pie here at Banter Bar, which has 24 beers on tap and a serious soccer obsession.

"London (CNN) -- The year 2012 is a significant one in the Maya calendar. The ancient long count calendar of the Maya, a Mesoamerican civilization that flourished across Mexico and Central America from 2000 BC to the time of the Spanish Conquistadores, states that on the 12th December, 2012, the sun will be aligned with the center of the Milky Way for the first time in approximately 26,000 years. And 21 December, 2012, is said to mark the end of the 13th Maya Calendar, a 144,000-day cycle or ""b'ak'tun"" since the mythical Maya day of creation 5,200 years ago. Though popularly interpreted as signifying the ""end of the world as we know it,"" scholars stress that the end of the ""b'ak'tun"" does not mean apocalypse. While few Maya people still follow the long count calendar, the Global Heritage Fund is celebrating the event by naming 2012 ""The Year of the Maya,"" with members of the Fund greeting the winter solstice on top of La Danta pyramid at the El Mirador site in Guatemala. ""Experiencing the Winter Solstice on the summit of La Danta is thought to be one of the greatest opportunities to experience the end of the 13th Maya calendar and dawn of a new age,"" said Jeff Morgan, Executive Director of the Global Heritage Fund. But their celebrations have a serious side: the Global Heritage Fund is highlighting the dangers to Mayan sites such as El Mirador, which are threatened by looting and deforestation, and hoping to secure the investment to turn these neglected spots into thriving and sustainable tourist destinations. ""Tikal National Park (in Guatemala) has proven that major Maya archaeological sites are economically sustainable through visitation and with appropriate investment, can generate hundreds of millions of dollars for conservation and maintenance of both the cultural and natural heritage,"" said Morgan. CNN's World's Treasures asked Morgan to compile a list of key Maya sites across LatinAmerica for Maya-enthusiasts keen to ring in the dawn of a new era sitting on the monumental steps of a temple or at the summit of an ancient pyramid. Chichen Itza . The site of Chichen Itza is a key sacred spot in Mexico's southern Yucatan peninsula -- the settlement is believed to date back to the 5th century AD. Its architecture is a blend of Maya and Toltec styles. It was the Toltec -- warrior peoples from the Mexican plateau -- who imposed the practice of ritual sacrifice at the site. Covering a huge surface area, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is rich in monuments, chief of which is the stepped pyramid temple of Kukulkan, as well as a Great Ball Court, where visitors can picture deadly ball games taking place. Tulum . Though not extensive, this clifftop site in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula is certainly picturesque, overlooking the turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. A photo-friendly beauty spot, Tulum is a relaxed pit-stop on the itinerary. A dip in the sea should revive any temple-weary travelers. Palenque . Also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Palenque, in Chiapas, Mexico, is nestled deep in the jungle, the tops of its many temples often wreathed in mist. The site boasts stepped pyramids, including the impressive Temple of Inscriptions, carved stone walls and even the burial site of Pakal the Great, Palenque's 7th-century ruler. Tikal . Tikal is set in an ecological reserve in Guatemala -- its ruins are believed to date from as far back as 600 BC, and at one point the city was thought to be inhabited by 90, 000 people. Temples, palaces, and public squares abound: If you want to go off the main tourist beat, you can explore the many ruins lying seemingly half-forgotten in the surrounding jungle. Not just a historical treasure, the land on which Tikal rests is a natural beauty spot, home to numerous protected species of flora and fauna. Copan . The Maya civilization spanned much of Central America and this site in Honduras is thought to have been inhabited as far back as 2000 BC. Abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in 1570 by a Spanish explorer named Diego Garcia de Palacio. The site is another maze of temples, plazas, altar complexes and ball courts, and of particular note is the Hieroglyphic Stairway Plaza, a monumental 100-meter-wide stairway bearing a long Mayan inscription composed of numerous glyphs.","2012 is key date on Maya calendar, said to be start of new era, not end of world .

"(CNN) -- A massive explosion at a fertilizer plant in the small Texas town of West left at least two people dead, sent dozens more seeking medical attention and prompted a widescale evacuation in the community of 2,600 people. Fire officials fear that the number of casualties could rise much higher. The blast took place at the West Fertilizer Plant, about 18 miles north of Waco. It sent a massive fireball into the sky . And the danger may not be over. Residents are being evacuated because officials are worried that another tank at the facility might explode. State troopers in gas masks were scene rushing to the area shortly after the blast, . Shortly after the explosion, more than 60 patients streamed into Hillcrest Hospital in Waco, suffering from ""blast injuries, orthopedic injuries (and) a lot of lacerations,"" said hospital CEO Glenn Robinson. While some of the injuries are minor, others are ""quite serious,"" he said. At least six helicopters are going to fly out those who are injured, Robinson said. Others are being transported by ambulance, and some are getting to the hospital by car, he added. Two other hospitals in the region were also assisting. As many scrambled to assist the injured, another danger seemed to emerge Wednesday night. ""What we are hearing is that there is one fertilizer tank that is still intact at the plant, and there are evacuations in place to make sure everyone gets away from the area safely in case of another explosion,"" said Ben Stratmann, a spokesman for Texas State Sen. Brian Birdwell. Photos of the explosion -- which reportedly happened around 7:50 p.m. (8:50 p.m. ET) -- showed a huge blaze and flames leaping over the roof of a structure and a plume of smoke rising high into the air. The West Fertilizer Plant is just north of Waco. A school and a nursing home are among the buildings near the plant, CNN affiliate KWTX reported. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he is aware of the explosion, a spokesman said, and was working to get resources into the area. Tommy Alford, who works in a convenience store about three miles from the plant, told CNN that several volunteer firefighters were at the store when they spotted smoke. Alford said the firefighters headed toward the scene and then between five and 10 minutes later, he heard a massive explosion. ""It was massive; it was intense,"" Alford said. Chrystal Anthony, a nearby resident, said she saw the flames engulf a nursing home and an apartment complex. ""It was an apartment complex that was devastated, the nursing home. The fire was close to a residential area,"" Anthony said. ""It was like a bomb went off,"" said Barry Murry, a resident who lives about a mile away from the plant. ""There were emergency vehicles everywhere. It has been overwhelming."" West, Texas, is a community of about 2,800 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Sitting about 75 miles south of Dallas and 120 miles north of Austin, West is one of 22 incorporated communities in McLennan County. Some firefighters at the scene of a fertilizer plant explosion in Texas were concerned Wednesday night about anhydrous ammonia. What is anhydrous ammonia? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anhydrous ammonia is a pungent gas with suffocating fumes that is used as a fertilizer. When exposed to humans, it can cause serious problems. CNN's Chandler Friedman, Carma Hassan, Ed Payne, Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Hospital is told to anticipate 100 injured, official says .

"(CNN) -- Is there room for one more music-streaming service on the Web? Some music-industry heavyweights are betting the answer is ""yes."" Beats Music, an offshoot of the uber-successful headphone company Beats Electronics, launched on Tuesday with a focus on mobile. It's available for Apple's iPhone and iPods, Android devices and Windows phones. A specialized iPad version is in the works. It enters a crowded landscape populated with the likes of Pandora and Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio and numerous other competitors. The difference, according to its creators, will be Beats' human touch. ""No one was doing a music service; everyone was building a music server,"" Beats Music chief executive Ian Rogers told WIRED, a CNN content partner. While other streaming platforms will have bigger music catalogues, Beats is banking on its more robust suggestion engine -- or, as a blog post Tuesday said, ""bringing you the right song for right now."" Like other music services, Beats will use a computer algorithm to help suggest new music for you based on what you've already listened to. But that system factors in things like gender and age in addition to your current playlist. It even considers which songs you crank up the volume on, compared to which ones you listen to quietly, and what you play during the work day compared to what you stream at home. And there's a team of curators and behavioral scientists participating in the process as well. In their blog post, the company plays up their involvement, while taking a shot at competitors. ""In our experience, it's always been a living, breathing human who has brought us that song we fell in love with,"" the post reads. ""We tried to remember a time a robot found us magic, but all we could find were the times the robot made us laugh: 'You like Pantera? Have you heard of Black Sabbath?' 'You like Mumford and Sons? Here's another song with banjos!' "" Beats Music definitely brings some music-industry clout to the Web-streaming wars. Super-producer Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M who has worked with artists from Bruce Springsteen to Lady Gaga, is chairman of Beats Music and co-founded Beats Electronics with Dr. Dre in 2006. Trent Reznor, of Nine Inch Nails fame, is the company's chief creative officer. The company is trying something else that's different for the music-streaming business. Unlike competitors like Spotify and Pandora, Beats Music will not have any free options. The service will cost $10 a month. (There's currently a special for AT&T customers offering service for up to five people for $15 per month). Rogers says it's a model Beats is confident about. ""We know people will pay for something where there is value,"" he told WIRED. ""Enough people pay for headphones, it's an exciting business. We think we can do the same thing here.""","Beats Music is the latest entry in Web music streaming .

"(CNN) -- Jerry Sandusky's wife still stands by him, insisting the former Penn State assistant football coach is innocent of sexually abusing young boys. Dottie Sandusky, in an interview with CNN's Jason Carroll, blames the news media for the conviction that sent her husband, now 70, to prison on a 30- to 60-year sentence. ""I think Jerry was found guilty before trial,"" she said. Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in 2012 on 45 counts, has always maintained his innocence. Why does his wife still believe him after hearing trial testimony from a parade of men who said Sandusky abused them when they were boys? ""Because he is innocent,"" she told CNN. Dottie Sandusky accused some of those who claimed to be victims of seeking money. The university announced last year that it reached a deal to pay nearly $60 million in civil settlements to 26 different men who said they were abused. ""It makes me angry that people are not telling the truth,"" she said. ""That's what makes me angry, and that an innocent man is in prison."" Dottie Sandusky's latest comments immediately drew responses from lawyers for two victims. ""Mrs. Sandusky is our best recent example of our deep denial of the reality of child sex abuse,"" attorney Marci Hamilton said.Â ""He was convicted by a jury of his peers based on the testimony of numerous victims. Never underestimate the ability of a pedophile to charm and deceive the adults around him or her."" ""Dott(ie) Sandusky, like her husband, remains remarkably unremorseful towards Jerry Sandusky's victims,"" attorney Tom Kline said. ""One significant and noticeable difference is her dramatic shift from her cold and detached demeanor as a witness for her husband at his criminal trial to an emotional and distraught spouse, which appears to my eye to be an attempt to convey a sympathetic image for herself and husband -- a child molester convicted by overwhelming evidence."" The couple's adopted son, Matt Sandusky, originally denied to a grand jury being abused, but during trial jury deliberations, he told his attorney that he, too, was a victim. In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the home and once attempted suicide. Dottie Sandusky said in her CNN interview that she didn't know why Matt changed his story. ""I don't know,"" she said. ""All the other kids do not believe him. You know, he always liked a better deal. He always liked to be, you know, better and he did have some financial problems."" While calling her adopted son ""very likeable, very believable,"" she questioned his honesty. ""We've had many things that have gone on with Matt. He has stolen from our family. He's stolen from our kids. He stole from my mother-in-law."" She previously disputed his credibility, referring to Matt's ""many run-ins with the law"" in a letter to the judge who was about to sentence her husband in October 2012. ""Matt is extremely disappointed that Dottie and the Sanduskys have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from Jerry Sandusky's heinous crimes,"" his lawyers, Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin, said in a written statement to CNN at the time. ""Matt has shown tremendous courage and strength. Rather than supporting her son when he made the gut-wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Jerry Sandusky, Dottie Sandusky has chosen to continue Jerry's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims, thereby perpetuating the abuse."" Her prison visits with her husband are sad, Dottie Sandusky said. ""It's hard to talk about family things,"" she told CNN. ""We talk about the case. We talk about our friends. We talk about what he's doing in prison or what has happened, you know. And I try to cheer him up, but usually he cheers me up instead of me cheering him up."" A jury found evidence that Jerry Sandusky abused 10 boys, most of whom he met through his children's charity, The Second Mile. Many of them were abused on Penn State's campus, where Sandusky had access after he retired. Sandusky's wife testified at his trial that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual going on in the basement of their home, where many of the victims say her husband molested them. In her letter to the judge, Dottie Sandusky said she had lost faith in the police and the legal system: ""To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths."" Penn State's record number of sex offense reports spurs federal inquiry . Victim 9 sues Penn State . CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- We celebrate Veterans Day this week, but we have been riding a crest of war remembrance for months now. World War I's centenary alone has brought forth new books -- histories of that war, based on historical documentation and letters unearthed in family and state archives. We look anew at the inscriptions on tombs of known and unknown soldiers and posters from the past whose propagandistic messages shout at us across the divide of time. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . But in the midst of this flood of words, an equally significant, and telling, aspect of the Great War has been largely overlooked: the place of silence in and around the conflict. World War I may call to mind the written word -- the harrowing verses of Wilfred Owen or the prose of Erich Maria Remarque, whose ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" rendered war's raw brutality. But the experiences of the years 1914-1918 in fact enshrined the notions that language cannot adequately express the experience of combat, that the veteran will often remain silent about war, even to his or her own family, that the speech of soldiers -- the euphemisms and slang used on the battlefield, the coded communications used after, among veterans -- leaves out as much as it reveals. Opinion: When the flu wiped out millions . This notion of war as an inaccessible space may seem almost antiquated today, when civilian smartphones and video cameras produce a continual feed of chaotic combat situations. But much of what goes on in military operations remains unknown to those who were not there. The connections between silence and war still hold among soldiers-- for reasons of security, censorship, military culture and enduring mechanisms of human psychology. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . In 2014, as in 1914, many veterans keep quiet about what are their most life-changing experiences. There is, for one thing, the trauma; there is also the desire to protect one's family. There is guilt over killing -- and guilt over surviving. And there is the sheer difficulty of how to explain it: how to put an exceptional state into everyday language. Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' World War I was a watershed in this regard, modeling, during the course of the conflict, what could and could not be said about war by combatants. Some silences were strategic: Soldiers knew their communications home would be censored, and it was unwise to appear defeatist or unpatriotic by conveying the horrors of the battlefield. Opinion: The promise World War I couldn't keep . Others refused speech as a way of respecting the war experience of fallen comrades. War poetry is vocal on the need for restraint to counter the rhetoric of heroism produced by those far from the front. In his 1915 poem ""When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead,"" Charles Hamilton Sorley scorned the use of ""soft words"" about those who could not speak back: ""Say only this, 'They are dead.' /Then add thereto, /'Yet many a better one has died before.'..."" Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . Most combatants could not come up with the words, soft or hard, to communicate to those back home what lay around them: carnage on an unprecedented scale. With many new weapons, and others used on a mass scale for the first time in history, World War I inaugurated a new human experience of battle and devastating new injuries. Even the educated felt that language failed them to convey the sights and smells of bodies rent by machine gun fire, devastated by bombs from the air, blistered from gas or paralyzed by shell shock. ""I cannot find words to translate my impressions. Hell cannot be so terrible,"" wrote the French lieutenant Alfred Joubaire in his diary, unable to draw comparisons with any known reality. Opinion: War: What is it good for? Art! The writings, drawings and other artifacts that flowed from the front grappled not only with the question of how to rise to these expressive challenges, but whether it is even possible to communicate this new reality to the noncombatant. Opinion: Should nations pay the price for their leaders' misdeeds? Henri Barbusse reflected on this futility in his 1916 novel ""Under Fire,"" which originated from notes taken during his time at the front. ""It'll be no good telling about it, eh? They wouldn't believe you ... no one can know it. Only us,"" remarks one soldier. ""No, not even us, not even us!,"" another responds. ""We've seen too much to remember ... We're not made to hold it all."" Traumatic repression, the veterans' despair at being understood, the affirmation of a special bond of knowledge and experience among comrades -- all familiar struggles from our modern wars. They are all here, in 1916 -- violence of a scope that exceeded comprehension. Indeed, Barbusse's scene ends with the rueful reflection that this war was something ""you can't give a name to."" Opinion: The promise World War I couldn't keep . Both the modern figure of the literary witness and the modern figure of the mute veteran emerged from this early 20th-century conflagration -- as with Barbusse, they were often one and the same - and with them the notion of war as something too overwhelming to tell. Opinion: How World War I gave us drones . Of course, this situation was not unique to the Great War. A study released in August by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, which reveals the prolonged post-traumatic stress among Vietnam veterans -- home from war for 40 years now -- reminds us of that. Opinion: How World War I gave us drones . And so it's fitting that from 1919 onward, World War I's November 11th Armistice has been marked in many countries through two minutes of silence and has been expanded to include the veterans of all wars. The words of World War I can enlighten us about the conflict 100 years later. But the spaces of silence around the din of all wars can tell us much about war's toll on those who wage it -- in 2014 as in 1914.

"(CNN) -- A report issued Monday by Pennsylvania attorney general's says that more could have been done to put convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky behind bars earlier, but the investigation stalled for months at a time in the three years that a case was built against the former Penn State football defensive coordinator. The report does not accuse anyone -- most notably the former attorney general, current Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett -- of doing anything maliciously to delay the investigation. Instead, it says that investigators from different agencies failed to communicate and share information and that search warrants and subpoenas were not issued as quickly as they could have been. For example, almost three years before his arrest, Sandusky was interviewed by a social worker, but police were not invited to the interview. ""This was a notable failure, particularly since at no point later in the investigation did law enforcement manage to interview Sandusky,"" the report said. The report also faults investigators for not finding a 1998 police report at Penn State for nearly two years despite the fact that several people in law enforcement were aware of it. Police also waited two years before contacting Sandusky's children's charity, the Second Mile, the place where he met almost all of his victims. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys. His arrest came with charges including conspiracy and perjury against three Penn State officials, including the former university president. And the scandal led to the firing of legendary Penn State coach Joe Paterno. The report does not talk about Paterno's role in the scandal â€” a widely debated topic among Penn State loyalists and fans who are trying to restore his reputation. Attorney General Kathleen Kane promised a review of her predecessor's handling of the case when she took office in 2012, and Monday's report is the conclusion of that two-year review. Corbett declined to respond to the report. Investigators from the Pennsylvania State Police, along with various child welfare agencies, disputed that the actions of their staffs contributed in any way to the delay in the investigation, but instead said that the initial case was too weak to stand alone in criminal court, especially given Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community. Former Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, former Vice President Gary Schultz and former President Graham Spanier are all awaiting trial on charges related to an alleged cover-up of Sandusky's crimes from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Prosecutors say that e-mails show the ex-Penn State officials knew about two reports of Sandusky abusing boys in the locker room showers on campus, but did not report the second one to police. That second incident was witnessed by former assistant coach Mike McQueary, and the case could go to court later this year, although it has continuously been delayed since the 2011 arrests.

Never one to skimp on the features, Samsung is adding some new usage models, enabled by the curved design. Dubbed ""Roll Effect,"" one technique makes use of the curve as a way to provide glanceable information by simply rolling one edge down when the Round is lying on its back.

Though not a member of the Note family, the Round does sport the Note 3's internal hardware, complete with a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, 3GB of RAM, and a 13MP camera. Other interface tweaks are reportedly enabled by the design and revolve around rotating the device to either side. Samsung is no stranger to motion control in its interfaces, but it's been met with varying success. The aesthetics match the Note 3, as well and it has the same plastic faux-leather back.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The number of people killed when militants stormed an election commission office in the Afghan capital Tuesday has risen to five, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry said. The victims were two police officers, two election commission workers and a provincial council candidate, said spokesman Sediq Sediqqi in Kabul. Eight others were injured, including four police officers and four election commission staff, Seddiqi said. After a five-hour gunbattle with Afghan security services, the five militants who carried out the attack were also killed, he said, bringing the violence to an end. Two militants blew themselves up as they entered the compound in the Darul Aman area, he said, while the remaining three went into the election commission building. ""The attackers would have killed a lot of innocent people, as there were 70 people working in that building, if the Afghan security forces hadn't engaged them in the armed fight from outside,"" Sediqqi said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes less than two weeks before Afghanistan holds presidential elections. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in an e-mail that the group's armed suicide attackers had managed to enter the election commission office after causing a large explosion. The election commission office is near the home of presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani, but his house did not appear to be the target of the attack. He was campaigning Tuesday in eastern Paktia province. The Taliban have vowed to use force to disrupt the April 5 presidential vote. The group also claimed an attack last week on the central Serena Hotel in which nine people died, some Afghans and some foreigners. Six people were also injured. Among those killed were Sardar Ahmad, a senior reporter for the Agence France-Presse news agency, his wife and two of his three young children. Official: Suicide bombers attack bank . In other violence Tuesday, at least five people were killed and 16 more injured when suicide bombers attacked a bank in Asadabad, the center of Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province. Abdul Ghani Musamim, spokesman for Kunar's provincial governor, told CNN three insurgents stormed a branch of Kabul Bank, where police and other governmental workers had gathered to receive their salaries. One detonated his explosives vest in front of the bank, while two others entered the building. One also blew himself up, and Afghan security forces shot the third attacker, Musamim said.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- It's the law of unintended consequences. Each time Americans spend billions to fortify the border by building fences or hiring Border Patrol agents, human traffickers raise their prices. Today, it costs about $3,000 to move a person across the border. It's less if you brave mountain lions and cross off the beaten path. It's more if you cross near civilization and absolutely positively have to be there overnight. If we bolster enforcement, the price could soar to $6,000. How do we win a battle against an opponent when, the more we spend to defeat him, the more we empower him to fight back? This riddle could stump anyone, but President Barack Obama seems to find it especially difficult. Raised in Hawaii and having lived in Chicago, Obama is a newbie to the border. He's made one memorable visit in 5Â½ as president and he must have felt as if he landed on another planet. Even on this week's fundraising swing through Texas, Obama couldn't find time to visit the border. That was his loss. When you travel from San Diego to Douglas, Arizona, to Columbus, New Mexico, to Brownsville, Texas, it's like you're visiting several worlds at once. Each stretch has its own script. It's a fascinating area -- unless you're not interested. Obama doesn't seem all that interested in the border, except when he can use it as a weapon. In May 2011, during a visit to El Paso, Texas, Obama mocked Republicans by saying they wanted to build a moat on the border and fill it with alligators. This week, in Dallas, more than 500 miles from the border, the president revealed his plans for tens of thousands of kids whose heads are filled with nightmares. Since October, spurred by violent youth gangs in their home countries and fake news reports of ""permisos"" for young people approved by Congress, about 52,000 children and teenagers from Central America have been apprehended on the border. ""Apprehended"" is too generous a word, since most of these people reportedly went up to Border Patrol agents with their arms raised and asked to be arrested. These uninvited guests are neither invading nor evading. They're surrendering. A lot of Texas Democrats probably thought it was a bad idea for Obama to snub the border, and one said so out loud. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, suggested that Obama's failure to survey firsthand the scene of the crisis evoked memories of President George W. Bush viewing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina from an airplane flying high overhead. This week, Cuellar said: ""I hope this doesn't become the Katrina moment for President Obama, saying that he doesn't need to come to the border. He should come down."" Now that U.S. officials have custody of the border kids, many of whom were -- according to media reports -- sexually assaulted or had their lives threatened, the hard part is deciding what to do with them. Do we really want to send them back? Are we that monstrous? Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion to deal with the crisis -- which includes $1.8 billion to help the Department of Health and Human Services provide better care for the children, and another $1.6 billion to help the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice expedite their removal. The remaining $300 million would go to the State Department to help Latin American governments counter the misinformation campaign. This budgetary whiplash -- where we show these kids some kindness before banishing them to the dark, desperate and dangerous places from which they escaped -- summarizes Obama's muddled approach to the immigration issue, where he tries to be both tough and compassionate and winds up confused. We need more border funding, but we could also use a lot more honestly and clarity in this debate. Money can't buy that. Liberals will have to swallow the fact that it was their foil, George W. Bush, who signed a law in 2008 giving safe haven to unaccompanied minors from Central America, and now it's their champion, Barack Obama, who seeks the power to override it. Meanwhile, conservatives are putting up a fight against the funding, but that won't last. They can't stand the idea of letting these kids stay here and grow up to become dependents and Democrats, and so they have to help Obama fund their return. For a while, there will be a tug-of-war in the GOP between the border hawks and budget hawks. But the former will win. That's a good outcome. It would also be good for Congress to pass immigration reform, and for Obama to ease up on deportations. For now, the administration needs the $3.7 billion, and it should get every penny. Congress should be generous, and the President should be diligent, but neither of them should be naive. On the border, enforcement dollars are no silver bullet. We can hire more Border Patrol agents, build more walls, and expedite deportations. But none of that will stop the downtrodden, desperate, and determined from seeking refuge in a country that is supposed to be in the business of offering it. And if Obama spent more time on the border, he'd already know that. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Ruben Navarrette: President Obama should visit the border in light of crisis .

"(CNN)  -- It seems that now someone called ""Barack Hussein Obama"" can be pulled aside and patted down merely because of his name. But while our president has the benefit of Air Force One, millions of us with a ""funny name"" (Muslim and otherwise) do not. Like me. I've consistently faced ""random"" selections for extra screening at the airport after I decided to wear the hijab, or Muslim head covering. I've been told to take my head scarf off or have my head probed while the passengers in front of me offered pitying smiles as they rushed to their flights. One time, the woman in front of me had a hairdo that could pose more of a security threat than any head scarf could. Muslim women wear the hijab as a symbol of modesty, to be judged not by their appearance. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. dreamed that people would be judged for ""the content of their character."" However, the Transportation Security Administration  is judging me and other Muslims by the way we look. The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women, and passengers can now expect a full-body pat-down, an appallingly invasive ""enhanced pat-down search  that could include the chest and groin, or a planned ""mind-scan""  that would track people's reaction to terrorist symbols. What's next, palm reading? At an airport with a full body scanner, I can have the image of my body displayed before a stranger -- virtual nudity.  Do they seriously have a blank check on our bodies? Of course I care about profiling partly because I'm affected. But does one have to face this issue to feel that it's wrong? After all, it is difficult to imagine ourselves in other people's shoes when we don't have to. It's hard for me too. Especially over the past month, I've been shocked at the comments about my faith, and the sometimes-prejudiced support for racial profiling. Radio host Mike Gallagher said, ""There should be a separate line to scrutinize anybody with the name Abdul or Ahmed or Mohammed."" Sorry Paula Abdul and Muhammad Ali, or anyone with the world's most common name, Muhammad. For people who aren't affected by racial profiling at airports, imagine this: The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving, which kills over 13,000 Americans every year. People who are not Muslim have to go through a Breathalyzer test before they can enter their vehicle. Muslims don't drink alcohol and are, therefore, exempt. Ridiculous? I agree. I know that what I am going through is just the tip of the iceberg of racial profiling in our country. Thirty-two million Americans report that they have been the victims of racial profiling. Racial profiling violates the U.S. Constitution, is ineffective and trickles down to the workplace, schools and elsewhere. You also run into problems when you justify profiling nearly one in every four people in the world. There are Muslims of every possible race, making profiling practically futile. Fareed Zakaria said  it best: ""When you're trying to find a needle in a haystack, adding hay does not help you."" Putting ethical and pragmatic reasons aside, it's hard to justify not caring. Even if racial profiling doesn't affect us, it affects our friends, family members, co-workers, doctors, television personalities --  the list goes on.   There are some people who don't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling. Therein lies the problem. According to the Pew Research Center, people who know Muslims are less likely to have negative views of them. Co-existence is a dismal possibility unless people go to the source to find out about Islam, not skewed Web sites. And Muslims, here's something to think about: If your knowledge of Islam came from common stereotypes, wouldn't you also be misinformed about the faith and its followers? The Quran says, ""[God has] made you into nations and tribes, so that you might come to know one another (49:13)."" So get to know your fellow Americans. There are some Americans who think Muslims are terrorists and some Muslims who think that other Americans are willfully ignorant. Neither group deserves such a label. Psychologist Henri Tajfel, who was a Holocaust survivor, explained  how we isolate ourselves into an ""in-group"" and facilitate discrimination of an ""out-group."" Religious profiling boxes Muslims into a category separate from Americans. We can't accept that distinction. Let's all think outside of the box. It's essential for U.S. security that airport screening be done. But we need to stop the inflation of procedures that make our society more afraid and less secure. The TSA needs to stop and evaluate methods that are more effective, less invasive, and don't discriminate based on religion or race. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nafees A. Syed.","Nafees Syed: Millions face extra screenings at airports for having ""funny names""

"(CNN) -- ""It takes a special person not to barf in the trash bag."" Welcome to the glamorous life of the sailing drone operator. Justice L Bentz, 26, lives in Antigua and shoots video profiles of some of the world's most expensive private yachts. Not a bad life. But it does come at the cost of wearing a black bag on your head. ""Sometimes, I fly the drone with my head in a trash bag so I don't get salt spray from the sea on my equipment,"" Bentz explains. ""I'm inside the bag, looking at my monitor and basically playing a video game -- watching that screen and securing myself so I don't get thrown around. We go out in the craziest conditions, and the Caribbean winds are really strong."" If Bentz isn't the most appealing sight, out on deck in a black bag, his footage is a different story. Drones have revolutionized what is possible with a camera, but rarely does the end product match this vista of superyachts and Caribbean seas. ""It's just a perspective you never really see,"" says Bentz. ""You can either charter a helicopter to come out for an hour for a thousand euros, or I can come out. ""How much do I cost? It really depends on what you want. In some cases, it's more. But I can get shots and angles a normal helicopter can't get. ""On the low end, I'm putting about $3,500 in the air. On the high end, up to $35,000. That would be an octocopter with a Canon 5D camera and a three-axis stabilized gimbal, with a two-man operation."" Bentz began flying drones as a hobby, then developed a passion for yachts when he spent two years working on board the 88m-long Maltese Falcon, one of the largest private yachts in the world. All of the technology he uses is custom-built, based on skills he picked up following in his brother's footsteps as a child. Older brother Tyler was one of the early pro video gamers, picking up awards -- and tens of thousands of dollars -- as a professional Quake 3 player at the turn of the millennium. He now works with Alan Karol, a 31-year-old Polish cinematographer, on larger projects -- of which there are many in a Caribbean racing season teeming with stunning yachts and proud owners. ""People spend this crazy amount of money to have everyone come and race in St Barts or Antigua,"" says Bentz, ""so they want something everyone can relate to and enjoy having."" Drones are not limited to the rarefied air of the superyacht club. Some of the world's leading sailing organizations have been experimenting with similar technology in the hope of transforming the way the sport is shown on TV. ""If we don't have a TV viewer-ready product, where does that put us in our livelihoods here? We've got to get on board,"" says Ben Remocker, who works with the 49er sailing class. Remocker has been at the forefront of plans to launch a new ""theater-style"" version of sailing, which sees races take place along short, compact courses -- making the action much easier to shoot, and simpler to show on TV. He argues that's vital for the sport's future, in a world where Olympic sports are judged on their ability to captivate a global audience. ""We've used drones quite a bit,"" says Remocker. ""One of the limitations is the range but, if we have a shorter course and only a 10-minute race, it's pretty doable now for a drone to stay in the air for that. ""We can film an entire race cheaply and simply, and you get great perspective."" Rune Neumann piloted the drones at this year's 49er class junior world championships. He argues this line of work is an art form, about more than simply putting a camera in the air. ""Everybody can film from above, but I want pictures from places where it's not normally possible to take them,"" says Neumann. ""To get the drone out in front of the boat by one or two meters, that's the difficult part. It's as difficult to get the shot as it is with a normal camera, there are so many variables. I'm not always happy about my work -- sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't. ""My advantage is I've been a pro sailor and sailed a lot of different boats. So 99 times out of 100, I know what the sailor is going to do. I can place my drone in the right spot because I can predict what will happen."" There is one obvious danger when you have thousands of dollars in equipment in mid-air, hovering above the ocean between fast-moving boats. ""I've been close sometimes,"" laughs Neumann, when asked how often drones have ditched in the sea or collided with vessels. ""I made an agreement with myself that if I lose one every year, it's OK. ""I've seen some of the other guys and they're hanging 30m away and don't want to get too close, because it's dangerous. But you have to get close, otherwise you can't get those pictures."" Remocker's recent efforts to convince sailing's main governing body, ISAF, to adopt his new, TV-friendly theater-style format have failed. At a conference in early November, the organization's top executives voted down the plans. That leaves him frustrated, but determined to convince the powers-that-be that this way of capturing his sport is the future. ""I think it's a hugely wasted opportunity. If it's not this, it's got to be something else. The way sailing's going, we're on a tough road,"" he says. Meanwhile, Bentz is pressing on with new tricks in a world he says is always changing. ""We're going to switch to remote-control airplanes,"" says Bentz. ""It's cheaper because a quadcopter has four motors, whereas an airplane only has one, and it can fly longer. Battery life is a big issue right now. With an airplane you can kill the motors, glide and hang out for a long time. ""Every couple weeks, there's stuff that's coming out. There's a really good community called DIY Drones and that's like my bible, pretty much. ""Custom-building is where it's at. I customize everything, it's all completely ripped apart and put back together. But there are off-the-shelf solutions. ""It depends on how perfect you want it to be.""","Antigua-based filmmaker shoots video profiles of superyachts using drones .

"(CNN) -- It's a popular question on social media: Why didn't passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 make mobile calls? Many recall that when United Flight 93 was hijacked on September 11, 2001, passengers were able to make two cell phone calls during the flight's final moments. Several other calls were made using airphones. If metadata was detected from cell phones on Flight 370, surely it would shed more light on the missing plane's flight path? The plane may have been flying too high or too fast to register with cell towers, according to telecoms experts, but careful analysis of the passengers' cell phone records will need to be completed to be certain. ""So far, we have not had any evidence of any telephone company of any member trying to contact,"" said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya at a news conference on Monday. ""But anyway, we are still checking. There are millions of records to process. It is being done as part of the investigation."" Was the plane too high? According to radar analysis, the plane is believed to have been flying as high as 45,000 feet and as low as 23,000 feet. But even this lower altitude is too high to register with mobile towers, experts say. ""If you look at the data in this case, the altitude at which the planes were traveling is too high,"" Vincent Lau, wireless communications specialist and professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, told CNN. ""Even on the ground it wouldn't be easy to pick up from that distance, and if you are flying it's even more difficult because at those angles you are only picking up what we call leakage from the side loops of the antennas, which are substantially weaker than the signals from the main loops of the base stations."" While business class seats on the aircraft are known to have been equipped with phones that worked via satellite, it would be easy to strike down that system from inside the plane, said Lau. Reports on Monday that the plane flew as low as 5,000 feet or less over mountainous terrain -- possibly in order to evade radar detection -- haven't been confirmed. ""In terms of the altitude it would have to be no higher than around 10,000 feet. Anything higher ... would be problematic,"" according to Bill Rojas, director of telecom research at IDC Asia Pacific. Unlike in urban areas, where cell phone antennae are typically pointed down toward the ground, cell towers in rural areas are up to 30-45 meters high and are often pointed at an angle meant to cover wider distances. So if you're up in the sky, you can receive the signal as well, Rojas said. ""If the airplane were flying over northern Malaysia or southern Thailand -- basically the rural area -- then it's very possible that a cell tower could register the signal from the phones, assuming they were on,"" said Rojas. ""Technically it is possible."" How do passenger jets change flight paths? Retrieving the data . If smartphones had been on and registered with a cell tower, the records would be relatively easy to retrieve. ""The registrations would typically be logged and depending on the operator they will be kept for hours, days or months,"" said Rojas. The telecom expert said that he'd place particular focus on the phone numbers of passengers from Thailand or Malaysia. ""I would assume that the authorities are checking with the mobile operators by comparing known passenger cell numbers to see if there were any pings or attempted or successful network registrations in northern Malaysia or southern Thailand or possibly even Indonesia,"" said Rojas. ""Any passenger who had roaming capabilities or a local Malaysian number -- if the plane were over Malaysia -- could in theory have been registered on the network if their phone was on. ""If a passenger does not have international roaming then their access would be rejected by the network and for a period of time that metadata might be stored by the network."" If the metadata records were erased automatically after a few days or a few hours, could they be retrieved? ""Each mobile operator will have its own guidelines for the duration of metadata storage and would not normally be made public for obvious national security and law enforcement reasons."" Rojas said as far as speed was concerned, the aircraft would need to have been flying at speeds below 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph) in order for passengers to make or receive calls. Passengers on high-speed trains in Japan and other countries can make calls via 3G networks at speeds of up to 240 kilometers per hour, but cell towers aren't able to register a signal beyond those speeds, Rojas said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney on Tuesday didn't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of President Barack Obama as dependent on welfare, and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign's message. ""This is a message I'm carrying day and day out and will carry over the coming months,"" Romney said on Fox News. ""This is a decision about the course of America, where we're going to head. We've seen the president's policies play out over the last four years."" Romney cited an opposition research video that Republicans began circulating on Tuesday afternoon that shows Obama speaking at Loyola University in 1998 about making government more effective. ""I think the trick is how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution, because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level, to make sure that everybody's got a shot,"" Obama is heard saying. 'Anatomy of a leak' of the Mitt Romney video . In his interview Tuesday, Romney framed Obama's remarks as an endorsement of redistributing private wealth, rather than on making sure government agencies were well supported. ""The president's view is one of larger government,"" Romney said. ""There's a tape that came out today where the president's saying he likes redistribution. I disagree. I think a society based upon a government centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role, redistributes money, that's the wrong course for America, that will not build a stronger America, or help people out of poverty."" Republicans have used the issue against Obama in the past. Romney's charged comments at a May fund-raising event were recorded with a hidden camera. The video shows him telling his donors that nearly half of Americans back Obama because they rely on government support. ""There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,"" Romney says in one clip first posted on Monday afternoon. ""There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing."" The fund-raiser video was the latest in what has been a shaky stretch for the Romney campaign following last month's political conventions and as the candidates hurtle toward three presidential debates next month. How candidates are preparing for the debates . Romney's remarks generated reaction from both sides of the political spectrum. The president suggested that Romney was ""writing off a big chunk of the country."" In an interview taped for the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" in New York, Obama said he didn't know what Romney was referring to in the video but was quick to add, ""One of the things I learned as president is you represent the entire country. If you want to be president, you have to work for everyone."" Obama was caught in a secret camera moment in 2008, when he was recorded at a private fund-raiser saying that some voters ""cling to their guns and religion."" At the time, Republicans quickly pounced on the comment and now Romney's running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan, uses the quote against the president on the campaign trail. Conservative commentator William Kristol wrote in his Weekly Standard column Tuesday that Romney's comments insulted some of his own supporters -- such as senior citizens on Medicare. However, other conservatives supported Romney for highlighting what they call the increasing dependency of American society on government programs. The latest flap also bled into other races, including two contests viewed as crucial for Republican hopes of taking control of the Senate. Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts and challenger Linda McMahon in Connecticut sought to distance themselves from Romney's remarks. ""As someone who grew up in tough circumstances, I know that being on public assistance is not a spot that anyone wants to be in. Too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs,"" Brown said. CNN Fact Check: Who really receives government assistance? But it wasn't an entire lost day for Romney. The latest Gallup daily tracking poll showed the post-convention bounce for Obama fading. The survey's seven-day rolling average shows 47% of registered voters supporting Obama and 46% supporting Romney, returning the race to narrow, pre-convention margins. A CNN poll taken the week after the Democratic National Convention earlier this month showed Obama with a six point advantage. Democrats pounce on Romney comments . A CNN-ORC poll conducted after the Democratic convention showed Obama with a 52%-46% lead over Romney after the two were tied at 48% in the same poll the previous week. And a Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed Obama continuing to lead Romney in Virginia, one of the vital battleground states of 2012. CNN's Polling Center . Another clip from the event, posted later Monday, shows Romney questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians. ""I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard,"" Romney is shown saying. ""One is the one which I've had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish."" Romney goes on to describe the obstacles he sees toward developing a so-called ""two-state solution"" that would establish an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. He cites problems of geography, including the proximity to Tel Aviv of a potential border between the two states, as preventing any real progression toward the two states. ""These are problems - these are very hard to solve, all right?"" Romney says on the tape. ""And I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.'"" In public, Romney has previously declared support for the two-state solution.

"(CNN) -- It's no secret that corporate branding is big business. But in the age of social media, staying ahead of consumer conversations is an increasing challenge. Enter Randy Browning and his company, Blab. It works on predictive social intelligence -- identifying and predicting emerging topics and conversations before they trend on the internet. The company's propriety technology, aptly named Blab Predicts, gathers 100 million conversations a day, across six social networks and 50,000 news sources in real time. Seattle, Washington-based Blab then classifies those conversations into topics. Companies pay for the predictive data related to each topic. CNN spoke with Browning to find out more about Blab and the merits of using predictive technology. CNN: Give us an example of Blab and how it works. Randy Browning: So let's say you're an airline and you're going into spring break, and you've got a lot of business riding on flights into Florida. All of a sudden, there's a shark attack in Florida. And the news is something that's going to move from the news world into the blog world and start resonating with your target audience. Blab is able to tell that airline this is just a news blip it's going to last 12 hours and it's going to not go further than that, or this is going to be a big issue and it's going to be pervasive 72 hours out. So we are really truly a crystal ball, saying here's how people are going to be dealing with this story that's hitting the press right now. CNN: Why do companies need to predict conversations on social media? RB: There's been a fundamental shift in the way that marketers need to engage customers and it comes down to this: customers are happy operating in real time. I learn, I'm engaged, I'm excited about living my life in real time. But businesses are scared to death to operate in real time! Because when you're spending millions of dollars in media, you don't want to be in a reactive state. You don't want to say, ""Hey, I'm caught off guard."" What we do for them is we shift time. We say here's what will be resonating with your target audience up to 72 hours in the future. CNN: You say that you're the first company to do this kind of predictive social intelligence. What are the challenges of being an early adopter of new technology? RB: Every start-up has issues it has to overcome. With Blab, it was my background in advertising. I had a vision but I wasn't a technologist. So I couldn't get in my garage and start building this. I didn't have venture capitalist connections. So it wasn't about calling up a friend and saying, fund us without the proof. That was the barrier I had to solve in building Blab, bring the right founding technology team together, the right angel investors together who would believe in a vision. CNN: What advice do you have for others who are starting a business? RB: My advice for entrepreneurs is if you're driven by a passion and an industry understanding, do your research around financing and investing. That is key, that's the success to getting a company off the ground. And keeping a company going.","Blab predicts topics before they start trending .

"London, England (CNN) -- Top British fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who dressed stars from Sarah Jessica Parker to Rihanna to Nicole Kidman in bold shapes and colors, was found dead in his home here Thursday, a spokesman for his company said. Though his reputation for controversy earned him the titles ""enfant terrible"" and ""the hooligan of English fashion,"" British Vogue Editor Alexandra Shulman said his work ""influenced a whole generation of designers. ""His brilliant imagination knew no bounds as he conjured up collection after collection of extraordinary designs. At one level he was a master of the fantastic, creating astounding fashions shows that mixed design, technology and performance, and on another he was a modern day genius whose gothic aesthetic was adopted by women the world over. His death is the hugest loss to anyone who knew him and for very many who didn't,"" said a statement from Shulman on the magazine's Web site. Asked about reports of McQueen's death, London's Metropolitan Police said a 40-year-old man was found dead at an address in Green Street, central London. They would not confirm his identity and said the death was not being treated as suspicious. ""At this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with Lee's family,"" said a statement issued from his company on behalf of the family of the designer, who was born Lee Alexander McQueen. ""Lee's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this."" According to a posting on McQueen's Twitter page, the designer's mother died February 2. ""i'm letting my followers know the my mother passed away yesterday,"" said an entry posted at 11:46 a.m. February 3. ""RIP mumxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,"" it added. One minute later, the message ""but life must go on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" was tweeted. The account has not been verified by Twitter as officially coming from McQueen, although the page does link to his Web site. His death comes just a week before the opening of the famed London Fashion Week. ""We are deeply shocked and saddened at the news of Alexander McQueen's untimely death,"" said a statement on the London Fashion Week Web site. ""He was a unique talent and one of the world's greatest designers. Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this sad time."" Although McQueen was not showing a collection at the London Fashion Week, he was to unveil his ready-to-wear collection at the Paris fashion shows in March. His 2010 spring/summer collection featured alien-inspired makeup and prints, according to Vogue, and ""was lauded as his best by the fashion press."" Dresses in that ready-to-wear line had exaggerated tiny waists and rounded hips, and models on the catwalk wore high club-like boots with them. Model Naomi Campbell said she was ""truly devastated"" by McQueen's death. ""His talent had no boundaries and he was an inspiration to everyone who worked with him and knew him,"" she said in a statement released by her publicist. ""This is a sad day to all who loved him around the world and my condolences are with his family. I will miss him so much, he will never be forgotten."" Designer Carolina Herrera called McQueen ""one of a -kind"" and said in a statement that he was ""one of the most talented designers of his generation. This is a big loss for the world."" A manager at the Alexander McQueen store in New York said the shop would be closed Thursday and Friday in light of the designer's death. Appearing on CNN Thursday before news of McQueen's death broke, singer Lady Gaga -- known for her ground-breaking fashion -- spoke of her admiration for the designer. ""He is so -- He is on his own planet. He doesn't need to respond to trends or what anyone else is doing,"" Lady Gaga said in an interview on ""American Morning. ""He is so pure and from within and I -- he just generally inspires me ... and I love when I can wear his clothes and sort of synthesize for my fans what it means to me, because I want them escape through his clothes the way that I do."" According to a biography of McQueen on Vogue's Web site, he was born in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver. He trained in London's Savile Row at a company that made suits for Prince Charles. One anecdote that helped cement his bad-boy image claimed that he had once embroidered a suit for the Prince of Wales with a profanity sewn into the lining.

"(CNN) -- Yale Historian Beverly Gage recently uncovered the first copy of an unredacted ""anonymous"" FBI letter sent to Martin Luther King Jr. telling him to kill himself. Click here to see the blacked out version of the FBI threat letter . There are dozens of such menacing memos and letters held in the U.S. archives that detail the FBI's systematic plot to ""neutralize"" the civil rights leader. In retrospect it may be horrifying to know that the government had such a plan, but historians say the plot did have an upside. FBI wiretaps have ""given us the most powerful and persuasive source of all for seeing how utterly selfless Martin Luther King was,"" as a civil rights leader, according to a leading civil rights scholar. ""You see him being intensely self-critical. King really and truly believed that he was there to be of service to others. This was not a man with any egomaniacal joy of being a famous person, or being a leader,"" said Pulitzer Prize-winning scholar David Garrow in a recent interview with CNN. Hoping to prove the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was under the influence of Communists, the FBI kept the civil rights leader under constant surveillance. See the FBI's actual discussion about the surveillance . See J. Edgar Hoover's order for the surveillance . See where the FBI put the microphones . The agency's hidden tape recorders turned up almost nothing about communism. But they did reveal embarrassing details about King's sex life -- details the FBI was able to use against him. The almost fanatical zeal with which the FBI pursued King is disclosed in tens of thousands of FBI memos from the 1960s. See the actual FBI document calling MLK an ""unprincipled opportunistic individual"" The FBI paper trail spells out in detail the government agency's concerted efforts to derail King's efforts on behalf of the civil rights movement. The FBI's interest in King intensified after the March on Washington in August 1963, when King delivered his ""I have a dream speech,"" which many historians consider the most important speech of the 20th century. After the speech, an FBI memo called King the ""most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country."" The bureau convened a meeting of department heads to ""explore how best to carry on our investigation [of King] to produce the desired results without embarrassment to the Bureau,"" which included ""a complete analysis of the avenues of approach aimed at neutralizing King as an effective Negro leader."" See the memo ordering the FBI to follow MLK throughout the country . The FBI began secretly tracking King's flights and watching his associates. In July 1963, a month before the March on Washington, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover filed a request with Attorney General Robert Kennedy to tap King's and his associates' phones and to bug their homes and offices. In September, Kennedy consented to the technical surveillance. Kennedy gave the FBI permission to break into King's office and home to install the bugs, as long as agents recognized the ""delicacy of this particular matter"" and didn't get caught installing them. Kennedy added a proviso -- he wanted to be personally informed of any pertinent information. While King did have associates who had been members of the Communist Party, by all accounts they severed those ties when they started working in the civil rights movement. What's more, the FBI bugs never picked up evidence that King himself was a Communist, or was interested in toeing the party line. But the long list of bugs in his hotel rooms picked up just enough about King's love life. See the FBI memo that calls him ""unfit to serve as a minister of the gospel"" See the FBI file cover about MLK's love life . A decision in a 1977 court case brought by Bernard Lee, one of King's associates, sealed the transcripts from those wiretaps until 2027. But King's associates confirm there were at least two cases in which FBI surveillance caught King in compromising circumstances. The first incident involved King at a party at the Willard Hotel in Washington. The FBI recorded the party and captured the sounds of a sexual encounter in the room afterwards. The second incident occurred during King's stay in a hotel in Los Angeles, California. There, agents heard another drunken gathering in which King told an off-color joke about the recently assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Hoover sent transcripts and excerpts of those recordings to the White House and to the attorney general. Hoover's contempt for King's private behavior is clear in the memos he kept in his personal files. His scrawl across the bottom of positive news stories about King's success dripped with loathing. On a story about King receiving the St. Francis peace medal from the Catholic Church, he wrote ""this is disgusting."" On the story ""King, Pope to Talk on Race,"" he scribbled ""astounding."" On a story about King's meeting with the pope, ""I am amazed that the Pope gave an audience to such a degenerate."" On a story about King being the heavy favorite to win the Nobel Prize, he wrote ""King could well qualify for the 'top alley cat' prize!"" See Hoover's thoughts on MLK's success, in his own handwriting . See Hoover's thoughts about MLK's interaction with the Pope, in his own handwriting . When King learned he would be the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, the FBI decided to take its harassment of King one step further, sending him an insulting and threatening note anonymously. A draft was found in the FBI files years later. In it the FBI wrote, ""You are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that."" The letter went on to say, ""The American public ... will know you for what you are -- an evil, abnormal beast,"" and ""Satan could not do more."" The letter's threat was ominous, if not specific: ""King you are done."" Some have theorized the intent of the letter was to drive King to commit suicide in order to avoid personal embarrassment. ""King, there is only one thing left for you to do,"" the letter concluded. ""You know what it is ... You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation."" With the exception of the wiretap transcripts that remain sealed under court order, many of the other memos were made public as part of high-profile congressional investigations into the FBI's harassment of King. A summary was put together during the course of these investigations. Other memos were released through a Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for National Security Studies in 1978. Another large batch was released through a 1979 FOIA request from David Garrow. While the memos depict a cold and calculating attempt by the government to personally embarrass King, the memos also create an ironic byproduct, according to Garrow. ""When you have a wiretap on someone you pick up all sorts of dreck. But in terms of the political history that ironically the FBI has created for us, it's a wonderful resource,"" Garrow said.","FBI memo called King the ""most dangerous ... effective Negro leader"" in U.S.

"(CNN) -- English-language broadcast networks won't carry President Obama's primetime address outlining his plans for executive action on deportations Thursday night, but the speech is set to make a big splash among his target audience — Hispanic Americans — as it cuts into one of the Hispanic community's biggest television events of the year, the Latin Grammys. The four major networks —ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC — currently have no plans broadcast it, most instead airing their fall finales — a choice one Hispanic advocate called a ""double standard"" aimed at President Obama. Related: Broadcast networks opt out of Obama immigration speech . Spanish-language network Univision plans to postpone the Latin Grammys to air the president's speech live, and will turn back to the star-studded awards show afterwards. Last year's show averaged around 4.6 million viewers, according to Univision, and was the number-two network that night- English or Spanish - among the coveted 18--34 demographic. Univision is also airing an additional special after the speech on its UniMas network, and will have special reports on Obama's move all weekend. Telemundo, too, is airing the speech live, instead of its originally scheduled telenovela. The network draws nearly 1.5 million average viewers during its primetime period. Both Univision and Telemundo will translate the speech live into Spanish. ""I don't think this is something we have any reference for,"" said Telemundo spokesman Camilo Pino, asked about the expected viewership of the speech Thursday night. ""But that's primetime for us, so it's big for us."" The White House declined to comment on the size of the Hispanic audience they expect to hit with the address. Some Republicans, however, have expressed skepticism over the scheduling. Related: What to watch for in Obama's immigration speech . Related: Immigration action is daring test of Obama's power .

"(CNN) -- King Tutankhamun's golden, mummified remains tell only a partial story of an ancient Egyptian boy king who died under mysterious circumstances. But a new ""virtual autopsy"" of King Tut's body, shown in an upcoming BBC One documentary, has given historians a clearer picture of the young man's life -- and death. Scientists used CT scans to recreate the first life-size image of Tutankhamun, one of the last rulers of the 18th Dynasty. King Tut ruled from 1333 B.C. until about 1323 B.C. Historians put his age at death at about 19. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2010 showed that King Tut may have died of malaria, possibly after suffering an infection in his broken leg. As seen in the new virtual autopsy photo, Tutankhamun's left foot was also severely deformed; the inward angle suggests that he had a clubfoot. Researchers believe the boy king had Kohler disease, a rare bone disorder. More than 100 walking sticks were found in Tut's tomb; historians originally thought they represented his power, but it's more likely Tut used them to get around. Albert Zink, head of the Institute for Mummies and Icemen in Italy, told The Independent it would have been impossible for the king to have died while riding a chariot, as has been previously thought. ""We concluded it would not be possible for him, especially with his partially clubbed foot, as he was unable to stand unaided."" King Tut replica tomb opens to public . Scientists believe genetics and inherited diseases played a role in Tut's bad health because of inbreeding. A genetic analysis of his family's mummies suggests that his parents were siblings. ""Tutankhamun: The Truth Uncovered"" will air Sunday on BBC. The Smithsonian will also be showing the documentary on November 2. CNN's Val Willingham contributed to this story.","Virtual autopsy of King Tut shows Egyptian ruler's body .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Daisy Cuevas suddenly became an international celebrity after touching on a hot topic during Michelle Obama's visit to her school last week. ""My mom says that Barack Obama is taking away everybody that doesn't have papers,"" the 7-year-old said to the first lady during her visit to the girl's school in Maryland. ""Yeah, well that's something that we have to work on, right? To make sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers, right? That's exactly right,"" Obama replied. ""But my mom doesn't have any,"" Daisy said. The episode transformed Daisy into a symbol of illegal immigration in the United States and prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to issue a statement dismissing rumors about an imminent deportation. ""We have not had an encounter with her, she is not in our custody and we have no indications that she is going through removal proceedings,"" the statement said. Thousands of miles away, in Peru's capital, unaware of the incident, was Yuly Cuevas, Daisy's 9-year-old sister. Yuly lives in Lima with her grandparents Genaro and Natividad since her mom left the country eight years ago in search of a better life. Read about Yuly on CNNMexico  Just as her sister is at the school in Maryland, Yuly is also a celebrity among her peers at the Lima school. ""They tell me: There is a girl exactly like you on television,"" says Yuly, who is two years older than Daisy but who bears a strong physical resemblance to her sibling. Yuly says it is ""incredible"" that her sister spoke with the first lady and she agrees with what she said because ""even though she hadn't talked, they would have realized anyway that my mom did not have papers."" Interestingly, her mother studied in the same public school Yuly attends but could not graduate because she became pregnant. When her daughter was 18 months old and she was expecting a second child, the mother made the tough decision to leave her child behind with family in Peru and immigrate to the United States to work as a maid for a Peruvian family. Initially, she had a companion visa to work legally in the country, but after it expired, she stayed in the U.S., according to her family. Genaro, the girls' grandfather, makes a living as a cabdriver. ""When the news broke, she [daughter Natalia] called me in tears, saying what trouble her daughter had caused her and wondering what she would do if she were deported back to Peru,"" Genaro says. He and his wife, Natividad, have mixed feelings; they fear their daughter will be deported, but they are also proud of the support that Daisy has gathered. Natividad, who sells fruit in her doorstep, recalls that when Daisy visited Lima last year to meet her Peruvian relatives they were impressed about how curious and talkative she was. ""She has been very smart ... That's why she asked that. Why did she think in that moment to speak about my daughter not having papers? Maybe because her mommy or daddy have talked about it,"" Natividad says. According to the grandparents, Daisy's parents have decided that if they are deported, they would bring her to Peru, even though she is a U.S. citizen, because they have no one to leave her with in the United States.","Daisy Cuevas makes news when she tells Michelle Obama her mom doesn't have papers .

"(CNN) -- A Florida town has banned people -- let's face it, young people -- from wearing saggy pants. A councilwoman for Ocala pushed for passage of the law, but the town's Mayor Kent Guinn may ultimately veto the fashion police. If the law goes into effect, it's unclear what measuring tools the Ocala Police Department would use to determine whether citizens' pants are within the 2-inch legal limit of a theoretical waistline. It's even more unclear how they will determine where the waistline actually lies on an individual. More likely than not, the Ocala PD will use the time-honored legal standard of ""I know it when I see it"" to eyeball the location of waistlines relative to pants lines. The not-too-subtle message is: Pull up your pants, because ""2 inches"" really just means ""too annoying."" Why do I suggest it singles out young people? I'm not ascribing any evil motive to law enforcement. Rather, as a society, we won't expect the police to ticket a plumber crouched over at work, accidentally revealing his tighty-whiteys. We'll expect them to target teens who show underwear as a fashion statement. So, the underlying legal question arises: Can the government even outlaw saggy pants in the first place? It's true that the First Amendment prohibits the government from interfering with our speech -- which is the right to receive and disseminate ideas and information. It's also true that speech need not be spoken or written. The First Amendment also protects ""expressive conduct."" The problem is that expressive conduct is hard to identify. Clothing can certainly be expressive. In 1971, the Supreme Court overturned one man's conviction for wearing a jacket that said ""F**k the Draft"" -- but that's not really expressive conduct, because the written words constituted speech. Expressive conduct conveys an idea without words. Wearing a black armband to school to protest a war is an example of expressive conduct, and the Supreme Court has said doing so is protected speech. Indeed, even offensive clothing, like Nazi uniforms, has been deemed expressive conduct, and the reviled Klansman robe has garnered First Amendment protections. Clothing can be communicative, but courts require an identifiable, specific message to apply First Amendment protection. Saggy pants proponents would have to show that (1) displaying your underwear conveys an identifiable message (2) that the rest of us on the street can understand as an identifiable message. Well, doesn't having one's pants on the ground convey ideas about comfort, personal style, and individuality? Certainly, but those are not specific enough ""messages"" for the courts. When you think about it, all clothing conveys those ideas. In the '80s, many of us were conveying strong ideas about acid wash jeans and shoulder pads, and in the '90s, our collective message was apparently flannel and work boots. But that's just style -- or lack thereof -- and it's not enough of a message to be protected speech. During the 2013 trial of George Zimmerman, many took to wearing hooded sweatshirts to show support for Trayvon Martin, who was killed by Zimmerman while wearing a hoodie. Wearing hoodies satisfies the first prong of having a particularized message, but probably fails the second. Hoodies are so popular that a court might conclude the message of solidarity is indistinguishable on the street from, say, someone wearing a hoodie to the gym. In that sense, hoodies would fail the second test, because they are not understood as speech by others. The results feel confusing: A court would likely conclude that the clothing of a Klansman or a neo-Nazi conveys a particularized message -- an unpopular, divisive, angry message. That would entitle it to constitutional protection. But saggy pants? The message is too amorphous, so it cannot be protected speech. And if it's not protected speech, the First Amendment will not prevent towns from outlawing those droopy drawers. Few of us like looking at people's skivvies when their jeans hang off them on the subway, but how offensive is it, really? Our culture's mores about clothing are fundamentally illogical. We attempt to outlaw this display of the top half of someone's boxers, but have no laws for that old guy at the pool -- usually the same guy glistening with suntan oil -- who prances around in nothing but a Speedo all summer. What's with that guy, anyway? The point is that culturally, we accept nearly complete nudity in one context, but try to regulate mostly clothed conduct in another. There really is no logic to our ideas about clothing. That helps to explain horrible fashion choices from decade to decade, but does little to logically justify clothing regulations. As much as we feel free to express ourselves with apparel, we likely have less freedom of expression than we imagined. And at least in one town in Florida, no matter how trendy your gear may be, it looks like it's time to pull up the pants.","Danny Cevallos: Florida town passed legislation to ban sagging pants .

"(CNN) -- Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation one year ago was an act which symbolized the frustration and desperation of millions in the Arab world, setting into motion a series of revolutions across the Middle East and North Africa. His was a cry for dignity, justice, and opportunity, which continues to be heard around a region undergoing tumultuous change. In today's Middle East, people matter. Many are now engaged in what could be a life-long struggle to fight long-standing grievances and take greater control of their lives. This process must involve the creation of new democratic political systems, which ensure greater accountability of leaders, and level the playing field of opportunity for all, not just a select few. It has been a remarkable year. Three dictators have been toppled and one has transferred power to a deputy. Nonetheless, analysts and policy-makers continue to speak about the slow pace of change in the region and warn of the onset of an ""Arab Winter."" Such distinctions -- spring and winter -- are misleading. Many seasons will come and go in the transformative years that lie ahead for the Arab world. Revolutions take time to settle. The transformation of societies takes even longer. The colored revolutions of Eastern Europe, two decades on, are still developing. It took centuries for democratic systems to be refined in Europe. We cannot expect democracy in the Middle East to be solidified in only one year. Still, across the region, there is cause for concern. Egypt's transition to civilian rule carries major worries, even as Egyptians continue to go to the polls. The concern remains that the ruling military council will relinquish power only under heavy pressure; and Egypt's economy and confidence are in nosedive as the populace awaits civil rule. Syrians meanwhile face a regime intent on killing and torturing its citizens to end their uprising. All this as a largely impotent international community argues over how to stop the increasing violence. In Yemen, many are not convinced by a regionally brokered transition deal, which allows Saleh and his family immunity from prosecution as well as continued political influence. Bahrain continues to reel from the absence of a genuine national dialogue between its rulers and the underrepresented and relatively impoverished majority Shia community. Libya's revolutionaries now face the immediate challenge of building a state from scratch, based on the rule of law and democratic principles. To do so, they are learning, they will first have to put down their guns. Link: Tunisia swears in new president . While events elsewhere in the region have been less dramatic, the desire for change is still palpable. Under popular pressure, Morocco now has an elected prime minister under a revised constitution; Jordan's king has been forced to change the government twice this year; Oman's Sultan has devolved some powers to his consultative council. Only time will tell if people accept these changes as going far enough to meet their rising expectations. As the respected Arab commentator Rami Khouri somewhat prophetically predicted last year, we are witnessing the ""birth of Arab politics."" For the first time, people have a voice and the opportunity to launch new parties and institutions, independent of the autocratic rulers and external interference that long stifled political development. Civil society organizations, the ""software"" of any democratic system, have mushroomed in transitional states such as Egypt and Tunisia. A truly democratic and accountable political culture is finally developing in the region. Undoubtedly, the biggest political winners over the past year have been Islamist parties, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood movement. As real Arab politics emerges, this is not surprising. One should accept that today, the center of gravity of the region's societies' is religiously pious, socially conservative, and economically liberal. The rise of the Brotherhood and the more fundamentalist Salafi parties is a natural legacy of years of political exclusion, and economic corruption and stagnation. As the West looks on, it should be remembered that a faith-inspired vision led to the establishment of the American state itself. The challenge for the Brotherhood will be to maintain their popularity and their discipline while meeting the demands of not just their supporters but of an entire nation. The wiser leaders among them may be realizing that winning at the ballot box, even exercising majority rule, does not entitle them to ignore their responsibilities to the minorities that may fear them. Mohammad Bouzazi's cry for the rights and responsibilities of all citizens provides a lesson that these new political actors and leaders would do well to heed. In this changed environment, international actors need to tread wisely. As regional and international participants in a recent Brookings seminar in Doha concluded, Western governments must embrace a wholesale reassessment of their foreign policies towards the region. This reassessment should reflect a ""paradigm shift"" towards genuinely inclusive and equal partnerships with the Middle East that do not seek to dictate democratic outcomes. Above all, people speaking for the first time must not be met with deaf ears. Western countries' engagement with newly emerging Islamist actors, then, should be based on the principles of mutual respect and establishing two-way communication. Link: Many similarities in Arab Spring, European chaos . Such a dialogue should also acknowledge the sorry legacy of past regimes that were considered key allies. Under the reign of such rulers, there was a mass campaign of victimization, torture, and marginalization against liberals and Islamists alike who posed a threat. While affected societies have established their own judicial processes to take their former leaders to task, it is also time for Western countries to acknowledge the pain and dislocation of those who suffered at the hands of these regimes. As certain dictators in the region continue to hound their people, the international community must not make the same mistakes again. When acts of brutality -- tantamount even to crimes against humanity -- are being perpetrated, as in Syria, the international community must act based on its responsibility to protect innocent civilians, and face down this evil. Ultimately, the region needs to find its own state-builders and create new states that reflect the will of their people. What has become clear over the past year is that the people of the Middle East and North Africa are in no mood to give up their search for justice and dignity. It is fitting that one-year after Bouzaizi's desperate act, Tunisia will see the election and appointment of a president and prime minister -- one liberal, the other Islamist - both human rights activists imprisoned by the previous regime. Mohammed Bouazizi's true legacy may be the birth of a new democratic Tunisia where a wholly unique model of governance is emerging -- one in which Islamists and secularists govern and where political activists who have been imprisoned for their views now sit in government. The new Tunisia, not Turkey, Eastern Europe, or even Indonesia, will be the real model for the newly emerging Arab world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Salman Shaikh.","Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi self-immolated catalyzing a series of revolutions across Middle East and North Africa .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson and Diana Ross shared a bond that he apparently thought would last long after his death. Michael Jackson and Diana Ross at the 1981 American Music Awards. In his will Jackson wanted Ross -- who took him under her wing and who he called one of his dearest friends -- to take care of his children if his mother, Katherine Jackson, was not alive or was unable to do so. While the public may have been surprised at Jackson's decision, the two have a long history together. ""I think it's very interesting,"" Jermaine Jackson, Michael's brother told CNN's Larry King on Thursday. ""There's been a long, close relationship with Michael and Diana for many, many years. And I think it's great.""  Watch Jermaine Jackson on Michael's death » . The star of the Supremes met Michael Jackson when he was a 9-year-old sensation after she saw him perform with his family at the Apollo Theater. She helped catapult The Jackson 5 to stardom when her name was used to release their debut album, ""Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5."" After The Jackson 5's debut album success, the pair appeared together in a variety of sketches, sang at each other's concerts, performed at the Hollywood Palace together, and starred in ""The Wiz"" together with her as Dorothy to his Scarecrow. ""You see skits from variety shows where they are doing Frank Sinatra songs and Casablanca,"" Emil Wilbekin, managing editor of Essence.com and a founding member of Vibe magazine under Quincy Jones, told CNN. ""Although she was older than Michael, they had a real connection and that connection, I think, and that friendship really moved throughout his career."" In a 1982 interview for the Ebony Jet Showcase, Jackson said he considered Ross, now 65 years old, to be one of his true personal friends.  Watch how Jackson, Ross became close » . ""Diana Ross, very dear friend Diana Ross,"" he said when asked who he considered to be his closest friends. ""She is the kind of person, I can tell her anything, the most private of secrets. And she tells me her secrets as well."" That friendship was something of a motherly love on Ross' part and an idolization from Jackson, according to Wilbekin. And the bond they formed could explain why Jackson chose her to care for his kids, if his mother could not, Wilbekin said. Ross raised five children of her own who grew up to become extremely ""normal and successful children of a superstar,"" Wilbekin said. ""The other thing interesting about Diana and Michael's relationship: They both were a part of groups, they both ended up eclipsing their groups, so they had a shared experience that nobody else could really realize,"" he said. ""I think in that they had a very special bond."" The two also were the subject of gossip regarding the nature of their relationship, fueled by Jackson's song ""Dirty Diana."" But Jackson said the hit was about groupies. Jackson also starred in ""Diana,"" produced in 1981 by Diana Ross Productions -- her first TV special not produced by Motown Productions. In that show, Ross introduced Jackson as ""the talent,"" and ""my baby Michael Jackson"" before the two sang ""Ease on Down the Road,"" and other songs. But it was their banter that received most of the attention. ""I knew you were going to be a star, I really did,"" Ross said to Jackson during the special. ""What I didn't know, what I didn't know, is that you were going to get so sexy."" Jackson, in turn, said he always knew Ross would be sexy, and then motioned for the crowd when he asked, ""Don't you guys think she's sexy?"" They were so close that when he first underwent plastic surgery, some speculated he was trying to look like his mentor. Regardless of that speculation, it's clear the two shared a connection deep enough that Jackson trusted her with his children in the event of his death. ""The point that nobody has brought up -- Diana Ross happens to be a phenomenal mother. [Her kids are] kind of balanced, normal celebrity kids. And I think that's the part people aren't really looking at,"" Wilbekin said. While some people may have been surprised another Jackson family member didn't follow Katherine Jackson in the will, Wilbekin said he believes that by picking Diana Ross, ""he named someone who was super-responsible."" And because Jackson's children, have been growing up in the limelight because of their father, he may have wanted someone familiar with that, Wilbekin said. ""That just shows Michael's foresight, his emotional wisdom and his ultimate love for his family and protecting them,"" he said. ""These are not normal kids, they did not live a normal life, and she totally completely understands that."" Ross has not spoken about Jackson's death outside of a statement released on her behalf. ""I can't stop crying, this is too sudden and shocking,"" Ross says in the statement. ""I am unable to imagine this. My heart is hurting. I am in prayer for his kids and the family.""","Michael Jackson, Diana Ross met when he was 9 years old .

That was the punishment meted out by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on Tuesday, after Moroccan officials refused to host the Nations Cup in January because they fear the spread of Ebola. After stripping Morocco of the right to stage the competition, CAF says it is now studying the applications of an unspecified number of countries prior to announcing a new host. ""These applications are currently under review and the Executive Committee will finalize the selection of the successful national association shortly,"" African football's ruling body said in a statement. Ghana international Asamoah Gyan is one prominent African footballer to support the decision to maintain the scheduled competition dates of 17 January to 8 February. ""I think the African Cup should proceed, it has to be played whether in Morocco or anywhere,"" he said on his official Twitter page. ""I heard stories about canceling the tournament and I don't think it is a good thing. We should just support the countries that have been affected by the disease and move on."" Despite knowing where the Nations Cup will be held in nine years' time (Guinea), African football fans still don't know where the tournament will take place in just over nine weeks. Speculation is feverish as to which country might step in. After Morocco requested its postponement in October, CAF contacted several countries to see if they would consider hosting should the North Africans pull out. Of those countries, 2013 hosts South Africa have been the most adamant in saying they do not want the competition. Ghana was also approached but public reaction in the West African nation against hosting the tournament was strong -- and this may be a problem for whichever country eventually stages the finals. With CAF rules stating that only the host nation automatically qualifies for the tournament, the Atlas Lions' elimination was effectively landed when Morocco decided against hosting the tournament on Saturday. A letter from Sports Minister Mohamed Ouzzine informed CAF that Morocco was maintaining the stance it adopted last month, when it asked for a postponement of at least six months to allow sufficient time to contain the Ebola outbreak. CAF's decision to disqualify Morocco comes on the day that the team began preparations for Thursday's match against Benin, which had been intended as a Nations Cup warm-up. 'Deadly Pandemic' The Ebola virus has so far ravaged three West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- with 4,960 reported deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). On November 3, CAF rejected the Moroccan request for a variety of reasons -- the most prominent of which was that the WHO was only recommending the cancellation of large gatherings in those countries most affected by the outbreak. Morocco has been untainted by the virus so far. It said its call for a postponement was ""dictated by health reasons of the most dangerous kind, linked to the serious risk of the spread of the deadly Ebola pandemic."" The government believed thousands of traveling fans from West Africa posed a potential health hazard, although CAF countered by saying it believed less than a thousand would travel from that region. In its statement on Tuesday, it also hinted at likely sanctions for Moroccan authorities. CAF's Nations Cup rules suggest that the Moroccans may be in line for a $50,000 fine, while there is also the possibility of a further sanction for the team given the late withdrawal. Morocco will still host next month's Club World Cup, saying that few visitors from sub-Saharan Africa visited the North African nation when it first hosted the FIFA event last year. The Nations Cup draw, which had been scheduled for 26 November in the Moroccan capital Rabat, may now also move, said CAF. The body also added that the forthcoming qualifiers will not change, with the 15 qualifiers set to be determined on November 19. Most of the interest though will be on the potential sixteenth team in the finals.","Morocco disqualified from Africa Cup of Nations for refusal to host January's finals .

"(CNN) -- In travels this week -- to Boston, Chicago, New York -- friends and strangers alike have said the same thing: They are turned off and tuned out of the sequestration mess in Washington. To a person, they are sick of the antics of those to whom they have entrusted enormous power. In times past, a president has usually risen to the demands of leadership when a Congress has stubbornly resisted tough choices, such as the upcoming mandatory budget cuts that are called sequestration. That's what Lyndon Johnson did in persuading key Republicans to help pass the civil rights bills of 1964 and 1965. And that's what Bill Clinton did in working with a Republican House led by Newt Gingrich. People forget how hostile House Republicans were to Clinton -- hell, they impeached him -- but he nonetheless worked with them to pass four straight balanced budgets and an overhaul of welfare. Obama signs order activating ""dumb"" budget cuts . In other times, Congress has displayed serious leadership when a president has lost his way. That's what Congress did to curtail overseas military ventures after two presidents in a row got us into a quagmire in Vietnam. And that's what top congressmen like Sam Ervin and Howard Baker did when Richard Nixon went off the tracks in Watergate. But today, we have a rare moment when both Congress and the president are retreating from their responsibilities. It's hard to recall a time when we were so leaderless. One of the foremost duties of Congress is to pass a budget: It has failed for four straight years. Republicans, especially in the House, have continually refused to meet the White House halfway. Meanwhile, a president who promised to be a solution has become part of the problem. Ever since his re-election, Barack Obama has seemed more intent on campaigning than governing. A new Washington Post/Pew poll gives some measure of how the public is turning away. Only one in four Americans is following news of the sequester. And as Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote in Tuesday's Post, ""Not only are most people paying very little attention to the sequester, they also have only the faintest sense of what it would do. Fewer than one in five, or 18%, in the Post-Pew poll say they understand 'very well' what would happen if the sequester went into effect."" Cillizza and Blake argue that far more people paid attention to the fiscal cliff because their taxes might go up. Fair enough, but in my conversations, people were mostly fed up with the soap opera. What to do? Last weekend in Italy, voters were so disgusted with their politicians that an upstart political movement led by a political comedian won the most votes of any single party. Is it time to draft Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert? Perhaps, but in the meantime, the president and the Congress have one solemn and urgent responsibility: Having created this mess, they must -- stress must -- work together to minimize the disruptions and hardships that they are promising will happen. It is insane that a series of cuts that represent only 2.5% of all federal spending and 5% of the budgets of most federal agencies will be allowed -- according to the administration -- to create havoc with airplane flights, bring grinding slowdowns to meat inspections, force an aircraft carrier to stay in port ... the litany goes on. To anyone who has been through numerous short shutdowns of government in the past, this sounds suspiciously like the ""Washington Monument syndrome"": the tendency of federal bureaucrats faced with budget cuts to shut down the most visible services first, causing screams and forcing the cuts to be rescinded. Administration spokesmen say their hands are tied by the sequestration law because it requires even, across-the-board cuts. But if that is the case, change the law. Everyone knows it is a stupid piece of legislation. Fortunately, some senators on both sides of the aisle -- Republican Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democrat Barbara Mikuski of Maryland among them -- are working on legislation that would give the administration flexibility in making the cuts so that disruptions can be kept as small as possible. So far, the White House and Majority Leader Harry Reid are saying no. The White House has made the argument that minimizing the effects would make people too complacent about what comes from reducing spending. In reality, what they are trying to do is to make Republicans look so bad that they will cave in. This is a terrible way to govern: Washington politicians should not turn citizens into suffering pawns in order to get their way. Meanwhile, Republicans like John McCain are objecting that such a correction to the sequestration law would cede too much power to the president. The concern about excessive power is legitimate, but surely a way can be found so that the White House and Congress would share power and any other arrangements be strictly limited in time. Perhaps, if wisdom once again rears its head, this mess will be so awful the president and Congress will get back to the bargaining table and come up with a long-term solution. But in the meantime, Obama and Congress have a duty to lead -- and that means to pass a bill that will minimize disruption and pain. By the way, speaking of comedians as politicians, Al Franken has turned out to be a pretty darn good senator. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen says everyone he talks to is turned off by mandatory budget cut mess .
Gergen: We are leaderless; neither Congress nor president is taking responsibility .
Most Americans have no idea of what ""sequestration"" means or what it will do, he says .
Gergen: All sides are using this as a political scare tactic; they have a duty to pass a bill ."
"Washington (CNN) -- A deeply divided Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that criminal defendants who receive inadequate legal advice on pretrial plea bargains can have their sentences overturned, equating that with an unconstitutional and ineffective assistance of counsel. The separate 5-4 decisions in a pair of cases from Michigan and Missouri will have a huge, immediate impact on the 97% of federal convictions and 94% of state convictions that stem from guilty pleas. ""This court now holds that, as a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy, joining four of his more liberal colleagues. ""When the defense counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the Constitution requires."" In a rare oral dissent delivered from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia called the majority decision ""absurd"" and ""unheard-of."" In unusual detail, the opinion lays out specific guidelines to defense counsel, saying they must relay plea bargain offers from the prosecution, regardless whether the lawyer believes them to be proper. The case from Michigan involved Blaine Lafler, convicted of assault with intent to murder and other charges, after shooting and seriously wounding a woman. The state twice offered to dismiss two of the charges, and recommended a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea. Lafler claims he rejected the offers after his lawyer convinced him the prosecution could not prove the most serious charge. The defendant was convicted and received 185 to 360 months behind bars. In Missouri, Galin Frye was charged with driving on a revoked license. Three previous convictions on the same charge meant he could be sentenced to up to four years in prison. Court records shows he was not told about two pretrial plea bargain offers that would have reduced his jail time. A week before his preliminary court hearing, the man was again arrested on the same offense. With no deal on the table, he subsequently pleaded guilty and received three years imprisonment. ""There appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would have accepted the prosecutor's original offer of a plea bargain if the offer had been communicated to him,"" Kennedy said in his ruling, ""because he pleaded guilty (later) to a more serious charge, with no promise of a sentencing recommendation from the prosecution."" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan supported Kennedy, who again proved to be the ""swing"" vote for the majority. Both cases were sent back to lower courts to sort out the new sentencing guidelines. In his dissent, Scalia warned criminal defendants will now flood courts with new claims of bad legal representation. ""The court today embraces the sporting chance theory of criminal law, in which the state functions like a conscientious casino operator, giving each player a fair chance to beat the house, that is, serve less time than the law says he deserves,"" he said. ""And when a player is excluded from the tables, his constitutional rights have been violated."" He added, ""In today's cases, the court's zeal to bring perfection to everything requires the reversal of perfectly valid, eminently just convictions,"" Scalia said. ""It is not wise; it is not right."" Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined all or part of the dissent. The cases are Lafler v. Cooper (10-209) and Missouri v. Frye (10-444).","Defense attorneys have a duty to give good advice on plea deals, the court rules .
They must do so to provide ""the effective assistance the Constitution requires""
In dissent, Justice Scalia calls the decision ""absurd"" and ""unheard-of"""

"(CNN) -- Officials on Monday lifted evacuation orders that had sent hundreds of residents fleeing parts of Amarillo, Texas, as two wildfires approached Sunday. In all, 12 homes were destroyed, they said. The Pitt Road Fire, on Amarillo's south side, destroyed five homes and eight outbuildings and damaged four other homes, but was 100% contained Monday, said April Phillips with the Texas Forest Service. She estimated the fire burned 150 to 200 acres. The Stone Ridge Fire, in the north, destroyed seven homes and 11 outbuildings and scorched 1,243 acres, but was fully contained Monday evening, said Tim Evans, a public information officer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Three people suffered minor injuries, he said. ""We still have quite a few hotspots,"" he said. ""But we do have the fire perimeter surrounded."" Mother Nature was not helping the firefighters. ""We're under a red-flag warning today,"" said Phillips, adding that there was no rain in sight. ""It's been, like, months"" since the area has had ""any significant rain,"" she said. The blaze began Sunday afternoon amid what police called ""very dry conditions, with zero chance of rain."" The current wildfire season is one of the worst in Texas history. Since it began on November 15, the state has seen 10,896 fires scorch 2.8 million acres, destroying 460 homes in the process, Evans said. CNN's Greg Morrison and Jessica Jordan contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 2.8 million acres have been burned this fire season in Texas .

"(Parenting.com) -- Parenting.com spoke with Olympic swimmer Cullen Jones about his journey from nearly drowning to winning the Olympic gold. Here, he talks about giving back to the community by promoting water safety for all with the Make a Splash Initiative. How did you get involved with the Make a Splash Initiative, and why do you think it's so important?I got involved with the Make a Splash Initiative in 2008 right after winning the Olympic Gold medal. USA Swimming Foundation and Phillips 66 came and approached me and showed me the drowning statistics. After reading that 70% of African Americans don't know how to swim and 60% of Hispanics don't know how to swim, that's when it became very real to me. This initiative has been a very, very big part of my life in the past five years. We are seeing the numbers changing, so it's been a success. Parenting.com: Parenting advice from Olympic moms and dads . What do you think is the cause behind these numbers? Why is being able to swim so uncommon in African American and Latino communities?Well, the University of Memphis put out a study in 2010, and you see three major factors: number one being fear, number two being parental backing and number three being physical appearance. So with knowing that information, the number one thing that we have seen when it comes to parents and children, fear trumps everything... so we're really trying to fight an uphill battle. And I understand completely, as a five-year-old, I almost drowned. We are seeing that children themselves are either afraid because of an instance where they have had a bad experience or parents projecting their fears. Parenting.com: Heathrow's perks for families . Do you remember what your first swimming lesson was like?I was a little nervous, obviously because I had almost drowned a couple weeks prior. So I understand where a lot of kids are coming from. I enjoy traveling all over the U.S. and having kids that are so nervous and kind of getting them to understand and relax around the water. It has been a pleasure and very humbling for me as an Olympic athlete to kind of give back and see kids that remind me of myself at that age. Parenting.com: Shocking pool safety hazard . What is a good age for a child to learn how to swim? What is a good age to enroll them in swim lessons?You know, it is never too early, and it is never too late to get kids involved in swim lessons. I taught, at the age of 15, a mommy and me class with newborns. Parents had their babies in the water, splashing around and just getting them comfortable. So there is never really an age, as long as you have someone present, someone responsible there, to teach. Parenting.com: Olympic champion summer Sanders talks life after the gold medal . What are the top three things parents need to remember about swimming now that pools are opening around the country? What kind of advice can parents give to their children should they happen to find themselves in a pool without knowing how to swim?The number one thing would be definitely to get your kids water safe, get them some lessons, and teach your children how to swim. There is no other remedy for drowning than swim lessons, and if you give your children that, you are giving them the tools to be safe. The second thing is tell your children never to swim alone. I myself, as an Olympic gold medalist, I even have lifeguards that watch over me when I am training. So all kids should have someone that is there, a responsible adult, that is watching out for them as they play, as they swim or as they train for the junior Olympics, whatever your next step may be. And the last thing is definitely to obey the pool rules. Every pool has rules like no horseplay. With the Make a Splash Initiative, I travel all over the U.S. The biggest thing I want to tell kids not only is to be safe around the water, but also is to have fun.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Fighter jets and other combat aircraft used Taiwan's main highway as a makeshift airstrip Tuesday as part of a dawn drill that simulated an attack from China. Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) said the aircraft practiced emergency take-offs and landings near the city of Chiayi, on a section of the main north-south route that runs along the island's west coast. Ground crews practiced refueling and re-loading ammunition, CNA said. The drill is part of Taiwan's annual ""Han Kuang"" exercises that last five days and test the military's combat readiness in the event of an attack from China, said J. Michael Cole, a correspondent for IHS Jane's Defense Weekly and a fellow of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham in the UK. ""Taiwan is a small place with a limited number of air bases,"" he told CNN. ""China has 1,500 to 1,600 short and mid-range missiles targeted at Taiwan and it's understood that the first phase of a missile attack would target these air bases so they would have to find an alternative."" The aircraft involved included an F-16 A/B jet fighter, a Mirage 2000-5 and an Indigenous Defensive Fighter, as well as an E-2K airborne early warning aircraft, a CH-47 Chinook helicopter, an OH-58D reconnaissance helicopter and two AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters, CNA reported. The military exercises also involve live-fire maritime drills on Taiwan's east coast and near the island of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait. Breakaway province . Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. Relations between the two sides have improved since the Kuomintang party came to power in Taiwan's 2008 election. In February, Taiwan and China held their highest level talks for more than six decades -- the first government-to-government contact since the pair's acrimonious split in 1949 amid civil war. Cole said that while relations have improved in some respects, with more exchanges in terms of tourism, investment and education, the underlying cause of the conflict has yet to be resolved. ""People here see themselves as Taiwanese but at some point Beijing will want them to move nearer (to reunification) and the military option remains on the table. In my view, it's a distant probability but it remains an option.""

"(CNN) -- The man behind a famous star has passed away. Jack Eskridge designed the Dallas Cowboys' team logo after joining the team in 1959, a year before its first season kicked off. His blue star with the white highlight graces every Cowboy's helmet to this day. Eskridge was 89 when he died near his home at a hospital outside Kansas City this week, the Dallas Cowboys' website reported Friday. He wasn't from the Lone Star State, though he liked Texas enough to live there twice in his life for a total of 23 years -- the first time to work for the Cowboys, the second to teach school, according to his obituary. He was once a professional basketball -- not football -- player. Eskridge played for the Chicago Stags and the Indianapolis Jets before joining the University of Kansas as assistant coach, where he helped recruit basketball superstar Wilt Chamberlain, his obit said. Iconic Cowboys coach Tom Landry hired him as an equipment manager. When the team needed a logo, Eskridge made one out of the lone star. It has endured. Eskridge passed away Monday.

"Little Rock, Arkansas (CNN) -- A cache of largely unvarnished, newly released interviews offer a glimpse into Clinton administration's triumphs and tribulations. Everyone from former aides like Leon Panetta and Bruce Reed to world leaders like Vaclav Havel, the former President of the Czech Republic, and Kim Dae-jung, the former president of South Korea, were interviewed for the project. Released Friday by the University of Virginia's Miller Center, which conducted the interviews after President Bill Clinton left office, the transcripts will be a treasure trove both to historians and opposition researchers, whose eyes will be on Hillary Clinton's presumed 2016 presidential run. The Miller Center is a nonpartisan affiliate of UVA that specializes in presidential scholarship, public policy and political history, according to its website. The release of the interviews was heralded and discussed on Friday during a celebration for the 10th anniversary of the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. Here are eight interesting takeaways from a myriad of recollections: . 1.) Pardoning Marc Rich was ""the single most inexplicable, devastating thing"" Clinton did -- former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor . On his final day in office, Clinton decided to pardon Rich, a commodities trader who was indicted in 1983 for tax evasion, false statements, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran, and left the country. Clinton's decision launched a number of congressional inquiries, and Kantor told the Miller Center he can't explain it. ""It is so easy not to have done it,"" he said. ""This is not like it's a close question."" 2.) Hillary Clinton is ""much more politically astute now than she was in early 1993"" -- Alan Blinder, a Clinton administration economic adviser . When Hillary Clinton was first lady, she famously led the failed push for health care reform in 1993. According to Blinder, Clinton was not totally ""politically astute"" at the time and ""learned"" to play politics over time. ""I think she's much more politically astute now than she was in early 1993,"" Blinder said while Clinton served as the junior senator from New York. ""I think she learned. She's really smart. She learns, and she knows she made mistakes. She's said it herself. I know she was not as politically astute then as she is now."" Clinton is now considering a run at the White House in 2016. 3.) ""Hillary was the major reason I was secretary of state"" -- Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state . Madeline Albright attributes her selection as Bill Clinton's second secretary of state in large part to Hillary Clinton. Albright had been Clinton's ambassador to the United Nations and, according to her retelling, the first lady was the one who lobbied for her promotion. Albright said. ""Hillary told me -- and he told me -- that Hillary said, 'Why wouldn't you name her?'"" Albright goes on later to say that her staff ""all thought she had a role in it"" but didn't know for sure until one day Bill Clinton said, ""'Everybody knows that Hillary had a role in having Madeleine becoming secretary of state.'"" 4.) ""The President always had an eye for attractive women."" -- Leon Panetta, former chief of staff to the president . When Leon Panetta was pressed about Monica Lewinsky -- the White House intern whose affair with the president spiraled into a national saga -- he said he knew the president had ""eyed"" her but chalked it up as ""no different than anything else."" ""The President always had an eye for attractive women,"" the former chief of staff told the Miller Center. 5.) ""He's got a woman problem"" -- former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala . When Alice Rivlin, former director of Office of Management and Budget, met Bill Clinton, she called her friend Donna Shalala. ""I just met this really smart, charismatic governor of Arkansas. Do you think he's a presidential possibility?"" Rivlin asked Shalala. According to the former budget head, Shalala responded, ""'Well I know Bill Clinton and he's terrific, and everything you say is right, but he's never going to be president of the United States.'"" Rivlin asked, ""Why not?"" Shalala replied, ""He's got a woman problem."" 6.) The Lewinsky affair ""probably kept some people away from the polls that might have voted for Gore"" -- Roy Neel, top aide to Vice President Al Gore . Neel told the Miller Project that Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky probably cost Gore votes in the incredibly close 2000 election. ""I'm absolutely convinced ... that the Lewinsky affair really energized social conservatives and so angered a lot of people, and they had nowhere to vent that anger,"" he said. ""They couldn't vote against Clinton. ... If they had gone to the polls they would have voted for Gore, but they were just disgusted."" Gore, who in many ways ran away from Clinton in the 2000 election -- would go on to lose, despite winning the popular vote. 7.) ""She inspired, continues to inspire, fierce loyalty and he doesn't."" -- Roger Altman, former deputy Treasury secretary . The Clintons are known for keeping a stable of former aides, friends and confidants within arms length. But according to Altman, Hillary Clinton was better than Bill Clinton at inspiring loyalty. ""It's quite a difference and I ascribe it to the fact that she does not look at the world as, or at least in my experience, as solely and only politically,"" he said. ""She wears her heart on her sleeve much more than he does. Less and less now that she's her own public figure, but that's her nature."" It is safe to say that many former Clinton aides who still consider themselves close to Bill Clinton would disagree with Altman. 8.) ""He came close to punching Jerry Brown in the New York debate when Brown attacked Hillary for being on the Wal-Mart board."" -- Bruce Reed, a Clinton domestic policy adviser . During the 1992 Democratic primary, then (and now) California Gov. Jerry Brown attacked Bill Clinton over Hillary Clinton's law firm and Walmart ties. And the attack worked. ""In the primaries, he had lost his temper a few times,"" said Reed. ""He came close to punching Jerry Brown in the New York debate when Brown attacked Hillary for being on the Wal-Mart board, something like that."" Clinton would go on to win the nomination and now Brown is supporting Hillary Clinton's prospective run at the presidency.","Clinton's White House is described as chaotic but driven in the documents .
An aide said Hillary Clinton is ""much more politically astute"" than during '93 health care push .
Aides, one Cabinet secretary detailed Lewinsky affair and Clinton's ""woman problem""
The documents will be poured over by historians and Clinton critics, alike ."
"(CNN) -- Manchester United confirmed Friday that star striker Wayne Rooney has extended his contract with the club. The new deal, which commits the 28-year-old to Old Trafford until June 2019, is reported to be worth Â£300k ($500k) per week. The announcement puts an end to months of speculation about Rooney's future following interest from Jose Mourinho's Chelsea last summer with further bids expected to come at the end of this season. Not any more. Confirmation that Rooney was staying put can be considered a minor victory for former Everton boss David Moyes following a turbulent first season in charge of United after succeeding Alex Ferguson. ""Wayne has been the best player in England since I put him into the Everton first team in 2003. Since becoming United manager in July last year, I have enjoyed working with him and seeing just how he has developed his incredible talent,"" Moyes said in a statement. ""With his ability, his experience and his desire to succeed, he is a vital part of my plans for the future and I'm absolutely thrilled he has accepted the challenge."" Moyes has overseen a stuttering league campaign this year with eight losses from 26 games so far leaving United languishing in seventh place. Calamitous exits from both domestic cup competitions have only added to the sense of turmoil. While United are still involved in this year's Champions League -- they play Greek champions Olympiakos is the first leg of their last 16 tie next Tuesday -- they remain an outside bet to qualify for next season's competition. In an interview published on his website Friday, Rooney appeared unfazed by this fact saying it wasn't ""a massive concern"" for him. ""This is because I know the direction that this club is going in, and if we don't make it this season then we will come back stronger and claim a Champions League spot next season. Let's not forget we still have a chance this year ..."" Rooney also expressed his delight at signing a new contract. ""This is one of the biggest clubs in the world and to know that I will be playing here for the majority of my career is something that I'm looking forward to. I'm happy that everything is now finalized and I can carry on concentrating on my football,"" he said. Rooney has played 430 games for United and won five Premier League titles and a European Cup since joining from Everton in August 2004. He is currently fourth on United's all-time list of top scorers with 208 goals -- 41 short of Bobby Charlton's mark of 249.","England striker commits future to Manchester United in deal worth reported $500k per week .

"(CNN) -- Imagine for a moment that we lived in a world where two million children under the age of five were dying every year of diseases that were entirely preventable. Imagine that this world was divided in two, where in one half children were free from this scourge and the other half lived in fear of these diseases which threatened their families every single day. ""Mostly it is our children that are affected. I lost two of my children, a boy and a girl and my sister also lost two of her children; two boys. The first one of mine was two years and the recent one who died just two weeks old."" These aren't the lines from a dystopian Brothers Grimm story, or a page lifted from the dark ages of our history. These are the words of Yenge Koroma, who lives in Vaama in Sierra Leone. This is our world today. Globally nearly a third of under-five child deaths are attributable to just two diseases, pneumonia and diarrhea. Between them, they account for around two million young lives a year, with nearly 90% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Last year, UNICEF and the World Health Organization launched a Joint Action Plan, which WaterAid strongly supports, to help tackle these two child killers together. These organizations recognized that alongside vaccines and treatments like oral rehydration salts, access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and good hygiene are vital in helping to prevent these diseases. As Yenge puts it: ""The cause of the sicknesses is the water we are drinking. That water is polluted. There is dirt in the water and sometimes fish die in the water mysteriously. Sometimes we launder in that water; we use the water as toilet. All this is really making the water unhygienic but we have no other source. It is the same water we are drinking and that water I believe is really the cause of the sicknesses in this community."" Her story is far from unique. Globally 1 in 10 people are without safe drinking water, while over a third of the planet (36%) goes without basic sanitation. In Sub-Saharan Africa the situation is that much more desperate, with 35% going without an improved water source, and a staggering 70% without safe sanitation. This lack of access to such basic and essential services has devastating consequences for people's health. According to the U.N. as many as half the hospital beds in the developing world are being used at any one time by people suffering from waterborne diseases. Economists at the World Health Organization have calculated that a lack of access to these services is costing developing countries $35 billion every year, in healthcare costs alone. When looking at the full range of productivity losses this figure jumps to $260 billion. This devastating loss of life and the economic costs can be tackled if governments, civil society and the private sector work together to address this crisis. Addressing this crisis requires collaboration and innovative partnerships and WaterAid works with organizations like the U.N., the World Health Organization, with governments, businesses, academia and our colleagues and partners around the world to advocate for the step change in approach we need to see to get these services out to the communities that desperately need them. WaterAid works in Sierra Leone and 25 other countries around the world, providing some of the world's poorest people with access to these basic services. Since 1981 WaterAid has reached 19.2 million people with safe water and 15.1 million people with sanitation, and we are proud to be the world's largest international NGO focused entirely on water, sanitation and hygiene. We are approaching a crucial point. Next year, governments from around the world will finalize their negotiations to decide on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. These goals will help to shape the progress and priorities in the developing world for the next decade and a half. WaterAid believes that these new Sustainable Development Goals should include a dedicated commitment from governments for everyone everywhere to have access to water, sanitation and hygiene. Access to these services is the crucial first step in tackling killer diseases, and in helping lift people out of debilitating poverty. A third of the U.N. member countries have already signaled that this should be a priority, and we agree. Access to sanitation, water and hygiene are fundamental for a decent and productive life. We must not lose this opportunity to act and help end preventable child deaths.","Pneumonia and diarrhea kill around two million young children a year .

"(CNN) -- ISIS is looking to take over a good chunk of the Middle East -- if not the entire Muslim world. At least, that's the message the terrorist movement is sending in its English online magazine, Dabiq. In Dabiq's first issue, which debuted in early July, the magazine declared that a ""new era has arrived"" for Muslims. Photographs in the webzine of ISIS militants in American armored vehicles rolling through Iraq seemed to buttress that claim. Graphic photos of dead soldiers from Iraqi forces litter the pages of each of the issues of Dabiq, and articles detail skirmishes across Iraq and Syria. Each issue of the magazine -- there have been four so far, appearing at roughly monthly intervals -- starts with a foreword that contains an inspirational message for readers, before diving into longer pieces that extol the virtues of ISIS and provide updates on the group's military campaign. ISIS members fervently believe that they have established a true ""caliphate"" in the areas that they control, a supposed distant echo of the perfect Islamic rule of the Prophet Mohammed and his immediate successors in the seventh century. Overall, the magazine is quite religious in tone. Excerpts from rulings by Muslim scholars are included in every issue, as are religious rationales for the actions of ISIS. In the most recent issue, an ISIS writer reasoned that capturing women from the Yazidis, an Iraqi minority group, to use as sex slaves was acceptable under ISIS' version of Sharia law, since the Yazidis are polytheists, a great heresy in Islam. Showing some convoluted logic, the ISIS writer also asserted that enslaving Yazidi women is a good way to stop adultery, since a man having sex with a concubine is legal under ISIS' interpretation of Islamic law, but sexual relations outside of marriage with free women are forbidden. The magazines are also, unsurprisingly, highly sectarian, repeatedly showing images of Shia shrines and tombs that have been blown up by ISIS, a organization made up of members of the Sunni sect. ISIS believes these sites to be idolatrous. Iraqi Army soldiers -- who are generally Shia -- are referred to as ""apostates"" and graphic photos of their executions by ISIS fighters are a staple of the magazine. Other articles aim to reassure readers that ISIS, which in June renamed itself the Islamic State, is an actual state that provides social services and reconstructs critical infrastructure. The magazine asserts that administrators govern towns after the main ISIS fighting force moves on and the most recent issue of Dabiq includes photos with captions showing ""services for Muslims,"" including street cleaning, electricity repairs, care homes for the elderly and cancer treatment centers for children. The first issue of Dabiq even had a sort of classified ad for ""all Muslim doctors, engineers, scholars, and specialists"" to come and join ISIS. The most recent installment of Dabiq asserts that two new wilayat, or provinces, had been established in the region where the Syrian-Iraqi border had once been. The magazine describes the new provinces as a successful step in ""eliminating any remaining traces of the kufri, nationalistic borders."" Pictures of a military parade celebrating the announcement accompany the article, along with pictures of a well-staffed checkpoint, a bustling marketplace, and ISIS police patrolling the area. In many ways Dabiq is not a new phenomenon. Osama bin Laden's Service Office during the 1980s Afghan war against the Soviets produced a similar magazine, Jihad, which was widely available around the Muslim world, was translated into many languages and was principally a fund-raising and recruiting tool designed to encourage young Muslim men to travel to Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan to support the Afghan jihad. More recently, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula from its headquarters in Yemen has been publishing Inspire, another well-produced online magazine. Inspire, published for the past four years, clearly served as something of a model for Dabiq. Both are well laid out and feature graphics and photos prominently. The Dabiq feature titled ""In the Words of the Enemy,"" where a helpful quote from an official or analyst from the West is included, is a direct copy of an Inspire feature. Dabiq's most recent issue features a portion of U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in which he discussed how much of a threat ISIS is to the United States. But the two webzines share few similarities beyond that. Inspire was very much focused on recruiting lone-wolf jihadists and inspiring homegrown extremism in the West, but Dabiq includes only a few vague sentences about carrying out attacks in the West. Where Inspire included instructions on bomb-making and building weapons to carry our attacks in the West, Dabiq focuses almost entirely on the actions of ISIS in Iraq and Syria and encourages followers to join the jihad there. In the third issue of Dabiq an ISIS writer asserts, ""This life of jihad is not possible until you pack and move to the Khilafah,"" meaning to leave your home and travel to ISIS' areas of control in Iraq and Syria. The purpose of the Dabiq webzine is quite different from Inspire: It is to encourage and perpetuate ISIS' successful insurgencies in Iraq and Syria, not to foster homegrown extremism or lone-wolf attacks in the West. That's about the only good news that one can glean from Dabiq.","ISIS has published four issues of online magazine detailing its aims .

"(CNN)  -- With two TV shows, an entertainment company and a new style website to her name, Tyra Banks is a 37-year-old businesswoman at the top of her game. She has already reinvented herself once, adding entrepreneurial acumen to her modeling portfolio. Yet this year Banks decided to hit the books, enrolling in an executive education program at Harvard Business School. Why go to school when you already sit atop a growing entertainment empire? For many high-level executives these days, sitting in the corner office isn't enough. Many who have accomplished a great deal in their profession are making time for ""to step back and to look at that success and look at where (they're) going,"" said Lynda Applegate, who chairs the management program in which Banks is enrolled. Taking an executive education course is just one way that those who have already achieved career success seek out new horizons. Some leaders decide to take their business in a new direction, while others change industry entirely. How to have a 'rock star' career . Mike Volpi, who left the tech sector after climbing the ranks at Cisco, said: ""You've achieved a lot in terms of recognition, you've probably made more money than you ever thought you would. The question you ask yourself is: what really makes you the happiest from this point on?"" As conceptions of what constitutes ""reaching the top"" change, we look at what some executives do after reaching CEO status. Learn to do business even better . A mogul in the making, Banks has signed up for the Owner/President Management (OPM) program at Harvard. The nine-week program, spread out over three terms, accepts candidates who ""hold a significant equity stake"" in a firm with ""annual sales of at least $5 million."" Harvard's OPM program gives its participants a chance to plan how to build on their success -- and head in new directions -- ""using a set of analytical tools and lenses that allow you to do things on purpose as you go forward,"" according to Applegate. Business owners from around the world come to campus to start with fundamentals like risk management, marketing and finance but segue into big decision-making subjects like growth strategies and legacy planning. Applegate said the peer group is intended to build a confidence-boosting community, one that can let already successful business owners contemplate taking on big new projects. ""The content of what we teach is important and it's been tailored to what business owners need to know, but what's really, really the value of program is the community you form,"" Applegate said. It can be lonely at the top, particularly if you run a company that's independent rather than supported by venture capital. In the OPM program, ""You've met people here who know exactly what you learned, sat in the same class with you and debated in the lunchrooms. You can get a couple people that you really respect and form an advisory board."" Try a new occupation . Some leaders approach the top of the corporate ladder and decide to head in another direction entirely rather than stay in the game. Mike Volpi made his name in high-tech as a senior vice president at Cisco and as CEO of internet TV company Joost, but bailed on corporate management two years ago. Volpi said that packing it in for a sailboat in the Mediterranean didn't have the same appeal as finding a new job, one that tickled his intellect in ways that overseeing a company's operations had not. ""A CEO's life is pretty tough, it's enormously compromising of any sense of personal life,"" said Volpi, who is now a venture capitalist. ""I missed that feeling of seeing what's going to happen and also being able to catch a wave before other people know the wave is there, and that's really what a venture capitalist does. ""My job now is intellectually just as challenging as the operating job was, but includes the ability to operate without being in the limelight."" Add ""non"" to the profit . When Charlie Knowles sold his tech company Rubicon, he didn't plan to stay on as CEO after the merger. Faced with a chance to go back to the basics, he discovered that reinventing yourself carries uncertainties. ""The question we all hope we get faced with is, 'If I could do anything in the world what would it be?' But it's also pretty daunting,"" he said. ""That kind of dovetails into a whole bunch of other fears -- of whether you can get traction in a new area, as you become exposed to different languages, different jargons, different networks."" Knowles knew that he wouldn't have to worry about a salary going forward and realized that even though he was good at engineering, he didn't leap out of bed wanting to go do it. ""I was a bit burned out on it."" What did make him jump? A lifelong love of animals. So he founded the Wildlife Conservation Network, and for the last 17 years he has been the executive director of a global organization that counts African wild dogs, saiga antelopes and snow leopards among its client base. Pursuing a personal passion in a non-profit context didn't mean it was all smooth sailing for Knowles. Non-profit CEOs still have to operate businesses, raise funding and management personnel -- just in a context with very different rules and culture, he said. ""The thing I didn't anticipate, ultimately, was it's just a completely different perspective,"" he said.","What do you do after reaching CEO status?

"New York (CNN) -- Facebook is embroiled in another controversy after the popular social networking site on Monday temporarily disabled a page that calls for a boycott of oil giant BP. Facebook officials said Tuesday the site was removed in error through a technological glitch and has been restored. The Boycott BP page aims to organize a worldwide boycott of BP stations and all its brands in response to the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of  Mexico. It urges visitors to ""Boycott BP stations until the spill is cleaned up."" In addition to the station boycott, it advocates boycotting Castrol, Arco, Aral, Amoco, am/pm and even the Wild Bean Cafe. The group said it has more than 700,000 members. The site went down Monday, with visitors redirected to Facebook's home page. Facebook spokeswoman Annika Heinle said there was nothing sinister behind the move, and an automated system mistakenly flagged the page for removal. ""The administrative profile of the BP Boycott page was disabled by our automated systems, therefore removing all the content that had been created by the profile,"" a Facebook statement said. ""After a manual review, we determined the profile was removed in error, and it now has been restored along with the page."" The missing page prompted a protest from Public Citizen, a nonprofit public interest group that has been promoting the boycott. It called the removal of the page irresponsible and said users should be given a better explanation. ""I don't think it's much of an explanation at all,"" said Greg Beck, a Public Citizen attorney. ""They didn't explain why their system took it down, and just the fact that a community that large -- with more than 700,000 users -- could be taken down without explanation is problem. The automated system doesn't tell us that much."" He added, ""Facebook and other social websites have become the public squares of the internet -- places where citizens can congregate as a community to share their opinions and voice their grievances. Facebook's ownership of this democratic forum carries great responsibility."" BP said it wasn't involved. ""We had absolutely nothing to do with this. When we were first asked about it we contacted Facebook, and their mistake was rectified,"" said Robert Wine, a BP spokesman. The controversy comes as the oil spill is in its 71st day, with BP saying it is likely to take until August before relief wells might be able to stem the flow. The Boycott BP page is filled with posts from users who decry BP's handling of the spill, as well as a few who say a boycott is not the answer. BP has more than 11,000 stations in the United States, which sell more than 42 million gallons of gas a day. Critics of the boycott note that BP doesn't own the stations -- independent franchisees do -- and they're the ones who would be hurt. Advocates said the target of the boycott is wide, and even if they can't make a dent in BP's billions of dollars in sales, they can make a moral point.","NEW: BP says it had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with page being disabled .

"(Health.com) -- Overweight people with a history of heart disease who take the prescription weight-loss drug Meridia may be at increased risk of heart attack or stroke, according to a study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study confirms longstanding concerns about the safety of Meridia in people with heart disease and other heart problems, who are already warned against taking the drug. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee is scheduled to meet later this month to discuss the possibility of increased regulation for Meridia. The meeting was prompted by the preliminary results from the study, known as SCOUT, which were released by the agency in November 2009. Health.com: 9 surprising heart attack risks . In the study -- which was sponsored by the drug's maker, Abbott Laboratories -- researchers followed 10,744 overweight and obese people who had heart disease or type 2 diabetes and a risk factor for heart disease (such as high blood pressure) for about 3.5 years. During that time, 4.1 percent and 2.6 percent of the people taking Meridia had a nonfatal heart attack or stroke, respectively, compared with 3.2 percent and 1.9 percent of the people taking a placebo pill. That translates into a 28 percent increased risk of heart attack and a 36 percent increased risk of stroke, according to the study. However, Meridia did not appear to increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in diabetics with no history of heart disease. Nor did the researchers find any differences in the death rates from heart attack, stroke, or other causes in people taking Meridia versus placebo. Health.com: Heart trouble? 30 herbal remedies to avoid . Lead researcher W. Philip T. James, M.D., an obesity expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in the U.K., says that the study underscores that Meridia should not be prescribed to people with existing heart problems. But, he adds, ""it does not prove that you should extrapolate the data to the normal population for which the drug is intended."" The active ingredient in Meridia, sibutramine, suppresses appetite by affecting levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine. The drug is designed to be used by overweight and obese people, not by people who are a bit chubby and are trying to slim down. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat . Meridia has been shown to slightly raise blood pressure and heart rate, and the cardiovascular risk associated with the drug has been known for years. Since being approved by the FDA in 1997, Meridia has carried a warning on its label that says the drug should not be used in people with a history of heart disease, heart failure, heart-rhythm problems, or stroke. In January 2010, after reviewing the preliminary data from the SCOUT study, the FDA asked Abbott to strengthen the warning. The European Medicines Agency -- the European equivalent of the FDA -- chose to suspend sales of the drug in the European Union. In an editorial accompanying the study, three New England Journal of Medicine editors suggest that the heart risk associated with Meridia is not justified by the weight loss seen in the study -- about 9.5 pounds (or 4.5 percent of initial body weight) after one year, on average. ""[I]t is difficult to discern a credible rationale for keeping this medication on the market,"" the editors write. Health.com: Three new weight-loss drugs: will they work? The FDA would be going too far if it pulled the drug from the market, says Donna H. Ryan, M.D., associate executive director for clinical research at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She notes that the patients taking Meridia who were at greater risk for heart attack and stroke in the SCOUT study -- those with preexisting cardiovascular disease -- are already precluded from taking the drug. The study should not be interpreted to mean that the drug shouldn't be used at all, says Ryan, who prior to 2008 served as a consultant for Abbott and other manufacturers of obesity drugs. ""The study doesn't really support that, and indeed, in the population where you didn't have preexisting cardiovascular disease...there is no increased risk,"" she says. Sidney Wolfe, M.D., the director of the health research group at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization that petitioned the FDA to ban Meridia for safety reasons in 2002, says that even people who haven't been diagnosed with heart disease should avoid Meridia. Some obese people have unrecognized heart problems that may be aggravated by the drug, he says. Meridia ""should never have been approved in the first place,"" Wolfe adds. The FDA's advisory committee on endocrinologic and metabolic drugs will discuss Meridia on September 15. The agency is not required to follow the committee's recommendations, but it typically does.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- What's next now that the oil stopped flowing, and what will happen when BP's crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico is finally, permanently sealed? That was the subject of a meeting about long-term cleanup up efforts Thursday between the man overseeing the federal response to the oil spill and coastal parish officials. Retired Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen said afterward that parish presidents ""hold nothing back,"" but the two sides agreed there should be no premature declaration of victory, when it comes to cleanup. The meeting came in New Orleans, Louisiana, two weeks after the ruptured well was capped and stopped leaking -- but before the final effort to permanently seal the well. Allen promised cooperation between multiple layers of government when ""response"" efforts evolve into ""recovery"" efforts in the Gulf. In what Allen described as a ""very frank, productive conversation"" the officials pledged to work together on long-term cleanup plans and jointly determine how clean coastal areas actually are. In addition, they discussed how to better respond to storms and what was learned from Tropical Storm Bonnie. Some parish presidents contend that federal officials were too quick to remove booms and other oil-fighting equipment ahead of the storm, worrying it amounted to ""downsizing."" And they talked about how next to use the many fishing vessels that have been pressed into service, laying out boom and doing other work. For example, those that aren't able to return to fishing as parts of the Gulf are reopened might be used to start removing boom in weeks ahead. In a positive note for fishermen, Louisiana wildlife officials late Thursday announced that portions of state waters east of the Mississippi River in four parishes were re-opened to commercial fishing for fish and shrimp. They said the move followed extensive tests by the Food and Drug Administration that determined the fish were safe for consumption. After the meeting, Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said, ""I want to be sure there are enough assets in each of  these parishes to fight this oil."" He said he wanted to ensure that for ""any decision to downsize, which we know will happen someday, we will be included with that."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who attended the meeting, said ""at times it was contentious, but I think it was productive."" He said he tried to impress upon federal officials that cleanup priorities in weeks ahead should come from the bottom, up. ""What we suggest is that they allow each parish to come up with their own detailed plan, parish by parish,"" he said. The meeting also included officials from a variety of federal agencies and BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking toward the effort to seal the well. Allen said in a separate briefing that crews are making good progress toward two well-killing efforts -- first by pouring mud and cement into it from the top in a move known as a ""static kill"" -- and then sealing it from the bottom through a relief well that's been slowly drilled to intercept the crippled well. The first effort is planned for Monday but might take place sooner, he said. The relief well may be ready for the ""bottom kill"" effort five to seven days after the static kill. Allen was asked whether the static kill was really necessary, or if it amounted to ""playing with fire"" -- in a move that could jeopardize the final effort to kill the well from the bottom. ""I don't think so,"" he said. ""Our science team has come to the conclusion that we do have well integrity and that the well is safe to do a static kill."" He said first effort ""would enhance and ultimately make more effective"" the final well-killing effort from below. The ship that would pour the mud and cement for the static kill, the Q4000, is on the scene and ready to go. And as flight crews find it harder and harder to spot oil on the surface of the water, Allen offered another bit of good news. He said said it's very unlikely that any oil might wind up in the loop current that winds around Florida toward the U.S. East Coast -- something that had been a  concern in the early days of the BP oil spill. ""The chances that oil will become entrained in the loop are very, very low -- and will go to zero as we control the leak at the well with the cap and ultimately kill it,"" he said. That's partly because oil hasn't moved beyond the Florida panhandle and partly due to a stroke of luck from Mother Nature. ""For the past several months now, there has been an eddy that has broken off the loop current between the wellhead and where the current actually comes north and turns and goes back down toward the Straits of Florida,"" he said. ""So there's been an eddy that has created a barrier between the wellhead and the loop current."" The coming static kill should also provide a ream of data that will give experts a better idea how much oil actually leaked from the well during the nearly three months it was spewing oil. At the height of the spill, skimming vessels were collecting 25,000 barrels of oil a day. Some scientists are skeptical the situation is improving and worry about how much oil may be lurking below  the surface. ""We've swept the oil under the rug, if you will, because we've applied a tremendous amount of dispersants to it,"" said Doug Inkley, senior scientist for the National Wildlife Federation."" Speaking on CNN's ""American Morning,"" he said, ""What this means is that most of the oil has been dispersed throughout the entire water column, so that we're not seeing it on the surface."" ""My biggest concern is the long-term effects on the food chain because the small organisms are eaten by the bigger organisms,"" he added. ""It's still underwater and could have an effect for years, if not decades to come."" But Steve Murawski, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's chief scientist for fisheries, told CNN such a concern is, in some cases, unfounded. ""Oil does not necessarily bio-magnify into larger things,"" Murawski said. Fish, dolphins and other larger sea animals process and excrete oil. However, he said, consumers ""need to be more careful with oysters and shrimp."" One thing not going away soon -- the threat of litigation against BP. A panel of federal judges met in Boise, Idaho Thursday to consider arguments on where litigation over the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil gusher should be consolidated. The Deepwater Horizon rig, off the coast of Louisiana, triggered the oil disaster when it exploded April 20, killing 11 people, and sank shortly afterward. New Orleans and Houston, Texas, appear to be the favorites for the lawsuit sites because of their proximity to oil company offices and litigants surrounding the disaster.","Local, state officials lay out cleanup concerns at ""frank"" session .

"(CNN) -- Four days after suffering a humbling defeat to Simona Halep, Serena Williams turned the tables on the Romanian to win a fifth WTA Finals title with a crushing straight sets 6-3 6-0 victory in Singapore Sunday. Williams had called her 6-2 6-0 reverse in round-robin group play Wednesday ""embarrassing"" and she set about putting the record straight in the title match. Fourth-ranked Halep began where she left off to take an early 2-1 lead with a break of service, but this was a very different Williams on the other side of the net. The world number one immediately broke back and a further break to lead 5-3 was the start of eight games in a row without reply. A total of 26 winners flowed from the racket of the 33-year-old American veteran -- who was winning the end of season crown for the third straight year -- the first player since Monica Seles in 1992 to achieve the feat. ""She was playing so well at the beginning and I told myself to just relax and once I did that I started playing better and making my shots,"" Williams told the official WTA website. ""I lost to her a couple of days ago so I knew she was capable of playing really well, but I knew I had to play better if I wanted to win. Williams' participation in the WTA Finals had been in doubt after she pulled out of a warmup tournament in China with a knee injury. ""I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to play here and now I've won the Billie Jean King Trophy again -- it's an amazing feeling,"" she added. Her triumph caps an unpredictable year for the 18-time grand slam champion, who won the U.S. Open crown last month, but made shock exits from the other three majors. She closed out the match with another empathic winner after just 69 minutes and picked up a check for just over $2 million for her efforts. Halep was the first Romanian to reach the final and only the eighth woman to achieve the feat while making her debut in the event for the top eight players of the year. The 23-year-old said she always expected Williams to rebound after the earlier match. ""She was more motivated and more focused maybe in this match, and she tried to hit the balls very strong,"" Halep told gathered reporters. ""I knew she will play better this match because she saw how I play, she saw what she has to do during the match. So she did really well today.""","Serena Williams retains WTA Finals title .

"(CNN) -- Thursday night's debate was the Joe Biden show. And like many shows, the beginning was excellent, the middle was painful to watch, and the finish was what we expected. The beginning: I'm calling it the first 45 minutes. The vice president was at his best. Yes, he had some smiles, but he had those four years ago. This time it was more obvious because the camera was always on him, and his teeth seemed so white as to make a dentist blush. Seriously, put the bleach tray down, Joe, or there won't be enough left over for washing the dirty clothes. However, Biden followed those smiles (and laughs -- which I don't like and always recommend against) with indignation about what Paul Ryan was saying. He followed those smiles with arguments that Ryan was wrong on his facts, wrong on his history and wrong about President Barack Obama. Had it not been clear that Biden was smiling because he thought Ryan was saying something ridiculous, it would have bothered me more. But for me, the smiles didn't get in the way too much once I put my Ray-Bans on. For the first 45 minutes, Biden dominated the discussion. The domination began with him telling Ryan, ""With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey."" Biden never let up. He hammered away on the topic of Iran, arguing that the Republicans wouldn't have been successful at getting support for sanctions from either Russia or China. Opinion: Feisty Biden, wonky Ryan . Foreign policy is Biden's wheelhouse. So when the topic came to Israel and Ryan continued Mitt Romney's line that Obama doesn't consider Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a close ally, Biden had one of his best moments. He said ""Bibi"" Netanyahu has ""been my friend 39 years."" So he both reminded us of his experience in foreign policy and made clear that he considers Netanyahu such a friend that he calls him by his nickname. It was an excellent moment for Biden. Biden's strength in this debate was his approach to the middle class and senior citizens. He never failed to take an opportunity to remind the American public that Romney is ""a guy who says 47% of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives."" Biden tied Romney's ""47%"" comments (even saying, ""If you heard that little soliloquy on 47% and you think he just made a mistake, then I got a bridge to sell you"") into his best points of the evening. He looked right at the camera and said, ""Folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?"" and ""Folks, follow your instincts"" on issues such as Medicare vouchers and Social Security privatization. At one point he spoke directly to seniors. It was a nice touch. But then inertia took over. I'll call this the next 30 minutes. After running right over Ryan, with the Republican barely making headway for the first 45 minutes, Biden lost control of the car. The over-steering was perhaps due to excessive coaching after the president's lackluster debate. At any rate, once he had run over Ryan, it was a quick swerve in the other direction, and then Biden thumped the moderator, Martha Raddatz, with interrupting indignation. Then Biden accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake pedal. His runaway berating was now headed toward the townsfolk. Biden kept pointing his finger menacingly. At first, only Ryan was the victim of the loose finger. But then Biden became trigger-happy with that finger-as-weapon. Raddatz couldn't duck fast enough and became the next target. Strafing the audience indiscriminately with his scolding, Biden was now pointing and shaking his index finger at anything that moved. Opinion: Partisans are fired up on both sides . This was cringe-worthy. Biden was so wound up that he was like that family member you're warned about before the big Thanksgiving get-together. ""Now, don't get Uncle Billy riled up, because once he gets going, nobody will enjoy their pumpkin pie."" Yep. Biden turned into Uncle Billy. He simply didn't know, or didn't have the capability to turn his frustration and emotions off. He interrupted, pointed and scolded so often that I think he finished one point with the phrase, ""You kids get out of my yard."" Yet he calmed down and was saved by a personal question about abortion. Yes, Biden's emotions were put back in check by talking about a woman's right to choose. You know it's a crazy debate when that happens. And for the rest of the debate, he was back to regular Joe. He still made emotional appeals, but they were more in check. He was very good again for the last 15 minutes. By the way, who was that high school debater up on the stage with Biden? Ryan reminded me of so many debaters I've seen in the past. Youthful, with ideas -- but in a critical debate they get lost. I'm not sure Ryan demonstrated that he's what we need in these tough times. He lacked passion, and he seemed a bit wet behind the ears. Did he do badly? By no means. He never lost his cool and he wasn't rude. But with his youthful appearance, and his taking a back seat to Biden, Ryan was overshadowed. Ryan did nothing to win or lose the debate. He just disappeared. Ryan underperformed to Biden's over-performance. One way or the other, good and bad, it was Joe Biden's show.

"(CNN) -- She had nightmares about taking part in the New York City Marathon -- in one she even dreamed she was dead prior to getting to the start line -- but it turns out Caroline Wozniacki need not have worried. For one the tennis ace from Denmark completed the grueling 26.2-mile journey Sunday, which was impressive enough given only about a week ago did Wozniacki's lengthy season come to an end in Asia. Secondly the former world No. 1 posted a time of just over three hours and 26 minutes. Wozniacki tweeted the secret to her finishing was ""carb loading,"" posting a picture of herself munching mountains of popcorn, while watching the New York Rangers play ice hockey against the Winnipeg Jets with friend Serena Williams on Saturday. Waiting for her at the finish line was Williams, who just happened to beat Wozniacki in the U.S. Open final in New York two months ago. ""I never tried anything this hard,"" Wozniacki was quoted as saying by the New York Daily News. ""This is the toughest physical challenge ever. ""You have to keep going, keep going. I just kept grinding out there."" It was always on Wozniacki's ""bucket list"" to run the marathon and she raised funds for the charity Team for Kids. Despite Wozniacki's athletic background, the race didn't go down without a hitch. She hit a wall, said the Daily News, at the 20-mile mark. But the 24-year-old -- formerly engaged to golf No. 1 Rory McIlroy -- ended strongly and was congratulated by Williams. Her feat also drew praise from fellow players and retired greats such as Billie Jean King. Wozniacki said completing the marathon would help her tennis game. ""I know I can be out there for hours and be fine,"" she was quoted as saying by the Daily News. ""I can keep battling it out there and I think that's a great mental advantage to have when you go out to play."" Presumably, though, she'll take a break first.","Caroline Wozniacki completes the New York Marathon in just over three hours, 26 minutes .

"New York (CNN) -- It came as no surprise to anyone who is a baseball fan that last year on September 28 a flurry of articles marked the 50th anniversary of Ted Williams' final game. Williams ended his career as few major leaguers do, with a home run in his final at bat. But this year as we approach the 51st anniversary of the game that ended Williams' career in 1960, it is time to turn our attention to novelist John Updike. It is the story Updike wrote for the New Yorker, ""Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,"" that has allowed Williams' last hurrah to take on a life of its own and that last year prompted critic Charles McGrath to argue that ""Hub Fans"" is ""probably the most celebrated baseball essay ever."" Thanks to Updike, Williams' last home run is far better known than his even more remarkable feat -- which took place exactly 70 years ago this month --- of going six for eight on the final day of the 1941 season to lift his average to .406 and become the last man in baseball to hit .400. Like Updike, I was at Williams' final game. I cut the graduate school poetry class I normally went to three afternoons a week for the chance to see Williams end his career. I had expected to get stuck sitting in the center field bleachers, but Fenway Park was not even half filled. Only 10,454 fans showed up for the game with the Baltimore Orioles. The Red Sox were a seventh-place ball club in 1960, and even for Ted Williams, most Bostonians were unwilling to take off work on a Wednesday afternoon so gloomy that in the sixth inning the stadium lights were turned on. I got good seats along the third base line, and in the fifth inning I was able to move down to the field boxes next to the visitors' dugout. The ushers could not have cared less. Before the game Williams was honored with a Paul Revere silver bowl and speeches from Boston's mayor and Red Sox television announcer Curt Gowdy, but the ceremonies felt perfunctory. Like the small Fenway Park crowd, they reflected Boston's divided view of Ted Williams. He was someone to admire but not to love, and in his final game he stayed true to form. In his last time at bat in an otherwise meaningless game, Williams pulled his miracle. In the eighth inning on the third pitch to him, he hit a towering home run to right field that cleared the Red Sox bullpen with plenty to spare. It was the 521st home run in a baseball career that had been interrupted by service as a Marine pilot during World War II and the Korean War. The home run was the perfect stage exit, but as Williams trotted around the bases with his head down, he made no effort to dwell on the drama of the moment. Once in the Red Sox dugout, he refused to come out despite the chants of ""We want Ted,"" and when at the start of the ninth inning manager Mike Higgins sent Williams out to his left field position, then instantly replaced him, he jogged back to the Red Sox dugout with his eyes firmly on the ground. As he had done since the end of his first year in the major leagues, Williams refused to tip his hat to the applauding fans. The Ted Williams whom Updike describes is a man divided between pride in his craft and determination to avoid making himself vulnerable to the whims of fans. But what sets Williams apart in Updike's account is that his internal and external struggles have taken place before thousands in stadiums across the country. In his role as a marquee athlete, he has not had privacy since his rookie year of 1939. As much as our contemporary culture will allow, Ted Williams is a man of mythic dimensions, . In Updike's story, ironically titled to sound as if it belonged on the sports page, Williams is both ""Achilles, the hero of incomparable powers and beauty,"" and a figure who at rest looks like ""Donatello's David."" But always he is larger than life. Circling the bases following his home run, Williams moves for Updike ""like a feather caught in a vortex."" Updike was able to capture more than any of us saw that afternoon at Fenway Park, and with the passage of time, his story of Ted Williams' final game has become more powerful than the original experience. Updike's account is all that thousands who were never at Fenway Park that fall afternoon, and who now outnumber those of us there, know of the heights on which Williams left the game. If Williams is our Achilles, then Updike is our Homer.

"(EW.com) -- Peter and Bobby Farrelly have been quietly developing a sequel to ""Dumb and Dumber"" for awhile now. Back in October, we heard that Sean Anders and John Morris -- the comedy screenwriting duo behind ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" and ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" -- were hard at work on a script. That was the last bit of news about the project...at least until this weekend, when Peter Farrelly dropped a Twitter-imploding bombshell in the middle of a ""Three Stooges"" press junket. ""We're getting set to shoot Dumb and Dumber 2 in September,"" the director told ComingSoon.net. ""We've got Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels back."" Farrelly may have jumped the gun a little bit -- a source close to the production tells EW that the film is ""moving along, but it's not greenlit yet."" It's hard to imagine a green light is too far away, though -- following last week's announcement about the impending arrival of ""Anchorman 2,"" this feels like the moment for long-awaited comedy sequels.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is beefing up its firepower in Afghanistan by employing heavily armored tanks in Afghanistan for the first time in the nine-year war, a military spokesman said Friday. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to use a company of M1A1 Abrams tanks in restive Helmand province by early spring, Marine Maj. Gabrielle Chapin said. The M1A1 tank is the fastest and most deadly ground combat weapons system available. It will allow for more aggressive missions while mitigating risks to U.S. forces, the military said. The tanks were used successfully by U.S. forces to battle insurgents in Iraq's Anbar province, Chapin said. ""They bring superior optics, maneuverability and precision firepower that will enable us to isolate insurgent forces from key population centers and provide the ability to project power into insurgent safe havens,"" he said. Other coalition forces, including those from Canada, already have used tanks in Afghanistan. ""Quite frankly, given the nature of the fight, they are very much needed,"" said Jeffrey Dressler, an analyst for the Institute for the Study of War. He said Gen. David Petraeus, who took over as the top American commander in Afghanistan in June, has taken a much more aggressive fight against the insurgency. The deployment of the tanks dovetails with that approach. They signal a more definitive presence for U.S. troops, said Col. John King, commander of the Georgia Army National Guard's 48th Infantry Brigade, who led an armored battalion in Iraq during the worst of that war in 2005 and 2006. ""The M1 tank is a formidable machine,"" King said. ""It's a formidable message. It signifies commitment, that we're committed."" Each tank weighs 72 tons and can fire with precision from afar, mitigating risks for both U.S. forces and Afghan civilians. And, King said, the mere presence of the hulking tanks provides a psychological boost for the troops. ""It's a tremendous combat multiplier,"" he said. ""It's a big deal."" He said that in Iraq, the mere sight of a tank made insurgents think twice about whether they wanted to fight. The company of 115 Marines in Helmand will have 15 tanks as they fight in an area that has been a hotbed of activity. The decision comes as Afghanistan tops the agenda at the NATO summit that started Friday in Lisbon, Portugal, and amid a dispute between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and NATO leaders over military strategy. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","The Marines plan to use a company of M1A1 Abrams tanks in Helmand province .

"(CNN) -- The mortgage settlement agreed to by 49 state attorneys general seems to be yet another stroke of good luck for the banks. Ostensibly, the settlement commits the banks to pay $26 billion to the government and homeowners to compensate for improper conduct in the foreclosure process. In the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-8, banks and mortgage companies rushed to provide mortgage loans to homeowners, many of whom weren't capable of shouldering the debt. The mortgages were bundled together and sold as exotic securities to investors. When housing prices stopped rising and homeowners could no longer refinance their way out of bad mortgages, the cycle ended and the financial crisis set in. This also led to an unprecedented wave of foreclosures that continues to this day. If anyone expects this settlement to have a noticeable effect on the housing market, they will be badly disappointed. Clearly, it will help some number of homeowners keep their homes, but the benefit is likely to limited. There are more than 10 million homeowners underwater by an average of more than $60,000. If the banks actually give $20 billion in debt relief as a result of this settlement, that would be sufficient to give $20,000 to 1 million homeowners. That's helpful, but little more than a drop in the bucket. The settlement covers a wide range of sins committed by banks and other mortgage lenders. In some cases, it was simply an issue of sloppy paperwork. That may not seem like that big of a deal, but anyone who has taken out a mortgage and had to pay a lawyer several hundred dollars to ensure that the paperwork was in order might not appreciate rules saying that big banks are not bound by the same law. If there's no evidence of deliberate fraud, banks will be given immunity from responsibility for sloppy paperwork. A second set of sins involved more substantive violations where servicers attached fees improperly or foreclosed without proper notice. The banks treated foreclosure as a mass production operation. In many cases, this might have meant imposing penalties that they did not have a right to impose or push through foreclosures without going through all the necessary steps. The third and most serious issue involved foreclosures where banks could not prove that they owned the property. This may seem farfetched, but there are foreclosure cases in which the bank's servicer lacked the documentation to show that it in fact owned the property. In some of the famous cases of robo-signing, people were being paid to forge documents to substitute for ones that could not be found. We don't know whether the number of cases where mortgage servicers could not produce the documentation to establish ownership of the house were few or many. This is an issue that is likely not to be investigated as a result of the settlement. Presumably servicers will at least have to produce proper documentation going forward. While $26 billion sounds like a substantial sum, we don't know at this point how much of this will the banks actually pay. Most of the payment will take the form of modifications and debt write-offs in short sales. There is no easy way to determine how much the banks will pay through this route because we don't know what debt write-offs they would have done in the absence of the settlement. If the banks are allowed to count every dollar written off as a dollar against the settlement -- as though they would have made no write-offs otherwise --then it is possible that they won't pay a dime for this settlement. We also don't know how much the banks will pay because most of the write-offs are likely to be on mortgage-backed securities that they are servicing, not on mortgages that they own. This means that they will be paying their penalty with investors' money. If this is not a legal first, it is certainly unusual to have a settlement where the defendant is able to pay using someone else's money. It would have been useful if the attorneys general had pushed for a settlement that gave enforceable rights to homeowners facing foreclosure. For example, if they had required servicers to give every foreclosed homeowner the right to stay in their home paying the market rent for five years following a foreclosure, millions of homeowners would have immediately been given housing security they currently lack. And, they could enforce this one themselves rather than relying on the goodwill of the bank or government overseers. But, that doesn't seem about to happen given the political power of the banks. It looks like their good luck is continuing. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"London (CNN) -- From his London hospital room, journalist Paul Conroy recalled Sunday his harrowing journey to hell and back from Syria -- speaking out against what he called its ""murderous regime"" in tribute to those, including his colleague Marie Colvin, killed in the chaos. Few foreign journalists have been in the Middle Eastern nation in recent months, as Syria's government has stringently restricted access amid widespread violence that the United Nations estimates has left more than 7,500 people dead. President Bashar al-Assad's government blames ""armed terrorist groups"" for the bloodshed. Yet senior U.N. official Lynn Pascoe told the Security Council last week that often over ""100 civilians a day, including women and children"" are being killed -- most of them the victims of what activists and witnesses have described as brutal attacks by Syrian government forces. Conroy spoke to CNN at length, days after surviving a bloody attack and surreptitiously escaping from the ravaged city of Homs to Lebanon and eventually back to his native Britain. After spending several days in Syria, both reporting and lying wounded in an embattled medical center, he had no doubts about who was responsible. ""It's really hard when you've got people presenting you with bits of people saying, 'Why aren't you helping?' What can I tell them?"" Conroy said. ""It's not like we don't know what's happening anymore. We do know."" His colleague at Britain's Sunday Times' newspaper, Colvin, had been with him earlier in February when they sneaked into Homs, which has been a hub of the resistance movement and government crackdown. Conroy called the experience -- without government minders, into what had been a largely imagined situation until then -- ""an eye-opener (given) the level of butchery going on."" After what they'd seen already, Colvin couldn't stand to just head home, he said. ""Marie was on fire,"" Conroy said. ""She couldn't let this go. Two days wasn't enough."" So they returned to Homs to find ""the situation was going downhill, almost by the hour."" They talked with CNN and the BBC, intent on doing whatever possible to get the news out. Around 8:15 a.m. the next morning, February 22, the building they were in took a direct hit, filling the air with dust and smoke. Several more blows followed. Conroy remembered feeling ""massive pressure"" and knowing he'd been hit. He later was found to be severely wounded in his stomach and leg. ""So I ran through where the door had been and, on the way out, more or less tripped over Marie's body and fell down next to her,"" he said. ""Her head was covered in rubble, her legs were covered in rubble, and she was obviously dead."" Activists soon risked their lives and dragged Conroy outside, threw him in a car and took him to the field hospital -- ""ironically, what we'd been trying to get to for two days."" A room, fitted with mattresses, became home to Conroy and another wounded journalist, Edith Bouvier of France, for the next five days. He learned that, in addition to Colvin, another journalist, Remi Ochlik, also was killed, while colleague William Daniels had survived the attack. Yet there was little peace. Conroy said. Every day, there was ""the most savage and ferocious bombardment"" imaginable -- reporting even what he called an ""Iranian drone flying around, looking for targets."" Then late one afternoon, ambulances descended on the hospital. The initial word was first that there was a cease-fire and that Red Cross representatives would be on hand soon to take him, Bouvier and others home. But Conroy said Red Cross workers didn't show up, just civilian Red Crescent members ""with no diplomatic presence."" A delegation member who was trusted by the Free Syrian Army -- the armed opposition group, made up largely of Syrian military defectors, who had looked after the journalists -- said that he heard Syrian state television planned to film the two being put on ambulances, then government forces would stage an attack that they'd later blame on the Free Syrian Army. Conroy said he was confused, but determined to get out. ""When you see bodies of kids with sniper rounds through the head, what's a journalist who had two of their roommates killed (to think)?"" he said. ""I'd rather die on the ground than wait for some lunatic to come in and start (shooting)."" A short time later, after borrowing shoes and pants, Conroy said he got an injection from doctors -- ""I just said put anything in, because I knew it was going to be a very painful experience"" -- and got into a Free Syrian Army vehicle. He emerged on a street, then found ""most of the buildings"" that had been there a few days before were ""gone."" Conroy said a rope was tied around him, and he was lowered about five meters (16 feet) into a tunnel. There, he and a seriously wounded boy, roughly 10 years old, joined a driver on a small motorbike. ""We just drove off, into this night, in this tunnel,"" he said, adding that he learned Syrian forces shot up the same tunnel some 20 minutes later. Yet he got out safely on the other end, being put on a stretcher and then placed in a ""van full of dead and sick guys."" The rest of his voyage consisted of ""a series of motorbike rides (and) car journeys,"" at times past sporadic attacks and through battlefields. Finally, Conroy said he was dropped off at a house, where three men were sitting watching television, with their machine guns nearby. ""And I thought, well, I better ask: Are we in Syria or Lebanon? They went, 'Lebanon,'"" he said. ""I just kind of sat down and had a toke of a ... cigarette... ""That's the first time that I felt I could actually allow myself to celebrate. I made it out. But I couldn't be delighted because nobody else was there with me. I was on my own."" Soon he was in the home of Tom Fletcher, Britain's ambassador to Lebanon, and eventually back in his native England. Last Friday, both Bouvier and Daniels returned to France -- with the opposition group Avaaz claiming it helped them escape. Now, dressed in a hospital gown, Conroy is on another mission: to get the word out about what's really going on. That is the best way, he figures, to reflect the spirit and mission of Colvin and other journalists killed in Syria. And he would return, he says, if only to challenge the Syrian government to an open debate about what they have done and what they'll do next. Conroy said he's convinced ""this regime will continue to exterminate civilians. They will massacre them. They will not stop."" ""If you are big enough to throw your army in to kill the women and children, then be big enough to have a conversation about it,"" he said. ""If you've got nothing to hide, come and do it. ""I'd go back, absolutely.""","Paul Conroy was hurt while surreptitously reporting from Homs, Syria .

"(CNN) -- The appetite for ""The Hunger Games"" was even more voracious than experts predicted. The Lionsgate movie based on the best-selling young-adult novel raked in an estimated $155 million in its opening weekend, according to the studio, giving it the third-best debut in North American box office history. Only ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" and ""The Dark Knight"" -- both sequels, with the strength of a franchise behind each -- recorded bigger opening weekends. The massive total for ""Hunger Games"" more than doubles the opening weekend of the first film in the ""Twilight"" franchise, another set of films that sprang from a young-adult series. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth star in the dystopian fantasy, based on the first book in the Suzanne Collins trilogy about a future society in which teenagers are forced to battle to the death. The $155 million estimate was reported by Exhibitor Relations Co., which compiles the box office totals tallied by studios. Final weekend numbers will be available Monday. Experts had initially projected a $100 million opening for ""Hunger Games,"" then revised their guesses as high as $140 million as fan fever soared, fueled by the books' success and a canny marketing campaign. The weekend's $155 million easily gives ""The Hunger Games"" the record for the biggest March opening ever, besting the $116 million debut of ""Alice in Wonderland"" in 2010, and shows a blockbuster release is not limited to the summer and holiday seasons, as long presumed. ""Hunger Games"" is already the highest-grossing movie in the history of Lionsgate, which has announced the sequel, ""Catching Fire,"" will be released November 22, 2013.","The movie sets a record for the biggest March opening ever .

"(CNN) -- What a difference two debates have made. Before the first presidential debate last week, President Barack Obama appeared to be cruising toward re-election and possibly a thumping victory. After the first presidential debate, that changed dramatically: Suddenly, we had a horse race. Now after the vice presidential debate Thursday night, we not only have a horse race, but partisans fired up on both sides. Joe Biden relit the fire under Democrats in a passionate, often dominant tangle with Paul Ryan. Going into that encounter, Democratic spirits were not only drooping but some were beginning to panic that they were throwing away the election. Biden put a forceful stop to the caterwauling -- or, as Gloria Borger put it, righted the ship. He was especially effective in countering Ryan on Medicare and (as Van Jones argued after the debate) in making a case that a Romney administration could mean the end of Roe v. Wade. An old pro, Biden knows how to play to seniors, women and the middle class. Opinion: Debate coach -- it's the Biden show! But Republicans took equal encouragement from Ryan's performance. And well they should. Ryan was a steady, unflappable presence onstage who made an articulate set of arguments in favor of conservative principles while also seeming sensitive and reasonable to many moderates. Ryan was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy, holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject. Overall, he more than justified Mitt Romney's judgment in choosing him as running mate. On substance, I called it a draw right after the debate (as did Wolf Blitzer and a few others on our CNN team). That was good news for both Biden and Ryan. The latter could claim credit for being one of the only two challengers who has ever fought a sitting vice president to at least a draw, the first being Al Gore against incumbent Dan Quayle in 1992. The CNN poll of registered voters who had watched the debate reached a similar conclusion: Forty-eight percent said Ryan won, 44% said Biden, though the difference was within the poll's margin of error. A CNN focus group thought it was a draw as well. (Note to candidates: What the focus group liked most was when Biden and Ryan said what their administrations would do to fix the economy. Could we possibly hear more of that in the remaining presidential debates?) But there was another element to the debate that has aroused more controversy. As it did in the first presidential debate, CNN chose to show the two candidates on a split screen throughout the evening. (Good call). Watching that, I found Biden's frequent laughs at Ryan to be off-putting -- and indeed, condescending. That plus the interruptions were in stark contrast to Ryan's calm, even-keeled performance. So on style, I thought the edge went to Ryan. Opinion: Feisty Biden, wonky Ryan . As often happens in these highly charged times, many Democrats sharply disagreed with that judgment on Twitter. They thought I along with some colleagues were jackasses (that is a very polite rephrasing of their language). Many cited a CBS poll after the election that found Biden a clear overall winner. What was lost in translation is that the CBS poll was of uncommitted voters  and the CNN poll of all registered voters. Recognizing there can be honest differences, I stand by my call -- Biden was overbearing in the early part of the debate and that diminished the impact of his arguments. Taken altogether, the vice presidential debate did make a difference: Biden was able to help his boss out of the hole -- he helped to stabilize the race. But Ryan was able to keep the GOP fired up, too. Both campaigns now gallop forward, looking toward the next showdown this coming Tuesday night when CNN's Candy Crowley is the moderator. It's a close horse race with passions high, fans on their feet.

"(CNN) -- A combative debate on Thursday between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Paul Ryan came down to the issue of trust. They challenged each other's facts and claims and offered starkly different visions for the direction of the country. Biden achieved his goal of bringing the fight to his Republican challenger in battling Ryan to a draw, boosting the spirits of Democrats disheartened by President Barack Obama's lackluster performance last week in the first of three presidential debates. Ryan made a positive impression with his command of both domestic and foreign policy issues that showed him to be a formidable national candidate after a career of local congressional races in his native Wisconsin. A snap CNN-ORC International poll showed voters who watched Thursday's debate narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48%-44%, a statistically even result after GOP presidential challenger Mitt Romney scored a clear debate victory over Obama. Ryan repeatedly said the Obama administration has taken the nation in the wrong direction, asserting it has hindered economic recovery and weakened U.S. influence around the world. What would you have asked? ""The choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs,"" Ryan said. ""Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues, and we will not blame others for the next four years."" He also repeated several times, in reference to the recent terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya and other anti-American protests, that ""what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy."" Biden called several of Ryan's remarks ""malarkey"" and challenged Americans to trust their common sense when judging proposals by the Republican challengers. The tax and entitlement reforms proposed by Romney and Ryan would harm the middle class and favor the wealthy, Biden said in seeking to depict Republicans as protectors of the privileged. ""You think these guys are going to go out there and cut those loopholes?"" Biden asked about unspecified moves promised by Romney and Ryan to balance broad tax cuts they propose. First ever 'Catholic' debate . On the topic of reforming the Medicare program for senior citizens, which Romney and Ryan seek to partially privatize, Biden referred to a Ryan proposal to provide partial government payment for seniors in the future to buy private health care. ""Folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?"" Biden asked, saying Ryan's plan would increase Medicare costs to recipients by $6,000 a year. Ryan disputed the claim, which was based on a proposal that he has since altered. The lone vice-presidential debate before the November 6 election pitted Biden, 69, and his almost four decades of experience in national politics against the 42-year-old Ryan, a 14-year congressional veteran who rose to the chairmanship of the powerful House Budget Committee. Despite Biden's more extensive experience, CNN polling showed 55% of respondents expected Ryan to win the debate, and both campaigns tried to downplay expectations for their candidate ahead of time. Privately, senior Democrats told CNN they believed a strong showing by Biden could help the Democratic ticket, but wouldn't be enough to erase problems created by Obama's self-admitted bad debate performance against Romney. Complete coverage: Presidential debates . Obama and Romney will square off again Tuesday in New York and October 22 in Florida. Polling after the first presidential debate showed Romney tightening the race nationally and in some of the nine battleground states considered vital to either candidate's chances of garnering the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. ""I do think Joe Biden did his boss a lot of good tonight,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said after Thursday's debate. CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said Biden's job ""was to right the ship, and he did it."" Both analysts criticized Biden for his tendency to smile and roll his eyes in response to some of Ryan's comments, especially early in the debate, with Gergen saying Ryan won on style but the debate was even with regard to substance. Biden also was more aggressive in his demeanor, repeatedly cutting off Ryan and sometimes talking at the same time as his rival to challenge specific comments. At one point, Ryan told Biden that ""I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other."" Biden responded: ""Well, don't take all the four minutes then"" in reference to how much time the candidates had to respond to a particular question. Overall, Biden spoke for about a minute more than Ryan during the 90-minute-debate. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, said Biden ""had to buy his boss a week until the next debate, and he did that tonight."" ""He wasn't charming Joe Biden tonight, that wasn't his mission,"" Castellanos said. Ryan repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the Obama-Biden record of the last four years, arguing the administration's policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation's standing and influence in the world. For his part, Biden tried to frame the election as a choice between differing directions for the country by contending policies of the Romney-Ryan ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues such as gay rights and abortion. Martha Raddatz of ABC News aggressively moderated the debate, challenging both candidates on some claims and moving on to various topics covering both domestic and foreign policy. Unlike Obama last week, Biden made sure to mention Romney's controversial comments secretly recorded at a May fundraiser in which the former Massachusetts governor spoke of 47% of Americans who depend on government benefits and won't vote Republican. ""Romney points out 47% of the people won't take responsibility,"" Biden said. ""... He's talking about the people that have built this country. All they're looking for is an even shot."" In the biggest laugh line of the night, Ryan conceded Romney didn't express the thought exactly as he wanted at the fundraiser, then needled the gaffe-prone Biden by saying: ""I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."" Biden immediately responded ""but I always say what I mean,"" later adding that if anyone thought Romney's ""little soliloquy on the 47%"" was just a misstatement, ""then I think you're ... I've got a bridge to sell you."" Ryan, the conservative congressman from Wisconsin, criticized Obama's administration for its failure to protect four Americans killed in the Libya attack last month, and for mixed messages about what transpired. Where they stand: Candidates and issues . ""This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself. But unfortunately it's indicative of a larger problem,"" Ryan said, adding that illustrated an unraveling of the administration's foreign policy. Biden smiled and shook his head as Ryan delivered his criticism, then responded that ""not a single thing he said was accurate."" On Iran, widely backed international sanctions pushed by Obama and backed by allies have devastated the Tehran economy, Biden said. He rejected assertions that Obama failed to work closely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that the United States lacked commitment to a possible military strike to prevent Iran from becoming capable of developing a nuclear weapon. ""This president doesn't bluff,"" Biden said. Ryan, however, insisted that Iran was closer now to having a nuclear weapon than it was four years ago, blaming the administration for allowing that to happen. He bluntly said that Tehran must not be allowed to become a nuclear power. Biden to stump in Ryan's backyard after debate . ""This is the world's largest sponsor of terrorism,"" he said. ""And if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the neighborhood will pursue nuclear weapons as well. We can't live with that."" Opinion: Ryan should speak for the millennials . Last week, Obama was chided for being passive, and polls conducted after the debate indicate the White House race is now extremely tight ahead of the election. Key surveys indicate that Obama and Romney are knotted up in the battleground states of Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin and Colorado. Most experts believe that nine swing states will determine the next president.

"(AOL Autos)  -- Gotcha! That's how many motorists feel when they see a little bright flash, which they know means an unwelcome fine and points on their license are heading their way. Motorists are debating whether speed cameras like these make roads safer or just stick people with useless fines. But how has the steadily increasing rollout of speed cameras in some 35 cities and more than 300 communities nationwide affected drivers? Do motorists welcome the safety enforcement or think they've been conned into paying a needless fine? More importantly, do speed cameras make our roads any safer? Perceptions in the press . Speeders that make the nightly news are either famous or unusual. Like Jennifer Bittone, 24, of Las Vegas, who was arrested in June in Scottsdale, Arizona, over some 22 speeding tickets issued in her name in just two months on one stretch of Loop 101. Or the Chicago Bulls' No.1 draft pick, Derrick Rose who was fined more than $1,000 in July for broaching 100 mph on a Chicago freeway. Or the UK motorist who gained international notoriety in May due to speed-camera pictures of him -- perhaps unadvisedly -- mooning the camera. AOL Autos: Celebrity cars you can afford . But the speeding issue, while occasionally titillating, is deadly serious. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that speed is a factor in about a third of all traffic deaths, which total about 13,000 annually. Speed cameras, as Wikipedia points out, were first used in Texas in 1986. In 2006, Scottsdale, became the first U.S. location to demonstrate the effectiveness of fixed speed cameras on a major highway, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. AOL Autos: Fast, fuel-efficient cars . Empirical studies . Russ Rader, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is funded by auto insurers with the mission of researching ways to reduce crashes, says the group is widely in favor of speed cameras. He said IIHS studies, and many similar reports conducted overseas, have proven their effectiveness. ""What the study found in Scottsdale, was that after they began the implementation of the pilot program, which is now a permanent program, the proportion of drivers traveling more than 10 mph over the speed limit dropped by 90 percent, and we found similar a response in Montgomery County in D.C., [where it] declined by 70 percent."" AOL Autos: Cars with the most thrill per gallon . ""It's human behavior 101: If drivers believe there's a high likelihood of getting a ticket, they're more likely to slow down. Speeding is a major factor in highway crashes."" The flip side . Common arguments against the cameras suggest that while speed cameras will cut speeds, this can lead to ""bunching,"" which can result in more accidents if drivers are taken by surprise by others slowing down quickly to avoid a fine. Anecdotally, this argument sounds convincing. Empirically, however, the argument is nearly impossible to prove. A 2005 review from the IIHS analyzed data from 14 studies and found crash reductions in the immediate vicinities of camera sites, ranging from 5 to 69 percent for all crashes, 12 to 65 percent for injury crashes, and 17 to 71 percent for fatal crashes. AOL Autos: Fast cars over 600 HP . Chad Dornsife, formerly of the National Motorists Association and now head of the Oregon-based Best Highway Safety Practices Institute, an advocacy group for ""fact-based safety policies,"" disagrees. ""There's a direct correlation between congestion and flow factors and accidents,"" he said. ""[The] biggest problems are where backups occur. Cameras destroy the flow of the road. Any time a driver hits the brake, and the one after him, you completely destroy the flow and capacity of the road."" He said that most speed cameras are catching drivers driving fast at night, which is the safest time of the day to drive since here is less traffic and roads frequently are clear. Dornsife cited German autobahns as an example of safe, uniform, free-flowing traffic. ""Everybody is worried about speed cameras and how they are used,"" he said. ""None of it has anything to do with safety. Bottom line is: it's all about money."" Enforcement . As well as raising revenue, a speed-camera system can free up officers from patrol duties to concentrate on other beats (which leads to criticism that police may be less inclined to patrol a section of road with a camera, leading to fewer arrests of drunken or reckless drivers). AOL Autos: 10 hot, small cars . Of course, the volume of fines usually has to pay court fees and cover the installation of the expensive network and its upkeep. Where camera systems are illegal . In California, photographic speed camera systems are illegal. This year, the city of San Jose was ordered to abandon its system as it relied on an image of the driver, which is proscribed by state law as a result of privacy concerns, leaving the city to settle millions of dollars of fines it handed out. Photo imaging is also illegal in Arkansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Red-light cameras at junctions are generally permitted in these states. This ban is under threat in California, according to watchdog site Highwayrobbery.net, which says an East L.A. state senator's bill introduced in February ""will remove from VC 21455.5 the requirement that an automated enforcement device be at an intersection, and that will allow the devices to be put on freeways. That change is accomplished by the repositioning of a 7-word phrase in VC 21455.5(a)(2)."" That bill is still making its way through the state legislature. Concerns over speed cameras extend to more privacy issues than just photos. A recent Washington Post story detailed the fact that many convicted for speeding in Maryland had complained about their Social Security records appearing online alongside their driver's license number and citation record. The records have since been removed. Driver perceptions . The UK-based Institute of Advanced Motorists reports that a perception among motorists of unfair camera policy can seriously damage relations between drivers and police. But IIHS spokesman Rader said perceptions in the U.S. are surprisingly positive. ""In the U.S. the assumption is that people don't like speed cameras. But we found in our surveys that, in D.C., 51 percent of drivers favored [speed cameras] and 36 percent apposed them,"" he noted. ""In Montgomery County, 62 percent supported them. In Scottsdale, 63 percent said they were in favor. After the operation began, 77 percent of drivers supported their use. Drivers support programs that make the road safer."" For Better or worse? Speed cameras remain a contentious issue across the U.S. and internationally, where debate still rages in the United Kingdom and Australia. One thing is clear: legislatures and city governments are increasingly expressing interest in speed cameras, seeing them as both increasing safety and revenue in a time when many are facing budgetary holes. And while the general motoring public can probably see both sides of the issue, it may be merely that the system is perceived as being inaccurate or unfair that leads to such fractious debate ... rather than the actual system itself being unfair.","Speed is a factor in a third of all traffic deaths, national highway administration says .

"(CNN) -- Barely holding back his sobs, a 13-year-old boy makes a heart-rending 911 call to the Grove City Police Department in Ohio. ""My dad just killed my mom. He just told me to call you guys,"" the boy is heard telling a 911 dispatcher. ""He just ran outside and killed my mom. And she's laying in the grass in front of the apartment."" The boy's father, Jeremy Roberts, had the boy make the call, police said, after allegedly stabbing his ex-wife to death outside his apartment. Despondent dads driven to kill loved ones . Roberts then calmly got on the phone himself, giving the apartment's address and informing police that the ""only"" weapon -- a knife -- was outside with his ex-wife, Candice Roberts. ""What did you do?"" the dispatcher asks him. ""She's covered in a blanket. You guys will see,"" Roberts responds in an even tone. He can then be heard, on the nearly five-minute 911 call, telling his children that they have a ""good big sister (who) will take care of you guys."" ""I told you that there's a lot of things that you don't understand, and you don't know. And now there's no choice for them to come out,"" Roberts said in the recorded call, without detailing what he meant. Before going to the front door -- and handing the phone back to his 13-year-old son -- Roberts says, ""One more hug. I love you guys."" A small child can be heard crying in the background. The 13-year-old boy can be overheard telling his father, ""I don't want to see you right now."" Roberts, 38, is in custody and will be charged with murder in connection with his ex-wife's death, police said. The victim had gone to the suspect's apartment in Grove City, about 10 miles southwest of Columbus, before 9 a.m. Sunday to pick up their two children, police said. Afterward, the 13-year-old boy phoned police to tell them his mother was dead and his father was responsible. Candice Roberts' 16-year-old daughter told CNN affiliate WCMH she feels ""incomplete and abandoned"" after the death of her mother, who she said ""was always there for me.""

"(CNN) -- One poker player gave new meaning to the saying ""throwing money down the drain."" Christian Lusardi, 42, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, flushed $2.7 million worth of counterfeit poker chips down the toilet in a room at Harrah's Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey state police said. He was arrested over the weekend, police said. Lusardi disposed of the fake chips he was using during the Winter Poker Open's ""Big Stack, No Limit Hold 'Em"" event at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, police said. Tournament personnel found 160 of the counterfeit poker chips -- each with a value of $5,000, for a total of $800,000 -- among the genuine casino chips, police said. The discovery in clogged sewer pipes prompted Harrah's to notify Borgata officials. The counterfeit chips forced officials to suspend the event for 24 hours. Soon after, the tournament was canceled. ""This was a very unusual occurrence. It's the first time in Borgata's 10 years that anything like this has happened,"" Joe Lupo, senior vice president of operations at Borgata, told CNN.

"Washington (CNN) -- The CIA has revealed it once considered creating and using a very different type of weapon in the fight against terrorism: a doll. An Osama bin Laden action figure with an evil-looking face. The spy agency began quietly developing the bin Laden doll in 2005, as first reported by The Washington Post, and recruited the help of the former head of the Hasbro toy company, Donald Levine. Levine helped develop the G.I. Joe action figure. The CIA's proposed plan, according to the newspaper, was to produce the dolls, with their bright red faces and spooky green eyes, and hand them out to children in Afghanistan in hopes of turning them away from the al Qaeda leader. But the agency aborted the plan after reviewing three prototypes of the doll, a CIA spokesman told CNN. ""The action figure idea was proposed and rejected by CIA before it got past the prototype stage,"" said Dean Boyd, CIA spokesman. ""To our knowledge, there were only three individual action figures ever created and these were merely to show what a final product might look like. After being presented with these examples, the CIA declined to pursue this idea and did not produce or distribute any of these action figures. Furthermore, the CIA has no knowledge of these action figures being produced or distributed by others.""","The CIA developed prototypes for an Osama bin Laden action figure in 2005 .

"(CNN) -- In every medical drama the scene is the same: The surgeon carefully places the delicate organ in a cooler filled with ice and snaps the lid shut. The transplant team then sprints toward the door, hoping to reach its patient in time. That speed isn't just for dramatic effect. Transplant teams rush because they have less than eight hours to transport the organ to the operating room, prepare it for surgery and implant it into the recipient's body. ""Beyond that time, there is significant injury to the (organ), which makes it unusable,"" said Dr. Abbas Ardehali, director of UCLA's heart and lung transplant program. Placing healthy organs in the same container we use to keep soda cold at a picnic seems archaic. But until recently, it was the only option hospitals had. That changed with heart-in-a-box. In 2006, surgeons in Europe transplanted the first heart using the TransMedics Organ Care System, a portable device that kept the heart ""alive"" -- beating, with blood and oxygen flowing through it -- during transport. In 2011, doctors began successfully transplanting lungs using a similar device. While the system has been approved for use in Europe -- more than 200 live organ transplants have been completed to date -- clinical trials are still wrapping up in the United States. Interim results from those studies are being presented at the annual International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation meeting in Montreal this week. Approximately 60% of lung recipients die in the first five years following surgery due to complications, according to the National Institutes of Health; scientists hope to change that statistic with this new technology. Woman needs 4 organs to survive . There are three potential benefits to keeping donor organs ""alive,"" said Ardehali, who is UCLA's principal investigator for one of the studies. The first is obvious: Organs that are kept warm and functioning instead of being placed on ice have less damage, so the recipient's body doesn't have to work as hard to accept it, Ardehali said. That may improve patient outcomes. Doctors measure a lung transplant patient's ""primary graft dysfunction"" in the days following surgery, said Neal Beswick, vice president of global marketing for TransMedics. That's basically an indicator of how well the new lungs are working. Past studies have shown that patients with high grades of graft dysfunction in the first 48 hours have a higher risk of organ rejection and early mortality later on, Beswick said. Preliminary results from the U.S. breathing lung transplant studies suggest this new method significantly reduces primary graft dysfunction. Patients who underwent live organ transplants during the study also spent less time on a mechanical ventilator, less time in the intensive care unit and had fewer lung-related complications. The portable transplant system also enables doctors to keep organs outside the body longer, giving hospitals the opportunity to share them across a larger geographic region. More than 114,000 people in the United States are awaiting organ donations, according to Organdonor.gov; 18 of them die each day without a donation. Iraq vet undergoes successful double-arm transplant . ""We'd like to increase lung transplantation by a factor of three,"" Beswick said. ""And we think that we could double the number of heart transplants without any increase in the number of organ donors."" Eventually, scientists may even be able to improve donor organs that would otherwise be discarded, Ardehali said. Currently, 75 to 80% of donor lungs are rejected because they are infected or have too much damage, he said. If doctors are able to keep the lungs, or other organs, alive outside the body for several days, they may be able to clear up any infection with antibiotics or improve the organs' resilience. It's a bit of ""science fiction"" right now, Beswick said, but doctors in the future could even use the TransMedics device to fight chronic diseases. For example, if doctors could remove the lungs of a stage IV cancer patient and attack the organs with radiation outside the body, they could potentially place the same cancer-free lungs back in the patient a few days later, effectively eliminating the need for donor lungs at all. ""A lot of things become real become real if the organ can be sustained for a long period of time,"" Beswick said. Hospitals pay approximately 45,000 euros -- or $58,000 -- for each TransMedic Organ Care System. While the hardware can be reused, the organ chamber must be disposed of after each transplant, Beswick said. ""It's a relatively high cost per patient."" TransMedic hopes to finish the U.S. heart trial in the next 90 days; the lung trial should be done by the end of the year. The company then hopes to submit their device to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval.

"(CNN) -- ""Raed, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, is scared. The lightning and storms outside remind him of the sounds of bombs he heard when he was back in Syria."" -- World Vision report . Raed's school was bombed right after he and his friends had left for the day. Soon his house was also destroyed. Raed's father, Ahmed, hoped that life in Syria would improve, but it didn't. He told World Vision in a recent report, ""Every minute in Syria posed a threat to the lives of my family. Massacres happened in front of our eyes. I had to get them out of there."" Ahmed led Raed and the rest of his family to Lebanon where they are now refugees. As recent reports out of Syria confirm, other families have been unable to escape in time. According to World Vision responders in the region and now the U.S. State Department, armed groups on both sides of the conflict have forced children Raed's age and younger to work as combatants, porters, messengers and to perform other support tasks. Syria is one of many countries where the use of and violations against children in conflict have become chronic. This week the U.S. Government released its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. This thorough report is a shining example of U.S. global leadership in the fight against modern day slavery around the world and in the US. The report is a critical diplomatic tool to engage countries and enable them to improve their own fight against trafficking. It also makes it possible to go beyond words: If a country is in the lowest tiered ranking, sanctions can be applied. A lot of ink and bandwidth will focus on the U.S. TIP report this week and what the U.S. and countries around the world are doing -- or are not doing -- in the fight against modern day slavery. Yet buried in the TIP Report, there is one page that is often unnoticed. It is a list of countries found to be using children in their national armies or in government-supported paramilitary groups. The Child Soldier Prevention Act (CSPA) of 2008 requires the annual TIP Report to include this list. But this year the list is more tragic than in years past, because the number of countries using child soldiers increased from seven in 2012 to 10 in 2013. This is the first time since the passage of the CSPA in 2009 that the number of countries on the list has gone up. The 10 countries are Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Myanmar, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Of those ten countries, the U.S. government gives military aid to seven of them: Chad, DRC, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen, and now the Syrian opposition. That means U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent on armies that use children. The CSPA says that any country receiving U.S. military aid and found to be using children in its armed forces will lose key forms of that aid, except that which can help countries demobilize and transition children out of their national armies. Over the past three years, President Obama has issued waivers or partial waivers to all countries that receive U.S. military aid. The intent of the law is to use the waiver authority only in extreme circumstances. Instead, waivers have become the default reaction of this administration and thus our best tool is being kept unused in the toolbox. When you keep your best tool in the tool box, it gets rusty and useless. These countries need support to help end the widespread use of child soldiers and change takes time. Nevertheless, they continue to exploit children in their militaries, and the United States refuses to show the will necessary to enforce the law that took effect just three years ago. If the U.S. government is going to put pressure on countries like Russia and China as seen in this year's TIP Report, why would it not pressure governments using children to fight for them? The United Nations has set a deadline of 2016 for all countries to stop recruiting and using children to fight in the military. So far the UN has signed Action Plans to accomplish that goal with each of the violating countries listed in the TIP Report. However, Action Plans are just words on paper. If we are going to realize the goal of stopping the use of children as weapons of war, then the U.S. needs to actually use its leadership and the tools we have at our disposal. They've already taken a step with DRC. Just this week Secretary Kerry appointed former Senator Russ Feingold as the new Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa. Senator Feingold was an original supporter of the CSPA and his engagement in the region will mean a great deal for the work in Rwanda and DRC. Now it's time for the U.S. to be just as strategic with the other countries on the list. In Syria, the TIP Report points out that the Syrian army and the opposition are using children as fighters, porters, and even executioners. What's more, there are now nearly six million refugee and internally displaced people from Syria and many of them are children. As a recent report from the Child Soldier Initiative points out, the likelihood a child will be forcibly recruited to fight in an armed group increases dramatically if that child is a refugee or internally displaced. It's a likelihood that's all too real for Raed and thousands of children just like him. The U.S. continues to show its leadership in fighting human trafficking when it comes to sexual and labor exploitation. It's time for the U.S. government to do the same thing for children used as weapons of war. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- The World Cup is apparently making a lot of people ""ill"" in China. Football fans are preparing for the kick off the biggest sporting event of the year by purchasing fake sick notes online. Most World Cup matches will take place in Brazil when it is past midnight in China, or in the early hours between 3 and 6 a.m. The schedule has Chinese media dramatically referring to this year's competition as ""the World Cup with the greatest time difference in history."" To catch those pre-dawn games, fans are resorting to claiming sick leave by purchasing fake doctor's notes through e-commerce sites such as Taobao. Standard pads of sick notes have always been available on the site, for as little as RMB 1 ($0.16) per pack. But to get a note that looks authentic, with a hospital's stamp and a convincing diagnostic scrawl from a doctor, it will cost up to RMB 300 ($50) per note, local media reports. One football fan said he was considering purchasing sick leave slips online for the thrill of watching games as they happened. ""Recordings of matches are meaningless, only live broadcasts are fun. If I stay up all night to watch the games, I will be so sleepy the next day and my boss will scold me,"" the man surnamed Liu told Sina News. Direct searches for fake sick notes won't work on e-commerce sites such as Taobao. To get around the illegality of selling fraudulent notes, vendors title their items as ""proof of diagnosis note."" Sina also reported that one online vendor was claiming to offer sick notes with consultation records registered at a Beijing hospital, at double the price of notes without registered records. To prevent employees taking fake sick leave, one IT company in Guangdong province has made a rare offer of three days paid leave to employees who wish to watch World Cup matches, according to local media. Fake sick notes made headlines in China in 2012 when a postal worker in Hong Kong used 130 doctor's notes bought from Taobao to scam more than HK$217,000 (about $28,000) in sick leave allowance as well as 635 days of leave in the span of four years. Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption found pads of blank doctor's notes as well as bogus doctor's stamps at the 40-year-old offender's home.","World Cup matches will take place while most people should be asleep in China .

"(CNN) -- U.S. law enforcement officials believe they may have identified the masked man seen in the ISIS video of the killing of American journalist James Foley, two U.S. officials told CNN. ""They have a pretty good idea of who it may be,"" a U.S. official said. But the official cautioned that ""it's not 100% yet."" Neither official, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, was willing to identify the suspect, citing the ongoing investigation. The official said, ""We've been using all means to identify the person."" That includes voice analysis and analyzing metadata from the video as well as other methods, according to the second U.S. official. The official declined to elaborate on what those other methods were. In late August, British Ambassador Peter Westmacott said his country was close to identifying the ISIS militant. Westmacott didn't elaborate about the identity in the August 26 interview, which aired on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Candy Crowley. ""We're putting a great deal into the search,"" Westmacott said at the time, referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the man's voice. The subject is believed tied to a group of extremists based in London, the officials said. FBI agents have been working with British authorities to nail down who the subject is, a priority for both governments. The same U.S. official said the United Kingdom has investigative interest because the masked man is believed to be a British citizen who traveled overseas to engage in conflict. The United States has investigative interest because he killed an American. Authorities are still trying to determine the identity of the militant speaking in the video of American journalist Steven Sotloff and determine if it is the same person in the Foley video, according to one of the officials. The source said ""it's too premature"" to know with any certainty just one week since the video of Sotloff's death was published. The source said British and American authorities would work together to find the masked man, who is believed to be in Syria. ""This person is in an environment that's highly dangerous. He could meet his demise on the battlefield,"" the official said, though the sources did not rule out bringing the suspect back for trial in British or American court. Foley disappeared on November 22, 2012, in northwest Syria, near the border with Turkey. At the time of his disappearance, he was working for the U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost. The video of his beheading was posted to YouTube on August 19. Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013. The video of his death was posted September 2.","Man with British accent appears in video of Foley's beheading .

"(CNN) -- Lone wolf terror attacks remain a significant threat within the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday, and could occur without warning. ""We have to be vigilant against an independent actor here in the homeland who might choose to strike at any moment,"" Johnson told CNN's Barbara Starr in an interview at the Reagan National Defense Forum Sunday. The threat posed by these potential attackers is nothing new. But Johnson's concerns show how challenging counter-terrorism has become. Just a few years ago, U.S. officials pursued a group that followed more predictable recruitment patterns. ""Core al-Qaeda was a relatively traditional command and control structure where someone would be recruited, they train at an overseas camp and then they'd be sent to commit a terrorist attack,"" Johnson explained. ""The new phenomenon that I see that I'm very concerned about,"" Johnson continued, ""is somebody who has never met another member of that terrorist organization, never trained at one of the camps, who is simply inspired by the social media -- the literature, the propaganda, the message -- to commit an act of violence in this country."" Johnson added that, while the U.S. government has largely been successful in disrupting plots hatched by terrorist cells abroad, catching individuals who are not formally connected requires them to take a different tactic -- relying heavily on state and local law enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security is also turning to religious and community organizations in its fight against extremism, Johnson said. ""I've made this a personal part of my agenda"" he said, ""by traveling to a lot of community-based organizations around the country, many of them Islamic based, and the dialogue is interesting."" ""We have to build trust across the spectrum of issues,"" he continued. ""I don't want to just go there and say, 'I'm here to talk about countering violent extremism. What can you do to help me?'"" Crucially, said Johnson, the government has to offer a competing message to the young men who might otherwise be drawn in by the extremist rhetoric they see online. This as groups like ISIS develop increasingly sophisticated social media and propaganda arms that strive to recruit western jihadists. ""I think that some men, some young men may be inclined to turn in that direction,"" said Johnson. ""We're seeing that obviously and so we have to offer a counter narrative. We have to offer a counter vision and so we need public participation in that.""","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says lone wolfs could strike without warning .

"(CNN) -- Everyone has their Denzel Washington moment. It might have happened while watching his first Oscar-winning role in 1989's ""Glory."" Or maybe it was sparked during 1992's ""Malcolm X"" biopic. It might've even taken you as long as 2001's ""Training Day."" But whenever it happened, even the most casual moviegoer can point to the movie -- and sometimes, the specific scene -- that made them realize Washington is a singularly gifted actor. Now nearing 60, Washington is still impressing at the box office, as his new action movie, ""The Equalizer,"" is predicted to open at No. 1. Washington has been acting onscreen for close to 40 years and has filled almost every role possible, from icon and soldier to ladies' man and villain. In ""The Equalizer,"" he slips back into the shoes of the avenger, playing a seemingly mild-mannered book lover who's also more than willing to execute bad guys when a young prostitute he has befriended (Chloe Grace Moretz) gets hurt. The movie itself has gotten mixed reviews, but critics agree that it's Washington that makes the running time worth it. ""Washington keeps you watching this sleazy stuff -- let's stipulate to that before anything else,"" said The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern. For The New York Times, Washington's ""craft and discipline endow even exploitative nonsense like this with a center of gravity."" ""The Equalizer"" may not inspire another Denzel moment for fans, but one thing's clear: the gift still stands.","Denzel Washington is back at the box office this weekend .

"(CNN) -- The short lives of disposable tableware: convenient, yet wasteful. In a Japanese fishing town, Hekinan, 300 kilometers west from Tokyo, a small family business is offering a greener alternative. Smart Business meets Sakakibara Katsuhiko, who's innovating in the world of edible crockery. CNN: How did you first come up with the concept of edible tableware? Sakakibara Katsuhiko: When I go to food festivals, I see bins filled with garbage, and I wondered if our manufacturing technology could do something to change it. So we decided to go beyond ice cream cones and to develop plates that are edible. The key question was how to strengthen the waterproof-ness for the plates. CNN: You currently use shrimp, salt and potato starch to create the plates. Do you plan to develop their flavor further? SK: We are going to create a variety of flavors for the plates so that people can pair them with more food. I think it would be interesting if we could also make edible knives and folks. That would really cut down the waste. CNN: What are your ambitions for the future of the company? SK: Japan will host the Tokyo Olympic Games in six years' time, and I want to provide edible plates for the Games (in 2020). CNN: How do you see Marushige Seika K.

"(CNN) -- A one-time American-based Islamic group cannot sue the government over claims it was targeted by the government's once-secret Terrorist Surveillance Program, a federal court has ruled. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday unanimously tossed out a lawsuit by the now-closed Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation. The federal government had listed the Ashland, Oregon, chapter as a supporter of terrorism in 2004. The group sued, saying its private overseas communications were unconstitutionally being monitored under the Bush administration's warrantless wiretap program. That spy program was unveiled in a 2005 New York Times article that said government officials were working with private telecom companies to secretly monitor telephone and e-mail traffic of targeted individuals and groups, both domestic and international. Federal officials later publicly acknowledged the existence of the program, which was then officially authorized by Congress in 2008. ""This case effectively brings to an end the plaintiffs' ongoing attempts to hold the Executive Branch responsible for intercepting telephone conversations without judicial authorization,"" said the appeals court. The decision overturns a federal judge's earlier award of more than $2.5 million to attorneys working for Al-Haramain. At issue was whether the federal government was liable from such suits. The Bush administration in 2008 had separately granted the telecom companies ""retroactive immunity"" from any lawsuits. The appeals court said Congress had never waived immunity for government officials over alleged state eavesdropping, even if constitutional rights were violated as a result of improper government conduct. ""Al-Haramain can bring a suit for damages against the United States for use of the collected information, but cannot bring suit against the government for collection of the information itself,"" the court concluded. ""Although such a structure may seem anomalous and even unfair, the policy judgment is one for Congress, not the courts."" The Islamic foundation said two of its U.S.-based lawyers had their telephone conversations with clients in Saudi Arabia secretly monitored, without a judge's prior approval. Lawyers for the group said they were in a Catch-22, unable to prove the government used the information from the wiretaps against Al-Haramain, after the government cited national security and state secrets. While ruling for the government, the appeals court sharply criticized Justice Department lawyers who had claimed in court papers the plaintiffs were engaged in ""game-playing"" by continuing their lawsuit for years. ""In light of the complex, ever-evolving nature of this litigation, and considering the significant infringement on individual liberties that would occur if the Executive Branch were to disregard congressionally-mandated procedures for obtaining judicial authorization of international wiretaps, the charge of 'game-playing' lobbed by the government is as careless as it is inaccurate,"" said Judge Margaret McKeown, writing on behalf of her two colleagues. The case is al-Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Obama (No. 11-15468).","Al-Haramain said its overseas communications were illegally monitored .

"(CNN) -- Go to Amazon.com and the link is right there at the top, nestled between ""Gift Cards"" and ""Help."" Chances are, you haven't noticed it in your frenzy to find the perfect potato peeler. But if you click it, a whole different world of Amazon opens up, one where stuff flows away from you rather than to you. That link reads ""Sell."" Last year, about a billion items sold on Amazon weren't sold by Amazon itself but by other sellers who make their merchandise available on the site. One of them is Bernie Thompson, a former Microsoft engineer who worked to ensure the Windows operating system played nicely with USB, the standard means of connecting peripherals to PCs and laptops. Thompson now runs his own business, Plugable Technologies, which makes a variety of USB and Bluetooth hardware, from charging stations to docks that connect tablets to desktop monitors. With fewer than 100 employees, the company isn't huge. But Thompson has no trouble running a truly global business. In 2006, Amazon launched a service that allowed U.S. sellers to use its network of warehouses to ship their goods. More recently, Jeff Bezos and company have rolled out the Fulfillment by Amazon program globally, enabling entrepreneurs like Thompson to move goods through fulfillment centers in other parts of the world. ""It really changes the paradigm when you're able to ship the goods in bulk to a warehouse in Europe or Japan and have those goods be fulfilled in one day or two days,"" Thompson says. Why are we so fat? The multimillion-dollar scientific quest to find out . While not all merchants are thrilled with their experience selling on Amazon, the company's logistical network has enormous reach and breadth. A guy like Thompson can click that ""sell"" link and -- without much time or effort -- get his hardware nearly anywhere in the world. In effect, he becomes a ""micro-exporter."" Amazon's global selling program, which has evolved along with the rest of its international footprint in recent years, works much like its domestic counterpart in the United States. Merchants can use the site to make their inventory available to purchase anywhere Amazon sells. But the real power of the system doesn't come into play until merchants also opt to use Amazon to fulfill and ship its orders, as Thompson does. Merchants in the United States who want to expand globally can list their products in Amazon's nine international Amazon marketplaces -- the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, India, China, Japan, and Canada. As they do domestically, sellers can export their goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses in those hubs. From those, Amazon says it ships goods to about 180 countries around the world. ""The small seller suddenly has access to the global marketplace,"" says Tom Taylor, Amazon's vice president of seller services. Taylor says the power of global selling and shipping is huge. Goods from sellers targeting only U.S. consumers can be seen by about 100 million potential customers. Expand that reach globally and the number of potential customers grows to 250 million. And it's not just U.S. merchants selling globally. Taylor says sellers from 89 countries use Fulfillment by Amazon to sell goods to U.S. customers. But the advantages Amazon gains by enabling micro-exports extend beyond the fees charged for its services. As Taylor puts it, a global network of small sellers can be incredibly nimble in response to shifts in demand around the world. Sellers can move their inventory from one hub to another according to their perceptions of where demand is greatest. Unexpected shooting targets used by the world's armies . The result is a global agility for Amazon without the need to pull levers itself. An army of sellers becomes deputized to build out the long tail of global retail. ""We often can see patterns in what they're doing faster than what we see in our own business,"" Taylor says. For Thompson, the ability to send bulk inventory to cross-border hubs saves money compared to shipping individual packages overseas, an approach he says is less error-prone than shipping piecemeal. ""We basically get the leverage, the huge scale that Amazon has in negotiating with shipping partners,"" he says. Outsourcing everything from taking and shipping orders to converting currencies, accepting payments, and handling taxes lets Plugable focus on customer service, which Thompson calls a key way to set itself apart in the crowded gadget market. Turnkey global selling and shipping also lets Plugable take the temperature of truly global demand before committing to any inventory at all. Thompson runs ideas for new products through Kickstarter, which not only allows Plugable to see what consumers want but where in the world demand is strongest. If the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, he says, he divides up the inventory of new products rolling off the assembly line according to relative demand in different parts of the globe. Instead of sending individual orders all over the world, Plugable ships in bulk to the international hubs where Amazon has facilities. From those locations, most of the world opens up to Thompson and his business -- a scale he says his business needs in order to make it. ""They're very cool products and very cool technologies, but they're a bit niche-y,"" Thompson says of his USB lines. ""If you were selling on just local channels, there's not enough of a market to justify the costs."" Read more from WIRED: . What's inside Sriracha that makes it so delicious?

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's online marketplace Taobao is offering buyers the chance to look like a world leader -- for less than $30.

And it's not all about the male leaders -- the longer Chinese button down jackets and traditional long dresses emblazoned with floral embroidery worn by female leaders and the spouses of their male counterparts are also for sale. Some shops are taking made-to-fit orders, with many vendors displaying photos of Obama wearing the suit next to their products. Trending?

""I had one of the worst things you could ever have. It really bugs me; it really actually bothers me because I don't smoke, I barely drink, I don't touch drugs.

In the instructional movie, director Drake asked four of the, ahem, biggest men in pornography for their secrets and tricks on how to please a woman. Evan Stone, Steven St. Croix and Sean Michaels answered interview questions and later demonstrated their techniques. At the end of Jeremy's interview, the camera pans out to reveal he's already getting some action. Although he has shot more than 2,000 movies over his 30-plus year career, the 59-year-old Jeremy modestly cleared the room for his scene. ""I was nervous,"" he says. ""Blood pressure medicine can affect the penis. I'm taking blood pressure medicine now and I was able to do it, but my scenes aren't as good as they used to be. I don't get the full massive. If I could be so specific, CNN, it bends a little. But it felt good being back in the saddle."" ""I'm really grateful that Ron Jeremy could be here with us today,"" Drake says. ""I'd like to pick his brain some more, but I wanted to go easy on him. I was really worried about having him on the set. When he was getting (oral sex), I was really watching; watching his breathing, watching his face. Everything."" With two operations, medication and successfully climbing the two flights of stairs required to green-light his return to work (""What'd I do? I walked up three just to prove a point""), doctors seem confident he'll be OK. Still, Jeremy now has to think about his performance above the belt, too. ""I look at exotic locations where I used to host shows, from Jamaica to Key West. I'm still planning on doing it, but it's scary,"" he says. ""What if I'm on a plane and something happens? You can't say, 'is there a doctor in the house?' It has to be an aortic doctor. They told me to walk around the plane every hour and I said, great, I'm gonna be that guy. There's always a guy that bangs into your elbow, and we all hate that guy."" Whether it's the result of a brush with mortality or simply wanting credit where it's due, the entertainment industry veteran and guest star in many mainstream movies, TV shows and music videos, is keenly aware of his fame. He rattles off his name-check by Seth MacFarlane at the Academy Awards, Grammy parties he was scheduled to attend, press mentions from TMZ and Jay Leno and celebrity well-wishers like Gene Simmons and Macy Gray. In the hospital, he says he was thinking about the Rainbow Bar and Grill, an LA institution, where, incidentally, his rum is sold. ""I thought, I can get in my car and drive over there.

"(CNN) -- American Ted Ligety served notice he will be the man to beat in his favored giant slalom discipline with an emphatic victory in the season opener in Soelden Sunday. The triple world champion was claiming his third straight win in World Cup giant slalom races and making it a hat-trick at the Austrian venue, matching Austrian legend Hermann Maier. Ligety, nicknamed 'Ted Shred', had left his rivals in tatters last year as he won by an astonishing 2.75 seconds, but this time around he had to settle for a closer margin over second placed Alexis Pinturault of France and home hope Marcel Hirscher. ""I'm super psyched to win this today,"" Ligety told the official FIS website after clocking one minute 59.50 seconds for the two legs. ""It wasn't easy conditions on the second run it was dark and bumpy, but any day you win it's a good day, so I can't complain."" Pinterault finished 0.79 seconds adrift with Hirscher just over a second slower than Ligety, who won the last two races of the 2012-13 season. ""I hope to be able to have a season close to what I had last year,"" Ligety added. ""But repeating what I did last year in giant slalom is going to be difficult and I don't expect to be winning the races by the same margins."" Sunday's race was the start of the journey to the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year and also marked the return of American favorite Bode Miller. The 36-year-old has not raced for 18 months but despite an unfavorable starting position he was able to finish in 19th place. ""My knee feels better than it has since 2001,"" said Miller. ""Once I made a decision not to race last year, it took a lot of pressure off and I could focus my recovery.""

"(CNN) -- Few issues divide people more sharply than abortion. So it is great news when recently lawmakers across the political aisle in Britain voted 181 to 1 to ban sex-selective abortion. The overwhelming support for banning abortion of a fetus based on its gender is progressive, moral and just. But what about gendercide -- the practice of killing baby girls, whether aborted or neglected after birth? Surely, there is no room for disagreement on the need to end gendercide. For every woman who freely chooses to abort a girl, there are countless others who are being forced to do so because of strong cultural preference for son. The sex-selective abortion of baby girls is not a pro-choice or a pro-life issue. It is a human rights issue that must be approached as an area of common ground. It is a woman's right to give birth to her daughter. For most of us, hearing ""it's a girl"" during a pregnancy ultrasound is cause for celebration. But in many countries, this phrase can be a death sentence. In fact, the words, ""it's a girl"" are the deadliest words on earth when heard during pregnancy. According to a U.N. estimate, up to 200 million women are missing in the world today due to gendercide. In China, the birth ratio of girls to boys is the most skewed in the world -- approximately 100 girls born for every 118 boys. When couples are restricted to one child, women often become the focus of intense pressure by their husband and in-laws to give birth to a boy. A woman need not be dragged out of her home and strapped down to a table to be a victim of forced abortion. Crushing social, economic, political and personal pressures in cultures with a strong son preference trample women who are pregnant with a girl. All too often, women in these cultures do not ""choose"" their daughters for abortion. They are forced. The ""Terracotta Daughters"" exhibit recently on view in New York City gave dramatic visual form to the girls that have been lost to the world through sex-selective abortion -- the haunting stares of an army of the dead. Because of gendercide, there are an estimated 37 million more men than women in China. As a result, the presence of ""excess males"" is one of the driving forces behind human trafficking and sexual slavery, not only in China but in surrounding nations as well. Alarmingly, China also has the highest female suicide rate of any country in the world. According to the U.S. State Department China Human Rights Report, the number of female suicides has risen sharply in recent years, from 500 women per day to a staggering 590. I believe that this grim statistic may be in some ways related to pressure on women to selectively abort or abandon their daughters. In India, the sex ratio at birth is 112 boys born for every 100 girls born. Indian girls, moreover, die of disease and neglect at a much higher rate than boys. Impoverished women in India are often manipulated or pressured into sterilization, which is one way of population control. There are even mass ""sterilization camps"" where women sometimes die of complications. Just this week, in Chhattisgarh, one of India's poorest areas, 11 out of 83 women who were sterilized died. This is the true ""war on women"" on a global scale. That one-third of the world's women -- those living in China and India -- are deprived of their right to bear girls is the biggest women's rights abuse on earth. These women deserve a passionate response from groups that stand for women's rights. Yet the response of the U.S. women's rights community has ranged from tepid to confused. My organization, Women's Rights Without Frontiers, has launched the ""Save a Girl"" campaign in rural China, and we are stopping gendercide, one baby girl at a time. We have fieldworkers in China who reach out to women who have learned that they are pregnant with or have just given birth to a girl, and are being pressured to abort or abandon her. A fieldworker will visit that woman and say, ""Don't abort or abandon your baby just because she's a girl. She's a precious daughter. We will give you a monthly stipend for a year to help you support her."" The practical support we offer empowers these women to keep their daughters. Our effort has helped more than 120 families keep their daughters. We plan to launch a ""Save a Girl"" campaign in India in 2015 as well. Every struggling mother in China and India deserves help to keep her daughter. Together, we can end gendercide one girl at a time and sweep sex-selective abortion into the dung-heap of history, where it belongs.","The British Parliament recently voted 181 to 1 to ban sex-selective abortion .

"(CNN) -- Interested in a lunch-hour swim, free from the office, in a big open-air pool with warm sand between your toes, palm trees swaying in the breeze and a cool drink close at hand? If the answer's yes, consider Brisbane, Australia, one of the world's most livable cities, according to a 2014 Monocle Magazine index. Unique among Australia's major cities, sunny Brisbane has a beach right on the doorstep of its central business district. Its setting is South Bank, the lively entertainment and cultural precinct that -- as the name implies -- sits on the south bank of the Brisbane River. This is where the city comes for recreation and entertainment, to eat and drink at casual riverside restaurants and bars, listen to impromptu music shows, ride a giant Ferris wheel, check out street artists and nighttime light shows, take in a formal concert at the performing arts center and visit art galleries and the state museum and library. G20 weekend . Apart from being the favorite of city workers, students and families, South Bank is also the main venue for the biggest event Brisbane has hosted in years: the G20 Leaders' Summit gathering of global political and business leaders in mid-November that will see 4,000 delegates and 3,000 journalists pour into the city. Along with U.S. President Barack Obama, world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, India's Narendra Modi, Japan's Shinzo Abe, Indonesia's Joko Widodo, UK's David Cameron, Germany's Angela Merkel and Russia's Vladimir Putin are scheduled to join Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott on stage at South Bank's Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre for the G20 Leaders' Summit on November 15-16. ""For those few days in November, Brisbane will be the capital of the world,"" Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk tells CNN. South Bank . All those politicians, business people and journalists have got to eat, drink and get happy at the end of their deliberations. In Brisbane they'll find plenty of places. Within South Bank itself, the Gallery of Modern Art Restaurant (Stanley Place, Cultural Precinct, South Bank; +61 7 3840 7303) is normally one of the best lunch venues. Along with other institutions in the cultural precinct, the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art will be closed on November 14, 15 and 16 during the G20 Leaders' Summit. For dinner it's hard to beat Stokehouse Brisbane (on the river at South Bank on Sidon Street; +61 7 3020 0600), near the maritime museum at the other end of South Bank. Next door to the convention center on Grey Street is one of the city's liveliest new beer outlets, The Charming Squire (133 Grey St., South Brisbane; +61 7 3077 7254). Two other great spots in South Bank are The Sangria Bar (Shop B12 Little Stanley Street, South Bank, Brisbane; +61 7 3846 1201), rated this year's ""Best Bar with Food"" by the Brisbane Times Good Food Guide, and Bacchus (corner of Grey and Glenelg Streets, South Bank; +61 7 3364 0837), rated the restaurant with this year's best wine list. Central Business District . Across the river in the CBD, there's no shortage of high-end diners, led by chef Ryan Squire's brilliant Esquire (145 Eagle St,, Brisbane; +61 07 3220 2123). According to the restaurant, ""the degustation menu evolves daily, driven by the availability of the best local produce that day and hand picked by the team of skilled craftsmen, the chefs, who work swiftly in the kitchen."" Other can't-miss choices include the highly creative Alejandro Cancino's Urbane (181 Mary St., Brisbane; +61 07 3229 2271) and the classy Aria Brisbane (1 Eagle St., Brisbane; +61 7 3233 2555), the northern edition of celebrity chef Matt Moran's original Aria in Sydney. Power brokers on a modest budget find Moo Moo (Stamford Plaza, 39 Edward St., Brisbane; +61 7 3236 4500), near where President Obama and his team are expected to stay, delivers the goods. One of the city's best-loved seafood restaurants is Gambaro's (33 Caxton St., Petrie Terrace, Brisbane; +61 7 3369 9500). The restaurant site has been completely rebuilt and now includes a Gambaro's Hotel. Across the road, the family that owns Gambaro's has added steak to its repertoire, with the smart new Black Hide Steakhouse (36 Caxton St., Petrie Terrace, Brisbane; +61 7 3369 9500) winning accolades for the quality of its cuts. West End and Fortitude Valley . Beyond South Bank and the CBD, some of the city's best cafes, bars and clubs are found in West End and Fortitude Valley, locales that come alive at night. Gordita Bar & Restaurant (11b/100 McLachlan St., Fortitude Valley, Brisbane; +61 7 3666 0605) is a Valley favorite serving ""wholesome Southern Spanish food along with a wine list so fat with artisanal wines from around the world you can practically feel it groaning in your hands."" For Asian noodles of any description, Kwan Brothers (43 Alfred St., Fortitude Valley, Brisbane; +61 7 3251 6588) is the obvious choice. Craft beers are the call at Yard Bird Ale House (6/24 Martin St., Fortitude Valley, Brisbane; +61 7 3852 6413) and Archive Beer Boutique (100 Boundary St., West End, Brisbane; +61 7 3844 3419). Away from the city . When it's time for sun, a city-side alternative to South Bank is the City Botanic Gardens, which link government buildings and a Queensland University of Technology campus with the city proper. Getting around on foot or bicycle is easy. Buses operate from a couple of key points in the city, including below the Queen Street Mall, from the Brisbane Transit Centre on Roma Street and from South Bank's bus center. Depending on where you're headed, the ferries plying across and along the Brisbane River make for a pleasant journey. Brisbane is the gateway to two well-known tourist destinations: the glitzy Gold Coast an hour to the south, with its multiple theme parks, canals, long stretches of beach, high-rise apartments, casinos and shopping malls; and the Sunshine Coast an hour to the north, a more casual and less developed array of canals and beaches, with chic Noosa at its northernmost tip regarded as the best place to stay. Two secret natural jewels can be found east of Brisbane, among the islands of Moreton Bay that shield the river mouth from the big swells of the Pacific Ocean. One is Tangalooma on Moreton Island, a 75-minute ferry ride from Brisbane's Holt Street Wharf at Pinkenba, the other is Point Lookout on North Stradbroke Island, about 60 minutes from the Brisbane suburb of Cleveland by water taxi or vehicular ferry, then island bus. Tangalooma offers whale watching from June until late November and the chance to feed dolphins in the wild. Point Lookout not only is one of the best whale-watching spots on the Australian east coast, it's home to a magic surf break that just keeps on delivering wave after wave.","Brisbane, Australia, is one of the world's most livable cities, according to Monocle .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Two children sued Malaysia Airlines and three government agencies Friday over the loss of their father aboard missing Flight 370. Jee Kinson, 13, and Jee Kinnland, 11, named the airline, officials at Malaysia's civil aviation and immigration agencies, and the country's air force chief as responsible for the loss of the jet, which disappeared on March 8. Their father, Jin Jing Hang, 41, was on board the flight bound for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It lost contact with air traffic control over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. Missing for 237 days now, Flight 370 carried 239 people, including 12 crew members. Malaysia, Australia and China are conducting a deep-sea search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, where authorities say they believe it ended up. In the suit, the claimants say the airline breached the agreement with their father for a safe passage when it failed to land in Beijing. The claimants say that air traffic control failed to take sufficient measures to establish contact or to launch a search for MH370 within a reasonable time after it had lost contact with the Boeing 777. The boys, who filed the suit through their mother, Ng Pearl Ming, said the immigration agency had failed to vet passengers properly, resulting in some people with fake identification boarding the flight. Two Iranians with forged Italian and Austrian passports were on the flight, according to authorities. Against the air force chief, the claimants allege that the Malaysian air force failed or neglected to investigate an unscheduled flight, presumed to be MH370, after detecting it. The government of Malaysia was named, as it is the employer and principal of the agencies named in the lawsuit. Civil aviation director Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said he found out about the lawsuit from news websites. ""We just read this from the news websites and have not received anything official yet,"" he said. CNN's attempts to reach other agencies named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful. The claimants are suing for loss of support from their father, who operated an Internet-based business.","Two boys, ages 11 and 13, lost their father aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy was confirmed as winner of the Race to Dubai Sunday despite not lifting a club in anger for six weeks. Victory for American Brooks Koepka in the Turkish Airlines Open -- at the expense of McIlroy's nearest challengers Marcel Siem, Jamie Donaldson and Sergio Garcia -- left the Northern Irishman with an unassailable lead ahead of the DP World Tour Championships in Dubai later this week. It is the second time in three years that McIlroy has ended the season as European number one, having claimed two major titles and a lucrative World Golf Championship event. But eyebrows were raised when the 25-year-old McIlroy said he would sit out the WGC-HSBC Champions and BMW Masters tournaments in China to prepare for a court battle against his former management company. With such a big lead after his earlier triumphs, the world number one judged he afford to miss out on more big pay days, his last appearance on the European Tour coming with a second place at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in the first week of October. Germany's Siem, who won the BMW Masters event, made a brave attempt to win in Turkey to keep the race alive. He started the final round Sunday just a shot off the lead, but could only card a closing 71 to finish tied eighth, with Donaldson 19th and Garcia 25th. Koepka, who lives in Florida, clinched his first European Tour victory with a superb closing 65 on the Montgomerie Maxx Royal course at Antalya to finish 17 under par. It left him a shot clear of England's Ian Poulter, who was left to rue a missed six-foot birdie putt on the 18th to force a playoff. Henrik Stenson of Sweden finished third to move into second in the Race to Dubai standings, but 2,726,514 points behind McIlroy, with 1,666,600 on offer to the winner in Dubai next Sunday. McIlroy will go in search of a search of a second win in three years at Jumeirah Golf Estates, delighted to have wrapped up the Harry Vardon Trophy, awarded to the player who finishes the season as Europe's top player. ""This has obviously been the best season of my career by a long way, and to win the Race to Dubai for the second time really is something truly special,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""That four-week spell over the summer, from the British Open to the US PGA Championship, would have to be the best golf of my life, so I feel like I've really earned the Race to Dubai."" The top 60 players in the Race to Dubai after this week's tournament, with Koepka up to sixth, will play in the $8 million end of season finale.","Brooks Koepka wins Turkish Open title .

"London (CNN) -- Space has come of age, grown up enough to be commercially viable -- or has it? For more than 80 years the BIS has been looking at how we get into, and travel in, space, but the society has concentrated more on the technical achievement or feasibility than on the finance or contractual requirements. From the end of World War II, technologies were very much in the hands of the defense industries and development was funded by the defense departments of national governments. Recognizing the strategic importance of space led to the 'space race' and the conquest of space being nationally or government funded. However, times change. The end of the Cold War led to the end of the space race -- governments no longer had to prove their nation's technical superiority in space. But in many Western industrialized nations, as the government support and funding reduced overall, there appeared a raft of technically capable companies and some government departments and entrepreneurs who were able to identify key areas where there could be a viable and sustainable return on their investment. Communications satellites became commercial products as soon it was realized that communications capacity could be sold and could provide a realistic return over their lifetime. Science and Earth observation (EO) missions have not met with such commercialization yet. It is difficult to see a commercial return from scientific exploration of either our own planet or other celestial bodies. But the gathered EO information could see a commercial return from the sale of mapping, environmental or weather data, or charges for navigation services. However, military and government owned assets -- already fully operational -- make it hard to compete. When it comes to launchers and human spaceflight things are changing. The original missile-based launch vehicles gave way to commercially manufactured, but government-owned and operated systems. Now the launcher market is opening up as new players broach new user markets. Space tourism and small payloads have very different launch requirements that are best satisfied by new systems -- like Virgin Galactic's Spaceship 2 and XCOR's Lynx spaceplanes. BIS spokesman Nick Spall adds: ""For many the fascination for space is the almost visceral desire we have to travel further and faster to explore and to spread human interest across the cosmos. The BIS has championed the goal of eventually colonizing the solar system and, indeed, traveling on to the stars one day. ""To achieve this human spaceflight ambition, NASA is quite correct in its decision to use a commercialized approach to lowering the cost of launching astronauts into orbit. The investment in Boeing's CST-100 and the Space X V2 spacecraft for flights to the ISS from 2017 will make seat prices cheaper and more sustainable. ""For the future though, reusable spaceplanes such as the UK's Skylon are the real answer to getting humans and hardware into space to properly explore and occupy the rest of the solar system. ""To help this low-cost approach happen, purely private space tourism spacecraft companies will offer affordable flights to space, with Virgin Galactic's SS2 and the XCOR Lynx going sub-orbit in the next two years. One day we will see space hotels in orbit and then on the Moon and eventually Mars. ""To go into deep space, to asteroids, the Moon and Mars, governments will have to foot the bill initially, but the possibilities are immense and there is a very exciting future for humans in space,"" he said. BIS President-Elect Mark Hempsell believes the UK government's new policy of maximizing economic return from space is illustrated by the recent studies into setting up spaceports in the UK, both for suborbital and orbital flights. ""The recent change in UK government direction, with the formation of the UK Space Agency as a key component, is at long last connecting the vision within Britain with the capability to realize its potential,"" he said. Another important factor of space exploration is in its relations with the dual areas of education and outreach. Space education . BIS vice president Chris Welch said: ""Space -- and especially space exploration -- has been shown time and again to engage and motivate students in a way that few other topics can. ""It also has a role to play for defining how a country sees itself. One only has to look at the recent exploits of China and India to see how success in space exploration can transform a nation's view of itself and what its citizens can achieve if they believe they can aspire to greatness,"" he said. NASA's decision to sub-contract Boeing and SpaceX is a sign of things to come, but governments must continue to support and fund those areas that are not yet self-sustaining. The UK space sector is currently bringing in over Â£11.3 billion ($18.07 billion) per annum to the UK economy and supports 99,000 jobs. The UK government, recognizing this important contribution, plans to capture 10% of the world space market and generate more than Â£40 billion ($64 billion) per annum by 2030, according to the UK government. This will certainly require the support and leadership of UK industry and the creation of up to 100,000 new jobs. With India's Mangalyaan spacecraft now orbiting Mars and China's ""taikonauts"" in Earth orbit and its Chang'e 3 lunar lander already on the Moon, the competition is heating up. The space industries of the Western industrialized nations must play their part in identifying where they can make a real contribution and even take a leadership role, while the national space agencies take on more of a coordination and funding role, particularly in scientific exploration and manned missions .","It is difficult to see a commercial return from scientific exploration, says Alistair Scott .

"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Water. A vital nutrient, yet one that is inaccessible to many worldwide. The World Health Organization reports that 780 million people don't have access to clean water, and 3.4 million die each year due to water-borne diseases. But an Israeli company thinks it can play a part in alleviating the crisis by producing drinking water from thin air. Water-Gen has developed an Atmospheric Water-Generation Units using its ""GENius"" heat exchanger to chill air and condense water vapor. ""The clean air enters our GENius heat exchanger system where it is dehumidified, the water is removed from the air and collected in a collection tank inside the unit,"" says co-CEO Arye Kohavi. ""From there the water is passed through an extensive water filtration system which cleans it from possible chemical and microbiological contaminations,"" he explains. ""The clean purified water is stored in an internal water tank which is kept continuously preserved to keep it at high quality over time."" Energy efficient . Capturing atmospheric humidity isn't a ground-breaking invention in itself -- other companies already sell atmospheric water generators for commercial and domestic use -- but Water-Gen says it has made its water generator more energy efficient than others by using the cooled air created by the unit to chill incoming air. ""Several companies tried to extract water from the air,"" says Kohavi. ""It looks simple, because air conditioning is extracting water from air. But the issue is to do it very efficiently, to produce as much water as you can per kilowatt of power consumed."" He adds: ""When you're very, very efficient, it brings us to the point that it is a real solution. Water from air became actually a solution for drinking water."" The system produces 250-800 liters (65-210 gallons) of potable water a day depending on temperature and humidity conditions and Kohavi says it uses two cents' worth of electricity to produce a liter of water. Civilian uses . Developed primarily for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Water-Gen says it has already sold units to militaries in seven countries, but Kohavi is keen to stress that the general population can also benefit from the technology. He explains: ""We believe that the products can be sold to developing countries in different civilian applications. For example in India, [drinking] water for homes is not available and will also be rare in the future. The Atmospheric Water-Generation Unit can be built as a residential unit and serve as a perfect water supply solution for homes in India."" Kohavi says Water-Gen's units can produce a liter of water for 1.5 Rupees, as opposed to 15 Rupees for a liter of bottled water. Dirty water . Another product Water-Gen has developed is a portable water purification system. It's a battery-operated water filtration unit called Spring. Spring is able to filter 180 liters (48 gallons) of water, and fits into a backpack -- enabling water filtration on the go. ""You can go to any lake, any place, any river, anything in the field, usually contaminated with industrial waste, or anything like that and actually filter it into the best drinking water that exists,"" says Kohavi. Major Alisa Zevin, head of the Facilities and Specialized Equipment Section for the IDF, says the unit is revolutionary for them. ""This unit gives logistic independence for the forces and make us ensure that we provide the soldiers high quality water,"" she says. In 2013, the IDF took Spring to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the island country and left 4.2 million people affected by water scarcity. The system filtered what was undrinkable water into potable water, and that is what Water-Gen hopes to accomplish elsewhere where the technology is needed. ""It's something as a Westerner you cannot understand because you have a perfect water in the pipe, but people are dying from lack of water,"" says Kohavi. Although Water-Gen's developments aren't a solution for the water crisis, Kohavi believes that the technology can do for countries that lack clean water, such as Haiti, what it has done for the Philippines. It can be the technology used to not only to filter water, but to save lives. ""They could actually bring solution, perfect solution, to the people over there,"" says Kohavi. ""For the kids ... They can use the technology to filter water in the field. People are going days just to carry water. And all our solutions can be an alternative for that.""","Israeli company has developed device for extracting water from air .
It says its water generator is more energy efficient than others .

"Patchogue, New York (CNN) -- A small group gathered Saturday in the Upper East Side residence of Mimi Fery, an interior designer in New York. English, French, a bit of German and even Farsi floated through the air as men in crisp, white pants carried umbrellas and women dressed in subdued blacks and grays greeted one another. The group boarded a large charter bus bound for Long Island -- not to the Hamptons but to Patchogue -- for a ceremony to celebrate the life of Mimi's daughter Sidonie. On December 6, 2012, six weeks after Superstorm Sandy devastated the East Coast, a message in a ginger ale bottle was discovered on a Patchogue beach amid heaps of trash left by the storm. It had been tossed into the ocean more than 10 years before by a little girl who was playing with family friends a few miles east. The note inside, scrawled in a child's hand, read, ""Be excellent to yourself, dude."" There was a phone number beside it. On the back it read, ""From Bill and Ted."" Garrett Rivers, who found the bottle, used the phone of fellow FEMA disaster relief worker Brian Waldron to call the number. ""I love a good story, and it was just laying there and it looked old, so I picked it up,"" said Rivers at Saturday's ceremony. But what they learned was that Sidonie Fery, the author of the advice -- taken from the movie ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" -- had died in a fall in April 2010 at her boarding school in Switzerland. She was 18 years old. The relationships that began because of that bottle, the remembrances shared since since its discovery, culminated in Saturday's excursion, at which Mimi Fery would dedicate a plaque in the beachside community and an arts fund established in Sidonie's name. On the bus ride to the beach, Fery shared stories of Sidonie's childhood, lighting up when she spoke of trips to Iran during which Sidonie taught her friends English -- even assigning homework -- and ventured out with her traditionally austere grandfather to jewelry shops, where they would turn sketches into small trinkets. ""When she was little, we never bought anything; I always made her make gifts. We always had to do something. It makes everything more special,"" Fery said. Out of a small black clutch, Fery pulled dozens of tiny, trimmed pictures of Sidonie at various ages: Sidonie in Iran, Sidonie as a toddler, Sidonie's last high school portrait before her death. She pored over Facebook messages from her daughter's friends, as well as text messages she and Waldron had exchanged. Fery said she was so excited about the event that she'd barely slept the past two nights. A welcoming committee was waiting in Patchogue, consisting of Mayor Paul Pontieri, Parks and Recreation Director Maria Guistizia, Waldron and Rivers. Fery and her loved ones were greeted warmly. Sun broke through the overcast and drizzly weather shortly after the noon ceremony began. When it was time for her remarks, Fery wept, and thanked her friends for being there. Her longtime partner, Kristiaen Van Gastel, spoke also. ""When life seems to be impossible, she (Sidonie) takes time out to talk to us,"" Van Gastel said. One of Sidonie's friends from boarding school, Ximena de la Camara, said Sidonie's death put things in perspective. ""Now you know what's really important in life. You have a new outlook,"" she said. After remarks from the men who found the bottle and Sidonie's friends, the plaque bearing the young woman's photo was unveiled, nestled in a flowerbed between the community pool and the beach. Through tears, her mother said it was beautiful. Then, standing in the wet sand, Fery and friends new and old threw carnations into the waves. Back home in Manhattan, Fery and Van Gastel's apartment on 57th Street is filled with small reminders of Sidonie's short but larger-than-life existence. It's decorated with modern Lucite tables and plush furniture, but the eye is drawn up toward the ceiling by the artfully decorated walls, a dozen of Sidonie's expressive collages, drawings, and paintings hanging in clusters. ""Sidonie was always telling me not to worry, that everything would be all right. Her message in a bottle reminds me of that every day,"" Van Gastel said.","The message in a bottle was discovered on a New York beach after Superstorm Sandy .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Sao Paulo is the scene of another night of protests in Brazil, with demonstrators calling for a government more responsive to Brazilians' needs. Protests have been staged in major cities across the country, but Sao Paulo was the focal point of Tuesday's marches. The thousands who gathered were mostly peaceful, and the atmosphere was almost festive. But at least one small group unsuccessfully tried to force their way into a municipal building. Police for the most part stood back, but repelled those who tried to enter the government building by bashing its windows with police barriers. Brazilians say they are angry about high taxes, corruption, and lavish spending on the upcoming World Cup soccer tournament, among other complaints. Protests on Monday were the largest in the country in at least 20 years. President Dilma Rousseff said Tuesday their message was being heard. ""The direct message from the streets is for more citizenship, better schools, better hospitals, better health, for direct participation,"" she said in a nationally televised address. ""My government is trying and committed to social transformation."" The feeling among the protesters is that they are paying into a system that is not giving them back enough in return. ""It's all about national priorities,"" said Fernando Jones, a CNN iReporter who participated in protests in Rio de Janeiro. ""We want health, we want education."" Brazilians like himself find themselves asking how the government is using their taxes for its citizens, while watching as millions are spent on preparations for the World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. ""People can't take it anymore,"" he said. Thousands protest over rising costs of 2014 World Cup . While praising the largely peaceful protests, Rousseff said that what she characterized as ""isolated and minor acts of violence"" should be confronted ""with vigor."" Government officials say they recognize the protester's freedom of expression, but that there is a lack of a unified message from the demonstrators. The country's investment for the World Cup and Olympics includes money for health and public transportation projects that address some of the protesters' concerns, Deputy Sports Minister Luis Fernandes said. ""There is absolutely nothing contradictory between organizing a World Cup and investing in health and education,"" he said. Are you there? Share photos or video, but stay safe . The protests are being organized largely by university students and a group called the Free Fare Movement, which wants public transportation to be free of charge. The protests follow a week of smaller demonstrations that began in response to plans to increase fares for Brazil's public transportation system, from 3 to 3.20 reais ($1.38 to $1.47), but have broadened into wider protests over economic and social issues plaguing the country. Protesters say they are angry about, among other things, government decisions to spend money on the World Cup and other projects instead of improving health care, education and other social programs. Brazil is building stadiums and revamping its infrastructure ahead of the World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, events that will put the world's focus on the Latin American nation of 201 million people. What's really behind the Brazilian riots? The protests have attracted international attention, and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged Brazilian authorities Tuesday to show restraint in handling protesters. Last week, at least 100 people were injured and 120 arrested after violent clashes between police and protesters in Sao Paulo. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters and journalists, bringing complaints of brutality and targeting of media covering the events. Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo; Mariano Castillo wrote from Atlanta; CNN's Micheal Pearson, Marilia Brocchetto and Ben Brumfield also contributed to this report.","NEW: Protesters take to the streets once more in Sao Paulo .

"(CNN) -- Here's something you probably didn't imagine doing today: entering a name-that-pangolin contest. But I hope you'll make room in your busy schedule for a humble and endangered creature that truly could use some help. P26 is the current name of that shy-looking pangolin in the photo above. What kind of name is that for such a rare and fascinating mammal, the modern world's tiny dinosaur, a ""walking pinecone"" that can defend itself against lions and tigers by rolling up into a little scale-covered ball? P26 sounds like a line in a spreadsheet. He deserves a way better name. The generous researchers at Vietnam's Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program have agreed to let CNN's readers suggest and then vote on a new name for P26, who was recently released back into the wild after being rescued from the black market. Suggest a name by commenting below. You can up-vote the names in the thread you'd like to be considered. I'll ask readers to vote on five of the best (non-profane) and most popular names next week. P26 will assume whatever name you pick. You can also tweet this to encourage friends to vote: . Pangolins like P26 are endangered, and they're thought to be the most-trafficked mammals in the world. As I found out on a recent reporting trip to Southeast Asia, activists fear that they could go extinct before most people so much as realize they exist. They're shipped around the world for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for their meat, which is a delicacy and status symbol in Vietnam and China. You voted for me to research and report on the illegal animal trade as part of my Change the List project, which focuses on bottom-of-the-list issues and places. Find more stories in this reader-led series at CNN.com/Change. On my trip to Indonesia and Vietnam in February, I met P26 and other rescued pangolins at the vastly underfunded rehabilitation center in Vietnam. The group operates on $27,000 a year, its manager told me. That's for seven employees at two national parks. I also went undercover to talk with mafia-type pangolin traffickers and poachers. My take-away is that celebrity would bring the pangolin a form of protection. As long as it remains an obscure and little-known creature, it's easier for pangolin bosses to keep packing up these animals by the tons and shipping them to market. And it's also easier for restaurants to sell pangolin and consumers to justify buying it. Pangolins are remarkable animals: Their tongues are longer than their bodies; they hang from trees by their tails; they're pretty much invincible to predators in the wild. It would be unthinkable if they went extinct because they're not conventionally cute. There are easy, workable solutions. Humans are their biggest threat. Given the seriousness of the trade, maybe this naming contest seems goofy or inappropriate, but I think of it as a way for CNN's audience to adopt a pangolin and to get to know P26. He's one of the shyest pangolins the researchers in Vietnam have worked with (all pangolins are super-shy, by the way, and they actually die of ""stress"" in captivity, which is why you almost never see them in zoos). He was released into Cat Tien National Park on March 19, and I'm told he's making his way into the world with extreme timidity, like a Great Dane walking onto a sheet of ice. That's, of course, understandable considering he was hunted and was likely bound for a restaurant table or a bag of scales before he was seized by the Vietnamese government and, luckily, turned over to the researchers. When researchers put P26 in a box out in the forest and encouraged him to walk away, he just sat there, terrified. ""With other releases the animal has happily come out the box and started investigating the area. P26, however, was lot more nervous,"" Louise Fletcher, who's handling his release, wrote on a blog where she documents the pangolins' journeys. ""It is bad practice and stressful to tip the box or lift the animal out. Better just to leave it open and let them climb out by themselves. So, instead, we stood back and waited, but he still did not want to leave."" He was still in the box when they left that night, she said. The next morning, however, she was relieved to find the box empty. The researchers are monitoring P26's movements with a radio tracking device that's attached to one of the scales on his tail. By March 24, P26 had left the den site -- a good sign -- but then ""dug himself further under the roots of the tree,"" as if to hide, Fletcher wrote in an e-mail. ""Hopefully now he will begin to become more familiar with the surrounding area.""

"(CNN) -- Underage sex trafficking is an awful thing, on that we can all agree. But the growing clamor by individual U.S. states for the shutdown of Village Voice Media's web-based advertising site, Backpage.com, is panicky, scattershot, legally suspect and potentially just as dangerous. Backpage.com is a personals website with a special ""adult"" section containing a wealth of listings for escort services. Like the back pages of most alternative local news weeklies, or for that matter the Yellow Pages of the phone book, the website contains ads and pictures that make no pretense about what is being offered. These are ads for prostitutes. What has particularly upset law enforcement officials and attorneys general, however, is that these listings have been used by underage prostitutes and the pimps selling them. Some of the listings also come from brothels whose workers are either illegal aliens or trafficked sex slaves. While Backpage has attempted to exercise some level of editorial control over its listings and also cooperates with police investigations into the activities of its posters, many are arguing that the mere existence of such listings promote prostitution, an illegal activity, and child sex slavery, a heinous and intolerable practice. Most notably, Nicholas Kristof wrote a scathing piece in The New York Times, calling Backpage a ""godsend to pimps, allowing customers to order a girl online as if she were a pizza."" He went on to list some examples of young girls trafficked through the site, including one as young as 13. Village Voice hit back, questioning his reporting, and he responded in kind defending it. As the rhetoric heated up, arguments seemed to focus more on dates of birth and the technicalities of web launches than the crime of child prostitution or how to stop it. As usual, the horror of child abuse and mysteriousness of the Internet combined to distort rational debate and cloud reality. Meanwhile, the anonymously run website, ""Village Voice Pimps,"" uses the most sensationalist language it can muster, along with personal attacks and dossiers on Village Voice writers and editors who have nothing to do with the parent company, Village Voice Media's advertising supplement. To me, these posts seem much more concerned with lambasting the Village Voice newspaper for its pro-gay and ""immoral"" stances than its ownership by the same media company that owns Backpage. In a sense, the girls and young women affected are being pimped yet again . Travel: Fighting sex trafficking in hotels, one room at a time . This is the environment in which Washington state wrote its well-meaning but ultimately ill-informed law SB 6251, making it a felony to publish ""any advertisement for a commercial sex act, which is to take place in the state of Washington and that includes the depiction of a minor."" Ever since Craigslist closed its ""adult"" section, Backpage had become the go-to online spot for sex listings. Its presence grew to be ubiquitous across the United States, making it the target of numerous law enforcement and attorneys general. Like the other states hoping to curtail the practice of underage prostitution and sex slavery, Washington state believes that the websites listing escort services should be held accountable for the listings on their pages. The problem is it's awfully hard to tell whether a person posting an ad for a 21-year-old escort is telling the truth. As written, Washington's law applies whether or not the person or business knew that minors were to be involved. So if someone were to post a comment to the article you are now reading that included a hint of how or where to find illegal sex with a minor, CNN would be feloniously liable. The Communications Decency Act, passed in 1996, was written to prevent just such blanket liability traps from hindering normal communication on the Internet. Congress determined that a free and open Internet required that the host of a site not be responsible for ""third-party generated content."" Congress also realized -- as the Village Voice has argued -- that the Internet actually makes it a whole lot easier to catch predators and sex traffickers. Unlike underground or street prostitution, this activity occurs out on the open Web and is highly traceable by IP addresses and other means. Ultimately, ending sex trafficking of minors is just not the best basis for developing good Internet policy. It is outlier behavior, and the very mention of its existence ends up paralyzing more rational debate and legislative specificity. In this case, it becomes an excuse to pile on a New York-based, gay-friendly, left-leaning publication with a fine history of investigative journalism. Meanwhile, Village Voice Media may be correct in challenging a law that paralyzes the Internet, but its inability to find a business model that doesn't depend on the adult sex industry is its own fault. Craigslist voluntarily removed its own ""adult"" section when the arguments for maintaining it just became untenable. Village Voice Media was the beneficiary of all that adult content, and is now the bearer of the karma. This sort of content is not just unbecoming of an editorial group that prides itself on promoting ethics and social justice; it is hypocritical. Like any alternative newspaper, the Village Voice can argue that an underserved subculture -- the sex industry -- deserves a forum through which to take care of its business in the safest, most traceable and transparent way possible. But the listings on Backpage don't reflect such priorities, nor do they reflect well on the integrity of the company that is hosting them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Calls to close Backpage.com are scattershot, potentially dangerous .
He says authorities say ads there peddle underage prostitutes, which is heinous .
He says federal law doesn't hold sites responsible for third-party generated content .
Rushkoff: Village Voice may be right to resist challenge but should ditch sex listings ."
"(CNN) -- Tiburcio Vasquez, a 19th century outlaw, is remembered in historical accounts as a notorious criminal who terrorized southern California. But one school district in California wants to remember him another way: as a hero to the Hispanic community who fought back against injustice. The Alisal Union School District set off a controversy last month when it announced that an elementary school in Salinas to be opened this year will be named after Vasquez. The move has led some local leaders, including the Salinas mayor, to criticize the controversial choice. ""We had a young man killed in Afghanistan who was from the Alisal area. He would have been a nice person to name the school after,"" Mayor Joe Gunter said Wednesday. ""There's a lot of good people we could name a school after, in my opinion."" According to a biography culled together by the University of Southern California, Vasquez was ""probably the most notorious bandit California ever saw."" Vasquez turned to a life of crime as a teenager and served time in San Quentin State Prison for stealing horses in the late 1850s, the biography states. He and his gang went into hiding in the canyons of Southern California after a ""string of infamous robberies and murders"" in 1873, the biography says. Vasquez eventually was captured, convicted of murder and hanged. His doesn't sound like a life to be emulated, but there is another side to his life story, said Francisco Estrada, a retired school teacher and member of the naming committee in the Alisal school district. Vasquez was a standout student from a very distinguished family, Estrada said. They had extensive land that was snatched from them after California became part of the United States. ""The community does not see Tiburcio as a thief or a murderer,"" Estrada said. ""We see him as a fighter for social justice of the Mexican-Californio whose rights have been deprived."" Estrada said he believes that Vasquez was falsely accused of murder. An account of Vasquez's life, written in 1948 by the Historical Society of Southern California, also hints at a more noble side of the bandit. ""It was well known that Vasquez was not a killer, that he repeatedly warned his followers not to kill, and his reluctance to take life, even when his own was in grave danger, was without doubt responsible for the remarkably few killings during his 23 years as an outlaw,"" the article said. The article continued: ""He hated the Americano with good reason and always in his mind was a thought, which had activated many of his race before him, that he could help get the Americans out and in some way regain California for Mexico."" Both narratives of his life, whatever his motivations were, remain controversial. Monterey County Superintendent Nancy Kotowski, who oversees the Alisal Union School District, said naming decisions fall solely to the local school board. Kotowski questioned the choice of name. ""This is an elementary school, pre-school to grade 6. The appropriate procedure would be to first clarify the historical record before naming a school after a controversial figure,"" she said. In a statement, the county Office of Education cited high rates of youth violence and murder in Salinas. Estrada called it ""ridiculous"" to link the name of the new school to violence in the community. ""What the mainstream calls a murderer and a thief was actually an outstanding individual who was highly educated, cultured and embraced the fine arts,"" he said. The school, which is scheduled to open in the fall, would not be the first institution to be named after Vasquez. A clinic in Alameda County that provides care for the uninsured is called the Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center.","A new school in California is being named after a famous bandit .
Tiburcio Vasquez is said to have been a notorious criminal .
Supporters of the name say he stood up for marginalized Hispanics ."
"(CNN) -- I often feel like a high-class prostitute, I just don't charge like one. Call girls seem to know their black book value, or at least their madams do. But sadly, many professional working women don't get or demand the compensation they deserve. It begins after college when young women are already making less than the guys -- 82% of what their male peers receive, according to a recent study by the American Association of University Women. It gets worse over time, particularly for women who temporarily take themselves out of work by choice or necessity when they become moms. This chronic feeling that they are giving it up for free can hurt women's lifelong earning power and their self-esteem. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wants to give America's women workplace moxie and the skills to break through barriers that are holding them back, namely themselves. Sandberg's new book, ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,"" is already generating the kind of buzz-worthy backlash and controversy that brings out the schadenfreude from the entire political rainbow of female commentators. Because she's a billionaire and home for dinner with the kids at 5:30, her gilded life makes her hardly relatable to virtually any other working mom. 10 views: Our struggle to 'have it all' The book, together with an ambitious ""Lean In"" social movement of monthly meetings dosed with inspirational anecdotes from other women, is all about bringing on the girl power and getting us out of the cubicle and into the corner office. ""Lean In"" comes ironically on the high heels of Marissa Mayer, the 30-something, newly minted Mama Bear CEO at Yahoo! who pulled the plug on the flex policies that allowed employees to work from home. Mayer, who has a nursery for her own newborn in her office, is getting hazed for this seemingly retro and anti-family move. Is Mayer the ultimate sellout or the quintessential feminist? Well, depends who you ask. Share your story: How do you balance work and family? But have no doubt, working women are back on the political radar. President Obama gave a shout out to the cause of equal pay at his recent State of the Union. The White House also has created several initiatives in the wake of Obama signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in January 2009, the first law he signed in his administration. The law amends the Civil Rights Act, extending the period women can sue for gender pay discrimination. So why do so many accomplished women get snared in the vicious cycle of not getting paid properly for the work they do? The problem, Sandberg's book points out, is internal. Women can get squeamish about negotiating for money and don't know how to effectively advocate for themselves. We are hard wired to make nice, not make people uncomfortable. Discussing money, for many women, feels exceptionally awkward. In my zigzagging career as a TV producer, writer, PR strategist, website editor-in-chief and TV spokesperson, I have cut my rates, jumped at the first offer, and even worked for free. Sometimes, I've just felt lucky to get the job. Brilliant women in science and tech, then and now . This behavior, said Mika Brzezinski, the best-selling author of ""Knowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You're Worth"" and co-host of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" is not unusual for women, but it's disastrous. It undermines our value. She said we must stop feeling grateful and instead become fierce and focused. Work hard and go after what you deserve. Brzezinski's book was born from personal experience and her admitted failure of not cutting herself a fair deal and getting the money she deserved. At the time, Brzezinski's on-air TV career had stalled, and when she landed the gig at ""Morning Joe,"" she never negotiated. Barely making ends meet and hearing she was earning 14 times less than her co-host, Joe Scarborough, was depressing and painful. After all, Brzezinski was working her tail off on ""Morning Joe,"" helping take it from an unknown MSNBC show to a political commodity. Like so many women, Brzezinski thought if she worked hard, she would eventually be rewarded. But her paycheck left her defeated and bitter. Brzezniski eventually got a significant raise. But she was prepared to quit the show when MSNBC finally came to the table. The myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career . ""We are good at advocating for other people but not for ourselves. You are asking not for the money you need, but the money you deserve,"" said Brzezinski. ""It's a cop out to say this just happens to women. We have to step up and take what we want and not feel uncomfortable for it. No drama, no games, no whining. Make them need you and be ready to walk."" Lyss Stern, founder and president of Divamoms.com, a luxury lifestyle company for mothers in the Tri-State area, said she knows what it's like to not be taken seriously. Because of her extensive network of influential and affluent moms -- an important demographic -- Stern's company is highly sought after by consumer product brands, entertainment companies and fashion and beauty businesses around the country. But it has been frustrating for Stern to get men, often the people making the deals, to recognize the value of her company. ""I've found that it's the men who think they can get away with not paying for my work. To them, they see a mom company as a hobby, not a business,"" Stern said. ""I have multi-million dollar companies reaching out to me each day. They will take out a $100,000 ad campaign in The New York Times, but e-mail me and say they want to do business but have no real money to budget for me. It's insulting."" In business for nearly a decade, it was relatively recently that Stern's attitude changed and she had the confidence to politely walk away from a lousy deal. ""It took me seven years to truly understand the worth of my brand and to be able to say that if you don't take me seriously, I don't want to work with you. It's your loss,"" Stern said. But many women simply lack the mojo to say no. It's almost as if women are conditioned to be pleasers and say yes, even if it's not lucrative for them. They depreciate their own value just to get the work but are then resentful that they've sacrificed themselves. ""It's a vicious cycle. All of a sudden 20 years go by and you realize, wait, I'm supposed to be making more not less, what happened?"" said Brzezinski. She said that getting what you deserve at work can also have a domino effect on all areas of a woman's self worth. ""It changes your life to know your value and every relationship you have is better and stronger and more rewarding and lasting,"" Brzezniski said. ""Women end up sabotaging their relationships when we don't demand respect for our value from other people."" Do you agree that women don't demand enough compensation in the job market?

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in rural Missouri have charged a man with exposing his partner to HIV and say he may have exposed more than 300 other people to the virus that causes AIDS. David Mangum told police he had at least that many unprotected sexual encounters with people he met online or in parks since he was diagnosed with HIV in 2003, Dexter, Missouri, detective Sgt. Corey Mills told CNN. Mills said it will be difficult to find and warn those people, since Mangum ""usually only knew his partners' first names."" Mangum was arrested after his former partner told police that Mangum had lied to him about his status, a police affidavit states. He was arraigned Thursday morning in Stoddard County, about 160 miles south of St. Louis, with bail set at $250,000. The former partner has tested positive for HIV, according to police. Mangum, 36, told police that between 50 and 60 of his partners lived in Stoddard County, according to court records.

"(CNN) -- What might be a good way to get your misbehaving kids to pipe down this summer? Tell them you'll ship them off to North Korea. As a host of American kids spend their summers on the shores of lakes, or at Bible or band camps, over 300 children from around the world have headed off to the Songdowon International Children's Camp in Wonsan, North Korea. It's an oasis in the benighted country for attendees, who this year come from Russia, China, Vietnam, Tanzania and Ireland. Heavily subsidized by the government, camp attendees get the benefit of comforts not afforded to regular North Koreans, such as air-conditioned bedrooms with video games. Instead of forming a circle around a campfire, homesick kids at Songdowon can take succor from giant bronze statues of the country's founder, Kim Il Sung and his son and successor, Kim Jong Il, surrounded by admiring children. The camp also boasts a private beach, volleyball courts and water slides. How you travel to North Korea . Originally opened in the 1960s to foster ties with other communist and non-aligned countries, it was given a major overhaul before reopening this summer. The revamp included some some personal attention from Kim Jong Un, who ""specified instructions for remodeling the camp,"" according to North Korean state media KCNA. For the equivalent of $270, happy campers can spend eight days in the country, getting to know their North Korean peers, and officials reportedly would welcome kids from all over the world, including the U.S. One ex-camper, Russian Valentina Boltacheva, told NKNews.org last year that she remembers ""swimming, boating, and doing morning exercises,"" alongside learning traditional Korean dances and ""songs about Korean political leaders."" She also said she came to the conclusion that ""Songdowon is a really prestigious camp in North Korea.""

"(CNN) -- Americans have been repeatedly shocked by school violence this year-- first in Nevada, where in October a student shot and killed a teacher and wounded two students before taking his own life; then days later by the news that the body of a young teacher was found behind her school in Massachusetts. The images of traumatized parents and a campus surrounded by police tape shake us profoundly -- our hearts break for the families of those who died. For them, this is the beginning of an unwanted journey. In my education research I have focused on the question of what happens in the lives of the people still connected to a school that has endured such a trauma long after the media and law enforcement move on. School shootings affect teachers, school secretaries, maintenance people and anyone else on campus at the time. How the school, the community and families work together is critical to the long-term recovery of those who witnessed the nightmare. It's important to consider two aspects of life after a school shooting. First, what do teachers go through as the days stretch on and, second, what can we learn from past shootings to help the educators in Sparks? For teachers who witness school shootings, one diagnosis stands out, and it is well-known in the field of psychology: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Teachers who see a shooting will experience the trauma of the activating event and a series of other emotions: pain, confusion, guilt, shame, a questioning of self-worth, fear, anger, depression, and, sometimes, acute anxiety. They may question their very sense of how the world works around them. They struggle to find a sense of safety. Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens . If PTSD is not dealt with, the quality of the teacher's life can degrade rapidly. Psychiatric clinician Bessel van der Kolk has described how, left untreated, these changes can become permanent. Victims of untreated PTSD can degrade into rigid thinking, paranoia, defensiveness, over-reactivity and health problems. This can have serious ramifications for students in their classrooms. They might find their teacher more and more withdrawn, less willing to engage intellectually or emotionally, defensive, sarcastic, inflexible and perhaps emotionally unstable. Teacher absenteeism -- meaning more substitute teachers -- might become a problem. What can we learn from previous shootings that might help the educators in Nevada? The most important factor in recovery is quick access to professional crisis counseling. Crisis counselors must discern how each individual witness deals with PTSD. In their trauma research, psychologists James Fauerbach and John Lawrence found that adjustment to trauma is a dynamic process influenced by the intensity of the incident but also by pre-trauma factors -- for example family stability, socioeconomic status. Personal resilience, which is effected by such things as social support, personality and native coping abilities, plays a role. This is why past experience teaches us it's important to get quick professional psychological treatment, tailored to each individual. More severe PTSD symptoms, such as recurring nightmares, can arise over time; it's crucial that counseling continue to be available and actively offered. After the first few weeks have passed, witnesses still need support. One of the worst things anyone can do is pressure the witness to ""just get over it."" Past experience suggests that teachers who witness shootings and who have these layers of support from family and community recover more fully and quickly than those who are more isolated. And then there is time. Each person heals at a different pace. There will be teachers who will be able to return to their duties in a week or so; some may need months or years of support and therapy. In my own study I compared two teachers recovering after witnessing a school shooting. One was able to return within a week and had extended support from district and local mental health professionals for some time. A mental health professional checked in on him weekly, even a year later. The other teacher had no such support. She was not even offered counseling. Her world, demonstrating van der Kolk's assertions, descended into defensiveness and health problems. She was unable to function after a month back on the job. School administrators should understand that a teacher going back into the classroom may be an unknown; their post-shooting self may still be struggling in many ways. Unfortunately a 2005 study found that 75% of school districts affected by campus shootings did not require counseling for teacher witnesses. Coordinating a re-entry plan with a professional psychologist can be fundamental to restoring a witness to a productive and healthy life. Finally, research indicates that the more connected a witness feels to the school, to his or her family, and to the community, the better the possibility for long-term healing. School administrators, by routinely fostering relationships through off-campus faculty parties, softball games and other group activities, could be setting up a safety net that could smooth over a transition for future trauma victims. One of the participants in my study regularly went on recreational events with co-workers. He mentioned how these same people felt connected to him and were there for him after the shooting. They knew him, knew when he needed alone time and when he needed to be around people. While this cannot prevent a tragedy, it can set up mechanisms to assist in healing. In the weeks and months that follow, administrators, community members, family members and colleagues should be sensitive to events, objects and other factors that may cause heightened anxiety and panic attacks. To guide teachers, administrators will need professional advice from psychologists. Beyond these things, what can the rest of us do to help? First of all, be a part of your local school. Teachers, students, administrators and other school workers need to feel valued and respected. Be a part of the process to find ways to make schools safer. Secondly, encourage your local school leaders to develop school morale, to develop crisis management plans and to foster a community feeling around the school.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Despite all the questions surrounding the war in Afghanistan, congressional Democrats have not challenged the administration's policies since President Obama announced a surge of troops in 2009. The release of classified documents about the war by the website WikiLeaks seemed to have no impact on Capitol Hill. The same week that the documents were released, the House approved legislation with almost no debate that will provide tens of billions of dollars for the war effort. Even though the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is chaired by John Kerry, who entered the national spotlight in the 1970s with his riveting testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the problems with the war in Vietnam, the panel has been relatively quiescent. Democrats don't want Afghanistan to become a political problem for Obama. Their party is having enough trouble as a result of the recession and the deficit that they don't want to give their opponents one more issue to run on. Democrats, who have suffered for decades when being attacked as ""weak on defense,"" also fear that any questions about the war will open them up to those attacks again. But Democrats who have doubts about the war can't afford to be silent. When Congress doesn't publicly ask tough questions of the White House, poor decisions have often ensued. The decision over funding Afghanistan came one week before the the 46th anniversary of the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7, 1964. On August 2, 1964, the North Vietnamese attacked the USS Maddox. Two days later, there were reports of another attack, although there were doubts at the time that the incident occurred. President Lyndon Johnson used the reports of the attacks to call on Congress to grant him authority to take action. As Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was criticizing the administration's Vietnam policies, Johnson requested a congressional resolution authorizing him to take ""all necessary measures to repeal any armed attacks against the forces of the United States."" Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7. The House unanimously supported the measure, and in the Senate the vote was 88-2. Johnson was elated. He watched his poll numbers rise. The resolution, according to Johnson, was like grandma's nightshirt, because it ""covered everything."" There were many people in the summer of 1964 who were warning the president to avoid escalating the war in Vietnam. Most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in Congress that came from across the political spectrum. The criticism came from all sources. Liberal Democrats such as Frank Church of Idaho said the intervention was dangerous and unnecessary. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield had asked the president, ""What national interests in Asia would steel the American people for the massive costs of an ever-deepening involvement of that kind?"" Florida Democrat George Smathers, certainly no leftist radical, complained that he had been all over Capitol Hill and couldn't find any legislators who thought, ""We ought to fight a war in that area of the world."" The journalist Max Frankel quipped: ""It is beginning to look as if the Democrats plan to be their own most vigorous critics in this year's election debate."" The most trenchant warnings came from one of the most hawkish members of Congress, Georgia Democrat Richard Russell, Johnson's mentor in the 1950s and the leading figure in the Southern caucus. On May 27, 1964, Russell had called Vietnam the ""damn worst mess I ever saw"" and said he felt that ""the more we try to do for them, the less they are willing to do for themselves."" When confronted with proposals to withdraw forces from Vietnam, Johnson could not stop thinking about the high political price Democrats had paid in the 1950s because of Republican accusations about not being tough against communism. He hesitantly accepted the analysis of hawkish advisors like Walt Rostow, who said that if South Vietnam fell to communism, so would the rest of the region. ""I'm not going to lose Vietnam,"" Johnson told his ambassador to Vietnam, Republican Henry Cabot Lodge. ""I am not going to be the president who saw Southeast Asia go the way China went."" The months surrounding the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution were a test, not just for Congress but for Johnson. Confronted with trenchant criticism of escalation, he decided to ignore these voices in favor of more hawkish advisors in his inner circle. In 2010, there are many politicians, defense experts and military officials who are warning that the president needs to rethink U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. The WikiLeaks documents pointed to issues that have been known for some time. Many experts are skeptical that the U.S. will be able to stick to the 2011 withdrawal deadline (indeed, many administration officials equivocated on this promise as soon as it announced), and there is ample evidence that the current war strategy will not produce an Afghanistan that remains free from America's adversaries. As Richard Haas, former Bush administration official and foreign policy expert, wrote in Newsweek: ""The war the United States is now fighting in Afghanistan is not succeeding and is not worth waging this way. ... Afghanistan is claiming too many American lives, requiring too much attention, and absorbing too many resources."" Democrats can't continue to write a blank check for this president. They must use the power of oversight and investigation to start addressing the problems with the war strategy and to create pressure on the administration to strengthen its military plans for the coming year. They can't simply trust the president do just to the right thing. Too often, when Congress has remained silent, presidents have made huge mistakes -- and it has taken decades for the nation to recover.

"(CNN) -- In its ruling in Windsor v. United States, the Supreme Court paved the way for states and the federal government to legally recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. As we near the one-year anniversary of that historic decision, here's a look back at the history of marriage equality, how we got here, and where the fight for equality still has to go. In the beginning, there was Adam and Steve... OK, that's not exactly true. I don't know; I wasn't there personally. But we do know that gay coupling has been around for a long time. Around 350 B.C., in ""The Symposium,"" Plato said there should be an army composed of same-sex lovers. In fact, there was such an army: the Sacred Band of Thebes. They were renowned for their valor and frequent victories. Fast forward a bit: In 1972, just five years after the United States Supreme Court overturned anti-miscegenation laws that barred interracial marriages, the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by two men who were denied a marriage license in Minnesota. A year later, Maryland became the first state to pass a law explicitly banning marriage between same-sex couples. And so we enter the dark era of explicit attacks and prohibitions on same-sex marriage equality. It went downhill for a while. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act, banning federal recognition of same-sex marriages and authorizing one state to not recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state, even though the Constitution requires states to honor each other's laws. Anyway,  35 states adopted laws defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman, with 26 of those states putting that discrimination in their constitutions. You with me so far? Meanwhile, in the midst of all these anti-gay marriage laws still being adopted, in 2004 a judge in Massachusetts ruled that it was unconstitutional under the state constitution to allow only opposite-sex couples to marry. Four years later, the California and Connecticut Supreme Courts made similar rulings. A year later, in 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court did the same. That same year, Vermont and Maine become the first states to legislatively enact marriage equality. Voters, legislatures and courts kept wrestling with the issue. But in 2012, a majority of voters in Maine, Maryland and the state of Washington passed marriage equality ballot measures, and voters in Minnesota struck down a constitutional amendment that would restrict the state's definition of marriage. It's as if the new century brought a new day for gay couples. And there was no turning back. Same-sex parent families: Share your story . Today, 19 states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex couples the freedom to marry. In an additional 11 states, judges have ruled in favor of marriage equality but the cases are tied up in appeals. Fully 3/5 of our country is now firmly on the side of equality and fairness, as are the American people. In 1996 when Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, only 27% of Americans supported same-sex marriage. Today, 55% of Americans think same-sex marriages should be fully recognized, valid and equal. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 78% support marriage equality. And those numbers are steadily growing, even among conservatives. Does marriage equality fix every problem facing the gay community? Heck, no. In 29 states, lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans can still be fired from their jobs based solely on their sexual orientation. In 33 states, transgender Americans can be fired based solely on their gender identity. We still don't even have a federal law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Gay men in America earn 10% to 32% less than similarly qualified straight men working in the same occupations. Transgender men and women are both more likely to be the victims of violent crime and more likely to be incarcerated. In some states, same-sex couples are discriminated against in the ability to adopt children. Being able to get married and be as happy â€” or miserable â€” as married straight couples in America doesn't make other issues of anti-gay discrimination go away. But marriage equality is a big and important movement toward fairness and justice for all â€” a movement that is, at this point, unstoppable.","Sally Kohn: It's almost a year since the Supreme Court struck down DOMA .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel partially reopened access to the Temple Mount for Muslim prayers Friday, a day after taking a rare step of closing it amid Israeli-Palestinian tensions following the shooting of a controversial rabbi and subsequent killing of a suspect. Midday access to the site, which includes the al-Aqsa Mosque, was granted only to men ages 50 and above, as well as to women -- restrictions that Israeli police said were meant to prevent demonstrations by young Muslim men. About 4,000 people attended midday prayers at the mosque, police said, down from thousands more that are normally seen around noon on the Muslim holy day of Friday. Police presence also was beefed up, with about 3,000 officers in and around the Old City and East Jerusalem. Thursday's closure of the Temple Mount -- the first in more than a decade -- infuriated Palestinians, with a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling it a ""declaration of war."" The scene Friday at the mosque was largely peaceful, with people praying quietly, police said. The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest site in Islam. Jews call it the Temple Mount, and Muslims know it as Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). Closure came after Wednesday shootings . Israeli police said they closed the Temple Mount on Thursday ""to prevent disturbances"" after the drive-by shooting of controversial activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick on Wednesday night. Israeli police shot and killed a suspect in Glick's shooting Wednesday night. An Israeli counterterror unit surrounded the house of the unnamed suspect in the shooting, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said on Twitter. He said the man opened fire on police, who shot and killed him. Glick is an advocate of Jewish access to Jerusalem's fiercely contested holy sites. After he gave a presentation in Jerusalem on Wednesday night, a man on a motorcycle shot him. Rosenfeld described the attack on Glick as an ""attempted assassination."" The rabbi was undergoing an abdominal operation for intestinal issues Friday afternoon and was in serious but stable condition, said Dr. Ofer Merkin, head of the trauma unit at Shaare Zedek hospital. Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli Prime Minister's spokesman for Arab media, tweeted that Thursday's Temple Mount closure was ""temporary & meant to prevent riots & escalation as well as to to restore calm and status quo to the Holy Places."" The closure didn't sit well with Palestinians. Presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh told CNN that the decision to close off the site was a ""brazen challenge"" and ""grave behavior"" that would lead to ""further tensions and instability."" Earlier, Rudeineh told the WAFA news agency, the official Palestinian news service, that Israel's act was a ""declaration of war on the Palestinian people, Palestinian religious sites and a declaration of war on both the Arab and Islamic states."" Contested site . The site, with its golden dome overlooking Jerusalem, is said to have hosted sacred events in both the Jewish and Muslim religions. Rabbinic sages say that God gathered dust from the spot to create Adam, the first man, before setting him loose in the Garden of Eden. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount also contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under God's orders -- before an angel intervened. Later, Israeli King Solomon constructed the first Jewish temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant, which was said to contain the tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to the Jerusalem site during his miraculous Night Journey, said Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware. ""It's all about al-Aqsa,"" said Khan. ""That's why all Muslims are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause."" According to Islamic tradition, the Night Journey took Mohammed to the same Jerusalem rock on which Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, where the Muslim founder led Abraham, Moses and Jesus in prayers as the last of God's prophets. That rock is now said to sit in the Dome of the Rock, whose golden roof gleams above the Old City skyline. Since its construction in the seventh century, the Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews. In the 1980s, Jewish radicals plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa, believing that it would lead to a spiritual revolution and usher in the Messiah. In 2000, the Second Intifada -- a 5-year-long Palestinian uprising -- was sparked, Palestinians say, after Ariel Sharon, then a candidate for Israeli prime minister, visited the compound surrounding al-Aqsa. Sharon insisted that his visit was not intended to provoke Palestinians, but many saw it as an attempt to underline Israel's claim to Jerusalem's holy sites. CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem. CNN's Jason Hanna and Holly Yan reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Daniel Burke and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","At midday Friday, the site was open only to men ages 50 and older and to women .

"(CNN) -- Folks are really mad at Marissa Mayer. The Yahoo CEO has revoked the company's long-time work-from-home policy, a ban that will take effect beginning in June. When I asked how my tech-industry-heavy social network felt about the policy reversal, the responses from both men and women were overwhelmingly negative. One man said the decision felt arbitrary and like a throwback to less-connected days before real-time video hangouts and collaborative docs. ""Short-sighted and against the tide of where things are heading,"" he observed. ""Going backwards"" and ""epic fail,"" wrote others. Google Mayer's name and you will find that the media and blogosphere are equally riled up. The move, some say, is particularly disappointing coming from a new mother, who presumably should know better about the difficult position that many parents are in. Opinion: Allow Yahoo workers to work at home . And who are we kidding? By ""parents"" we mean mostly moms, because whether we have solid childcare, family support or neither, many of us are performing real-life acrobatics worthy of Cirque du Soleil. Yahoo's new policy pushes my buttons, as well. Had it not been for workplace flexibility and the ability to work from home, I -- and scores of my friends and colleagues -- probably would not be in the game at this point. I telecommuted long before I had children, back in the days when almost no one I knew worked from home. The joke then was that when I showed up at the office, it was because I was getting lonely and wanted to hang out. Having kids completely flipped the script, and telecommuting suddenly went from luxury to necessity. My husband continued working full-time, and I started juggling. You won't ever truly understand the meaning of ""hustle"" until you've tried to do anything while taking care of children at the same time. CEO right: Yahoo workers must show up . But here's the thing: Being stuck between the rock of workplace imperatives and the hard place of home mandates is not new to any of us working mothers, and we all know that the trade-offs you have to make in that position are almost never easy or simple. The difference is that Mayer's experience is far more public and high-stakes, and half the world is second-guessing her. Mayer is running a public company, with more than 11,000 employees. Is it possible that as Yahoo's chief, she is privy to a fact or two that you and I might not know and understand about the larger predicament Yahoo finds itself in? Absolutely. Mayer did not take over a healthy company and disrupt an effective culture that has been working well. Yahoo is in trouble and has been for a long time. (Full disclosure: I very briefly wrote a column for Yahoo last year.) And as much as we all swear up and down that we are happier and more productive working from home, this is not necessarily (and objectively) so. Tech execs question Yahoo's work-from-the-office edict . Last summer while on assignment at the Aspen Ideas Festival, I interviewed Ben Waber, an MIT research scientist and CEO of Sociometric Solutions. Waber and his colleagues at MIT and Harvard have been engaged in a process called ""reality mining"" -- analyzing the constant trail of data that we leave behind about ourselves via e-mail, instant messaging patterns, phone logs and meeting information -- to come up with insights about work productivity and satisfaction. He helps companies translate these insights into concrete ways to enhance people's experience at work, as well as to increase productivity. Testing those insights across dozens of companies in different industries, Waber has found that face-to-face communication, friendships and social interaction at work make people more productive and happier. ""Obviously there's a big difference between working from home every day of the year and telecommuting occasionally,"" Waber told me yesterday. ""There are pros and cons to both arguments, but when you look at the data alone, there is compelling evidence that individuals coming in to work physically at Yahoo may benefit the company."" As he writes in his forthcoming book, ""People Analytics,"" ""A large, robust body of research indicates that companies need to figure out some way to get employees together face to face, because remote work tools just aren't cutting it. ... When making the decision to work from home, employees must weigh personal needs against the negative impact it will have on their colleagues and on them as an individual."" ""It's easy for us to armchair quarterback,"" observes Leisa McNeese, ""but Marissa Mayer is in it, and at this point I'm assuming she's making the best decisions with the information she has."" The mother of two young children, McNeese is the former co-president and current emeritus board member of the Parents' Club of Palo Alto and Menlo Park, a nonprofit to which many Silicon Valley parents belong. Like me, McNeese would have been completely out of the paid workforce without the ability to work from home when her children were born. For almost a decade now, she has worked as a consultant, as well as for a nonprofit tech startup that was completely virtual. Yahoo work-from-home policy riles workers everywhere . McNeese is willing to give Mayer the benefit of doubt for now, but she observes that ""like most things, workplace flexibility is not something that is an either/or issue."" McNeese believes that while Yahoo's strategy may make sense in the short-term as a reboot or in a crisis situation, it is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run. Given the culture of Silicon Valley, where so many highly successful companies offer a good amount of flexibility when it comes to working from home, an employer that sets rigid and immutable standards on this issue risks shutting out a large segment of potential talent and making itself undesirable to others. What about the charge that the impact of Mayer's decision is sure to be felt disproportionately by the working mothers at Yahoo? Shouldn't Mayer ""get it"" because she is a new mom? ""That's essentialist nonsense in my feminist book,"" McNeese says. ""We all experience motherhood and fatherhood in different ways. If we wouldn't be asking this same question about a male CEO who just had a baby, then I'm just not interested in going there with a female one."" As much as Mayer's decision strikes a nerve for working moms, some of us are feeling a troubling sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu about the damned if she does, damned if she doesn't scenario she finds herself in. And at least for now, we are willing to reserve judgment. How do you feel about Yahoo's new telecommuting policy?

"(CNN) -- Science fiction flicks featuring aliens can be a little formulaic: Aliens invade American territory, mass destruction ensues, and nine times out of 10, Will Smith rides to the rescue . A company operative (Sharlto Copley) gets an alien's attention in ""District 9."" But the alien-infested ""District 9,"" opening in theaters Friday, takes things in a different direction -- if the producer may say so himself. ""It's utterly original,"" producer Peter Jackson -- yes, ""Lord of the Rings"" helmsman Peter Jackson -- told Entertainment Weekly. ""In an industry that's looking to make movies out of every obscure TV show, or sequels, or video games, you look at 'District 9' and it's unlike anything you've ever seen,"" he said. With its inventive plot and crowd-pleasing special effects, the low-profile, relatively low-budget ($30 million, a pittance these days) film was a hit at Comic-Con, creating a buzz before the film's release. The brainchild of newcomer Neill Blomkamp, ""District 9"" is a mash-up of the director's love for science fiction with his rearing in an apartheid-divided South Africa. Set and shot in the shantytowns of Johannesburg, the film is a mix of action-movie shock and sociological food for thought. The mayhem begins when an alien spaceship runs out of fuel over South Africa in 1981, and simply hovers idly in the sky. With no attack forthcoming, officials finally evacuate a group of aliens -- it turns out they've fled their home world -- and corral them into barbed-wire ghettos, effectively separating the shrimp-like creatures from the human populace. Overseeing the aliens' camp is the corporation Multi-National United (MNU). It's an obvious nod to South Africa's own violent and divisive history, but director Blomkamp says he isn't aiming for political commentary. ""This is an organic thing that has grown out of me living in South Africa. I didn't want to go, 'Here's a whole bunch of people that have been oppressed by this apartheid-esque society' and beat people over the head with it,"" he told CNN. ""I wanted to say, 'This is the city I grew up in, and this is what it felt like,' with a science fiction veneer to it so that it doesn't take itself that seriously."" Documentary-like authenticity was of prime importance to Blomkamp, and was the reason for his casting of fellow South African unknown Sharlto Copley as leading man. Copley has no prior acting experience, but critics have lauded his portrayal of Wikus van de Merwe, a private-sector employee who goes from being the oppressor to one of the oppressed after an accidental run-in with some DNA-transforming alien goo. ""Having grown up in South Africa, I was exposed to the tail end of apartheid as a child, [and] it's something I felt I could relate to,"" Copley said. ""Playing the character, I saw so clearly how you discriminate. ... The film deals with things that are fundamentally human."" ""District 9"" is also fundamentally a thriller, and there's no shortage of gory, gritty scenes and clever special effects that will appeal to fans who like a little action with their sci-fi. Indeed, the film has been praised for its masterful use of special effects, weaving the technology seamlessly into the documentary-style scenes. Sometimes the two are in the very same shot, Blomkamp said. ""One of the first shots completed was a motherboard shot, where [computer-generated imagery] was incorporated into some of the handheld footage, and it felt like it was working, this idea of handheld stuff with [CGI],"" Blomkamp said. ""It set a good tone; it captured the essence of what I was going for."" Not bad for a 29-year-old novice, who had previously directed short films and commercials. But that body of work was impressive enough to catch the eye of A-list producer Jackson, who originally had Blomkamp in mind for feature version of Halo, the video game. ""[Jackson] had received all of the crazy short films and commercials I had done, and once I met him and hung out and got familiar with the kind of filmmaking universe he set up down there, he did sign off on me as director of 'Halo,' "" Blomkamp recalled. But, five months into the project, the plug was pulled on ""Halo."" ""Right away, [Jackson] said, 'If you want, you can stay in New Zealand and we can just keep the momentum going and allow another film to take place,' "" Blomkamp said. One of Blomkamp's friends suggested his short film, ""Alive in Jo'burg,"" for feature treatment. Blomkamp ran with the concept, developing it alongside fellow screenwriter Terri Tatchell into ""District 9."" ""It's pretty cool,"" Blomkamp said. ""I would've packed my bags and left had [Jackson] not said that."" It's been more than two years since Blomkamp started the project, and though he's found the experience exhausting, he has quite a final product to show off. ""There is nothing better than to come out the end of that process and have it play in a movie theater,"" he said. ""For that first film, I got what I had set out to do, [and] that's a pretty awesome feeling.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Tyler Perry, the star, writer and producer of films such as ""Madea Goes to Jail"" and the television show ""House of Payne,"" could be adding philanthropist to his growing list of credits. Tyler Perry is sponsoring a trip to Disney World for kids at a largely minority day-care center. According to his publicist, Perry is sponsoring a Disney World trip for 65 Pennsylvania children at a largely minority day-care center after a swim club canceled pool privileges for the children. ""He wanted to do something nice for them and let them know that for every negative experience, there are people out there who want them to succeed regardless of the color of their skin,"" said Keleigh Thomas, Perry's publicist. She added the entertainer would be footing the bill for all transportation, hotel, admissions and food costs at the Florida theme park. When Perry heard about the situation with the children in the highly publicized aftermath of the pool cancellation, he immediately wanted to help them, Thomas told CNN, adding that a trip to Disney World is definitely ""better than the pool."" ""I am ecstatic for the children,"" Alethea Wright, director of the Creative Steps day-care center, told CNN. Perry's team extended the offer to her on Friday, she said. The Disney World stay will be from August 1 to 3, according to Perry's Web site. The pool controversy started after the Valley Swim Club in suburban Philadelphia revoked the swimming privileges for children from the Creative Steps center after one visit on June 29. Some black and Hispanic children said white club members made racist comments to them during that visit, asking why ""black children were there"" and raising concerns that ""they might steal from us."" The day-care center had originally contracted to use the pool during the summer, but the club canceled the agreement and returned the day-care center's $1,950 check without explanation. The club canceled contracts with two other day-care centers because of safety and crowding, swim club director John Duesler said. Those facilities have not protested the club's actions. The issue was exacerbated when Duesler told two Philadelphia television stations the children had changed ""the complexion"" and ""atmosphere"" of the club. The comment brought protesters outside the facility. Duesler later said that safety and crowding prompted the cancellation. As the controversy grew and reached national news shows, the swim club asked the Creative Steps day care to return. It refused and said it would pursue a lawsuit. In a statement posted Monday on his Web site, Perry summed up his feelings about the pool situation: ""This made me so angry,"" he wrote. ""This is awful, and for anyone that has grown up in the inner-city, you know that one small act of kindness can change your life,"" he wrote, adding that with the trip to Disney World, ""I want them to know that for every act of evil that a few people will throw at you, there are millions more who will do something kind for them. This is all about the kids.""","Tyler Perry to send 65 kids from day care center to Disney World .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Boko Haram launched a grisly attack on a Nigerian village in an area that troops had been using as a base in the search for hundreds of schoolgirls abducted by the militant group, witnesses told CNN on Wednesday. The hourslong assault on Gamboru Ngala that left at least 150 people dead, some of whom were burned alive, is the latest in a series of brazen attacks and abductions by Boko Haram, raising concern about whether the Nigerian government can retake control of the region from the entrenched terror group. Word of the attack follows news that President Goodluck Jonathan, who has been under fire for his handling of the mass abduction, accepted U.S., British and Chinese offers of assistance to find the schoolgirls, officials with those governments said. It's unclear what impact the latest attack could have on the international response to Nigeria's fight with Boko Haram, which so far has concentrated on helping the government rescue 276 schoolgirls abducted on April 14. The assault on the village came after military troops deployed to the area were called to the border area near Chad, where reports -- later determined to be false -- surfaced that the schoolgirls had been found with Boko Haram militants, witnesses and local officials said. CNN cannot independently confirm the report, and attempts Wednesday to contact Nigeria's military for comment were unsuccessful. Indiscriminate killing . Witnesses described a well-coordinated attack that began shortly after 1:30 p.m. local time Monday at a busy outdoor market in Gamboru Ngala. Wearing military uniforms, the militants arrived with three armored personnel carriers, they said. They shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" -- ""God is great"" -- and opened up on the market, firing rocket-propelled grenades and tossing improvised explosive devices, witnesses said. Some marketgoers tried to take shelter in shops only to be burned alive when the gunmen set fire to a number of the businesses, the witnesses said. A few Nigerian soldiers who had been left behind at the village could not hold off the assault and were forced to flee, they said. Many sought safe haven in nearby Cameroon, they said. The fighters also attacked the police station during the 12-hour assault, initially facing stiff resistance. They eventually used explosives to blow the roof off the building, witnesses said. Fourteen police officers were found dead inside, they said. The final death toll could be closer to 300, Nigerian Sen. Ahmed Zanna told CNN. Monday's bloody attack by Boko Haram militants, some of whom U.S. officials say have been trained by al Qaeda, follows a pattern of seeking revenge against anybody who is perceived to have provided aid to the Nigerian government. International aid taking shape . News of the attack came as U.S. officials pressed ahead with plans to provide Nigeria with law enforcement assistance and military consultations, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""Obviously, this is in the interest of the Nigerian government to accept every aspect of our assistance,"" she told reporters during a briefing Wednesday. ""They conveyed that they were willing to do that yesterday and it continues to be in their interest to be as cooperative as possible."" U.S. officials will establish a joint coordination cell at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja where the goal will be to provide intelligence, investigations and hostage negotiation expertise, Psaki said. The cell will include U.S. military personnel, who are expected to arrive in Nigeria in the coming days, she said. The Pentagon has started planning for how it can help Nigeria, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. It's unlikely at this point that U.S. troops would be involved in operations, the officials said. Britain is sending a small team of experts to complement the U.S. team, a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday. The spokesman didn't specify the nature of the team's expertise. On behalf of China, Premier Li Keqiang offered satellite and intelligence services to aid in the search. Meanwhile, Nigerian authorities offered a reward of about $310,000 on Wednesday for information leading to the rescue of the girls. ""While calling on the general public to be part of the solution to the present security challenge, the Police High Command also reassures all citizens that any information given would be treated anonymously and with utmost confidentiality,"" the Nigeria Police Force said in a statement. According to accounts, armed members of Boko Haram overpowered security guards at an all-girls school in Chibok, yanked the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks. The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. The reward offer comes amid international outcry over the mass kidnapping in mid-April. The #BringBackOurGirls campaign initially began on Twitter. It quickly spread, with demonstrators taking to the streets over the weekend in major cities around the world to demand action. Defending the response . Nigeria's President has been under enormous international pressure to step up efforts to rescue the girls after come after waiting three weeks to publicly acknowledge the kidnappings. His administration, however, is defending its response -- even as details emerged this about a second mass kidnapping. At least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15 were snatched Sunday night from the village of Warabe by Boko Haram, villagers said. ""The President and the government (are) not taking this as easy as people all over the world think,"" presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said, adding that helicopters and airplanes have searched for the girls in 250 locations. More troops, he said, are on the way. Despite the flurry of activity, the father of two of the schoolgirls taken by Boko Haram scoffed at the Nigerian government's response. ""We have never seen any military man there,"" said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals by the government or Boko Haram. ""Had it been military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters, we would have seen them."" Members of the U.S. Congress called for action, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the abductions ""abominable"" and Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani children's rights activist shot in the head by the Taliban, spoke out, too. ""The girls in Nigeria are my sisters and it is my responsibility that I speak up for my sisters,"" Yousafzai told CNN's ""Amanpour."" The U.S. first lady, Michelle Obama, was among the latest high-profile figures to take to Twitter about the girls' plight, tweeting a photo of herself holding a sign that read: #BringBackOurGirls. ""Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families,"" she said in the post. Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge . 'I abducted your girls' Boko Haram translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language, and the group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The United States has branded Boko Haram a terror organization and has put a $7 million bounty on the group's elusive leader, Abubakar Shekau. A man claiming to be Shekau appeared in a video announcing he would sell his victims. The video was first obtained Monday by Agence-France Presse. ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" he said. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women."" More than 450,000 people, including celebrities and lawmakers, to date have signed a change.org petition that calls upon the world to act to save the girls. The petition calls on Jonathan and the government ""to ensure all schools are safe places to learn, protected from attack."" CNN Freedom Project: Ending Modern-Day Slavery .

""If you're an average guest here on vacation this is not something you want to be doing,"" Lindsay said. ""It's very much like running a marathon throughout the day."" And don't try it with the kids, they said. Can you imagine running past the gift shop or ice cream parlor to make your 37th ride? They started at Hollywood Studios in the morning and rode all the open rides at Walt Disney World's three other parks, too: Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. The weather cooperated this year, and their strategy of fast passes, single rider lanes and time management paid off. They kept moving and kept hydrated by filling up their water bottles and eating from their supply of energy bars. ""If you sat down in a vehicle of some kind and it moved you even a few feet we considered that a ride,"" said Lindsay.","Riding all the rides at Walt Disney World was two men's dream .

"(CNN) -- Experts are always looking for creative ways to increase awareness about public health problems. A new idea from the University of Alaska Anchorage has definitely caught some people's attention. In an effort to combat fetal alcohol syndrome, researchers are planning to install free pregnancy test dispensers in the bathrooms of some bars. Alaska has the highest reported rate of fetal alcohol syndrome in the United States, according to a 2010 report by the state's Department of Health and Social Services. Health officials estimate that in Alaska, 126 babies born each year are affected by prenatal alcohol use (out of roughly 731,000 people in 2010, one of the lowest state populations). However, most states don't have comprehensive data about their rates, making it difficult to draw national comparisons. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is an umbrella term used to describe the range of possible lifelong effects from prenatal alcohol exposure, such as physical, mental, behavioral and/or learning disabilities. Fetal alcohol syndrome and spectrum disorder are often used interchangeably. The university's two-year, $400,000 program begins in December and will be studied closely. Pregnancy test dispensers will be placed in bars that are frequented by women 21 to 44 in six regions of the state. In different bars within the same areas, printed warnings will be posted to provide a control group for the researchers. Both methods will include a toll-free number, website and QR code to complete a short survey about knowledge and prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome. The surveys are site specific, so the university will be able to measure results for each location individually. Staff will also conduct interviews with bar patrons and staff to analyze the use and effectiveness of the dispensers and confirm the survey results. The hope: Pregnant women stop drinking that night . The researchers believe offering free pregnancy tests in bar restrooms will encourage women to use them and, if they are pregnant, stop drinking that night. ""This is a rigorous pilot study to evaluate community based intervention,"" said David Driscoll, director of the University of Alaska Anchorage's Institute for Circumpolar Studies. ""It's only part of a much larger set of initiatives."" Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the program and whether it's worth the cost. Will a free pregnancy test really be used at the bar and stop someone from drinking? Opponents criticized Alaska state Sen. Pete Kelly's program proposal, saying the money would be better spent on giving away condoms or contraception at bars to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Kelly argued the pregnancy tests will be available to help responsible citizens. ""If you know you're pregnant, you won't drink. That is true for much of the population,"" the Republican senator said in an interview with the Anchorage Daily News. ""Birth control is for people who don't necessarily want to act responsibly."" The paper argued many people using birth control are acting responsibly. Depending on what stage of her pregnancy she's in and how often a woman drinks, fetal alcohol syndrome can cause, among other things, abnormal facial features, brain damage, hyperactivity, difficulty with judgment and motor skill impairment, according to the Mayo Clinic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Surgeon General all agree that women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy, since no amount has been determined to be safe. Approximately 40,000 babies are born with fetal alcoholism in the United States, according to the CDC. 'Why take the risk?' Alcohol is harmful to a fetus or embryo at any time -- even before a woman knows she's pregnant, said the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. ""We know that alcohol is a neurotoxin, and we know that it crosses the placenta,"" said the organization's president Tom Donaldson. ""Why take the risk?"" Although not involved in the project, Donaldson is eager to monitor the outcome, and based upon the attention this strategy has gotten, he has high hopes for its success. Until now, fetal alcohol syndrome prevention has relied on advisories and labels, which people aren't inclined to look at. But this creative approach, he says, comes without finger-wagging. ""If a woman chooses to drink or not is based on the moment,"" he said. ""It's not a broad admonition."" Study: paying more for alcohol saves lives . Jody Allen Crowe, founder of the nonprofit organization Healthy Brains for Children, started a similar pregnancy test program in Minnesota and is a consultant on this project. He manufactures and is providing the dispensers and tests, both which include information about fetal alcohol syndrome prevention. Less than two years after the first dispenser in Minnesota was installed, there are now 10 dispensers located in bars, a youth center and even a convenience story by a community college. Crowe has also moved his project into Canada and is in talks with universities in other states about similar studies. ""We've experienced success so far, but what we need now is empirical, gold standard research,"" Crowe said. The University of Alaska's study will be able to gather the necessary data to provide tangible results. There's no numerical data to measure the success of the program, but Crowe said the $3 pregnancy tests in Minnesota are being utilized and replenished. The Alaska study hopes to determine how many women taking the tests actually stop drinking during their pregnancy. Alaska falls slightly below the national average for alcohol consumption in women ages 18 to 44, according the the CDC. The state leads the country in rapes, at almost triple the national average. Alaska also ranks in the top 10 for alcohol abuse, with just over 21% of adults reporting binge drinking habits. Both of these factors likely contribute to the high rate of fetal alcohol syndrome among Alaska residents, experts believe. While it's certainly generating a buzz, experts believe that this program has a strong potential for positive results. The university's study will provide research and quantitative data that could change the face of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention on a national level.

"Toluca, Mexico (CNN) -- For decades, Richard St. Denis has advocated for the rights of Americans who, like him, are living with a disability. But the attorney from Colorado saw his life shift in 1997, when he was invited to speak in Mexico. ""I was asked to bring one wheelchair to give to somebody,"" he remembers. ""As I was waiting for the program to begin, I was shocked to see people using branches for crutches, being pushed in wheelbarrows and crawling."" The lone wheelchair went to Leti Elizale Marcial, a 17-year-old suffering from polio. She had never walked a day in her life, and she was carried around daily by her mother. ""I saw how happy she was, but I looked around and saw the other people that had nothing,"" St. Denis said. ""Their life was going to be exactly the same, and one wheelchair was not enough. I just felt someone had to come and help."" So once a year from 1997 until 2004, St. Denis would load a van with 10 to 15 donated wheelchairs and drive 30 hours -- from Colorado to Mexico -- to distribute them to people with disabilities. Now, he has a permanent residence in the country and a nonprofit, World Access Project, that provides custom-fit wheelchairs, walkers and canes to people in rural Mexican communities. ""We want to distribute the more than 75,000 wheelchairs we estimate get thrown away in the U.S. every year,"" said St. Denis, 56. ""What we call our trash becomes their riches, and it makes an incredible difference in their lives."" The used wheelchairs are collected from hospitals, nursing homes, medical supply businesses and individual donors from across the United States. With help from a U.S.-based nonprofit, Hope Haven, the wheelchairs are refurbished by senior citizen volunteers and prison inmates in Iowa before being shipped to Mexico. St. Denis' group also began purchasing mobility equipment from a company in Mexico that makes wheelchairs designed for use on the country's rough terrain. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . St. Denis said the wheelchairs provide recipients with more independence, access to job opportunities and the chance to pursue a social life. ""Before it, I didn't know anyone; I was in the house,"" said Marcial, who is now 32. ""After I got my chair, it was like I was born again. I went out, and I got to know other people with disabilities when I'd thought I was the only one. I also started working, and I have my own house now. I'm married, and my 2-year-old girl thinks of Richard like a grandfather. I really am thankful for all of his support."" The mission of World Access Project goes beyond a one-time gift. ""We don't just give them a wheelchair and say, 'Adios,' "" St. Denis said. ""We develop relationships, and we teach people how to use the chair -- not just as something to sit in. Volunteers from the United States come down a few times a year to help make the recipients' homes more wheelchair-accessible, and we host classes and camps to teach people how to play sports with their chairs."" St. Denis has become a familiar face throughout Mexico, where an estimated 2 million people have some form of disability, according to a government housing census. He is frequently welcomed into homes and greeted kindly wherever he goes, and he has formed relationships with other organizations that serve people with disabilities. He believes his project's popularity is due, in great part, to a personal connection to the people he serves. ""I understand what they're going through, and they know I understand,"" St. Denis said. ""We're conquerors of the limitations in our life."" In 1976, St. Denis fell while skiing in Lake Tahoe, California. The result was a severed spinal cord, a surgery-filled hospital stay and the rest of his life in a wheelchair. ""I thought (it) was a horrible tragedy,"" said St. Denis, who was an airplane mechanic in the Air Force at the time. ""I woke up every morning wishing I was dead ... angry at God for taking the ability to walk away from me. ... I just stopped wanting anything for my life."" St. Denis rejected most forms of assistance from anyone. But with time -- and inspiration from a wheelchair-bound veteran he befriended -- he eventually ""adjusted"" and found a new purpose. St. Denis said he is now content and comfortable in Mexico, where he lives and works for 10 months out of the year. But he acknowledges that he has received some criticism from friends and family in the United States. ""People say, 'it's too dangerous in Mexico; why do you go there to help when you can help people in the United States?' "" he said. ""I feel like God has called me to do this. They need a presence here, and what I'm doing is teaching other people so that when the day comes when I can't come to Mexico anymore, the people of Mexico will continue doing this work. That would be the biggest dream that I could ever imagine."" Through World Access Project, St. Denis has helped more than 500 people in Mexico. He has also made lifelong friendships and learned that personal losses can be used to transform the lives of others. ""One day, someone said, 'Richard, I want to thank you for giving up your legs so we could have a better quality of life,' "" St. Denis said. ""I didn't intentionally give up my legs, but I feel like I gave up something to help other people. I know people's lives are getting better in Mexico. I feel really great to be part of that.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher died Friday from complications of kidney and bladder cancer, his family said. He was 85. As America's chief diplomat for four years during President Bill Clinton's administration, Christopher ""eschewed confrontation in favor of negotiation with friend and foe alike,"" according to a profile posted on the State Department website. ""The cause of peace and freedom and decency have never had a more tireless or tenacious advocate,"" Clinton said in 1996 after Christopher announced he was stepping down from the post. President Obama said he and the first lady were saddened to hear of the loss. ""Deeply dedicated to serving his country, Warren's career ranged from the naval reserve in World War II to a clerkship at the Supreme Court to the practice of law and politics in California and Washington,"" Obama said in a statement. ""And as President Clinton's Secretary of State, he was a resolute pursuer of peace, leading negotiations with regard to the Middle East and the Balkans, including the Dayton Agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia.  Warren Christopher was a skillful diplomat, a steadfast public servant, and a faithful American,"" the president said. In 1981, Christopher received the Medal of Freedom -- the nation's highest civilian award -- for his role in negotiating the release of 52 American hostages in Iran while serving as deputy secretary of state for President Jimmy Carter. Christopher -- known as ""Chris"" to his friends -- also oversaw the negotiation of the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the Bosnian war. ""Literally, until the last minute the outcome was in doubt. Our negotiators had their bags packed and were ready to head home without an agreement. But Chris refused to give up,"" Clinton recalled in his 1996 remarks. ""And the force of his will finally convinced the Balkan leaders to give in to the logic of peace."" Clinton went on to praise Christopher's efforts in the Middle East peace process and helping build democracy in Haiti. Issuing a statement from Paris, where she is attending a summit over the crisis in Libya, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she also was deeply saddened by the passing of her predecessor. ""The longer I spend in this job, the deeper my appreciation grows for the giants who came before,"" she said. ""Warren was a diplomat's diplomat -- talented, dedicated and exceptionally wise."" She credited Christopher helping establish diplomatic relations with China, overseeing the expansion of NATO, and working for peace in the Middle East. She said he ""championed human rights around the world."" ""In addition to being a great statesman, Warren was also a dear friend,"" she said. ""I relied on his advice and experience over many years."" Christopher also played a significant leadership role on several domestic issues, particularly in the state of California, where he was chairman and later senior partner of the O'Melveny & Myers law firm. He chaired a commission investigating the Rodney King assault and subsequent riots in Los Angeles, and served on the California Hate Crimes Task Force, according to a biography provided by the firm. His legal career began with a clerkship with U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who advised Christopher to ""get out into the stream of history and swim as fast as you can,"" the law firm's biography said. That idea stuck with Christopher, who later said ""being Secretary of State is to take part in history's relay race"" after announcing his plans to step down from the post. Christopher was born in Scranton, North Dakota. He served as a Naval ensign in during World War II. He graduated from the University of Southern California in 1945 and graduated from Stanford Law School in 1949. In a 2009 interview, he told the Los Angeles Times that his views about human rights were shaped by the trips he took with his father, who was a clerk for foreclosure sales in North Dakota during the Great Depression. ""On the way there, he would talk to me about the hardship the farmers faced. That certainly was the beginning of it for me. It's a constant struggle to try to improve the lot of people around the world,"" he said. ""A lot of people live in poverty and deprivation, and we have to be constantly alert to do what we can, to always feel we have done as much as we should."" He is survived by his wife, four children and five grandchildren, the law firm's biography said. Plans for a private memorial are pending.

"(CNN) -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that China's Gini coefficient -- a number that is widely used to measure a country's income inequality -- is 0.61. This number suggests a level of income inequality so high that can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. In the U.S., this number is 0.39. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's economy. Why? The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Here the next generation of Chinese leadership can and should play a significant role. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment and income transfer programs. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. Although 90% of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems, benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance. Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system. China's urban unemployment rate was at 8.0% in the summer of 2012. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. It also pays too little: unemployment benefit is only 17% of the average salary compared to 47% in the U.S. and 60% in Germany. Given the challenges ahead, China's new leadership should view this with some urgency: When the economy is in transition, unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help. China can also learn from successful programs in the developed and developing countries. Programs such as Earned Income Tax Credits of the United States help the poor who actually work. Many developing countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and India have various Conditional Cash Transfer programs that pay poor families if they keep their kids in the school. Recognizing the serious income inequality problem in China, Beijing issued a new income redistribution policy in February. The new policy moves in the right direction, but is not nearly enough. Beijing plans to raise the government spending on social welfare programs by two percentage points within next five years, from 12% to 14%. The comparable number in the United States is 37%. If Chinese government wants to serious tackle the income inequality while helping boost consumption of the country, they have to work on a much larger scale. There is money on the table to support this. China's state owned enterprises (SOEs) are tremendously profitable due to their monopoly positions but only turn in less than 10% of those profits to the government. Beijing runs a budget deficit of only 1% of its GDP. According to the new plan, Beijing will demand five percentage points more of the share of the profits from SOEs. That's not enough. If Beijing doubles its budget deficit (still very low relative to most developed countries) and boosts revenue from SOEs on social welfare programs and income transfers, China would spend at similar percentage as the U.S. and inequality may be reduced to a similar rate. If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy.

"(CNN) -- Foreign diplomatic missions in North Korea face an ominous decision after Pyongyang said Friday it could not guarantee the safety of embassies and international organizations in the event of armed conflict. Tensions on the Korean peninsula remain in a heightened state amid new reports that North Korea has prepared missiles for launch, while South Korea has deployed naval destroyers to its coasts. The British Foreign Office said North Korea told British officials that it would not be able to guarantee the safety of diplomats in the capital if fighting breaks out. Several diplomatic missions said the North Koreans held a meeting Friday for ambassadors in which they asked whether anyone needed assistance in evacuating their personnel. ""We are consulting international partners about these developments,"" the British Foreign Office said in a written statement. ""No decisions have been taken, and we have no immediate plans to withdraw our embassy."" A spokesman for Sweden's ministry of foreign affairs said the North Koreans ""did not urge us or ask us to evacuate,"" but offered assistance for those who wanted to leave. The Swedish Embassy in North Korea acts ""as the United States' interim protecting power and provides basic consular services to U.S. citizens traveling in North Korea,"" according to the U.S. State Department. The Swedish Embassy remains open and operational, the spokesman said. Russian state media reported a more specific suggestion for its diplomats. North Korea asked the Russian Embassy to consider a possible evacuation of its staff because of the tensions, Denis Samsonov, spokesman for the embassy, told Russian state media. France's foreign ministry state it was taking the situation ""seriously."" It said it had no current plans for evacuations of personnel or French nationals in the country. The developments come as two medium-range missiles have been loaded onto mobile launchers on the East coast of North Korea, a U.S. official told CNN on Friday. A second U.S. official said intelligence on that is not definitive. The account followed a report by South Korea's semi-official Yonhap news agency, citing military sources in Seoul, that the two missiles were ready to be launched. Yonhap said the missiles have been hidden in an unidentified facility. In response, South Korea has sent Aegis destroyers equipped with advanced radar systems to both of its coasts, Yonhap said, citing navy sources. The United States would ""not be surprised"" if North Korea launched a missile, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday. ""We have seen them launch missiles in the past and the United Nations Security Council has repeatedly condemned them as violations of the North's obligations under numerous Security Council resolutions."" New regional tensions were triggered by North Korean saber rattling, including threats to launch nuclear strikes, and the flexing of military prowess by the United States and South Korea in response. These followed the imposition of stepped up U.N. sanctions against the North after its latest nuclear test in February. North Korea has also said it planned to restart ""without delay"" a reactor at its main nuclear complex that it shut down five years ago as part of a deal with the United States, China and four other nations. Most observers say the North is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile. And many analysts say the increasingly belligerent talk is aimed at cementing the domestic authority of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Thursday the situation did ""not need to get hotter,"" reflecting efforts by the Obama administration to ease its rhetoric and cool tensions. But the latest developments by North Korea, which has accused the United States of pushing the region to the ""brink of war,"" could signal a missile launch soon, officials have said. The missile components, U.S. and South Korean officials have said, are consistent with those of a Musudan missile, which has a 2,500-mile range, meaning it could threaten South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. U.S. reducing rhetoric that feeds North Korean rhetoric . It is believed a missile launch would be a ""test"" launch rather than a targeted strike. That is because it appears the North Koreans have only moved the components so far. The United States is waiting to see whether North Korea issues a customary notice to its airmen and mariners to stay out of the region. Communication intercepts in recent days also seem to show that Pyongyang might be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks, another U.S. official said. Key dates in U.S. military moves near North Korea . Wednesday, the United States announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases.

Pentagon officials, while decrying North Korean rhetoric, said recent announcements of U.S. military deployments in response to belligerent statements by Pyongyang may have contributed to the escalating tensions. As the bombast reaches a fever pitch, the United States is refining its message. The Pentagon now says it is working to decrease the temperature as it maintains a frank and vigilant stance toward the threats. Photos: Painting a picture of North Korea . Starting Wednesday, North Korea also barred South Korean workers and managers from entering the Kaesong industrial complex, an economic cooperation zone that sits on the North's side of the border but houses operations of scores of South Korean companies.

"(CNN) -- Less than three months after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie cruised to an overwhelming reelection win, the main political question he faces isn't whether he can make a transition to the national stage and run for president -- it's whether he can continue to govern the state at all. Negative press about the so-called Bridgegate scandal -- an apparent decision by top Christie aides to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge and snarl traffic for days on end, allegedly out of petty political spite toward local officials -- has taken a severe toll on Christie's national prospects: A recent poll confirms that he has tumbled from first to third place as a potential 2016 presidential candidate. But that could prove to be the least of Christie's headaches. A more pressing matter is raised by a short, devastating letter penned by Alan Zegas, the lawyer for a former top aide to Christie, David Wildstein, and published on the New York Times website. The immediate point of the letter was to press the Port Authority, the agency that operates the George Washington Bridge, to pay Wildstein's legal expenses. But it's not just a financial dispute. If Wildstein, who personally oversaw the lane closures, was following orders requested or approved from on high, he can demand legal protection by the agency. But by refusing to cover his costs, the Port Authority is saying, in effect, that Wildstein was acting on his own. The letter by Wildstein's attorney bluntly suggests otherwise: ""It has also come to light that a person within the Christie administration communicated the Christie administration's order that certain lanes on the George Washington Bridge were to be closed, and evidence exists as well tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the Governor stated publicly in a two-hour press conference."" Ouch. The Christie administration hastily responded with a statement that the governor ""had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein's motivations were for closing them to begin with."" But the damage was done: The scandal now has the potential to be carried directly into the inner circle of the Governor's office, and undermine his credibility. Until now, Christie has employed a blunt but effective two-step strategy for containing the scandal. Step One: Summarily fire and publicly condemn deputies who were linked to the scandal. Step Two: Plead utter ignorance as to how or why these top aides would engage in unethical or illegal behavior. The strategy was never quite plausible -- Christie, a former prosecutor, has a reputation as a hands-on manager whose aides don't stray far without permission -- and it's a risky gambit: By publicly denigrating fired members of his inner circle, Christie opens himself to the possibility of disgruntled ex-employees going public with information that is embarrassing, or even incriminating. One can only imagine what Wildstein was thinking during Christie's two-hour press conference, in which he blasted Wilstein and another fired ex-aide, Bridget Ann Kelly, for ""abject stupidity."" ""What did I do wrong to have these folks think it was OK to lie to me?"" he said during the press conference. Adding insult to injury, Christie went so far as to say that Wildstein, often described in the press as a high school friend, wasn't really a Christie pal. ""David and I were not friends in high school. We were not even acquaintances in high school,"" Christie said. ""We didn't travel in the same circles in high school. You know, I was the class president and athlete. I don't know what David was doing during that period of time."" At least one commentator, Michael Tomasky, thinks that personal snub might make Wildstein more inclined to turn on Christie. ""What if Wildstein is sitting on some goods? Is he going to be happy being dismissed as too geeky for Christie to waste his time on back in high school?"" Tomasky asks, concluding: ""The nerd is striking back."" As a matter of political technique, Christie's swift firings and forceful denials seem credible in the short term -- but they also echo at least one time when the denounce-and-fire tactic backfired. In 2010, after New Jersey's request for millions in federal education funds was rejected -- in part because the final request lacked key budget estimates -- Christie publicly castigated and fired his education commissioner, Brett Schundler, allegedly for lying to him about what went wrong with the application. But Schundler swiftly struck back, producing e-mails and other documents that showed he had, indeed, told Christie up front about the application's shortcomings. ""I will not accept being defamed by the Governor for something he knows I did not do,"" wrote Schundler. ""The Governor called me a liar this week. That was the last straw."" The Schundler episode is important. Will Christie's strenuous denials of knowledge of Bridgegate -- and his suggestion that his top aides lied to him -- hold up under scrutiny? Indeed, the state's most powerful newspaper, the Star-Ledger, is already warning Christie that the end may be near. Within hours of the publication of Wildstein letter suggesting Christie knew about Bridgegate, the paper published a hard-hitting editorial. ""If this charge proves true, then the governor must resign or be impeached. Because that would leave him so drained of credibility that he could not possibly govern effectively,"" the editorial says. ""He would owe it to the people of New Jersey to stop the bleeding and quit."" For Christie, it's been a long, bumpy road. He began November with a spectacular reelection and a coveted spot on the cover of Time Magazine. He enters February with troubling hints that his governorship may be damaged beyond repair. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Bridgegate has hit New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's national prospects hard .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean coast guard commando was stabbed to death and another injured Monday after they boarded a Chinese fishing vessel they suspected of fishing illegally in the Yellow Sea, the coast guard and a South Korean news agency said Monday. The incident triggered a swift diplomatic response, with the South Korean Foreign Ministry calling in the Chinese ambassador to South Korea to protest, the Yonhap news agency reported. First Vice Foreign Minister Park Suk-hwan ""strongly demanded the Chinese government strictly clamp down on illegal fishing and the illegal acts of Chinese fishermen,"" the news agency quoted him as saying. South Korea said it had seized the Chinese ship and nine sailors aboard, Yonhap reported. A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday that the country is ""closely following the case."" ""China is ready to work closely with the (South Korean) side to handle the case properly,"" spokesman Liu Weimin said. ""The two countries had signed relevant fishery agreements. ... Competent authorities have taken measures to educate Chinese fishermen and management of outbound fishing boats to prohibit cross-border fishing and irregularities. ""At the same time,"" Liu added, ""we hope the (South Korean) side will fully protect the rights and interests of Chinese fishermen and provide them with due humanitarian treatment."" The incident started after South Korean commandos boarded the Chinese ship. The captain of that ship ""suddenly broke a window pane on the ship"" and stabbed one commando several times with a piece of broken glass, Yonhap reported. That commando later died; another was hurt. South Korean authorities took the ship toward the port at Incheon, west of Seoul. The Yellow Sea has been a point of contention for several Asian countries, most notably North and South Korea who have long disagreed on whose waters end where. The South Korean coast guard has stopped hundreds of Chinese boats this year on suspicion of illegal fishing in the sea. The waters, which are important fishing and crab grounds, are also frequently crowded with boats from China. And disputes over fishing rights have resulted in dozens of boat seizures. CNN's Chi Chi Zhang and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","NEW: South Korea has seized the ship and its nine sailors .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When Haiti suffered a massive earthquake two years ago, many people responded by donating money. Jake Wood responded with a Facebook post. ""I'm going to Haiti. Who's in?"" wrote the former U.S. Marine. The images Wood was seeing on the news reminded him of his tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He realized that the skills he had acquired in the service, including the ability to adapt to difficult conditions, work with limited resources and maintain security in a dangerous environment, were sorely needed. ""Those are just lessons that you work at every single day in Falluja,"" said Wood, 28. ""To a veteran, it's second nature."" Wood wanted to help, and he persuaded his college roommate, a firefighter, to join him. Within minutes of seeing Wood's Facebook post, another friend and former Marine, William McNulty, signed on. Interest quickly snowballed, and soon donations poured into Wood's PayPal account. Three days later, he and seven others were in the Dominican Republic, heading into neighboring Haiti with medicine and equipment. Over the next three weeks, more than 60 volunteers -- mainly from medical or military backgrounds -- followed Wood's lead and made their way to the stricken country to join his group. They set up triage centers in camps, treating whoever they could, and helped ferry people to hospitals. Wood estimates they helped thousands of Haitians. They called their group Team Rubicon, in reference to the phrase ""crossing the Rubicon,"" which means passing a point of no return. The moniker turned out to be appropriate. Wood had planned for the trip to be a one-time mission. But during their time in Haiti, he and McNulty became aware that they were on to something. ""We realized we were more effective than many organizations that were down there with us,"" Wood said. ""We also realized that most organizations weren't engaging vets on their own. So we said, 'Let's try to improve this.' "" Team Rubicon became a nonprofit, and Wood has never looked back. In the past two years, he says, the group has built an army of more than 1,400 volunteers -- 80% of them military veterans -- who respond to disasters and help those in need. The team has conducted 14 missions. It ran triage clinics after the Chile earthquake and the flooding in Pakistan. It traveled to Sudan and Myanmar to help people caught in regional conflicts. And last year, it removed debris and assisted in search-and-rescue missions following tornadoes in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Joplin, Missouri. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . Disaster relief requires springing into action quickly, and Team Rubicon prides itself on being fast to deploy. Senior team members monitor severe weather alerts via Twitter, and when a storm is brewing, they notify volunteers in that region to make sure it's on their radar. When the decision is made to deploy, the team quickly establishes a roster of needs online so volunteers can sign up. ""We'll tell them where to be, when, etc."" Wood said. ""For instance, we'll meet up, convoy in, (and) link up with the emergency operations center."" Wood never envisioned himself running a nonprofit. After graduating in 2005 from the University of Wisconsin, where he also played football, Wood enlisted in the Marines and completed two combat tours. When his military obligation was up, he intended to go to business school. But a couple of weeks after he finished filling out his applications, the earthquake hit Haiti. 'A reason to come together' From the beginning, Wood and McNulty believed that using veterans to respond to disasters made a lot of sense. But over time, they realized that the missions were also benefiting the veterans themselves, giving them a sense of purpose and self-worth that they often lose when they transition to civilian life. Wood believes that today's veterans enjoy the fellowship that comes from giving back. ""Being able to help people and be a part of a team once again ... I think gives them some of (what) they were missing,"" Wood said. ""They are almost recharged."" Wood realized the importance of this after a personal loss in April 2011. His best friend, Clay Hunt -- a fellow veteran and Team Rubicon volunteer -- committed suicide. Hunt had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and survivor's guilt. It was a shock to Wood, as Hunt seemed to be adjusting well. He was literally a poster boy for returning veterans, appearing in a public-service announcement for a veterans advocacy group. ""It was tremendously difficult to feel like I had let him down, knowing that we had survived two wars together but that when things were easy and it had come to peace, that I wasn't there enough for him,"" Wood said. ""That has been a very tough battle for me, dealing with that."" Hunt's death made Wood realize how critically important the connections are that Team Rubicon enables veterans to build with each other. It also made the group refocus its own mission: Instead of being a disaster relief organization that uses veterans, Team Rubicon is now a veterans support organization that uses disasters as opportunities for continued service. ""We're giving them a reason to come together ... and that community lasts long after the mission,"" Wood said. ""Right now, Team Rubicon is focused on how we can ... get them involved in as many ways as possible."" The approach seems to be working. Nicole Green served in the Air Force for four years, working as an intelligence officer in Iraq from 2003 to 2004. For her, finding Team Rubicon has been life-changing. ""When I got out of the military, it was very stressful,"" she said. ""You feel alone. You meet people who don't understand your background."" Green volunteered for the group's first domestic mission, in Tuscaloosa. She enjoyed it so much that she helped out in Joplin less than a month later. ""I felt that I was doing something meaningful with my life again ... using a lot of the same skills, but in a way that (was) constructive instead of destructive,"" Green said. ""And I was with other people who understood me ... focused on a common goal. That was really a great feeling."" Team Rubicon is working with several veterans organizations to recruit more volunteers, and Wood is aiming to have 10,000 on its roster by the end of the year. The group is also working on ways to keep volunteers engaged once they sign up by doing service projects at home and abroad. Wood believes that giving veterans a chance to give back is a formula for success, and he's determined to bring his message to as many people as he can. ""There's no limit to what veterans can do. ... They've already proven that they want to serve ... and when they come home, a lot of them still want to do it,"" he said. ""It's a win-win situation.""

"(CNN) -- Three Palestinians, including two sick children, have died recently while waiting for resettlement from Iraq, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. UNHCR goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie visits the Al Waleed refugee camp in August. About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border and face difficult living conditions, including limited medical care, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency has appealed for the resettlement of ""vulnerable and sick"" children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Baghdad last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week, the UNHCR reports. The agency has been pursuing medical resettlement. ""UNHCR has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Norway last August. Another 11 medical cases submitted for resettlement are awaiting approval,"" the agency said, which is working to identify other medical cases. And it is urging the resettlement of the entire group. ""UNHCR has sought solutions for the whole group since last year and has only received positive indications from Sudan and Chile,"" the agency said. Thousands of Palestinians have lived in Iraq, with some going there when Israel was formed and others born there. The UNHCR notes that some got ""preferential treatment"" under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But they have been the targets of violence since he was toppled.

"(CNN) -- The nation's most visible budget battle was heavy on passion and light on legislative attendance Thursday as Wisconsin wrangled over a bill that would strip teachers and other public employees of most of their collective bargaining rights and cut their benefits. Republican Gov. Scott Walker called for 16 senators -- 14 of them Democrats -- to appear at the Capitol in Wisconsin for a vote on his bill. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said the chamber will reconvene Friday. Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller said he and fellow Democrats had left Madison because they were ""trying to allow opportunity for democracy to work."" ""We will return and do our job, but the governor has to do his job,"" Miller said. He noted their return is contingent on changes to the controversial legislation. Walker called on the absent lawmakers to return to Madison ""out of respect for the institution of the Legislature and the democratic process."" ""Their actions by leaving the state and hiding from voting are disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of public employees who showed up to work today and the millions of taxpayers they represent,"" Walker said. CNN affiliates WREX and WTVO reported that several of the AWOL lawmakers fled to Rockford, Illinois. And while the legislators skipped town, thousands of people came to Madison to protest the bill for a third day, including many teachers, who stand to be strongly affected by the bill. Demonstrators spilled into the state's Capitol building, chanting, ""This is our house"" and ""Forward not backward,"" voicing their opposition to the bill. The Madison Metropolitan School District canceled classes for the third day Friday, because of anticipated staff absences. Showdowns over local and state budgets -- hurt by lower tax revenues and other trends of the economic downturn, including federal budget cuts --  are occurring from California to New York. ""There are some tough decisions that are going to have to made on the revenue side and the spending side,"" said Elizabeth McNichol, senior fellow at the Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. -- A month after Illinois lawmakers approved a massive tax hike, Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday unveiled a $35.4 billion budget that depends on state lawmakers approving $8.7 billion in new borrowing largely to clear a towering stack of unpaid bills. -- In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg presented budget plans Thursday that could eliminate more than 6,000 teaching jobs in the next fiscal year. -- Last month, the mayor of crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, announced layoffs of nearly half of the city's police force and close to a third of its fire department. -- In California, Gov. Jerry Brown imposed a statewide hiring freeze across all government agencies. Thirty-five U.S. states and Puerto Rico reported projected budget shortfalls for fiscal year 2012 totaling $82.1 billion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""As most federal stimulus dollars will have been exhausted, a common phrase we hear from states across the country is that 'we're very much on our own this year,'"" said  Arturo Perez, a budget analyst for the conference. State revenues are -- at the national average -- 11% below pre-recession levels largely because of high unemployment and other effects of the economic downturn, McNichol said. ""People are out of work and not buying as much,"" McNichol noted. With fewer budget contributions that, in part, stem from the higher unemployment numbers, public-sector services and long-standing contractual obligations could suffer, she explained. The budget battle is somewhat unique in heavily unionized Wisconsin, where collective bargaining began. Many workers don't take kindly to what they see as a frontal assault on workers' rights. Walker, who says the state is in a crisis, is asking legislators to pass his Budget Repair Bill to combat a $137 million shortfall through June 30. An upcoming two-year budget for 2011-13 must address a pending $3.6 billion deficit, he said. But the state's Legislative Fiscal Bureau -- similar to the federal government's Congressional Budget Office -- reported last month that tax cuts passed late last year by Wisconsin's newly elected, Republican-led legislature had helped add more than $200 million to the state's budget shortfall. The legislation requires workers to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions, although supporters say local governments will decide on health care contribution for their employees. Pay raises would be limited to inflation, unless a referendum approves of a larger increases, and collective bargaining could cover only wages. The legislation also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification, a costly procedure, and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks. ""Calling this a budget bill is a smokescreen,"" said Bryan Kennedy, president of AFT-Wisconsin, which represents about 17,000 employees. ""This is an attack on all labor organizations."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama described the bill as ""more like an assault on unions"" and their capacity for collective bargaining. ""He doesn't see that as a good thing,"" Carney said. ""The president believes, the secretary of education believes that the best way to deal with this is for people to address these problems by sitting down at the table to collaborate and work out a solution."" But House Republicans -- many of whom were elected on budget-cutting campaigns -- have commonly taken a stricter stance on government spending and collective bargaining. ""Republicans in Congress -- and reform-minded GOP governors like Scott Walker, John Kasich and Chris Christie -- are daring to speak the truth about the dire fiscal challenges Americans face at all levels of government,"" House Speaker John Boehner said in a written statement. A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council said the issue ""goes far beyond what's being discussed as a budget."" ""It affects the very people who work on the front lines who will no longer have a voice in workplace,"" said union spokeswoman Christina Brey. The legislation would save the state about $30 million between now and the end of June and, if continued, an estimated $300 million during the next two years, Walker has said. He said workers in the private sector pay higher percentages of their pay for health care and pensions. .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An American-born Israeli man, described by police as a ""Jewish terrorist,"" is mentally unstable and in need of psychiatric help, his attorney told CNN Monday. Israeli authorities Sunday announced the arrest of Yaakov ""Jack"" Teitel, 37, a West Bank settler who was arrested last month. Israeli police and security forces say he has been charged in connection with a string of attacks and murder plots over the past 12 years against Arabs, homosexuals, leftists, messianic Jews and police forces. Teitel's attorney Adi Keidar said his client has admitted to the 1997 shooting of a Palestinian man and laying explosive devices -- in addition to other crimes that he was not involved in, particularly the August shooting attack on a Tel Aviv gay youth club that killed two people. Police said that Teitel initially claimed responsibility for the attack, but they are still unsure about the identity of the shooter. Keidar said he has yet to see the full indictment against his client. Teitel sees himself as an emissary of God, who has come to eradicate all the profanities against God, according to Keidar. He said he believes Teitel is in need of immediate psychiatric evaluation. Teitel, 37, was arrested last month in Jerusalem after hanging posters in support of the Tel Aviv attack. ""He was like a serial killer. This guy was a Jewish terrorist who targeted different types of people,"" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. ""He was deeply involved in terrorism on all different levels"". According to police, the long series of attacks began in 1997, when Teitel entered Israel as a tourist and managed to smuggle a handgun on board a British Airways flight to Tel Aviv. Teitel's first victim, police said, was Samir Balbisi, an east Jerusalem cab driver who was shot and killed. Two months later, the same gun was used to shoot and kill a Palestinian shepherd in the South Hebron Hills. Teitel was interrogated by police following the second killing but denied any involvement in the act and was later released. Teitel moved to Israel in 2000, into the West Bank settlement of Shvut Rachel, married and has four young children. According to Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, Teitel's father, who now lives in Israel as well, served as a dentist in the U.S. Marines during the Vietnam War. It is believed Teitel was first introduced to weapons and explosives during his time living on American military bases. In 2008 Teitel allegedly planted a bomb inside a package delivered to a house of a messianic Jewish family. Ami Ortiz, a 15 year old boy suffered serious injuries in the attack, police said. Next on Teitel's list of targets, police said, was Israel Prize laureate Zeev Sternhell. Teitel admitted in planting explosives at Sternhell's doorstep in September last year. Sternhell, a prominent left-wing activist was lightly wounded, according to police. Harsh questions were raised in the Israeli press Monday on how an alleged killer was able to escape the hands of the law for over 12 years and emphasized the difficulty of security forces in tracking Israeli terrorists. Shin Bet described Teitel as a lone wolf who did not confess his acts to anyone and carefully calculated his moves in order not to get caught. He did not learn the Hebrew language in all his years in Israel, they said. CNN's Michal Zippori and Guy Azriel contributed to this report.","Israel on Sunday announced the arrest of American-born Yaakov Teitel on terror charges .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Anti-Gadhafi forces have come across a military site in southern Libya that contains what appears to be radioactive material. The site, not far from Sabha in the Sahara desert, has two warehouses containing thousands of blue barrels marked with tape saying ""radioactive,"" and plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same type tape. The fact that Libya might have radioactive material is not a surprise: In 2004, the the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that the Libyan government had yellowcake stored in Sabha. Afterward, Moammar Gadhafi's government vowed its intent to dismantle its nuclear program, and there has been no indication it was ever developed enough that it might appear in weapons. Still, the fact that it was lying seemingly unguarded -- such that it could end up in the hands of terrorists or nations intent on illicitly turning radioactive material into weapons -- is a definite cause for concern, said David Albright, a former weapons inspector and now president of the Institute for Science and International Security. ""During wars, nuclear material is not protected very well,"" Albright said, noting that IAEA crews in the past have entered war-zones such as in the former Yugoslavia and Algeria. ""The IAEA needs to get there as soon as possible, to determine if anything is missing."" Yellowcake is processed uranium ore that can be used to produce enriched uranium for nuclear purposes, with Albright noting that it -- if it is what outside experts believe -- is not highly radioactive, in itself. Even so, Cirincione seconded the sentiment that the discovery was cause for alarm. ""These pictures are amazing and sobering. Remember we had been assured by the State Department just weeks ago in August that significant mustard gas, MANPADS and nuclear materials were all secured. This discovery appears to show that in fact we can't count on anything being secured in Libya now,"" Cirincione said. The yellowcake is not in itself a real danger, but having it next to high explosives is a potential environmental disaster if they were to explode, said Cirincione, who's president of the Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation. Fighters entered Sabha, long regarded as a pro-Gadhafi stronghold, on Wednesday afternoon and initially met no resistance, officials said. About a dozen lightly armed revolutionary fighters are now guarding the military site outside the city. Electric power in Sabha, which had been off for two weeks, was restored Thursday evening. In addition, Al Madar, one of the nation's mobile phone networks, began working in the city after being down for more than a month. Elsewhere, revolutionaries have taken control of the southwestern town of Ubari, chasing Moammar Gadhafi loyalists from the area as Libya's new leaders continued to gain momentum, National Transitional Council field commander Al-Amin Shtawi said Thursday. The announcement comes days after the NTC received the significant milestone of being recognized by South Africa, Algeria and the African Union as Libya's legitimate rulers. ""Due to the role and obligations that the National Transitional Council has fulfilled and due to the African Union position, Algerian-NTC (diplomatic) relations will move from semi-official to official,"" said Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci, according to state-run Radio Algerie. Algeria had been among Gadhafi's biggest allies in the region, and is where his wife and three of his children fled to in August. Troops loyal to Libya's new leaders have been putting pressure on several regime holdout cities in recent days. Along with Thursday's military action in Ubari, fighters have also clashed with Gadhafi loyalists in the northern town of Bani Walid and in Sirte. Despite not yet having complete control over the entire country, the NTC says it is planning on how to set up a new government. Elamin Belhaj, a senior member of the NTC, told CNN Wednesday that the formation of a Libyan government will not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces control the borders of the country and liberate the three cities of Bani Walid, Sirte and Sabha . That effort could take up to one month, he said. After liberation, the NTC will create an interim government by appointing a prime minister who will be responsible for forming the government. The prime minister will decide how many ministers will be in that interim government, but he must return to the NTC for approval of that government. That government will create a new constitution that will be put before the Libyan people for approval in a referendum.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean lawmaker has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for plotting an armed rebellion. The verdict makes Lee Seok-ki -- a member of South Korea's left-wing United Progressive Party -- the country's first sitting lawmaker to be convicted of treason since the 1980s. Lee was found guilty of leading a secret group of 130 members with alleged links to North Korea. Tension in the Korean peninsula escalated in early 2013, when Pyongyang declared an armistice agreement between the two Koreas invalid and said it could carry out nuclear strikes against its southern neighbor. The court was told that Lee thought that the heightened tensions could lead to war between the North and South, and he allegedly directed members of the group to attack major national facilities in the event of such a conflict. ""Piecing together the statements from the informants and evidences ... the defendants are found guilty for conspiring to start riots aimed at subverting the constitution,"" Suwon District Court said in a statement. It said a strong penalty was inevitable because Lee's plot ""posed substantial and clear threats to the existence of Korea and order of liberal democracy."" Under South Korean criminal law, a crime of rebellion can be committed when more than two people gather to conspire treason. Lee denied all charges against him, while his party, the Unified Progressive Party, described the case as ""a medieval witch-hunt."" Some local media and analysts said the investigation was being used to divert attention from allegations that South Korea's state spy agency - the National Intelligence Service - had been involved in manipulating South Korea's 2012 presidential election.","South Korean lawmaker Lee Seok-ki has been jailed for 12 years for plotting a rebellion .

"(CNN) -- Amid the current tension along the Turkish-Syrian border, Turkey has seemingly surrendered its initial reluctance to take a more proactive stance against the Islamic State (ISIS). More than 150,000 mostly Kurdish refugees have crossed the border into Turkey in recent days, fleeing the Mujahedeen's advance on the Syrian border town of Kobane. As ISIS mortar and artillery shells have repeatedly hit Turkish soil, the government in Ankara seems to have realized that it cannot divorce itself from the negative spill-over effects of the international coalition's war against the self-proclaimed caliphate. The release of Turkish diplomats who had been held hostage by ISIS in Mosul for three months leaves Turkey free to reevaluate its strategy towards the jihadist terror regime to the south. Turkish infantry and tanks have taken up position along the border with Syria waiting for a go-ahead from Ankara where Parliament voted on Thursday to provide the Turkish government with a mandate to militarily engage ISIS -- if necessary with boots on the ground. The question now is whether Turkish armed forces can be the strategic game-changer in the international coalition's war against ISIS. Ever since his return from the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been campaigning for the establishment of a safe haven in Northern Syria and Iraq. It would both provide a place of refuge for Kurds now stranded in Turkey as well as create a buffer zone to keep hostilities at bay. Turkey's potentially costly intervention would hardly be altruistic then. It would not seek to drive ISIS out of its Syrian and Iraqi heartland. Rather, military intervention would create a safe haven similar to the one created in Northern Iraq after the Gulf War -- this time around hopefully patrolled and secured not just by air power but by actual soldiers. It would relieve pressure from Turkey's border regions allowing Kurdish refugees and armed volunteers to return to their homes further south. At the same time, it would enable Turkey to galvanize her control over Kurdish heartlands, which given the local state of anarchy, have become fertile grounds for the growth of Kurdish insurgency. Unlike the Arab contributions to the U.S.-led coalition, Turkey's contribution will add more than just legitimacy. A joint military operation with capable air and land components would be able to expel the Mujahedeen from their current positions not just seizing but most importantly holding territory. Due to their NATO training, Turkish boots on ground would be able to provide the much-needed integrated forward air controlling capability to partners in the air. It would facilitate reconnaissance and target acquisition increasing the effectiveness of air strikes while minimizing their collateral damage. Further, Turkish bases geographically nearer the coalition's area of operation would increase the flight time for coalition aircrafts currently based in the Gulf. Aircrafts could remain in the air for longer and react to changing realities on the ground much quicker. Yet, both strategically and operationally, a mere military commitment by Turkey to Syria and Iraq, will not be the panacea for the underlying socio-political maladies that made the rise of ISIS possible. From a strategic point of view, there is no sole military solution to jihadist fundamentalism in the region without a comprehensive regional effort to target the socio-political root causes that have fueled insurgency in Iraq since 2003 and in Syria since 2011. From a military operational point of view, the establishment of safe havens even when enforced by Turkish ground troops, would always be an operation with limited scope. It is highly unlikely that Turkish forces would advance deep into the jihadists' heartland around Raqqa or Mosul, leaving ISIS with enough space to maneuver. And as a hybrid fighting force, ISIS has proven to be highly adaptive and flexible in its operational approaches. Since U.S. air strikes commenced more than six weeks ago, its Mujahedeen have relied more heavily on dynamic non-linear advances by infantry often in the cover of civilian environments. A conventional military approach with limited scope as envisaged by the Turkish military will find it hard to defeat ISIS on its own turf -- even with boots on the ground. While Turkish boots on the ground can bring about a short to mid-term relief in Kurdistan, they will not be the strategic game-changer in Syria and Iraq, single-handedly solving a socio-political problem by military means. Turkish boots on the ground are no alternative then to proxies with local social bases who would be jointly trained, equipped and empowered by Arab and Western partners -- proxies who could not only effectively undermine ISIS' centers of gravity but also herald the socio-political changes necessary for building sustainable security and stability in the region.","Turkey's Parliament voted on Thursday to authorize military action against ISIS .

The allegations: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act and violation of his right of publicity under New York Civil Rights Law §51, arising from a video billboard for M&Ms. The video ad depicts an M&M frolicking around New York, in what kind of looks like Times Square, in what kind of looks like The Naked Cowboy's outfit -- briefs and nothing more than a smile. There have been plenty of jokes about the lawsuit, and I'm especially fond of the ones found on The Wall Street Journal Law Blog on Thursday, such as: . All jokes aside, I think he may have a case. In order for him to show trademark infringement, The Naked Cowboy has to be trademarked; has to prove that Mars, without his consent, infringed upon the trademark; and has to show there's a ""likelihood of confusion"" between his trademark and the allegedly infringing mark -- in this case the naked M&M. To state a claim under New York's civil rights law, Burck has to show that Mars used his name, portrait or picture for purposes of trade or advertising, and without his written consent. Surprising to some -- at least to me -- The Naked Cowboy's name and likeness are in fact registered trademarks owned by Burck. According to the complaint, Burck has licensed The Naked Cowboy name and/or likeness to companies for the purposes of advertising and endorsement. Mars, Inc., had no immediate comment. His character is part of the USA Network's ""Characters Welcome"" campaign; he appeared in a music video for the song ""Rockstar"" by the multiplatinum artist Nickelback; and he's featured singing in the video game ""True Crime: New York City at Times Square."" He also has appeared in several movies and television programs, including ""Starship Dave,"" ""Survive This,"" ""Mulva: Zombie A** Kicker,"" ""Steve Harvey's Big Time,"" ""New York Minute,"" ""Creature Feature,"" ""Lonely Planet,"" ""Troma's Edge,"" ""American Icon"" and ""The Howard Stern Show."" He even appeared in a Chevrolet commercial that debuted during Super Bowl XLI. And this isn't the first time a pseudo-celebrity (sorry Cowboy) has sued and won. Remember Vanna White? She was awarded $403,000 when Samsung used a robot, wearing a blond wig, jewelry and a dress, that turned letters on a game board similar to White's role on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" the TV game show. Still laughing? I'm not. At the end of the day, this lawsuit may be the end of the era of the ""naked"" cowboy. I predict he will be able to afford some very nice duds.

"(CNN) -- Controversy continues to swirl around the comments made by Todd Akin, Missouri Representative and Senate candidate, that ""legitimate rape"" would only rarely lead to pregnancy. Initially, the media focused on the fallout of his remarks concerning issues of abortion, sexual violence and the effect on women voters. While Akin has vigorously recanted his remarks, and both Mitt Romney and President Obama have lambasted his statements, only more recently has attention been paid to the fact that Akin sits on the House Committee for Science, Space and Technology. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's petition for Speaker of the House John Boehner to remove Akin, a Republican, from the House science committee is just starting to gain momentum, and well it should. The House science committee has oversight on congressional science and technology policy and thereby helps shape the course of billions of dollars of related funding. In other words, Akin -- who is now best known for his folkloric views on reproduction -- has a strong say in determining the long-term scientific progress of our country. News: Akin imbroglio is bad news for Republicans . How can a science and technology leader like the United States allow itself to be governed by people who try to ignore scientific fact? Given Akin's ""magical"" theories regarding rape, abortion and pregnancy, I would not want him having a say in the long-term plans of a single middle-school science class, much less our nation as a whole. How do we let him get away with this? And make no mistake: We are likely to let him get away with this. Akin's apologize-and-move-on method is quite effective in politics today. In politics, the woeful reality is that folklore often trumps real science. Opinion: Rape can make you pregnant. Period. The situation with Akin is not an isolated one. The dynamics of politics over science (and emotions over data) are widespread in our government today. For much of the past year, political forces in Congress have pushed to ""overturn science"" by seeking to overturn the EPA Endangerment finding. In that case, the EPA had used what it deemed to be the best-available scientific data to conclude that greenhouse gases were a pollutant and a danger to public health, and in response (following standing government policies) it issued an emissions rule for cars and some trucks, only to encounter political hurdles questioning the data. If you want to have an argument over how government policy should or shouldn't be applied to climate change issues, that is fair. If you want to fund further data collection (by reputable entities) to add to our understanding of climate phenomena, that too is reasonable. What is not reasonable is to discredit years of scientific data without any scientific basis for doing so and to ask for a do-over. Such data takes years to collect after all, and should not be used as a stalling tactic. News: 'Legitimate rape' reaction goes global . The recurring theme in these stories is that when data goes against a politician's belief or hope, they try to refute the data and the science -- sometimes supplying their own folklore as stand-ins for real data -- rather than taking on the higher-level and more complex policy issues regarding how to respond to the data. Further examples are also easy to find, including Michele Bachmann's pseudo-scientific statement regarding vaccine side effects. As experimental scientists, my colleagues and I are often faced with situations where we hoped our experiments would yield data that neatly agree with our hypothesis, but when we actually run the experiment, we see the data indicates something either subtly or dramatically different. What do we do? Rerunning the experiment is, of course, a natural step. But eventually, if substantial data points to a hypothesis different than ours, we need to adjust our thinking, adjust our hypotheses, and accept what the data is showing us. News: Akin takes on 'party bosses,' insists he 'can win this race' Where does this leave us regarding Akin and the House science committee? One of my key roles as a thesis research adviser is to help guide undergraduate and graduate students to accept the realities of experimental science, and to think hard about what their gathered data is telling us, rather than to wish for different data. Increasingly, I see that one of my key roles as a U.S. citizen is to guide our politicians along a similar path: Rep. Akin and his cohort cannot be allowed to substitute folklore for science, and it is our responsibility to stop them. Most notably, those who choose not to distinguish between folklore and science should not be on the House science committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Margaret Martonosi.","Missouri Rep. Todd Akin sits on the House Committee for Science, Space and Technology .

"(CNN) -- Over the course of her remarkable life, Althea Gibson was many things to many people -- an accomplished jazz singer, a saxophone player, an actress and the first black woman to play on the professional golf circuit. For Billie Jean King and tennis fans around the globe, however, Gibson will always be best remembered as a towering figure of their sport. And not just because of her imposing stature. ""I saw Althea Gibson play (tennis) for the first time when I was 13. Because she was already one of my 'she-roes' I was very excited"" says King, who herself won 12 grand slam singles titles as well as founding the Women's Tennis Association. ""Her story is quite unexpected and quite wonderful at the same time,"" she told CNN's Open Court show. Gibson won an impressive 11 grand slam crowns (five singles, five doubles and one mixed doubles) between 1956 and 1958. ""She was so exciting to watch,"" King says. ""She was almost six feet and she had long arms, long legs -- very intimidating to the other players, you could tell."" While King herself is rightly lauded as one of the all-time tennis greats, the achievements of her idol Gibson are often overlooked. Perhaps this is to do with fading memories, the inaccessibility of the grainy black-and-white footage that recorded her in action, or the fact that tennis remained an amateur sport during Gibson's playing days. For tennis historians, however, her legacy remains an important part of the sport's history. Gibson inspired prominent black players including three-time men's grand slam winner Arthur Ashe, 1990 women's Wimbledon finalist Zina Garrison and modern day greats like the Williams sisters. Venus Williams once said she had all the opportunities she has today ""because of people like Althea."" For Gibson to achieve what she did, however, she had to scrap, battle and overcome barriers that few of her contemporaries would have been faced with. Forgotten legend . Born in South Carolina in 1927 before being raised in New York's tough Harlem district, Gibson spent much of her youth playing ping-pong or practicing on local tennis courts. Aware of her special talent, the tight-knit Harlem community raised funds to help pay for coaching lessons. According to friend David Dinkins, former mayor of New York City, her ability was obvious from a young age. ""(She) learned her tennis much like Billie Jean King, just hitting against walls and she was pretty damn good,"" Dinkins says. ""She was tall and she had a good serve/volley ... she was tough."" She had to be. America in the late 1940s and early '50s was a very different place than it is today. The dark specter of racial segregation still hung over many parts of the country. ""It was American apartheid, like South Africa,"" Dinkins says. ""But that's the way we were. Most tennis was played at country clubs and places that didn't admit people of color, so it was tough for her."" But the young Gibson was nothing if not resilient. With the backing of family, friends and the American Tennis Association Junior Development Program -- an organization that identified and helped talented young African-American players -- she graduated high school before being admitted to Florida A&M University on a full athletic scholarship in 1949. ""She had a community that really loved her and made a huge difference in her life,"" King says. ""These people really were there for Althea, as a person. You don't have to have the whole world behind you but if you have a nucleus of friends who care, I think that's probably what got her though it."" Gibson would also find she had advocates within the game as she progressed from playing in local and regional tournaments. An impassioned appeal from 18-time grand slam winner Alice Marble is widely credited with ensuring Gibson became the first black player to receive an invitation to appear at the United States National Championships (the forerunner to the U.S. Open) in 1953. ""If tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen ... it's time we acted a little more like gentle-people and less like sanctimonious hypocrites,"" Marble wrote in American Lawn Tennis magazine. Impressive performances ensured appearances at other championships and tournaments soon followed. Gibson's first major triumph duly arrived at the 1956 French Open in Paris. Wimbledon and U.S. Nationals titles followed a year later as she became first African-American player to win at any of these tournaments. ""I don't know if she appreciated fully the magnitude of what she had accomplished, to be the first at anything is by definition an achievement,"" Dinkins says of the breakthrough victories. On returning to New York after winning Wimbledon in 1957, Gibson became only the second black athlete after 1936 Berlin Olympics hero Jesse Owens to be granted a ticker tape parade through the city's streets. ""I think as an African-American winning Wimbledon in the mid-'50s and having the Queen of England present on Center Court with the whole world watching, it had to be so joyous,"" King says. ""I can tell you for people that cared about desegregation and wanting to get us all together, what an uplifting moment that had to be."" Gibson herself, however often tried to distance herself from issues of race, and disliked being seen as a pioneer for the African-American community. The New York Times wrote in her obituary in 2003 that ""when a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to (baseball player) Jackie Robinson as an outstanding representative of her race, Gibson replied: 'No. I don't consider myself to be a representative of my people. I am thinking of me and nobody else.' "" Early retirement . Gibson would repeat the feat of winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals titles in 1958 but would retire soon after at the age of just 31. While the 2014 U.S. Open winner can expect to pick up $3 million as well as the coveted silver trophy, there was no prize money for the major champions in Gibson's era. ""She would always answer truthfully about how it was difficult and that everything with her after she finished,"" King says. ""It was just difficult to make a living."" Gibson was a fine singer and recorded an album upon retirement in an effort to cash in on her fame. She also appeared in the movie ""Horse Soldiers"" with John Wayne. She then decided to take up professional golf and in 1962 became the first black woman on the LPGA tour. Despite being the possessor of a powerful swing, Gibson never won a tournament and golf was never a lucrative endeavor for her. A number of roles in sports administration soon followed, as well as in local government bodies in New Jersey. By the late '80s and early '90s, however, a series of illnesses had struck. Medical bills mounted and her inability to work left her struggling to afford rent and medication. Upon learning of Gibson's plight, King decided to step up to help her ""she-ro."" ""We all tried to get people to pitch in a few dollars because we heard she wasn't doing well, and we certainly did not want her to go hungry or not have shelter,"" she says. ""I think we raised at least $50,000 to give to her so she could live in the way she deserved to live, being such a great champion."" For Dinkins, however, that Gibson's situation ever got to requiring donations from fans to keep her going is a damning indictment of both the sport in Gibson's day and wider society. ""It's too bad that we as a society failed to recognize those among us who should be revered and whose accomplishments should be praised, and that has been the case with Althea,"" he says. ""There's so many people who have never heard of Althea. Tennis fans ... they think tennis started with Billie Jean King. In many ways it did, but it's sad that more people don't know about her (Gibson) and who she was."" King agrees wholeheartedly with this sentiment. Although Gibson died over a decade ago, aged 76, King remains keen to publicize the seminal role she played in the sport of tennis and how she inspired a generation of black athletes to pick up a racquet. ""Because of Althea, people like Arthur Ashe, Garrison and all these different people of color wouldn't have had the opportunity,"" the 70-year-old says. ""We need people to pay attention now and preserve her legacy to her, we all owe her big. I just hope we will continue to honor her.""","Althea Gibson was the first black woman to win a major tennis championship .

"(CNN) -- North Korea said Sunday it would no longer move forward with nuclear disarmament in response to a planned U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise. The announcement was made by the official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA. ""The maneuvers clearly indicate once again that the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are the harassers of peace and warmongers keen to bring a war to this land,"" the statement said. North Korea also announced it would no longer abide by the armistice that brought a truce to the Korean War, saying that South Korea violated the agreement by participating in the military cooperation with the United States. Disarmament talks were already at an impasse between North Korea, the United States and other nations. The military exercises would bring negotiations to a standstill and push North Korea to boost its nuclear arsenal, the statement said. ""The process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will naturally come to a standstill and (North Korea) will bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defense,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- She calls herself an artist, writer, chef, poet, stylist and philanthropist. The wife of her 80-year-old boyfriend (or ex-boyfriend) calls her a mistress and a gold digger. And now V. Stiviano, the woman who was a regular courtside presence at Los Angeles Clippers games next to owner Donald Sterling, is attracting more attention than the players. Audio recordings that surfaced over the weekend purportedly depict an argument between Stiviano and Sterling. If authentic, the recordings seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and posting such pictures on her Instagram account. Here's what we know about Stiviano. 1. She's the target of a lawsuit . Just last month, Sterling's wife filed a lawsuit against Stiviano, accusing her having an affair with the billionaire team owner. In the complaint, Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. Stiviano also took over a $1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $250,000 in cash from Sterling, the court document claims. Stiviano fought back, saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts. She also said she never took advantage of the Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. 2. Stiviano herself is of mixed race . In the audio recording on TMZ, the woman reminds the man that she is of ""mixed"" race and part black. In another part of the recording she says she is ""black and Mexican."" 3. She says she's not the one who leaked the tape . Stiviano's lawyer, Mac E. Nehoray, said Stiviano was not the one who publicized the conversation. ""This office understands that the currently released audio tape of approximately 15 minutes is a portion of approximately one (1) hour of overall audio recording of Mr. Donald T. Sterling and Ms. Stiviano, and is in fact legitimate,"" Nehoray said in a news release. ""Ms. Stiviano did not release the tape(s) to any news media."" 4. She's staying mum . Stiviano, whose first name is Vivian, has just two words posted on her door for reporters: ""No comment,"" CNN affiliate KCBS said. KCBS reporter Greg Mills saw Stiviano walk down a staircase from her duplex in Beverly Grove, California, but she darted back up the stairs when she saw him. 5. Stiviano loves photos of herself . Just take a look at her Instagram account. By Monday morning, the number of Stiviano's Instagram followers had skyrocketed to 137,000. Many of Stiviano's photos feature her posing in front of Clippers banners or wearing a bikini. She also has several photos of men wearing baseball caps that read ""V. Stiviano."" ""One day I will look back at Instagram & say, 'I've been there & I've done that.' I do it all. Artist, Lover, Writer, Chef, Poet, Stylist, Philanthropist,"" Stiviano's Instagram bio says. The man alleged to be Sterling in the conversation takes particular exception to one photo he says the woman posted on Instagram. It was a photo of her and basketball legend Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" the man says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" she responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" The website TMZ said the conversation reportedly took place on April 9. One day later, Stiviano posted a photo of a wedding gown on Instagram. ""I THINK IM READY?"" she wrote, adding hashtags such as ""#beautiful #amazing #grace #lover #modern #day #marriage to #myself #weddingdress #justforfun."" ""IM PATIENTLY WAITING,"" she added. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Steve Almasy, Kevin Conlon and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","V. Stiviano is being sued by the wife of Clippers owner Donald Sterling .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the spring of 1962, Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most controversial men in America. One night in Chicago's Orchestra Hall after delivering a stirring speech on civil rights and the future of America, he shook hands with a standout 15-year-old with conservative parents, Hillary Rodham. More than 50 years later, the moment still resonates profoundly with Clinton, who has had an illustrious political career and could again seek to make history as the first woman president. ""Probably my great privilege as a young woman was going to hear Dr. Martin Luther King speak,"" Clinton said earlier this year at an event at the University of Miami. ""I sat on the edge of my seat as this preacher challenged us to participate in the cause of justice, not to slumber while the world changed around us. And that made such an impression on me."" Clinton has traced much of her life in politics and activism to King's words that night. But there was another minister, not famous like King, who also influenced her views on social justice and stoked an intensity for action. Don Jones was the Methodist youth pastor who organized the trip of like-minded teens to see King, and mentored her for the rest of his life. ""Don opened up a new world to me,"" Clinton said in 2009, the year he died, ""and helped guide me on a spiritual, social and political journey of over 40 years."" Park Ridge, Illinois, was a conservative Chicago suburb in the 1960s, made up of hard-working, middle and upper class families. It wasn't diverse in politics or race. ""We lived in a suburb that was all white basically and everybody in Park Ridge was a Republican,"" said Ernest Ricketts, a childhood friend of Clinton's who attended elementary, middle and high school with her. Clinton's parents, especially her father, seemed to fit the town. Hugh was a small business owner and a vocal supporter of Barry Goldwater in 1965, while Dorothy, Clinton's mother, was a closeted Democrat. The former first lady attended First United Methodist Church with many of the same friends that she attended school with, and her life and experiences, from school to sports to church, revolved around Park Ridge. That wasn't the case for Don Jones, a Depression-era child who spent most of his youth in South Dakota and later attended South Dakota State. Before graduating, Jones enlisted in the Navy and served in Korea during the war. A young veteran by the late 50s, Jones finished his degree at Augustana College and later enrolled in divinity school at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, in 1958. Peter Jones, Don's youngest son, described his father as ""naturally outgoing"" and ""inquisitive."" His oldest son, David, said his father had friends across the country and was fiercely loyal. Politically, Don Jones also was inspired by a larger-than-life public figure. His sons said President Franklin Roosevelt ""had an effect on his outlook on politics and what government can and can't do for people."" Upon graduating from Drew in 1961, Jones landed in Park Ridge at First Methodist, a conservative church that didn't quite match his worldliness. For many, including Clinton, Jones was dramatically different than anyone they had ever met. Confronting life outside Park Ridge . Jones started University of Life when he came to Park Ridge, a youth group for a few dozen high schoolers that met two times a week - Sundays and Thursdays. But meetings were not just bible readings and prayer. Jones, according to the young Methodists who attend the group with Clinton, was determined to broaden their outlook on life. In an interview with Donnie Radcliffe for the 1992 book ""A First Lady for Our Time,"" Jones said he hoped the Park Ridge kids would ""become aware of life outside Park Ridge."" At one meeting, Jones arranged for an avowed atheist to debate a Christian on the existence of God. At another, Jones brought the group to a local synagogue and held a public discussion with a rabbi about Judaism and Israel. He held discussions about teenage pregnancy, drugs and crime and introduced his congregation to new authors and artists. Jones also took his students to Chicago's rough South Side and introduced them to the lives that other kids their age live - one of drugs, gangs and death. During the height of the civil rights movement, this kind of trip for kids like Hillary Rodham were unheard of. ""He came a very important time in our lives,"" said Betsy Ebeling, a longtime Clinton friend who attended Jones' youth group. In short, she described Jones as ""very influential."" Ricketts went further, telling CNN that Jones wasn't only influential, he was life altering. ""He was very influential in giving us a different perspective, a different world view,"" he said. ""It wasn't revolutionary, but he challenged us to look at things in a different way and a broader perspective."" A different view on faith . From the moment Jones arrived in Park Ridge, he was on thin ice, according to a number of people close to him. He was not a ""fundamentalist"" or ""literalist,"" said Peter Jones and that rubbed some in the community the wrong way. ""It was a conservative community and church,"" his son said, ""And he was a free thinker."" ""He wasn't a religious figure that tried to indoctrinate or tell people what to think or feel or believe,"" said David Jones. ""He used a method that really drew people out and questioned them."" So just two years after he moved to Park Ridge, Jones left. And although it is not totally clear, Ricketts and others said his unorthodox style may have been the reason. ""The things that Don did didn't exactly endear him to the people who were the movers in shakers in Park Ridge,"" said Ricketts, who vividly remembers when Jones left the community. ""They were rather more conservative and weren't entirely sure that they wanted the kids exposed to so many different ideas."" Jones returned to Drew in 1966, a place he where he remained for the next four decades. To Clinton, the mark the Jones left was already deeply cemented. The two stayed friends, regularly exchanging letters until Jones died in April 2009 at 78. According to Radcliffe's book, Clinton wrote him in 1964 and told him that she wasn't getting along with the new youth minister. ""I think he believes I'm a little radical,"" she wrote. The letters continued when Clinton arrived at Wellesley College. In April 1966, she wrote Jones to talk about her new identities at college and in later that year she wrote him to talk about her changing view on politics. ""I wonder if it's possible to be a mental conservative and a heart liberal,"" she wrote. Ricketts, who has kept up with Clinton since their years in Park Ridge, said Jones continued to mentor the budding politician long into her career. ""She has a very close relationship with him,"" he said, noting that Jones attended both of Bill Clinton's inaugurations and would visit Washington during the presidency. ""He held her in very, very high regard,"" said David Jones. 'Lifelong friend and mentor' When Jones died, the university remembered him as ""a beloved professor"" and icon in the small New Jersey town. Clinton honored him as ""a lifelong friend and mentor."" ""Don taught me the meaning of the words 'faith in action' and the importance of social justice and human rights,"" she said in a letter. ""I will miss him and will be grateful forever for the gift of his intelligence, counsel, kindness and support over many years."" Although the former first lady, senator and secretary of state has mentioned more prominent figures as inspirations -- like former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and activists Malala Yousafzai -- the faith leadership that Jones provided appeared especially enduring. At a 2007 faith forum put on by CNN when Clinton was running for president, she mentioned her ""old friend"" and youth minister in a question about prayer. ""I was raised to pray,"" Clinton said. ""As a little girl, you know, saying my prayers at night, saying grace at meals, praying in church."" Jones' impact on Clinton came up again in at another CNN faith forum in 2008 when Clinton's description of her faith foundation tracked very close to what Jones taught her in the 1960s. ""I have tried to take my beliefs, my faith, and put it to work my entire life,"" she said. ""And it has been gratifying to do the little I've done to try to help other people, which is really what motivates me."" To people close to Clinton, including old friends from Chicago, Jones' impact on the Democratic frontrunner remains clear as she contemplates another presidential run. Faith continues to be an important part of Clinton's life, according to Burns Strider, Clinton's friend and faith adviser. Clinton carries a bible in her purse, Strider said, and will occasionally argue biblical texts while traveling. ""I think she lives based on how her faith and her experience within her faith, be it the youth trips into the city, the service trips, and different things, has informed her,"" he said. And to Ricketts, Jones' impact was unmistakable. ""Hillary is the sum of all of these experiences and all of these philosophical expressions in her youth,"" he said. ""She has absorbed all of the experiences that she has had and benefited from the really positive influence of Don.""","Don Jones landed in conservative Park Ridge, Illinois, in the early 1960s with a purpose .

"Seoul (CNN) -- They were once referred to as the ""Vatican's spies."" But one Christian hopes attitudes towards missionaries are changing in North Korea. Father John Park has been a welcome and regular guest at Pyongyang's only recognized Catholic Church since 2000. ""When we first arrived at Changchung Church, North Korean followers came out ... then immediately rushed to a nun who traveled with me and jumped up and down bursting into tears,"" said Father Park, a South Korean priest with Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. ""These people haven't seen a nun in 50 years. That's when I realized that they are indeed followers."" North Korea is accused of widespread religious persecution and the United States claims its few state-run churches exist simply to give the appearance of religious freedom. 'Silent church' Its Catholic Church is known as the ""silent church."" It has no ties with the Vatican and there is not one single residing priest in the country. There are strict controls over what is permitted -- many religious processes such as confession are out of the question. A confidential one-on-one conversation between a South Korean -- even if that person is a priest -- and a North Korean is impossible and both could be accused of espionage. In the 1970s, Pyongyang proudly insisted that the country was ""free from religious superstitions,"" according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. The reclusive regime is officially atheist. Then for no apparent reason, the authorities in the North created a small number of churches and temples in the late 1980s, all of them under very strict government control. And Changchung Catholic Church was one of them. Father Park has been holding mass annually at a church in Pyongyang for North Korean Catholic followers despite criticism that they may be ""fake"" believers. Over the course of 14 years traveling to the North, he said he's interacted with many of the church's congregation and believes they're genuine. He recalled one man, known only as ""Mr. Cha,"" who died four years ago. ""Mr. Cha was a follower before the Korean War and his dream since young was to become a priest. He lived alone waiting for a chance to either go to China or Rome to become a priest."" In 1945, North Korea had an estimated 50,000 Catholics, according to the South Korean Catholic Bishops Conference of Korea (CBCK). Around 20,000 are believed to have defected to China before Japan's long occupation of the Korean peninsula was ended at the end of World War II. There was also around 300 foreign and local clergy in the North during the time, most of whom went missing, were executed or died in prison, according to the CBCK. Aging church . Many followers at Changchung Church were baptized before the Korean War (1950-53), and many have died, Father Park said. He believes the congregation has dropped from about 150 to 100 since 2000. ""A lot of people are ailing and if followers from the older generation die, things could get difficult. There may not be too many followers in North Korea but we should open-mindedly help and support them,"" Father Park said. ""Like a mindset of a shepherd, we should treat them with warm heart,"" he added. North Korea's state-run Korean Catholic Association claims it has about 3,000 ""registered Catholics,"" while the United Nations puts the number at 800. Nevertheless, members of religious groups, as well as the groups themselves, are often criticized as being fake. ""The North Korean government is tolerant of a small controlled religious presence within the country or is willing to fake such presence,"" said Andrei Lankov, an associate professor in social sciences at Kookmin University in South Korea. ""Even if some members are true believers, they are selected by the government. The police authorities, the secret police, is checking your background,"" he said. North Korea's constitution does allow its people to practice religion. However, in the same constitution, it also says it won't allow it to be ""used for drawing in foreign forces or for harming the State or social order."" Kenneth Bae, an American citizen who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea, was accused of bringing down the government through religious activities. And he is not the only missionary to be detained in the country. ""From their (North Korea's) point of view, it is a very real threat. Right now, Christianity seems to be their most dangerous ideological challenge to the existing regime,"" said Lankov.","North Korea is accused of widespread religious persecution .

"(CNN) -- The nine young North Koreans thought they were near the end of their long and dangerous journey toward freedom. Their years-long odyssey had taken them thousands of miles, from North Korea, one of the world's most repressive states, to Laos, a small, landlocked nation in Southeast Asia. From there, they just needed to cross the border into Thailand and find their way to South Korean diplomats who would be able to offer them citizenship and a new life. Orphaned and homeless: Surviving the streets of North Korea . But something went wrong in Laos. They were detained by the authorities. And rather than transferring the group of young refugees to South Korean officials, as the people engineering their escape were anticipating, the Laotian government this week did something unexpected. It gave them back to North Korea. ""This is a horrible, horrible thing that has happened,"" said Suzanne Scholte, the president of the Defense Forum Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit group that was involved in the effort to get the young North Koreans to safety. Analysis: North Korea diplomacy effort grows, but sides are still far apart . The United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, says Laos deported the group of North Koreans to China on Monday. And Scholte said Friday that she believes they have already been flown back to North Korea, where she fears they could face torture or even death. Human rights advocates and UNHCR have criticized the decision by Laos to deport the refugees, who are between 15 and 23 years old, noting that international law gives people the right not to be forced to return to places where they face persecution. Thousands of North Koreans have fled their country's Stalinist regime since the Korean War in the 1950s and settled in South Korea, which offers them citizenship. Most of them make their way there through China and Southeast Asia. Plucked from the streets . Until they were detained by Laotian authorities earlier this month, it appears the group of young North Koreans traced a path similar to that of many other refugees. Years ago, they slipped through the authoritarian grip of their homeland and crossed the border into China, most likely with their various parents. Opinion: What North Korea could learn from Myanmar . Scholte said that in China, one or way another, they all ended up fending for themselves on the streets, eating out of trash bins and dodging North Korean agents. She said she didn't know whether their parents had abandoned them, died or been detained and sent back to North Korea. They were plucked from that precarious existence by a South Korean man and his wife who were living in China, Scholte said, referring to the man only by the name of ""M.J."" to protect his identity. Read more: Why the Korean War still matters . M.J. and his wife took in a total of 15 young North Koreans, giving them food, shelter and protection for more than four years. To avoid getting caught, the youngsters had to remain inside at all times. ""You could liken it to a Jewish family trying to hide from the Nazis,"" Scholte said. ""They had to be invisible."" China doesn't treat North Koreans in its territory as refugees and usually sends them back across the border. Difficult journeys . In 2011, the Defense Forum Foundation began working with M.J. and his wife to try get the group of North Koreans out of China to South Korea or the United States. They managed to get the three oldest North Koreans to safety in South Korea via Thailand, Scholte said. Next, they succeeded in organizing the escape of the two youngest children and one with learning difficulties to the United States. Analysis: What's Kim Jong Un up to? Nine others remained in China. M.J. and his wife accompanied them on the quest to reach South Korea via Laos and Thailand. They reportedly entered Laos around May 10 and were detained soon after that. At the time, Laotian authorities assured M.J. and his wife, who were not being held, that there was nothing to worry about, Scholte said. ""We had no reason to believe that the Laotians were going to cut some deal with North Korea,"" she said, noting that she had helped to get four other North Koreans to the United States from Laos in 2009. But on Monday, she said, M.J. received word that the group of refugees was being taken to the North Korean Embassy. By then, it was too late to save them. ""When I got the call, I was in shock,"" Scholte said. An 'alarming case' Other organizations also were surprised by the development. Laos has been one of the main routes to a safe country for North Korean defectors, according to Eun Young Kim, a senior program officer with the Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization based in Seoul. ""We never officially experienced the Laotian government actually cooperating with the North Korean government and sending them back to North Korea,"" she said. ""This is a very surprising, alarming case, especially the fact that the North Korean government got involved."" Read more: Escaping from N. Korean gulag . It was unclear what prompted the decision by Laos to give the refugees to the North Koreans. Laotian government officials in the country's capital, Vientiane, declined to provide official comment on the matter when contacted by CNN on Friday. But Khantivong Somlith, an official at the Laotian Embassy in Seoul, said that the refugees had been handed over to North Korea because they didn't have visas and were therefore in Laos illegally. ""We know they are Koreans, that's why they were sent back to the North Korean Embassy,"" he said. ""That's the rule."" He said he didn't know where the refugees are now. Controversy in South Korea . South Korean officials have been criticized in their country's news media as having failed to act quickly and decisively enough to get the North Koreans out of Laos after their detention. But Scholte said that all those involved in the attempt to recover the refugees had ""underestimated"" the North Koreans' determination to get hold of them. She noted the efforts of South Korea in previous successful operations to rescue North Koreans. ""We haven't seen this before,"" she said. Interactive: Who's in range of North Korean missiles? The South Korean government has declined to discuss the specifics of this case. ""We've expressed our government's position to the relevant nation and we have also consulted on future measures,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young said in a news briefing Thursday. After reaching a peak of nearly 3,000 in 2009, the number of North Koreans arriving in South Korea dropped to just above 1,500 in 2012, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. Concerns over safety . International organizations, meanwhile, are raising concerns about what fate awaits the deported refugees. ""North Korea has to come clean on where these nine refugees are and publicly guarantee that they will not be harmed or retaliated against for having fled the country,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. ""As a result of their return they are at dire risk -- North Korea criminalizes unauthorized departures and is known to torture those caught trying to escape and those sent back."" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern ""about the safety and fundamental human rights of these individuals if they are returned"" to North Korea. M.J. and his wife, herself a former North Korean refugee, are now back in South Korea and remain very upset about what happened, Scholte says. ""This is a couple that was willing to risk their own life and safety to shelter these children,"" she said. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian investigators say they have filed charges against former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and others connected to the energy services company Halliburton, accusing them of paying bribes to secure a lucrative natural gas project in the 1990s. Cheney and nine others are accused of charges that include ""conspiracy and distribution of gratification to public officials,"" Femi Babafemi, a spokesman for the country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said Wednesday. The investigation is part of a long-running case involving Halliburton and a subsidiary firm, Kellogg, Brown and Root, over alleged bribes paid to Nigerian officials to secure $6 billion worth of contracts for a liquefied natural gas project in the Niger Delta. Many observers in Nigeria regard the move as a publicity stunt by the commission ahead of national elections this April and a symbolic effort to display resolve against government corruption. The agency has had limited success in getting successful prosecutions and hasn't charged any high-profile people since its top commissioner was removed from the body in 2007. After the country's high court sets a trial date, authorities could pursue extradition. The bribes allegedly amounted to $180 million between 1994 and 2004. Kellogg, Brown and Root was one of four large international construction firms that built the natural gas plant. The firm pleaded guilty to foreign bribery charges in the United States last year and paid a $402 million criminal fine, the U.S. Justice Department said. KBR and Halliburton also paid another $177 million to settle civil complaints related to the bribery, the Justice Department said. Investigations in Nigeria, however, have been ongoing, and there are allegations the bribes went all the way to the top, to aides, officials, and possibly then-President Olusegun Obasanjo. Cheney's lawyer has said in the past that  there is no reason to suspect his client is guilty. ""This matter involves the activities of an international four-company joint venture (which included KBR, then a subsidiary of Halliburton) well over a decade ago,"" said attorney Terrence O'Connell. ""The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated that joint venture extensively and found no suggestion of any impropriety by Dick Cheney in his role of CEO of Halliburton.""","The investigation relates to possible bribes paid to secure a gas contract in the 1990s .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has raised political tensions on the peninsula with a barrage of bombastic comments directed at its enemies South Korea and the United States. Even by North Korean standards, the series of threats during the past six weeks by enigmatic young leader Kim Jong Un have been incredibly provocative, making the situation worrisome for analysts. Here's a look at Kim's escalating rhetoric and his country's actions since he came to power after his father's death in 2011: . March 2012 . As South Korea hosts world leaders at an international nuclear security summit in Seoul, North Korea moves a long-range rocket toward a launch pad. Pyongyang says it plans to carry out the test in mid-April as part of a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and Kim's grandfather. April 2012 . Defying warnings by U.S. President Barack Obama that Kim has nothing to gain from provocations, Pyongyang launches the rocket. It breaks apart and falls into the sea. August 2012 . Kim visits the same military unit behind a 2010 attack on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, where he reminds the troops to be ready to fight a ""sacred war"" against Seoul. The North Korean leader makes the veiled threat just ahead of an annual war games exercise conducted on the Korean Peninsula by the United States and South Korea. The dictator calls the joint Seoul-Washington military exercises a ""war rehearsal"" to invade. October 2012 . North Korea claims to have developed missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland. December 2012 . Kim announces plans to launch another long-range rocket in a renewed effort to send a satellite into space. Two days after the government announces the launch window is being pushed back because of technical issues, the rocket lifts off from the west coast of North Korea. Pyongyang declares the mission a success. January 2013 . North Korea announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it says are part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The threats come two days after the U.N. Security Council approves the broadening of sanctions in response to the rocket launch in December that apparently put a satellite in orbit. February 2013 . North Korea carries out an underground nuclear bomb test on February 12. The test is designed ""to defend the country's security and sovereignty in the face of the ferocious hostile act of the U.S.,"" the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency says at the time, referring to new U.S.-led sanctions. ""This nuclear test is our first measure, which displayed our maximum restraint. ... If the U.S. continues with their hostility and complicates the situation, it would be inevitable to continuously conduct a stronger second or third measure."" March 2013 . Angered by U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear test, North Korea threatens for the first time to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against the U.S. and South Korea. It's one of a series of provocative threats and, in some cases, actions by North Korea that begin with Pyongyang saying it is scrapping the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War. At the same time, it cuts off its direct phone links with South Korea at Panmunjom, the abandoned village that sits on the border between the two countries. North Korea then doubles down on the threat, saying it is nullifying the joint declaration on the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. One of the country's top generals, according to published reports, claims Pyongyang has nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that are ready to be fired. Although U.S. officials don't believe North Korea is in a position to strike the United States, the Obama administration responds to the threat by announcing plans to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast. U.S. officials also say B-52 bombers are making flights over South Korea as part of annual, joint military exercises this month that have enraged North Korea. Pyongyang releases a new propaganda video that shows an imagined missile attack on U.S. government buildings in Washington, including the White House and the Capitol. The roughly four-minute video is posted on the YouTube channel of the North Korean government website, Uriminzokkiri. North Korea threatens to attack U.S. and South Korea bases, putting its troops on alert. It announces through state-run media that the military is ready for combat. The threat follows claims that U.S. B-52 bombers again made flights over South Korea. Later it's revealed that F-22 Raptors and B-2 stealth bombers also take part in the U.S.-South Korea drills. Pyongyang says it's readying rockets aimed at U.S. targets, releasing photos that show Kim meeting with military officials with strike plans on U.S. maps visible in the background. The North also cuts its last military hotline with South Korea. April 2013 . North Korea begins the month pledging to restart its Yongbyon nuclear complex, including a uranium enrichment plant and a reactor that was shut down under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks among North Korea, the United States and four other nations. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry responds by warning the United States will not accept North Korea as a ""nuclear state."" Later that week, Pyongyang warns that it cannot guarantee the safety of safety of embassies and international organizations in the event of armed conflict. It comes as a U.S. official tells CNN that two medium-range missiles have been loaded onto mobile launchers along North Korea's east coast. Tensions then move to a joint industrial complex that serves as an important symbol of cooperation between the two countries. The Kaesong Industrial Complex sits on the North's side of the border but houses operations of scores of South Korean companies. Pyongyang blocks the entrance of hundreds of South Korean workers to Kaesong, where more than 50,000 North Koreans work, producing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods each year. Soon after, North Korea warns foreigners to secure shelter or evacuate in case of hostilities, as Japan moves its missile defense systems into place at three sites around Tokyo. A U.S. official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information, tells CNN recent intelligence suggests that a missile test could be ""imminent."" Meanwhile, North Korea's state media published articles that described festive events, suggesting a much less fraught situation inside the country. The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that various sporting events were happening or scheduled to take place to mark the 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. ""The ongoing sports tournaments make the country seethe with holiday atmosphere,"" KCNA said. Kim Il Sung's birthday, known as the Day of the Sun, is a major public holiday in North Korea. CNN's Elise Labott, Jethro Mullen and Brad Lendon contributed to this report .","U.S. and South Korean officials believe Pyongyang poised on a missile test .

"(CNN) -- North Korea stated its commitment to lasting peace and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in an editorial published on New Year's Day, state-run media reported. ""The Workers' Party of Korea and the government ... will strive to develop relations of good-neighborliness and friendship with other countries and achieve global independence under the unfurled banner of independence, peace and friendship,"" KCNA reported. The editorial may be a hopeful sign as the international community tries to coax Pyongyang back to six-party negotiations aimed at ending its nuclear program. North Korea has refused to return to the talks conducted by the United States, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, insisting that it wants to talk directly with the U.S. government. In April, Pyongyang declared the talks ""dead"" in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests last year. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton previously said the United States was willing to meet bilaterally with North Korea but only within the framework of the six-party talks. She also has warned that the United States will not normalize ties with Pyongyang or lift sanctions unless North Korea takes irreversible steps toward dismantling its nuclear program. ""The fundamental task for ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Asia is to put an end to the hostile relationship between (North Korea) and the U.S.A.,"" Friday's editorial said. ""It is the consistent stand of (North Korea) to establish a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula and make it nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations."" Some analysts have said that North Korea might be trying to buy time with its new outreach to the United States. Recent reports in Seoul, South Korea, have claimed North Korea is in the final stages of restoring its Yongbyon nuclear plant, which Pyongyang had begun to disable before walking away from the six-party talks. Given the secrecy of the North, those reports could not be verified. Analysts said North Korea is also desperate to break out of its diplomatic isolation and ease its economic pain, especially after the U.N. Security Council imposed tougher sanctions on the country in response to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests during 2009.","Some analysts say North Korea might be trying to buy time with new outreach .

"(CNN) -- What makes a travel destination ""hot""? What makes people around the world all at once start booking tickets to cities they know little about or salivate for restaurants they've only just heard of? What accounts for places with perfectly respectable histories (Estonia, Laos) suddenly finding their ways ""onto the map"" of the traveling masses? A lot of what attracts tourism is economics, sometimes positive (China) sometimes less so (Greece). Major world events contribute to international buzz -- the Summer Olympics placed London atop many ""hottest 2012 destinations"" lists. Savvy marketing makes a difference. The current ""It's more fun in the Philippines"" campaign has helped attract visitors to that vastly underrated country. The chance whims of pop culture can unexpectedly thrust a heretofore obscure place into the spotlight. By now you've probably heard of the Seoul district of Gangnam. You couldn't have said that this time last year. When compiling our list of 2013 hot spots, we took into account all of the above and more while canvassing travel sites, experts and organizations to identify up and coming destinations based on bargains, significant events and important new services, such as added airline routes and major hotel openings. Our hot seven aren't the only ""new"" places ready to be discovered in the coming year, but they're a solid start. Where will you be traveling in 2013? Let us know your ""hot destinations"" in the comments section below. 1. Scotland, United Kingdom . Scotland has seen fit to dub 2013 the ""Year of Natural Scotland,"" and what better time to do it? Anyone who saw the 2012 James Bond thriller ""Skyfall"" walked away wishing they too could race through Scotland's dramatic countryside and hide out in its misty highlands (granted, while not being pursued by a homicidal Javier Bardem). Of many outdoor events and special deals planned around the Year of Natural Scotland, highlights include: the Dumfries & Galloway Wildlife Festival 2013 (March 29-April 14); Heb Celt 2013 music festival (July 17-20); Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight (September 7-22); and, of course, The Open Championship golf tournament (July 14-21). More independent-minded trekkers will find 2013 a good year to tackle part of Scotland's Great Trails, a network of long-distance routes across the country. The entire length of the country -- all 750 kilometers of it -- can be walked via the recently announced Gore-Tex Scottish National Trail. The trail, which runs from the English border to Cape Wrath, travels past pristine lochs and haunting glens as it follows mainly existing routes, such as the West Highland Way and Rob Roy Way. Should Scotland give the UK the highland fling? 2. Rabat, Morocco . What a difference a little recognition makes. Travelers have long overlooked Morocco's low-key capital, instead being seduced by the heady sights and sounds of Marrakech or beachside charm of Essaouira. That'll change in 2013 with the elegant city in the northwest of the country having been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2012. This means word is just starting to get out about what the UNESCO folks call Rabat's ""fertile exchange between the Arabo-Muslim past and Western modernism."" Exhibit A: the historic old town featuring the magnificent twelfth-century Hassan Mosque and a picturesque medina overlooking the Atlantic with largely hassle-free shopping. Exhibit B: Rabat's charming French-built new town with wide boulevards and lovely cafes. A shiny new tramway links the capital to its sister city Salé, while a new airport terminal means the city has become much more accessible.Rabat (area population 1.7 million) is hitting the proverbial travel radar, but it's far from overrun -- that makes 2013 the year to be there now.Link: www.visitmorocco.com . 3. Košice, Slovakia . Thanks in part to its medieval old town and vibrant mix of Renaissance, Baroque, and art nouveau architecture, the compact yet captivating eastern Slovakian city of Košice (population 250,000) has been chosen 2013's European Capital of Culture (along with Marseille in France). To say that city officials are excited is an understatement -- they've planned at least 300 cultural events for 2013. The ECOC opening ceremony will be held January 19 and 20 and is, according to officials, ""conceived as a unique, two-day inspirational event which will enliven the whole city."" Events will be spread across town, from the State Theater to a stage on major Hlavna Street to numerous clubs and restaurants.Throughout the year, activities will draw on the city's Slovakian and Hungarian heritage and include music festivals, theater, art and street performance. Just as enjoyable is people watching along a pedestrian-only main drag while taking in the Gothic St. Elisabeth cathedral and sipping a Košice Gold, the city's official cocktail (with a super-secret recipe). Link: www.kosice2013.sk . 4. Sub-Saharan Africa . Multi-country African trips usual mean long, bumpy journeys on bad roads or budget-busting charter flights between destinations. The November 2012 launch of Fastjet, Africa's new European‐style, low-cost airline, promises to revolutionize travel in the region. Fastjet currently operates a small fleet of Airbus 319s from its Tanzanian base in Dar es Salaam, connecting the capital to the trekking mecca of Kilimanjaro. It also flies to Mwanza on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, handy for the western Serengeti. According to flightglobal.com, the airline will establish a second base of operations in Nairobi in early 2013, and add operation centers later in the year in the African capitals of Accra, Ghana and Luanda, Angola. Other destinations slated for 2013 include Entebbe in Uganda (allowing cheaper access to the country's mountain gorillas) and beach resorts of Zanzibar in Tanzania and Mombasa in Kenya. With one-way fares as low as US$20 (excluding taxes and surcharges), remote parts of Africa will be a lot easier to get to in 2013. 52 weeks, 52 things to do in 2013 . 5. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States . With Daniel Day-Lewis likely getting an Oscar Best Actor nomination for his spooky good portrayal of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (the 85th Academy Awards show will be held February 24) and the 150th anniversary of the real president's famed 272-word Gettysburg Address (given in the wake of the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg, it's perhaps the most famous speech in American political history), U.S. Civil War history will take center stage in 2013. A year of events and commemorations are scheduled in and around Gettysburg, including a 10-day program of tours, performances and a massive battle re-enactment on July 4 (U.S. Independence Day) at the Gettysburg National Military Park from June 28 through July 7. 6. Amsterdam, the Netherlands . Like birthday celebrations? Amsterdam does, and it's set to host a bunch of them to mark major anniversaries in 2013. The 160th anniversary of Vincent Van Gogh's birthday will take place on March 30 with special exhibitions and opening hours of the city's Van Gogh Museum. One of the world's greatest orchestras, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra turns 125 years old in 2013. A special ""125 Years of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra"" concert will be held on April 10, 2013. ""Bach, Mozart, Haydn with Giovanni Antonini"" is the highlight of the late February-early March schedule. More Amsterdam birthdays: the city's canal ring will celebrate its 400th anniversary, the Artis Royal Zoo turns 175 and the Rijksmuseum national museum of Netherlands art and history returns after a 10-year renovation, with a grand opening scheduled for April 13. ""Once the new Rijksmuseum has become a tasteful, daring, imaginative and optimistic museum, it will have fulfilled its mission,"" says to the museum's website. That's a lot of ways to celebrate 2013 in a city already known for fun. What were the most popular travel destinations in 2012? 7. Colombia . Magical Andes mountain scenery, bustling cities quickly getting up to international speed in the wake of a troubling past, high-end hotel openings (Hilton, InterContinental, Marriott) and new direct routes from major air carriers are quickly moving Colombia onto a lot of traveler wish lists -- including ours. The deal folks Travelzoo agree, naming Colombia a ""Wow Deal Destination for 2013"" and reporting on a ""tourism boom breeding competition and deals in a country where the U.S. dollar already goes far."" Adding a grace note is Bogotá's designation as a 2013 UNESCO City of Music. The organization recognized the city ""foremost for its fast growing musical sector and dynamic music scene as a major center of musical creation and activity in Latin America."" To mark the honor, a series of concerts and music festivals will take place in the city throughout the year, from casual performances in public parks to lively club shows and the first Bogotá International Music Festival (March 27-30, link in Spanish only), a four-day, 55-performance concert event that this year will be dedicated entirely to Beethoven. As we already mentioned, our hot seven aren't the only ""new"" places to hit in 2013. Other trending spots include: . Montenegro -- great beaches, rich history, underappreciated cuisine, stunning sites. New Zealand -- more film-inspired sightseeing mixed with top-rate food and wine. Miami -- reinventing itself as a hip hangout for arty types. Japan -- offering better than ever value as the country seeks to reinvigorate travel in wake of 2011 tsunami.

"(CNN) -- Until he returned home this weekend, Merrill Newman -- an American held in North Korea -- had no idea what a story he'd become. During his detention, the 85-year-old veteran of the Korean War had no access to news. He has since seen the flood. ""Looking at the television and newspaper reports, I've seen a lot of speculation about why I was detained. I've given considerable thought to this and have come to the conclusion that I just didn't understand that, for the North Korean regime, the Korean War isn't over and that even innocent remarks about the war can cause big problems if you are a foreigner,"" he said in a statement Monday. Newman traveled in October as a tourist to North Korea on a 10-day organized tour. Authorities nabbed him just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang. Merrill talks about his time in North Korean custody . In his statement, Newman describes what he thinks might have set them off. ""I innocently asked my North Korean guides whether some of those who fought in the war in the Mount Kuwol area might still be alive, and expressed an interest in possibly meeting them if they were. The North Koreans seem to have misinterpreted my curiosity as something more sinister,"" he wrote. ""It is now clear to me the North Koreans still feel much more anger about the war than I realized. With the benefit of hindsight, I should have been more sensitive to that."" For weeks, the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman. An explanation finally came last month, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's ""apology."" The word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions. In the note dated November 9, Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol unit, part of the ""intelligence bureau"" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect ""information"" and wage deadly attacks. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to that report. In his statement, Newman distanced himself from those comments. ""Anyone who has read the text of it or who has seen the video of me reading it knows that the words were not mine and were not delivered voluntarily. Anyone who knows me knows that I could not have done the things they had me 'confess' to,"" he wrote. Newman said he was treated well during his detention. His release coincided with a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to South Korea, where he laid a wreath in honor of those who died in the war that pitted North against South. A senior administration official said that Newman's release was the result of direct contact between Washington and Pyongyang. The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered. Newman thanked Biden, the U.S. State Department, the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang and family and friends in his statement. He also asked that people not forget Kenneth Bae, another American being held in North Korea. Bae was arrested in 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years for so-called hostile acts and attempts to topple the government. ""I know there is a lot of interest in this, and I'll do my best to answer as many questions as I can,"" wrote Newman.

"(CNN) -- Former Crown Prince Philippe was sworn in as king of Belgium on Sunday after his father abdicated the throne an hour before. Albert II of Belgium gave up his throne over concerns about his advanced age. ""I have noticed how my age and my health have not permitted me to exercise my duties the way I would like to,"" the 79-year-old said in an address to the nation. King Philippe, 53, was educated in public schools in Belgium's two major languages, Flemish and French, and later attended the royal military academy, where he trained to be a fighter pilot. Belgium, which is home to the European Union capital of Brussels, has also gained a queen in Mathilde, Philippe's wife. She is the daughter of a count and countess and graduated with a degree in speech therapy. Albert's abdication follows that of the Netherlands' Queen Beatrice earlier this year and that of Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has praised Albert for the move. ""I wish to express to him my sincere thanks for his tireless efforts in the service of Belgium and Europe,"" Barroso said in a statement. Throughout his 20-year reign, Albert ""has never ceased to be a staunch defender of the values that are the basis of the European construction,"" Barroso said. The Belgian royal family has had less luck promoting cohesion within its own country, which is culturally split between ethnic Flemish Dutch people in the north, ethnic French people in the south and a small group of ethnic Germans in the east. Separatist ideas have sprouted particularly in the Flemish region, which has a stronger economy. Opinion: Why Queen Elizabeth won't step down .

"Dresden, Germany (CNN) -- The German city of Dresden waited anxiously Thursday to see if the swollen River Elbe, which has brought misery to thousands in the Czech Republic, would breach its flood defenses. The river is expected to crest in Dresden late Thursday or early Friday. It is running at about 8.5 meters, compared with a normal average of 2 meters, and is likely to reach about 9 meters (30 feet) when the flow peaks. CNN iReport: See floods through a volunteer's eyes . The city is just one of many across central Europe to face the prospect of the worst floods since the devastating inundations of 2002. The streets of the nearby historic town of Meissen are under several feet of water ahead of the river's peak, affecting homes and businesses, and forcing the evacuation of some 4,500 people. Although the sky is mostly clear, heavy rain at the weekend after a wet spring has filled the region's rivers to bursting point. More rain is forecast for the coming weekend. The flooding has caused at least 15 deaths across the region and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from their homes in the Czech Republic and Germany. The peak of the flood wave from the Czech Republic along the Elbe is expected in the eastern German states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, the European Commission said. Some 15,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in Saxony and 3,300 in Saxony-Anhalt as of early Thursday, it said. A possible evacuation of 30,000 people from Halle, near Leipzig, is also being planned. Authorities in Saxony said at least 3.5 million sandbags have been filled and deployed in flood defenses in Dresden and surrounding towns. After passing through Dresden, the Elbe's floodwater will continue to flow to the north and west and should reach Torgau, in Saxony, and Wittenberg, in Saxony-Anhalt, over the weekend, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. If the crest occurs as forecast in Wittenberg it will pass the record high measured in 2002, Miller said. Preparations are also under way further north, in the states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Rising Danube . The Danube, another of Europe's great rivers, has caused major flooding in southern Germany and Austria, and the crest now menaces towns and cities downstream in Slovakia. Felipe Bezerra, a 33-year-old university student, went to a bridge in Vienna, Austria, overlooking the Danube to see the surging torrent. He told CNN iReport he was struck by the sound and force of boats' motors, all straining against the steadily rising floodwater. In Austria, efforts are focused on the River Danube in the province of Lower Austria, said the European Commission's emergency response center. River levels are declining across the country but roads, railway connections and river transport remain affected. Four people are reported to have died and three are missing in Austria, it said. Villages and suburbs around the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, about 35 miles from Vienna, are already experiencing severe river floods, the European Commission said. The area is threatened by both the Danube and the Morava. A state of emergency has been declared in Bratislava, where the Danube is expected to rise further on Thursday, Slovakian fire department spokeswoman Silvia Jancovicova told CNN Thursday. Boats were used to evacuate 25 people, including a child, in the Devin neighborhood of the capital, she said. No deaths have yet been confirmed in Slovakia, Jancovicova said. The water level in Bratislava should start falling by midday Friday, Miller said. However, high flood warnings are posted for the entire Danube in lower Slovakia along the border with Hungary until Monday. In Germany, the situation has stabilized along the Danube, the European Commission's emergency response center said. About 12,600 people have been evacuated in the southern Bavaria region, and many roads and railway lines are closed. An emergency alert is still in place in the Bavarian town of Regensburg, and Deggendorf is completely cut off, it said. Some 55,000 emergency workers, most of them members of local fire services, have been involved in Germany's flood response efforts, Interior Ministry spokesman Markus Beyer said. Another 25,000 people -- including 12,000 federal civil protection workers, 5,500 soldiers and 2,500 federal police officers -- have also been deployed since Saturday, he said. The flood wave in the Danube is expected to reach the Hungarian capital, Budapest, on Sunday, it said. A state of emergency was declared this week in three counties along the river Danube in northwestern Hungary, as well as in Budapest. Czech Republic fears more rains to come . The historic center of the Czech capital, Prague, was largely spared as the swollen Vltava River peaked there earlier this week, but other areas fared less well. Some 700 towns were affected by the floods, Czech fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova said Thursday. Some of the 19,000 people evacuated are now able to return to their homes, she said, but the country is not yet in the clear. More heavy rain is expected during the weekend and authorities are doing what they can to regulate water levels on the Vltava ahead of this, she said. In northern Bohemia, the River Labe, as the Elbe is known there, reached its peak levels around midnight Wednesday, she said. However, the risk of flooding remains high due to the weather forecast. More rainfall is also expected in Prague, especially toward the end of the weekend, she said. Eight deaths have been reported in the Czech Republic and four people are missing, a fire service spokeswoman said Thursday. Three deaths occurred Saturday in southwestern Germany, the Interior Ministry for the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Dresden and Ivana Kottasova reported from London, where Laura Smith-Spark also wrote and reported. CNN's Sarah Brown and Mari Ramos also contributed.","NEW: At least 15 flood deaths are reported across central Europe since the weekend .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A small aircraft crashed in northeastern China close to the border with North Korea, killing its pilot and fueling speculation Wednesday about its origin. China's official Xinhua news agency said in several brief dispatches that the plane, which went down Tuesday afternoon at Lagu Township in Fushun County, ""might be"" from North Korea. It confirmed the death of the pilot and the destruction of a residential house on the ground, but added no one else was hurt. Xinhua said that the Chinese government is communicating with Pyongyang about the incident. The crash location in Liaoning province is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) away from a North Korean air base in the border town of Sinuiju, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. An employee at Songgang Iron Ore, a company near the crash site, told CNN there was a large security presence in the area, with armed police officers and special forces agents cordoning off the crash site. Photographs of the wreckage purportedly taken by an eyewitness have been circulating on Chinese websites, showing the North Korean air force emblem on the fuselage beneath the tail. Military enthusiasts online have identified the aircraft as a Russian-built MiG jet but differed on the specific model, with some calling it a MiG-21 fighter and others claiming it to be a MiG-15 trainer . Yonhap quoted unnamed sources in South Korea as saying the plane's pilot may have been trying to defect from North Korea to Russia, losing direction en route and killing himself on impact of the ensuing crash. Chinese commentators have speculated that the plane may have run out of fuel. An official at the Liaoning provincial foreign affairs office declined to comment, while the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing referred journalists to the Xinhua news report.","The crash site is about 120 miles from a North Korean air base .

"(CNN) -- A pair of Georgia men faced more than a half-hour of skeptical questions from reporters Friday as they defended their claim that they stumbled upon the body of Bigfoot while hiking in a remote North Georgia forest. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Introduced by a publicist and beside a man who promoted what turned out to be a fake Bigfoot discovery in 1995, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer repeatedly said that their claim is not a hoax and that scientific analysis will prove it. ""We were not looking for Bigfoot. ... We wouldn't know what we were doing if we did,"" said Whitton, a police officer on leave after being shot in the hand while making an arrest. ""I didn't believe in Bigfoot at the time. ... But you've got to come to terms with it and realize you've got something special. And that's what it was."" The men say they were hiking in early June when they discovered the body of a 7-foot-7, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature near a stream. They also claim to have spotted about three similar living creatures -- and showed reporters video stills of what they say is one of those creatures shadowing them through the woods.  Watch report of scientist skeptical of Bigfoot claim » . The announcement, which the men first made on the Internet radio show ""Squatch Detective"" several weeks ago, has been greeted with healthy skepticism, even among some Bigfoot enthusiasts. Scientists, including the head of North Georgia College and State University's biology department, have said it's unlikely a tribe of 7-foot-tall creatures would have avoided discovery in a region popular among hikers, hunters and vacationers. Several Web sites have popped up questioning the claim and comparing a photo that the men say is the creature's body inside a freezer to a widely available Bigfoot costume. On Friday, Whitton acknowledged creating a pair of videos posted on the Internet video site YouTube, one in which his brother poses as a scientist and another in which Whitton briefly seems to admit that the body is a fake. ""It seems that the stalkers have busted us in a hoax,"" he says in the video. But then adds, ""we still have a corpse. We just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend."" At Friday's news conference, Whitton first said that no video existed in which he calls the discovery a hoax. But after speaking to Tom Biscardi, the self-described ""Real Bigfoot Hunter"" who has been searching for the creature of legend since 1971, he said the video was made ""to have a little fun with it"" and was originally intended to throw off the ""psychos"" who had stalked him and his family since the men first made their claim. iReport.com: Have you seen 'Bigfoot'? The two also promoted a Web site registered to Whitton on June 16 and said they plan to write a book about their experience. Friday's news conference was held in Palo Alto, California, near the home of Biscardi. About 100 reporters and onlookers attended the event, in a hotel banquet room, including a man who shouted questions while wearing a gorilla suit. Dyer and Whitton said they were carrying a video camera during their hike to film wildlife. They said they handed the body over to Biscardi, who is keeping it at an undisclosed location until a team of scientists can examine it. One of the two photographs the men gave to reporters Friday showed what appears to be the creature's mouth, an effort to disprove allegations that what's in the photo is a costume. ""I want to get to the bottom of it,"" Biscardi said. ""I'll tell you what I've seen and what I've touched and what I've felt, what I've prodded was not a mask sewed onto a bear hide, OK?"" Biscardi acknowledged that he promoted a fake Bigfoot discovery in 1995, saying the woman who claimed to have the body convinced his staff members before he visited her and discovered that she was mentally ill. Alleged Bigfoot sightings have surfaced from time to time for years, dating to at least the 1800s. The most famous was the so-called Patterson film from 1967, which is purported to show a tall, furry, apelike creature walking along, at one point looking over its shoulder at the videographer. Most scientists who have studied the film say there's no way to authenticate it, and many say the creature appears to be a man in a costume.

"Washington D.C. (CNN) -- Kim Jong Un has further solidified his control over North Korea by reportedly purging his uncle Jang Sung-taek, Vice Chairman of the important Nation Defense Commission. Although Jang was often referred to as the ""second most powerful man in North Korea,"" he may now been ousted from the leadership elite for the third time. He has twice returned to the inner circle of power, but this cat may now have run out of lives. Kim's uncle 'probably' ousted, S. Korean lawmakers say . What does the move say about the stability of North Korea? Some experts perceive a weak, embattled Kim feeling forced to fend off challengers. But it is more likely that Kim's purge of Jang -- as well as hundreds of other officials since 2011 -- shows that the North Korean ruler is firmly in control and confident enough to target even the most senior strata of power. Like his father and grandfather, Kim is playing rivals off against each other to eliminate real or perceived challengers. Debate rages amongst experts as to why Kim felt it necessary to purge his former mentor and protector. Potential explanations revolve around four Ps -- power, parity, people and policy. Although a classic struggle for power between the leader and potential contenders is a possible explanation, Jang had seemed content to play the role of Ã©minence grise, exercising power behind the throne. The best chance for Jang to have grabbed the ring of power would have been when Kim was weakest immediately after his father's death in 2011. But even then, the young Kim was immediately presented as the sole ruler and not as a part of a leadership consortium. After Kim acquired each of his father's titles affirming control over the government, military, and party, it became increasingly more difficult for potential challengers to oust him. Kim Jong Un more bellicose than his dad was? Then there's the issue of parity between the Korean Workers' Party (KWP) and the military. Under Kim Jong Il, power shifted to the military, as the National Defense Commission became the preeminent center of government power. But under his son, the KWP has regained some power. The KWP's Central Military Commission has now eclipsed the National Defense Commission as the arbiter of North Korean military policies. Rather than a struggle to wrest power from Kim, the purge may instead result from people fighting for closer access to him. There are widespread rumors that Jang was defeated in a struggle with personal rivals. The least likely explanation for the purge is a debate over policy. Although Jang was often referred to as a ""reformer"" by the media, there is little evidence that he or any hidden cabal advocated implementing significant economic and political reform or moderating North Korea's threatening behavior. Pyongyang created the perception of factions of hardliners and reformers as part of a ""good cop-bad cop"" strategy to elicit benefits during negotiations. As a Korean adage warns, ""The same animal has soft fur and sharp claws."" When Kim ascended the throne in 2011, he was erroneously perceived as a reformer simply because he had spent a few years in Switzerland as a teen. The likely departure of his uncle will have little impact on North Korea policy. Kim has shown himself to be just as inimical to reform and pursuing a less belligerent foreign policy as his predecessors. He showed his willingness to escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula to dangerous levels earlier this year, threatening nuclear attacks against the United States and South Korea. The young leader has also made clear he has no intention of abandoning his regime's nuclear weapons, even revising the constitution to enshrine North Korea as a nuclear weapons state. Pyongyang declared, ""those who talk about an economic reward in return for the dismantlement of [North Korea's] nuclear weapons would be well advised to awake from their daydream ... Only fools will entertain the delusion that we will trade our nuclear deterrent for petty economic aid."" Rather than seeking an illusory North Korean reformer, Washington and Seoul should instead prepare for the extended rule of yet another member of the Kim family willing to test the resolve of his opponents. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Bruce Klingner.","Jang Sung-taek was the vice chairman of North Korea's top military body .

"New York (CNN) -- He called the widow of Roger Maris a few days ago, a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of Bobby Kennedy-George Wallace. Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do. And, indeed, he was correct. Pat Maris deserved to hear the words ""I juiced"" straight from the artificially enhanced horse's mouth; deserved to know why she and her family had unwittingly served as his official cardboard props some 12 years ago; why her late husband's single-season home run mark (arguably the most hallowed standard in all of American sports) had been tattered by a man boasting all the integrity of a Times Square pickpocket. Think back, if you will, to September 8, 1998, when McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer of the season at Busch Stadium, then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the Maris children. Later, with tears streaming down his cheeks, McGwire told the media how, earlier that day, he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark. ""I touched it with my heart,"" he said. ""When I did that, I knew tonight was going to be the night. I can say my bat will lie next to his, and I'm damn proud of it."" By all accounts, back then Pat Maris thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow, one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark. And now? ""I think she was shocked when I called,"" McGwire said yesterday in his interview with Bob Costas  on the MLB Network. ""She was disappointed and she has every right to be."" In case you haven't received the official memo, protocol dictates this as the time when we're supposed to forgive, forget and move forward. Yes, Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone. Yes, it was against the law. Yes, they are termed performance-enhancing drugs for a reason. But in the world of Major League Baseball, where the phrase ""manning up"" is traditionally applied to an athlete playing through pain or putting on a particularly clutch display, a new, steroid-era definition has been established: . Manning Up (verb): When someone is caught cheating and, following a lengthy period of silence and/or denial, has no choice but to vaguely express remorse/regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of Holiday Inn banquet room autograph shows for $15 a pop alongside Erin Moran and the robot girl from Small Wonder. The fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms. So, like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte and Alex Rodriguez before him, Mark McGwire finally ""manned up."" Twelve years after shattering Maris' record, five years after his embarrassing, I'm-not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony, the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED, and that he was very, very wrong. Well, very wrong. Well, pretty wrong. Well, sorta wrong. Well, uh, not really wrong at all. Between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses, McGwire apologized for, ahem, nothing. Costas asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids. ""Absolutely,"" McGwire said. ""I was given this gift by the man upstairs."" Costas asked whether the steroids made him stronger. ""The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes,"" McGwire said. ""I did not take steroids to get any gain for any strength purposes."" Costas asked which drugs he had used. ""The names,"" McGwire said, ""I don't remember."" Heck, Costas tossed the ultimate underhand softball question, just to help a guy out--Did McGwire feel as if he was cheating? ""As I look back now as far as my health and my injuries, trying to help my injuries to help me feel normal, I can see why people would say that,"" he said. ""As far as the God-given talent and hand-eye coordination and the genetics I was given, I don't see it."" And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it. By using PED, he didn't merely take Maris' record. No, McGwire made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere. He was selected to All-Star Games that should have featured other players. He won Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year as other candidates were overlooked. He convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history--real, honest-to-goodness history--when, in fact, it was all a WWE-styled illusion. Pat Maris received her phone call. Will you be getting yours? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman says Mark McGwire owed (and delivered) apology to Roger Maris' wife, Pat .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- On June 8, 2009, nearly one year ago, I stood before a judge in North Korea's Supreme Court and was sentenced to 12 years in one of the country's notoriously brutal labor camps, also known as death camps. My legs wobbled in fear, and I grabbed the podium in front of me, fearing I would faint. Three months earlier, I was on assignment for Current TV. I was reporting on the trafficking of North Koreans, most of them women, who escape to neighboring China, where they are used and exploited. Following a local guide we'd hired, my colleague Euna Lee and I did regretfully step foot into North Korean territory for no more than a minute. As we made our way back to China, North Korean soldiers chased us onto Chinese soil and violently dragged us back into North Korea. We were the first Americans tried in North Korea's highest court. Our sentence, two years for trespassing and 10 for ""hostile"" acts, shows where the North Korean government's real concerns lie. Leery about a negative portrayal of its regime, the North Korean authorities decided the documentary we were making would threaten their government. It was seen as a hostile act meant to weaken or bring down the country. No country on Earth is more paranoid about its image than North Korea, which has maintained its firm grip on power in part because of its ability to indoctrinate its people. North Korea is one of the world's most closed-off societies, with little known about what goes on inside. Its citizens know little about the outside world. The regime's mass propaganda machine carefully and consistently disseminates information to the North Korean citizenry extolling the virtues of the communist state and its megalomaniacal ""Dear Leader,"" Kim Jong Il. During nearly five months of captivity, I was allowed to watch television in a guard's area and saw black-and-white movies about the Korean War and the heroic communists defeating their arch-enemy, the United States. Rallies celebrating a recent satellite launch or nuclear test featured North Korean men and women proudly, defiantly waving their fists in the air. I rarely spotted any young adults, or college-aged spectators within the crowds, just older folks who seemed less likely to cause disruptions. With their booming voices, newsreaders listed off the latest achievements made by Kim Jong Il, such as the opening of a chicken-processing factory or the building of a dam. At night, I had to put a pillow over my head to drown out the patriotic anthems sung by the military choir. But beneath all this flag-waving is a different reality. Escapees from North Korea paint a stark picture of a place where human rights don't exist. The slightest criticism or disrespect paid towards Kim Jong Il could land one in a hard labor camp, where starved and tortured prisoners scavenge for food while performing backbreaking work. When my Current TV colleagues and I were in the northeastern part of China that borders North Korea, we spoke with several defectors who had fled the desperate conditions, seeking food and freedom across the border. While they have been able to get more sustenance in China, freedom has not come as easily. The Chinese government does not regard these defectors as refugees, even though they face certain, brutal punishment if they are sent back to North Korea. A young woman, whom I'll call Ji-Yong, recounted her escape, braving the rushing waters of the Tumen River that separates North Korea and China. Not knowing how to swim, she nervously made her way across the frigid waters in the dark. She had been told she could find a better life in China and that there would be work opportunities in the computer industry. Instead she was placed in the online sex industry and was forced to undress for clients who watched her via the web. Her boss tied her arms behind her back and locked her in a room to prevent her from escaping. With help from a friend, she was able to get away, but with nowhere to go and no money, she ended up working for another online sex company. She was grateful that her boss treated her humanely and allowed her to go outside for breaks. With tears streaming, smearing her thick black eyeliner, she spoke of how much she missed her mother. Ji-Yong's story is becoming increasingly common as traffickers prey on vulnerable and scared women from North Korea. Many others are sold like commodities into loveless marriages where they are abused and treated like slaves. North Korean women have no legal status in China, so the children they bear with Chinese husbands also suffer. The Chinese government does not grant these children citizenship; they must live in the shadows as stateless children with no access to public health care or education. If the mothers are deported, or leave their husbands, the children are often left abandoned and orphaned. During my captivity, I thought about the North Korean defectors who had opened their lives to me. Thinking about their struggles gave me strength to endure. I might have been living the biggest horror of my life, but what I was going through paled in comparison to what North Koreans in their country and in neighboring China have lived through and continue to struggle against today. I am fortunate to be home in America now, where freedom is my birthright. North Koreans are imprisoned. But there is hope. Organizations such as the nonprofit LiNK (Liberty in North Korea) are on the frontlines of raising awareness about the desperate plight of North Korean defectors and helping escapees find refuge in countries where they can begin new lives. LiNK's campaign ""The Hundred"" aims to rescue and resettle 100 North Korean defectors. Their efforts are risky because they must shuttle defectors from secret shelters in various countries across Asia before they can find safe haven in countries such as South Korea or the United States. This video shows North Korean defector, Ki-Won, and his journey to freedom with the help of LiNK. Recently a bill was introduced in Congress by Sam Brownback, R-Kansas in the Senate, and Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, and Diane Watson, D-California, in the House that seeks to address the issue of North Korean orphans and stateless children in China. If passed, the bill will help pave the way for families in the United States to adopt eligible children. In June, I stood before a North Korean judge and expressed my hope that the United States and North Korea might one day establish closer relations. That desire still exists. I also promised that if released, I would never report on the issue of defectors or North Korean human rights abuses again. That is an oath I cannot keep as long as the people of North Korea remain silenced.

"Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- The headline from one Swedish newspaper summed up the days to come for President Barack Obama: ""Obama in the Shadow of War."" During a fast-paced three-day overseas trip that includes visits to Stockholm, Sweden and a G-20 summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the president will face allied, yet skeptical leaders who remain unconvinced that military action is necessary to punish Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Even as Obama administration officials acknowledge that Syria will be an ongoing subject of discussion, they dismiss the notion the president is fighting a losing diplomatic battle, noting support from both France and Turkey. Obama's visit to Sweden marks the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited the nation's archipelago capital city of Stockholm. However, the president is only visiting the Scandinavian nation as a result of his administration's decision to cancel a bilateral summit in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the latest example of worsening U.S.-Russian relations. Obama-Putin will have a chance to talk on 'margins' of G-20 summit . White House officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have complained of Russian obstruction to any United Nations intervention in Syria's bloody civil war. Still, even on Obama's first stop, there is opposition to any unilateral U.S. action against Syria. ""Sweden doesn't want a military attack... I don't believe that is the solution to the conflict,"" Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told Swedish public broadcaster SVT in an interview over the weekend. But Obama's principal adversary on Syria, Putin, appeared to open the door to U.N.-sanctioned military action in an interview with the Associated Press and Russia's state Channel 1. Washington out in the cold as China-Russia relations flourish . ""If there are data that the chemical weapons have been used, and used specifically by the regular army, this evidence should be submitted to the U.N. Security Council,"" Putin said. In response to Putin's remarks, a senior administration official said the White House continues to be deeply skeptical about any support from Russia, which holds a key seat on the Security Council. But as the president arrived in Europe, there were signs of a potential thaw in the chill between Washington and Moscow. Interactive: U.S. and allied assets around Syria . Administration officials said Tuesday Obama is expected to meet briefly with Putin at this week's G-20 summit -- ""on the margins,"" one White House official said. That is a small but measurable improvement over what the White House said late last month, when it indicated the two leaders would not spend any time together in St. Petersburg. The relationship between Obama and Putin has suffered from one damaging episode after another in recent months. Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to national security contractor turned leaker Edward Snowden was greeted with frustration by Obama administration officials. And then Obama's comparison of the Russian president's body language to the ""bored kid in the back of the classroom"" did not go over well in Moscow. In his interview with the AP and Channel 1, Putin urged observers not to read too much into the body language coming from other leaders. ""We work, we argue about some issues. We are human,"" Putin said. Before the president's trip to Russia, he will spend 24 hours in Sweden, a nation administration officials describe as a key ally on issues ranging from national security to climate change. While in Stockholm, Obama is also scheduled to meet with Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and pay tribute to the late Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who is credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust.

"(CNN) -- In the hubbub at San Francisco's airport following the crash of Asiana Flight 214, a United airlines employee and his fiancee allegedly stole luggage and exchanged some of its contents at a nearby Nordstrom for cash, a prosecutor said Tuesday. The two suspects -- Sean Crudup, a United customer service representative, and Raychas Thomas, his fiancee -- were arrested as the latter was catching a flight to Hawaii, the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office said in a news release. Both are free on bail. The incident happened in the aftermath of the July 6 crash-landing of Flight 214 at San Francisco International Airport. Two people died right after the Boeing 777 shed parts, spun and burst into flames and another died six days later; about 180 others were hurt. Asiana crash probe moves on from San Francisco airport . Thousands more were inconvenienced when departing and incoming air traffic at the airport was halted in the hours after the crash. In some cases, incoming flights were diverted to other airports in California. Passengers' bags sometimes made it to San Francisco before they did, leading to a pileup of luggage. That's where, according to the district attorney's office, the case against the suspects begins. Surveillance video showed Crudup stealing bags and handing them to his fiancee and another unnamed woman, the prosecutor's office said. Report: TSA employee misconduct up 26% in 3 years . Thomas exchanged valuable clothing that had been in the bags at a Nordstrom store in Pleasanton, California, for about $5,000, the district attorney's office said. More of the victims' property was found during a search of the home that Crudup and Thomas shared, according to authorities. Crudup and Thomas have been charged with one count each of grand theft and two counts each of commercial burglaries, District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe said. Convictions on these charges -- all of them felonies -- carries a maximum sentence of 4 years and 4 months in prison. Thomas posted bail ""right away"" and is set to appear in court August 26 for her arraignment, the district attorney notes. Her fiancee, Crudup, was in court last Friday, July 26, at which time he's pleaded not guilty. Wagstaffe didn't know the name of the court-appointed attorney assigned to Crudup, who posted $75,000 bail over the weekend. In a statement to CNN on Tuesday, United said that it has ""zero tolerance for any theft."" ""We are assisting the San Francisco Police Department in this investigation,"" the airline said, ""and this employee has been held out of service.""

"(CNN) -- The 80 cast and crew members involved in the making of the movie that has roiled much of the Islamic world said Wednesday they were ""grossly misled"" about its intent and expressed sorrow over the resulting violence. ""The entire cast and crew are extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer,"" they said in a statement to CNN about the movie, ""Innocence of Muslims."" ""We are 100% not behind this film and were grossly misled about its intent and purpose,"" continued the statement, which was sent to CNN by a member of the production staff who asked not to be identified for security reasons. ""We are shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved. We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred."" Mystery swirls around anti-Islam film . Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed Tuesday in Libya amid a regional furor over the film, which mocks Islam's prophet. A casting call published in July 2011 in Backstage magazine and in other publications for actors identifies the working title of the movie as ""Desert Warrior"" and describes it as a ""historical Arabian Desert adventure film."" An actress in the film who asked not to be identified said the original script did not include a Prophet Muhammed character. She added that she and other actors complained that their lines had been changed. The actress said she spoke Wednesday with the producer, who is identified in the advertisement as Sam Bassiel. ""He said he wrote the script because he wants the Muslims to quit killing,"" she said. ""I had no idea he was doing all this."" ""I would never be involved in a film to ever hurt or bring harm to anybody,"" she told CNN. ""This makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was involved in that movie that brought death to somebody else."" The actress said the character of Muhammed in the movie was identified as George when it was shot, and that she returned afterward and read other lines that may have been dubbed into the piece. YouTube restricts video access over Libyan violence . A member of the production staff who worked directly on the film and has a copy of the original script corroborated the actor's account, adding that it mentions neither Muhammed nor Islam. The Wall Street Journal identified the filmmaker as Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real estate developer. The Journal reported that, in its telephone interview with Bacile, he characterized his film as ""a political effort to call attention to the hypocrisies of Islam."" ""Islam is a cancer,"" he told the newspaper. ""The movie is a political movie. It's not a religious movie."" CNN has not been able to contact Bacile and cannot verify that he made the movie. A CNN search of public records on Sam Bacile came up empty. Israel's Foreign Ministry said it doesn't know who Bacile is. Reaction: Libya, West condemn killing . ""This guy is totally anonymous. At this point no one can confirm he holds Israeli citizenship and even if he did we are not involved,"" ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said. ""No Israeli institution, government department or office has any involvement in this. This guy acted on his own behalf."" In Egypt and Libya, mobs targeted U.S. missions and blamed America for the film. In the end, Stevens and three other Americans in the Libyan city of Benghazi were dead, although it was not clear whether that attack was solely incited by the film. Consultant Steve Klein told CNN he worked with Bacile on the movie and said the filmmaker had gone into hiding. ""He's very depressed, and he's upset,"" Klein said Wednesday. ""I talked to him this morning, and he said that he was very concerned for what happened to the ambassador."" Klein, however, said it was not the film's fault that protests had turned bloody. Casting further doubt on the filmmaker's identity, The Atlantic quoted Klein as saying Sam Bacile is a pseudonym and ""he did not know Bacile's real name."" CNN could not immediately reach Klein for his response to that report. An online trailer for the film depicts Islam as a fraudulent religion bent on getting rid of nonbelievers. Cartoonish scenes show Muhammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. Other scenes show security forces ordered to do nothing as rampaging Muslims destroy Christian homes, and a donkey anointed the first Muslim animal. Many Muslims find any depiction of Muhammed to be offensive -- a Danish newspaper's publication in 2005 of Mohammed caricatures triggered riots -- and derogatory depictions of the prophet are considered by some to be worse. ""The film is offensive to the prophet and immoral,"" said Egyptian Prime Minister Hashem Kandil. ""We call on the great people of Egypt to exercise restraint when expressing their anger."" Muslim sensitivities around Prophet Mohammed . The prime minister called on the United States to take legal action against the makers of the film, though it was not clear that it violates any U.S. law. According to The Wall Street Journal, Bacile said he raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors to make the two-hour movie in California last year. Based on the trailer, the movie appears to have been produced on a low budget. The movie, which was posted in July on YouTube, got more notice after Egyptian television recently aired segments and anti-Islam activists, including Egyptian-born Coptic Christian Morris Sadek, promoted it online. Terry Jones, the Florida pastor whose Quran-burning last year sparked deadly riots in Afghanistan, said he had been contacted to help distribute the film. ""The film is not intended to insult the Muslim community, but it is intended to reveal truths about Muhammed that are possibly not widely known,"" Jones said. ""It is very clear that God did not influence him (Muhammed) in the writings of the Quran,"" said Jones, who went on to blame Muslims' fear of criticism for the protests, rather than the film. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Jones on Wednesday to ask him to withdraw his support for the film, according to Col. David Lapan, Dempsey's spokesman. ""Jones' support of the film risks causing more violence and death,"" Lapan said. Tensions mounted Wednesday as the United States deployed Marines to Libya. Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood -- the former party of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy -- has called for peaceful protests against the film on Friday, Islam's day of religious observance. In Afghanistan, the Taliban charged that the movie was made with the permission of the U.S. government. The First Amendment prohibits the government from interfering with free expression. President Hamid Karzai condemned the film as abhorrent and an act of desecration. ""There could be many deaths once news of this video and Pastor Terry Jones' comments get out,"" said Karzai's deputy spokesman. The issue is sensitive in Afghanistan, where throngs of people this year protested NATO's burning of Qurans at Bagram Airfield. U.S. President Barack Obama said the act was unintentional, but the uproar nonetheless was huge. In America, a Muslim advocacy group called the movie ""trashy"" and said its producers represented neither the United States nor the Christian faith. ""We urge that this ignorant attempt to provoke the religious feelings of Muslims in the Arabic-speaking world be ignored and that its extremist producers not be given the cheap publicity they so desperately seek,"" said the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Facebook sprouted several pages dedicated to condemning the film, including one called ""Israelis, Jews & Americans Against Sam Bacile's 'Innocence of Muslims' Film."" A post on that page simply said: ""IM-Bacile."" Witnessing protests in Libya or Egypt? Share your photos on CNN iReport.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Palestinian security reinforcements were awaiting orders Saturday as part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian operation in the West Bank town of Hebron, officials said. Palestinian security officers assemble Saturday in the West Bank town of Hebron. The Palestinian militant organization Hamas quickly condemned the move, which is evidence of a growing cooperation between Israel Defense Forces and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The 550 reinforcements, composed of members of the Palestinian Authority's National and Presidential guards, entered Hebron as part of a security crackdown aimed at establishing order and confiscating illegal weapons, Mayor Khaled al-Aseyli said. The U.S. State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security has trained portions of the Presidential Guard over the last year. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said the guards are targeting Hamas militants in the West Bank. He said Hamas condemns the operation, as well as the coordination between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Israel is rewarding the Palestinian Authority for its work in detaining militants, Barhoum said. Though Hamas' power base is anchored in Gaza, there are remnants of the Hamas infrastructure in the West Bank, where the rival Fatah party's Palestinian Authority holds sway. On Wednesday, two Israeli brigadier generals met with Palestinian security officials at the IDF West Bank headquarters, according to an IDF statement. ""The two sides discussed the Palestinian request to conduct an extensive enforcement operation against law breakers and rioters in the Hebron area,"" the statement said. ""During the meeting, the plan for the enforcement operation was presented and the process of coordination during the operation was agreed upon."" The statement further said the meeting was held in a ""positive atmosphere"" and the two sides would convene soon to continue their dialogue on security matters. Hebron is the third city in the West Bank to be reinforced with Palestinian Authority forces. Forces converged on Jenin and Nablus earlier this year, West Bank security sources said. In the last two months, the IDF has removed at least 20 of its roadblocks in Hebron. The IDF said it has removed scores of roadblocks and opened major crossings in the West Bank, allowing ""the free movement of the Palestinian population.""

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers scolded and shouted and lectured. Deputy Attorney General James Cole responded dozens of times the same way at a House hearing on Thursday: The Justice Department can't provide details of its ongoing criminal investigation into whether IRS employees broke the law in unfairly singling out specific political groups for extra scrutiny. Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, who led the Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee hearing, and others on the panel wanted to know why after 14 months prosecutors haven't filed charges. Cole acknowledged the investigation is now examining the circumstances of missing emails, and a destroyed hard-drive, from former IRS official Lois Lerner. He told lawmakers the Justice Department investigation has other ways to retrieve emails that Lerner sent, because they can gather records from those who received them. Cole said the Justice Department didn't know about the lost emails until the issue became public in June, when the IRS notified Congress. He also said investigators would look the delay in notification. GOP lawmakers were angry that the Justice Department continues to say the investigation is ongoing even after media reports, including from CNN, said that federal investigators so far have found no prosecutable crime in the case. Cole said such reports are premature. ""No decisions have been made on this case,"" he said. Democrats on the panel defended the department and served up questions to Cole to help him make his point. For an investigation such as this one, 14 months and more is ""normal,"" Cole said. For much of the hearing Cole stuck to versions of the same response: . - ""With all due respect we don't talk about the investigative steps."" - ""Don't want to sound like a broken record congressman, but I'm not at liberty to discuss non-public information."" When asked how many people have been interviewed or subpoenaed: ""I don't know an exact number, and I wouldn't tell you if I did."" Increasingly irritated, Rep. Paul Gosar reminded Cole that he was a dentist not a lawyer, and tried to grill him over comments in February by President Barack Obama. The President told Fox News in an interview aired before the Super Bowl that he believed the IRS scandal resulted from ""boneheaded"" decisions by a few people but that so far there was ""not even a smidgeon of corruption"" found. Gosar asked Cole to define what a ""smidgeon"" was. After several prods from Gosar, Cole said ""smidgeon"" means ""small.""

"(CNN) -- Even in the best of circumstances, Dawson City's famed Sourtoe Cocktail doesn't go down smoothly. On Saturday night, however, the cocktail's marquee ingredient -- an actual human toe -- went down a way it was never meant to. Served by the Sourtoe Cocktail club at Dawson City's Downtown Hotel, the Sourtoe can be any drink -- what makes it a Sourtoe Cocktail is the addition of a real, preserved amputated toe, which is dropped into the glass.

"New York (CNN) -- Never fear. While North Korea is a closed communist state, a rogue nuclear power that regularly threatens war and starves its own people in prison camps, Dennis Rodman has just returned from some one-on-one diplomacy with its ""dear leader"" Kim Jong Un and has good news to report: ""I love him. The guy is awesome. He was so honest."" I'm going to go out on a limb and say this isn't going to look much better in the eyes of history than Charles Lindbergh vouching for Hitler's character in the late 1930s. But say this for the retired rebounding champion known as ""The Worm"" -- he got closer to the young dictator by walking in the front door of North Korea with the Harlem Globetrotters and Vice magazine than diplomats and intelligence services have gotten to date. As former Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Ganyard told ABC News, ""There is nobody at the CIA who could tell you more personally about Kim Jong Un than Dennis Rodman, and that in itself is scary."" 5 ways North Korea is getting stranger . Bonding over a shared love of basketball and getting drunk with the dictator's entourage sure sounds like a cozy way to visit a country where 3.5 million people have starved to death since 1995. But it requires a bit of willful ignorance to scoop up the state propaganda and be used as a dupe for their domestic state-run media, which is also likely to portray the diminutive dictator as an all-time dunking champ. In a rambling interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Rodman defended his trip and his budding friendship with Kim, telling George Stephanopoulos: ""I don't condone what he does, but as far as a person to person, he's my friend"" and then went on to the fetid well of moral equivalence to dismiss the prison camps and reports of mass murder as ""just politics."" Rodman is far from the first celebrity to be used for publicity purposes to prop up a dictator and even profess real friendship. Lindbergh cozied up to Adolf Hitler in a naive attempt to keep America isolationist in World War II. American singer, actor and attorney Paul Robeson was taken in by the Soviet Union and proclaimed its lack of segregation was evidence of freedom's progress while millions were being murdered by Joseph Stalin in gulags. Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez was proud of his personal friendship with Cuba's communist dictator Fidel Castro, propelled by long nights of drinking and philosophizing by the Caribbean Sea. In more recent years, stars have taken big money from dictators in exchange for private concert performances, including Seal and Hilary Swank appearing at Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov's multimillion dollar 35th birthday bash (Swank later apologized), Nelly Furtado performing for Moammar Gadhafi (she later gave the money back) and Mariah Carey, Usher and Beyonce performing for Gadhafi's sons in St. Barts. (My colleagues at The Daily Beast put together a useful gallery of these and other ""stars who hang with dictators."") The greed that simply compels one to take a gig, no matter who is paying the bill, is different than the impulse to ingest talking points and benefit from the privileges of friendship with mass murderers who can sometimes seem charmingly insane in person. Just because you're crazy doesn't mean you're stupid and just because a man can be a monster in his vise-like grip on a state doesn't mean it should be a compelling revelation that he is also in fact human. As David Remnick detailed in his literary and journalistic portrait of the Soviet Union, ""Lenin's Tomb,"" Stalin was a fan of American musicals and after one long day of purging his own ranks with arbitrary executions, he retired to watch a comedy called ""Happy Guys."" This is where judgment and moral clarity come in handy -- two concepts rarely associated with Dennis Rodman. That's why George Stephanopoulos was right to hand him a copy of the Human Rights Watch report on North Korea after Rodman declared his intention to return to North Korea for another visit sometime soon. Vacationing in dictatorships is always a bad idea, even if it is justified by the self-serving notion of conducting personal diplomacy. It is still, as the Sex Pistols once said, ""a cheap holiday in other people's misery.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Army Wednesday notified Pfc. Bradley Manning, a prime suspect in the WikiLeaks case, that he now faces 22 more charges in connection with allegedly downloading secret information from computers in Iraq. The most serious new charge alleges that he aided the enemy by making this information public. That charge is punishable by death. A news release from the Army said the prosecution team ""has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty,"" but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision about the death penalty. All told, Manning, a military intelligence analyst from Oklahoma, now faces a total of 34 charges in the case, including: . -- Wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the internet . -- Theft of public records . -- Transmitting defense information . -- Transferring classified data onto his personal computer . -- Disclosing classified information concerning the national defense. Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, would not comment on the new charges, but posted a statement on his blog Wednesday evening: . ""Over the past few weeks, the defense has been preparing for the possibility of additional charges in this case."" U.S. military officials have said that Manning is the prime suspect in the leak of many thousands of classified documents that ended up on the WikiLeaks website. However, WikiLeaks is not mentioned in the charge sheets. Last August, Coombs said he'd seen no evidence tying Manning to the WikiLeaks case. Even though the investigators filed the new charges, there are still several legal steps that would be taken before any decision will be made on which charges, if any, Manning would actually face in a court-martial. One of those steps involves determining Manning's mental capacity. That step is expected to take two to six more weeks. Manning is currently being held in the brig at Quantico Marine Base south of Washington, D.C. There has been a push by friends and supporters to have the rules about his confinement conditions eased. They say his confinement, in a one-man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise, is unfair.","Army private charged with aiding enemy .

"(CNN) -- Jonathan Trappe, the American who aimed to cross the Atlantic Ocean suspended from 370 helium-filled balloons, has aborted his mission just 12 hours and about 470 miles into the journey, his Facebook page says. The 39-year-old IT project manager from Raleigh, North Carolina, was forced to make an early landing in a remote part of Newfoundland, Canada, because of a technical issue. ""Hmm, this doesn't look like France,"" Trappe posted to his Facebook page late Thursday, along with the coordinates of his landing. Via his messaging system, Trappe spoke to Barcroft Media, a British company he partnered with. He said he feared he might die as he attempted to crash-land his balloon contraption. ""Honestly did not know if I would survive that landing!"" Trappe said of touching down in pitch darkness near Blow Me Down Provincial Park in the wilderness of Newfoundland. He then messaged, ""Situation stable. Have 60l water 38L. Gatorade 60,000 cal food. Have shelter and exposure gear."" Trappe said he would stay the night at his landing site before grabbing what gear he could -- including footage he took of the shorter-than-planned trip -- and making his way home. Canadian teams have begun searching the forest where Trappe crash-landed. If the patrol is unsuccessful, Trappe, who has confirmed he is safe and well on Facebook, is prepared to spend another night in the mountainous region, which is populated by black bears and moose, said Sgt. Richard White of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. If the teams can't find him, or if he can't get a commercial team to extract him, he plans to make his way out of the mountainous forest on foot and head to a local community. Fans followed the adventurer's movements on a website that showed his longitude and latitude along the journey via a satellite tracker he took with him. Trappe took off from Caribou, Maine, early Thursday with 370 balloons. ""Nobody has ever made a flight like this, using only small helium balloons -- in manned flight -- across the ocean,"" Trappe wrote on his website, clusterballoon.com, after the style of ballooning used in his attempt to across the Atlantic. In 2010, he was the first person to cross the English Channel using a balloon cluster. Five people have died trying to cross the Atlantic with balloons. Trappe spent two years preparing for the transatlantic flight, and his trip to Europe was supposed to take about a week. ""While disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the Atlantic short, I know Jonathan thanks everyone for their support and encouragement,"" said Trappe's friend, Kevin Knapp, who monitored the trip from a command center on the ground.","NEW: A Canadian team has begun searching for cluster balloonist Jonathan Trappe .

"(CNN) -- While North Korea's recently departed leader Kim Jong Il will probably be most remembered for his pompadour, jumpsuits and relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons, the world must never forget the legacy of anguish and terror he left for millions of his people. The North Korean regime is built on fear: fear, according to reports of defectors, that disloyalty and even minor infractions against the Kim family's cult of personality will lead to a death sentence working in one of the North's gulags, mining uranium on starvation rations while your family struggles to survive just outside the wire. There is fear that the secret police will shut off the electricity to your house and burst in to extract the DVDs or VCRs you were secretly watching to learn about the outside world; fear that border guards will not accept your bribe or might catch you bringing a Bible back from China, the punishment for which is being bound by wires poked through the ears of other prisoners and marched off to slave labor; fear that you are in a province suspected of disloyalty by Pyongyang and that you might be allowed to slip from malnourishment to starvation when the harvest comes up short again. It has been surprisingly difficult to confront North Korea on these human rights abuses. The regime claims that all of its citizens live in a worker's paradise and that Western or South Korean criticism is only aimed at confrontation and war, which Pyongyang will meet with fire and destruction. American, Japanese and South Korean governments have all at one time or another decided that pressure on human rights might distract from diplomatic negotiations over the more dangerous threat from the North's nuclear weapons program --which is, of course, one of the reasons the North wants nuclear weapons. The South Korean political left has also slowed pressure on human rights because they have traditionally seen criticism of the North as an excuse by past conservative military governments to restrict civil liberties in the South. Those episodes are happily behind us in today's democratic South Korea, but the memories and ideological fissures linger. And China is a major obstacle, resisting pressure on the North on human rights because of fears it may increase refugee flows across the Yalu River, which runs along its border with North Korea. Still, the information gets out. Satellite images show huge prison camps containing as many as 200,000 prisoners. Defectors like Kang Chol-hwan have written about life (if it can be called that) within the Yodok camps in his book ""The Aquariums of Pyongyang."" Americans and other foreigners have also opened a window to the suffering of the North Korean people, including Mike Kim, a young Tae Kwon Do expert who opened a string of martial arts studios in China as cover to help North Koreans defect. His book, ""Escaping North Korea,"" is a stunning story of tragedy and heroism. There is also more that the United States and other countries can do as a matter of policy. First, we should remain consistent in highlighting the North's record in all diplomatic discussions, including with the North Koreans. Second, we should put more international pressure on China to allow the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees to visit North Koreans in China and to stop refoulement (the forced repatriation of North Koreans against their will). Third, we could increase the number of North Korean defectors we accept in the United States and use our diplomatic leverage with third countries like Thailand and Mongolia to ensure that North Korean defectors have the ability to safely make their way to the South. Fourth, we should not link food aid to political negotiations, and should insist only that we have adequate monitoring to ensure food gets to those desperate North Koreans who need it. Finally, while we are not well positioned to force a collapse of the regime and must appreciate that its demise would present the danger of loose nukes, we must nevertheless prepare with our allies for massive humanitarian assistance in the event that collapse does happen. That scenario would bring risk, but also great hope for 23 million suffering North Koreans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael J. Green.","Michael Green: Kim Jong Il should be remembered for a regime built on anguish, terror .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- While only the highest echelons of North Korea's opaque leadership will know the full financial cost of Wednesday's launch, South Korea's government estimates Pyongyang spent $1.3 billion on its rocket program this year. The two rockets launched this year -- this week's mission and a failed attempt in April -- cost $600 million, while the launch site itself is estimated at $400 million. Other related facilities add another $300 million, according to an official from South Korea's Ministry of Unification. ""This is equivalent to acquiring 4.6 million tons of corn,"" the official said. ""If this was used for solving the food shortage issue, North Koreans would not have to worry about food for four to five years."" Whatever the cost, what is known is that North Korea is one of the poorest countries in Asia, with an economy worth just $40 billion, according to the CIA World Factbook. But the price of North Korea's rocket launches might be lower than government estimates because North Korean workers earn much less than their southern neighbors, says Cheong Wook-Sik, Director of South Korea's Peace Network in Seoul. The Kaesong industrial complex, on the border with South Korea, has some of the country's highest wage earners at about $100 per month, says Cheong, 14-year chief of the South Korean non-governmental organization. ""This is very high compared to the rest of North Korea. If you're not working in Kaesong, the average worker salary drops to an average of perhaps $50 per month."" Prior to Wednesday's launch, South Korea threatened tougher sanctions on North Korea in the footsteps of a 2007 freeze on North Korean funds held at Banco Delta Asia in the Chinese territory of Macau. Cheong says some $25 million are still frozen there -- illicit funds from money laundering and drug trafficking by the North Korean regime. ""But in order to impose further sanctions, China's involvement is necessary"" because Beijing is Pyongyang's closest ally in the world, Cheong said. ""I don't think financial sanctions against North Korea are the best course of action because that can make the situation out of control."" But the financial cost and any risk of further sanctions may be a tradeoff for internal political gain as leader Kim Jong-Un tries to solidify his grip on power, as Wednesday's launch comes near the first-year death anniversary of his father, Kim Jong-Il, on December 17.

""If North Korea succeeds in launching a satellite, North Korea propaganda may spin this by saying the country has become a prosperous and strong nation. That will help Kim Jong-Un both consolidate his power and help maintain the legacy of his father."" If there is a message to the international community, adds Cheong, it may be that North Korea is implying ""our satellite launch means we have nuclear weapons, we have a delivery system.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Same-sex marriage is a non-issue in American politics. OK, that might be a bit of an overstatement, but it seems to be causing less of a firestorm lately than when it was a dependable wedge issue. When Attorney General Eric Holder announced Saturday at the Human Rights Campaign's gala that the federal government will expand the recognition of same-sex marriages in federal legal matters, including bankruptcies, prison visits and survivor benefits, it barely moved the political crisis dial. The Twitter world was relatively quiet. News releases from both Republicans and Democrats were few and far between. The topic was barely mentioned on the Sunday political talk shows. The biggest fallout might be more about President Obama's use of executive action to push his agenda rather than the issue itself. It's not that this announcement isn't a big deal, because ""it's a very big deal,"" said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic donor and former campaign manager for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Although Holder's announcement is an extension of the Supreme Court's decision last year striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, it's a definitive statement on the Obama administration's policy position. ""Just like during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the stakes involved in this generation's struggle for LGBT equality could not be higher,"" Holder said Saturday. ""As attorney general, I will not let this department be simply a bystander during this important moment in history."" Same sex marriage fast facts . Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the announcement is ""logical, it's consistent, it's passionate."" But one day after Holder's announcement, conservatives, who tend to oppose same-sex marriage, have said little. Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that it ""appears to be another example of the Obama administration imposing its will on the states"" and noted that same-sex marriage is legal in her state. It ""could"" be an issue in other states where it is not, she said. That's not exactly a seething denouncement. The issue has come a long way in the court of public opinion, as a majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage. According to a national Quinnipiac University poll from September, 56% of Americans support marriage for same-sex couples, compared with only 25% who supported it in 1996. A CNN poll in 2010 was the first time a poll found that a majority of respondents backed it. Republican strategist Ana Navarro said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that opinions on same-sex marriage represent the ""most rapid social change that we've seen in our lifetime."" Navarro said Republican politicians' positions are evolving, too, but they aren't too vocal about it. She said Republican views on the issue are changing rapidly, but politicians ""may not be out there because there's no reason to take the political hit if there's no legislation in front of them."" The political hit could come from the party base, among whom opposition is more common. The same Quinnipiac poll found that 36% of Republicans back same-sex marriage in their states. Navarro insisted, however, that opinions are changing quickly among Republican voters and that by the 2016 presidential election, it might be ""much less of a point than it is today."" The last five years have seen a tremendous amount of change on the issue. More than a dozen states have legalized same-sex marriage, and Obama is the first president to endorse it. Support for gay rights generally has increased, as evidenced late last year when the Senate passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace. It was the first time the Senate had passed the measure, and it won 10 Republicans votes. Republican strategist John Feehery, president of QGA Communications, said: ""There is so much else the Republican Party should focus on. I imagine that they won't spend much time pounding away at this issue."" Elmendorf said the administration's decision was not a political risk for Obama or the Democrats leading into the 2014 midterm elections. ""There's not a political downside for Obama. There's none,"" he said. Elmendorf noted that gay rights' issues in politics are no longer a niche issue but rather appeal to many voters. ""It's not about gay voters any more, it's about any voter under the age of 40,"" he said. Rand Paul warns his former home state, Texas, could turn blue . Not everyone has stayed out of the fray, however. Former Arkansas governor and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who also appeals to social conservatives, sent an e-mail to his supporters shortly after Holder's announcement. ""Is it a surprise this administration is picking and choosing the laws they like?"" the e-mail read. It included included a link to the CNN story about Holder's announcement and asked for support of Huckpac, his political action committee, and the Conservative Candidates fund. Same-sex marriage could become a campaign issue in some of the more conservative districts and states around the country, where incumbents could face challenges from the right, especially in the more than two dozen states that have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. A Republican operative said people could ""probably see this as another overreach by the Obama administration to subvert their will."" Even Obama's evolution on the issue, from opposing same-sex marriage to supporting it, still has not satisfied LGBT activists and supporters. For one, he has not indicated that same-sex marriage should be addressed at the federal level to eliminate the patchwork of laws around the country. While reaction might be much more muted, for proponents, the issue is far from won.","Political reaction to more federal recognition of same-sex marriages to all states muted .

"(CNN) -- Seven years ago, I was shot during the massacre at Virginia Tech and became a gun violence survivor. The events that day changed my life, and I've devoted much of my professional life to making sure that fewer people's lives are altered by gun violence the way mine was. Given that this has become my life's work, people often ask me what we can do to reduce gun violence in America. My answer is always the same: pass a comprehensive background check bill at the federal level. A federal background check bill won't end gun violence altogether, but it's the most meaningful and immediate thing we can do that would save the most lives. Current federal law only requires background checks when guns are purchased from federally licensed dealers. Undoubtedly, these checks have saved lives. In fact, since its inception 16 years ago, the gun background check system has blocked more than 2 million felons and other dangerous people from buying guns. The problem is that the same individuals who are blocked from sales at a dealer can simply purchase guns through unlicensed, private sellers at gun shows or from strangers they meet online with no background check at all. This gap in the law allows millions of guns to exchange hands each year without background checks. That has to change and if national politicians won't take action, we'll have to take this fight to the state level. Increasingly, that's exactly what the gun violence prevention movement is doing. Voters in Washington state, for instance, passed a ballot measure requiring that all purchasers of guns sold in Washington go through a background check. In order to pass more ballot measures like this, it's imperative that our movement build a strong base of grassroots supporters that vote with these issues in mind. I'm proud to say that the organization I work for, Everytown for Gun Safety, is doing just that. Our Gun Sense Voter initiative is aimed at signing up 1 million voters who vow to vote for candidates with gun sense. We also need to make sure that all of the records of those who are already prohibited from owning guns are actually in the system to begin with. Currently, hundreds of thousands of records identifying seriously mentally ill people as prohibited gun purchasers are missing from the federal background check database because of lax reporting by state courts and agencies. One of those missing records was of the Virginia Tech shooter who killed 32 people and injured 15â€”including myselfâ€”before committing suicide. A court had found that he posed an imminent threat and had issued an order that prohibited him from buying or possessing guns, but because the state failed to submit this prohibiting record to the federal background check system, he was able to pass a background check and buy the guns he used in the massacre. Gun owners themselves understand that a background check system that works isn't about undermining the rights of lawful gun owners. In fact, recent polling has revealed that more than 70% of gun owners support background checks. I've experienced firsthand the horror that can result when a dangerous individual gets access to lethal firepower. I'm reminded of this every day, when I see the scars across my body. For many of my friends, the experience is much worse. They wake up each morning and can barely recognize their own faces, while others still feel the gaping hole of a loved one who is gone. I've made it my life's work to make sure that fewer people have to wake up every day and experience that. Background checks save lives. It's time we pass a law requiring them on every sale.","The CNN Guns Project explores the role of guns in the United States .

"(CNN) -- Views on marijuana are shifting, but nearly everywhere, it is too early to talk about substantive changes to drug policies. Not so in Uruguay. The small South American country is poised to become the first nation to legalize and regulate the production, sale and consumption of weed. This would place Uruguay at the vanguard of liberal drug policies, surpassing even The Netherlands, where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place. The bill, which was passed by Uruguay's Chamber of Deputies and will be taken up by the Senate, attempts to answer the questions that inevitably arise when debating drug policy: How will marijuana be regulated? Who will grow it? How can the country avoid cannabis tourism? The Uruguayan government offers specific proposals for how to manage a legal market for marijuana. The government supports the marijuana bill and says it was designed to resolve issues particular to Uruguay. But the model the bill proposes will undoubtedly be studied by other countries that grapple with the similar questions. Why Uruguay, why now? There is a contradiction in Uruguayan law, the secretary-general of the country's National Committee on Drugs, said: Consumption of marijuana has been legal, but its production and sale are not. ""We seek to eliminate that incongruence,"" Julio Calzada told CNN. The other tenets of the marijuana bill are to treat the use of weed as a health issue and to make a distinction between dangerous drug traffickers and consumers. The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said. The decision to push legislation to overhaul its drug policies did not come overnight. ""We have reflected on our problems,"" Calzada said, and the government felt that Uruguay's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue. President Jose Mujica's Broad Front coalition has a majority in the Senate, making passage of the marijuana bill likely when the chamber considers it in October. Then, Mujica has said, he will sign it into law. However, the progress that the bill has made is at odds with what polls say is the will of the people. According to a CIFRA/Gonzalez, Raga and Associates poll in July, 63% of Uruguayan respondents said they disagreed with the bill. Only 26% said they approved. The poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 Uruguayans and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, is not much different from earlier polls published when the bill was proposed. ""The government does not overlook the polls and public opinion,"" Calzada said, but the government believes it is in the best interest of the country to go forward with the bill. It is not the executive branch, but the Congress that will pass the law, and voters will decide in the next elections whether to ""punish"" the ruling party for going against public sentiment, he said. The model . The marijuana bill could be modified by the Senate, but as it is currently written, it provides several paths for the legal production and sale of marijuana, while increasing health education about the risks of drug abuse. In short, the proposed law states that the planting, cultivating, harvesting and selling of marijuana remain illegal but adds a long list of exceptions to that rule. Households may grow up to six plants and harvest a maximum of 480 grams of weed per year. Another avenue would be the creation of ""membership clubs"" made up of between 15 and 45 people, who can grow up to 99 marijuana plants. These growing operations must be licensed by the government, and the pot will be sold to the public through pharmacies, which also will be licensed to do so. Those who grow or sell marijuana outside of these government-licensed options will be subject to prosecution and could face prison terms of 20 months to 10 years. The bill calls for the creation of a new government body -- the Institute of Regulation and Control of Cannabis -- that would be in charge of the licensing and any sanctions for noncompliance. The institute would also oversee a registry of all marijuana buyers that would be designed to ensure that those who buy marijuana are at least 18 years old and residents of Uruguay. This requirement is also meant to deter cannabis tourism to the country. The bill also instructs the health system to provide educational programs about the risks of drug use at all levels of schooling. Any direct or indirect advertising for marijuana in any media would be prohibited. A grand experiment . The government studied drug policies in many countries where marijuana is decriminalized or tolerated, but the bill that has garnered international attention was not designed to be copied. It is tailored for the problems that Uruguay faces, Calzada said. Rising drug violence ""has impacted daily life in our country,"" and regulating the market could be a solution, he said. If it becomes law, the new marijuana regulation will put Uruguay at odds with many countries that continue to pursue an aggressive policy of prohibition. But conversations about rethinking marijuana laws have sprung up in Latin America and elsewhere, and Uruguay is prepared to take any heat about its decision, Calzada said.","Uruguay is close to legalizing and regulating marijuana .
If the bill becomes law, it will allow the production and sale of weed .
The proposal is specific for Uruguay, but the model will be of interest to other countries .
The government is pushing for the bill, which polls show the public is against ."
"(CNN) -- Got that winter coat out? Keep it out, because icy cold is here to stay for about a week. That freeze blast last week -- it got refueled with another round of arctic air. And it's creeping toward the Northeast and down to the Deep South, northern Texas, and the desert Southwest, the National Weather Service says. It will get at least as cold this week in Memphis, Tennessee -- which should see a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit overnight Monday -- as in Albany, New York, where the low will hit 16 the next night. Single digits are striking this week as far south as Tupelo, Mississippi -- 9 degrees overnight Monday. And low temperatures in the teens litter a large part of the country's weather map on a few nights. Daytime highs won't bring much relief, not even in the Southeast, where they should be 25-30 degrees below normal, the weather service said. Snow . The front is expected to lay down snow from parts of Kentucky through New York State, and freezing rain from Tennessee to the lower Midwest and parts of Maine. Some places in the Plains, Midwest and Great Lakes could see 4-6 inches of snow, CNN meteorologists said. The western side of Michigan could get up to 8 inches. But this blast won't be the snow maker the last one was. The freeze should let up before the end of the week for the southern parts of the country, but not for most of the rest. By Wednesday, most of the eastern two thirds of the country will rebound to only 15 degrees below the seasonal average. SoCal wildfire weather . If you're in Southern California, it will feel like you live in a parallel universe to the rest of the country. Conditions will be ripe for wildfires. Yes, possibly wildfires in November. Highs in the 70s, perhaps up to 80 degrees, and dry, gusty winds are behind it. They will sap the air of moisture, and if a spark ignites, they could push the flames across the landscape. Wind and warmth will ""contribute to extreme fire behavior,"" the weather service said, which issued a red flag warning, the highest alert. The state's wildfire fighting authority Cal Fire has put more firefighters on duty. It has also asked that residents not mow dry grass, pull a vehicle over onto it, toss cigarette butts on it -- and not to target shoot in undesignated areas, especially not at metal targets, which could make sparks fly.","In Southern California, they're on wildfire watch with warm, dry winds .

"(CNN) -- Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder and attempted murder in the beheading of a 54-year-old woman last week at his former workplace in Oklahoma and in the stabbing attack on another woman, said Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn. Nolen was also charged with a third felony, assault with a deadly weapon, the prosecutor said. The attempted murder charge is also called assault and battery with a deadly weapon, Mashburn said. ""It is highly likely I will seek the death penalty in this case,"" he said, adding that he would first consult with the victim's family before making his decision. Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, is accused of carrying out the attacks Thursday at a Vaughan Foods processing plant soon after he learned he'd lost his job there. Nolen was trying ""to get revenge on certain people he felt responsible"" for his job loss, Mashburn said. The large kitchen knife used in the attack came from Nolen's home, Mashburn said. The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen ""was saying Arabic terms in the attack,"" Mashburn said. Nolen's Facebook page uses the name Jah'Keem Yisrael. The cover photo appears to be of fighters holding weapons. The postings include all-caps messages about Islam and quotations from the Quran. Gov. Mary Fallin called the attack ""an act of cowardice, brutality and barbarism."" The Oklahoma Department of Homeland Security is also investigating the incident. ""That investigation is still ongoing, and it is unclear at this time whether the crime was an act of terrorism, workplace violence or a gruesome combination of both,"" Fallin said in a statement. The attack . Police said Nolen walked into the Vaughan Foods front office Thursday and attacked one of the first people he encountered, Colleen Hufford, 54. He severed her head with a knife and then attacked Traci Johnson, 43. Johnson was one of three people Nolen was targeting, authorities said, and he wasn't able to reach the other two. Hufford was attacked despite not being one of the three intended targets, the prosecutor said. Court papers said Nolen grabbed Hufford from behind and ""immediately began cutting her across the throat with the large knife, with a back and forth sawing motion."" Nolen then grabbed Johnson and ""cut her across the throat and left side of her face with the knife"" in an attempt at a second beheading, according to a police affidavit. See copy of court papers and police affidavit . Mashburn said that while Nolen was employed at the plant, he made statements ""saying he didn't like white people,"" which prompted Johnson to file a complaint with the plant's human resources department. The 'local hero' Mark Vaughan, the company CEO and a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office, confronted and twice shot Nolen, authorities said. Vaughan arrived at the plant with a rifle and shot Nolen as he was charging with knife in hand, Mashburn said. Nolen is now hospitalized, Mashburn said. Fallin called Vaughan ""a local hero ... whose whose response saved at least one life and possibly saved others."" ""Mark's actions also serve as a reminder that the rights outlined in the Second Amendment, which protect the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry weapons, save lives,"" the governor added. In unrelated incidents, Nolen was convicted of assault and battery on a police officer, escape from detention and possession of marijuana, all in January 2011, according to court papers filed by prosecutors. CNN's Javier de Diego contributed to this report.","Governor says it's unclear whether attack was terrorism, job violence or both .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's dictator is still missing. Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public since early September, and on Friday he missed the symbolically important anniversary of the Korean Workers' Party. This absence has fueled speculation that there is political intrigue afoot in Pyongyang -- possibly even a coup. No one outside of North Korea really knows what's happening -- including, almost certainly, America's troubled $50+ billion-per-year intelligence bureaucracy. But it seems likely that the corpulent potentate, who exhibited a limp before disappearing, is recovering from some kind of physical problem. Making a rare allusion to the young tyrant's health, a government mouthpiece reportedly venerated Kim in September as a man ""who keeps lighting the path for the people, like the flicker of a flame, despite suffering discomfort."" Alas, the third supreme leader of the Kim dynasty, who has ruthlessly eliminated potential rivals including his own uncle, may now see eliminating calories as the more pressing necessity for regime survival. But the speculation and concern in Washington and allied capitals over the cloistering of Kim is noteworthy in itself. It reveals a lack of political intelligence of any real value on the regime. In turn, this lapse should remind us that inherently unstable, nuclear-armed North Korea could someday put Northeast Asia into crisis without any warning. Is Kim Jong Un's sister in charge? Professing renewed concern, North Korea's foreign enablers seem eager to reprise a remedy that has failed repeatedly before: six-party talks. That dialogue, pursued intermittently in the previous decade, was intended to eliminate Pyongyang's nuclear program -- a goal to which the reclusive state agreed. Twice. But three separate nuclear tests showed that the talks clearly failed. North Korea pocketed copious foreign aid and relief from sanctions, China got to play the diplomatic grande dame of the region, Russia showed up and Japan got ignored. Beijing and Moscow would now like a repeat performance. At the U.N. last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that ""the six-party talks remain the only viable and effective way to resolve the nuclear issue."" A week later in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with his North Korean counterpart and declared, ""the talks today confirmed that resuming the six-party talks is possible."" Why has North Korea decided to talk now? Washington and Seoul have yet to take the bait, but you can rest assured that the foreign policy establishments in both towns will urge them along. Perhaps seeking to jumpstart this encouragement, North Korea unexpectedly sent a very senior delegation to South Korea last week, and agreed to resume formal reconciliation talks between the two nations. Those talks are perennially ineffective, but they are like catnip to experts convinced that North Korea can be tamed with the right combination of words and goodies. There is another way to handle North Korea, which involves putting sustained pressure on the regime. China always says it is willing to take this step, but in fact never does -- and never will as long as China itself is run by a cabal that is terrified of the will of its own people. The government that will not now tolerate the modicum of Chinese democracy it previously agreed to in Hong Kong certainly does not want freedom advancing up the Korean Peninsula to its doorstep -- the precise outcome of a regimen of pressuring of Pyongyang that Washington, Tokyo, and Seoul ought to pursue. The blossoming freedom movement in Hong Kong actually offers a guide. In a moving letter to his fellow Hong Kong students, a young Chinese man wrote: ""Looking back at us mainlanders, not only do we seldom care about Hong Kong issues, we barely understand our own. ... ""We don't know that it's possible to ask, 'What do we want?' "" ""I understand the fear behind your courage. If you don't do anything now, the day will come that you are going to be just another me. Honestly, this is my fear too."" The young man's eyes were opened forever -- made possible in part by a temporary escape from the repression and media censorship of his home. People like him become the fundaments of a world that is freer and safer. This type of liberation should come as no surprise: It is the reason that free nations broadcast uncensored news and other media into the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War. These broadcasts and other cultural tools, combined with real economic, military, and political pressure, ended that conflict favorably for the side of freedom. So it can be with North Korea. U.S. governmental broadcasting today is in irreversible collapse, but the free world can give greater support to North Korean defectors and others who comprise a nascent uncensored media for those left behind. The Koreans who have undertaken this effort on a shoestring budget over the past decade have proven its effectiveness. These free journalists have been effective getting information into and out of North Korea, which is why the Pyongyang regime despises and targets them. In turn, this creates more North Koreans whose eyes are open -- who, like the Chinese student, now realize they should be able to ask, ""What do we want?"" Fundamentally, we need a policy of truth for North Korea: . Help North Koreans get the truth. Grasp the truth that China will never seriously help the free world with North Korea. Accept the truth that six-party talks would fail again. Embrace the idea that the truth will set people free.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hasn't been seen in public for more than a month .

"(CNN) -- A newly discovered Facebook bug may have inadvertently compromised the contact information of 6 million users, the company says. The bug, which has since been repaired, was part of the Download Your Information tool, which lets Facebook users export all the data from profiles, such as posts to their timeline and conversations with friends. People using the tool may have downloaded inadvertently the contact information for people they were somehow connected to. Some people upload their contact lists or address books to Facebook, which the company then uses to suggest new friends they can connect with who are already using the service. Though the number of people impacted is sizable, the actual spread of their contact information appears to be limited. The phone numbers and e-mail addresses were not exposed to developers or posted publicly. It is only shown to people they had at least a tentative connection with, and who may have already had their contact information. Even in that pool, it was only exposed to people who had used the data-exporting tool. ""For almost all of the email addresses or telephone numbers impacted, each individual email address or telephone number was only included in a download once or twice.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's move to abolish re-education through labor camps -- under which tens of thousands have been imprisoned without trial -- may be no more than a cosmetic change, a new report from Amnesty International warns. The human rights group says that while labor camps are being shut, research suggested that authorities are expanding the use of ""black jails,"" enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and ""brainwashing centers"" to take their place. ""There is a very real risk that the Chinese authorities will abolish one system of arbitrary detention only to expand the use of other types,"" the report said. A spokesman from China's Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the Amnesty report. Corinna-Barbara Francis, Amnesty International's China researcher, said the abolishment may only be a ""cosmetic change just to avert the public outcry over the abusive re-education through labor system."" China said on November 15 that it would close its labor camps after earlier putting the policy under review, with the move hailed as the biggest change to China's criminal justice system in decades. Detention without trial . The system was set up in 1950s and allows police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves, prostitutes and drug addicts -- for up to four years without a trial. According to China's Ministry of Justice, the country had 351 labor camps at the end of 2012, with more than 50,000 inmates. Other estimates have put the number of detainees much higher. The ""re-education process"" has also been used to punish those detained for their political, religious or personal beliefs -- such as members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement or petitioners with complaints against local officials, Amnesty said. Torture is said to be rife at the camps. Detainees have told Amnesty International they were beaten, sometimes with electric batons, denied food, subjected to simulated drowning, injected with unknown drugs and subjected to the ""rack"" torture."" Brainwashing centers . The report said interviews with petitioners and Falun Gong practitioners revealed abuses were continuing despite the closure of the camps. Some labor camps were being re-labeled as drug rehabilitation centers and released detainees were being sent to black jails -- unofficial detention centers set up in places like hotels or abandoned buildings -- or ""brainwashing centers,"" another form of arbitrary detention. Falun Gong practitioner Zhang Zhi told Amnesty International she was released from a labor camp in Harbin in June 2013 but on her release staff from a brainwashing center were waiting for her at the gate. Her family were able to intervene and prevented her from being taken away. She has since gone into hiding. ""The Chinese authorities must immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention and ensure that laws protecting detainees are brought into line with international human rights standards,"" Francis said. ""This needs to be a fundamental change in the policies that are at the root of the repression and which strip detainees of their most basic rights.""","Amnesty says China's move to abolish labor camps may be a cosmetic change .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told CNN he believes there is no on-field racism in football and that players who think they have been abused should simply say ""this is a game."" The head of world soccer insisted FIFA had been tireless in their efforts to combat the specter of racism in football but suggested any player who is abused during a game should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on. The football authorities in England are currently dealing with two high-profile allegations of player-on-player racism, involving Chelsea and England captain John Terry and Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez. Both players deny the claims. When asked by CNN World Sport anchor Pedro Pinto if racism exists on the field of play Blatter said: ""I would deny it. Blatter comments spark Twitter fury . ""There is no racism, there is maybe one of the players towards the other, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one, but also the one who is affected by that, he should say it's a game, we are in a game. ""At the end of the game, we shake hands, this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination."" This year has also seen allegations of high-profile racism by fans. Former Brazil defender Robert Carlos walked off the pitch during a Russian league match after a banana was thrown at him from the stands, while the Malaysian Football Association was forced to apologize to Chelsea in July when their Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun was subject to racial slurs during a pre-season encounter.

On Wednesday the English Football Association (FA) announced they had charged Liverpool player Suarez over a clash with Manchester United's Patrice Evra during an English Premier League match in October. Evra alleged the Uruguayan had aimed racial taunts at him -- a claim Suarez denies. In a statement on their official web site the FA said Suarez is alleged to have used abusive language towards his opponent, including ""a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race"" of Evra. London's Metropolitan Police is investigating allegations that Terry racially abused Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during an English Premier League match last month. Terry denies the allegations. In his interview with CNN, Blatter, who was re-elected unopposed as the head of world football despite allegations of corruption surrounding the voting process for the right to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, championed his organization's commitment to tackling racism. ""I think the whole world is aware of the efforts we are making against racism and discrimination,"" he added. ""And, on the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct, but then at the end of the game, the game is over and you have the next game where you can behave better."" Blatter's comments provoked an immediate response within soccer. Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, brother of Anton, took to Twitter to say: ""Tell me I have just read Sepp Blatter's comments on racism in football wrong .... if not then I am astonished. ""I feel stupid for thinking that football was taking a leading role against racism ..... it seems it was just on mute for a while."" The 'Kick It Out' campaign, who work to eradicate racism from football in England and Europe, said Blatter's comments were ""worryingly out of touch."" A statement from Blatter was later posted on FIFA's official web site, in which he sought to clarify his comments. It read: ""I would like to make it very clear, I am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination in football and in society. ""My comments have been misunderstood. What I wanted to express is that, as football players, during a match, you have ""battles"" with your opponents, and sometimes things are done which are wrong. ""But, normally, at the end of the match, you apologize to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match, you shake hands, and when the game is over, it is over. Anyone who has played a football match, or a match in any sport, knows that this is the case. ""Having said that, I want to stress again that I do not want to diminish the dimension of the problem of racism in society and in sport. I am committed to fighting this plague and kicking it out of football.""","Sepp Blatter tells CNN World Sport's Pedro Pinto there is no on-field racism in football .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Thruway Authority could have done a better job in dealing with a snowstorm that caused accidents and shut down a section of interstate highway near Buffalo, New York, an agency spokesman said Friday. The agency is reviewing emergency procedures after hundreds of snowbound motorists were left stranded along a seven-mile stretch of Interstate 90, agency spokesman R.W. Groneman said. ""We tried to contact stranded motorists,"" he said. ""We tried to bring them water and nutrition."" Authorities used plows and all-terrain vehicles to clear the road and provide food, water and gas to those stuck, and even busing stranded motorists to a senior center-turned-shelter in suburban Cheektowaga. Groneman said the agency is searching for ways it could have prevented additional motorists from joining the gridlocked section of the highway, which was closed for more than 24 hours. ""We're looking for a better way to do that, by putting up barriers and reaching out to them,"" Groneman said. The highway reopened at 6 a.m. Friday. More lake-effect snow fell on parts of upstate New York Friday, forecasters said, as residents continued digging out from the storm that left some 6-foot-high snow drifts in its wake. The National Weather Service said more than 2 feet of snow fell over the past two days in a band south and east of Buffalo, with 3 feet or more in a narrow area at the center of that band. ""When the snow first hit, I could barely get a mile from my house,"" said Buffalo resident Martha Bouquin. ""It's better now because the snow plows are in action."" Orchard Park resident Audra Wells said she can drive on roads once rendered impassable. ""Yesterday, we couldn't even open our door,"" she said. While packing a punch, the storm was hardly a record-setter: More than 76 inches of snow fell in Buffalo in late December 2001, including 35.4 inches in a single 24-hour period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""Normally we get several of these a year, but more down south in what we call ski country,"" said National Weather Center meteorologist Judy Levan in Buffalo, New York. ""The impact of this storm was that is was over the metro areas, which caused some of the problems."" Snowbound motorist and Lake Erie resident Lynsey Branch said she had been traveling to Buffalo in an effort buy groceries and Christmas presents when she was stopped by gridlocked highways and mounting snow drifts, trapping her in her car for more than 24 hours. ""They dug me out just around 9:30 last night,"" Branch said. ""We had gone over to Buffalo Wednesday night to go shopping. ...""That's how bad the lake effect is."" Branch said ""the whole situation could have been dealt with a lot better,"" adding that there was little communication between trapped motorists and state emergency workers. ""Every time we asked a question (of New York State Police officers) there was no concrete answer,"" she said. ""They were dancing around all the questions we asked them."" The National Weather Service said several inches of snow would accumulate around Lake Ontario on Friday, with lake-effect snow showers tapering off Friday evening. It was ""just too much in too short of a time,"" Bob Hill, who offered his plow to help Thursday, told CNN affiliate WVIB. Shifting winds from an east-moving front combined with record-breaking warm water temperatures in Lake Erie to create the intense early December storm, meteorologists said. Frank Rodriguez, 22, whose office backs up to the once-clogged highway, said people -- including a few truck drivers wearing only T-shirts as they waded through 2 1/2f feet of snow -- had been scaling fences all day to get food and find warmth. He said the interstate was ""completely dead"" most of Thursday. Ironically, his hometown of Grand Island, 11 miles north of Buffalo, had minimal snow. ""It was kind of weird -- it was almost like a blanket"" covering some spots and not others a few miles away, Rodriguez said. That disparity is common with lake-effect snow, with official advisories warning about rapidly changing conditions and noting that ""the weather can vary from locally heavy snow in narrow bands to clear skies just a few miles away.""

"Washington (CNN) -- David Austin is one of the few outsiders who has seen firsthand how people live in the North Korean countryside, and he describes a population ""lethargic"" from malnutrition. Just two weeks ago, he visited an orphanage as part of his work as the North Korea program director for the relief organization Mercy Corps. He said the last protein children had eaten was in January -- eggs. ""That tells us not only are they not getting a balanced diet but in terms of the rations, they're getting only about 60% of what a child needs,"" he said. Austin describes widespread severe malnourishment and ""an entire generation"" that is ""stunted physically, developmentally because of chronic malnutrition."" No sign of North Korean rocket launch . According to Austin, in seven visits since 2007, he has been to dozens of orphanages and hospitals and more than 19 private homes. He says he is troubled that the United States plans to call off a massive shipment of food aid as a result of the anticipated rocket launch by North Korea between now and Monday. Pyongyang insists that the rocket is necessary to put a weather satellite in orbit, but Washington and Seoul consider it a ballistic missile test in disguise. Such launches by North Korea breach U.N. Security Council resolutions. Under a recent food deal with the United States, North Korea agreed to refrain from long range missile launches and nuclear tests. In exchange, the United States would provide what Austin described as a year's worth of corn-soy porridge mixed with vegetable oil for children younger than 10 and pregnant women. The food ""wouldn't taste delicious but it saves lives,"" Austin said, noting that it would have helped 2.4 million people. At the White House, President Barack Obama's aides suggest their hands are tied after Pyongyang announced the launch just weeks after the food deal was agreed. The North Koreans' ""blatant disregard for their commitments makes it impossible for the United States to provide the nutritional assistance that it had hoped to provide for the North Korean people,"" said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. Some observers have doubts about the White House's approach. ""I have real questions about whether we should have linked humanitarian food assistance to the nuclear missile program in the first place,"" said Mike Green, who was senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council during the Bush administration. ""It is not the fault of the average North Korean who needs the food, who is at starvation level, that the regime is developing nuclear missiles."" He said the threatened missile launch was a ""provocation that should have been predictable."" But Green acknowledged that if the North Koreans flaunt the deal, sending the food ""would be a political liability for the administration at home, and it would look weak internationally."" Austin of Mercy Corps was careful not to criticize the Obama administration. But he did say the administration had previously made it clear it would send food to North Korea if there was a verified need for that aid. ""We know there is a need and we know we can met the need. As a humanitarian organization we are saying there is an opportunity to do that,"" Austin said. ""I don't want to assign blame. But I'm saying there is an opportunity to engage positively and constructively with a group of people the White House describes as innocent and starving, and we can do that.""","An aid worker describes widespread chronic malnutrition in the countryside .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Crews struggling to bring the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant under control had some success Sunday as cooling systems at two of the facility's reactors were working, Kyodo News reported. Earlier, workers had connected electric cables needed to power up cooling systems in the damaged reactors. The plan is to get power up and running for the Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 reactors soon. Officials with plant owner Tokyo Electric and Power Company told CNN that the company still has to conduct safety and stability checks on the circuit before throwing the switch. Cooling systems at the Numbers 5 and 6 reactors -- the least-troublesome of the group -- have already been restored, Kyodo News said. The cooling systems are essential to keep temperatures low, curb the further emission of radioactive material and, in a worst-case scenario, prevent a full nuclear meltdown. A meltdown could occurs when nuclear fuel rods get so hot that they melt the steel and concrete structure containing them, spilling out into the air and water with potentially deadly results. But there is no guarantee that the cooling systems will work. ""We do not know if the water pumps are damaged and if they will still work when power is restored,"" said Graham Andrew, a special assistant to the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Meanwhile, authorities set up a new system using an unmanned device that sprayed seawater continuously on the No. 3 reactor's overheating spent nuclear fuel pool. A Tokyo fire department official said the system began operating around 2 p.m. Saturday and can spray water for up to seven hours at a time. Previously, firefighters, soldiers and electric company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure. The water, pumped from a nearby port and then funneled to the system, was directed at the No. 3 reactor's spent fuel pool in order to cool it and prevent the emission of more radioactive material into the atmosphere. Authorities have also started spraying the No. 4 reactor. The news comes soon after the Japanese government considered halting the sale of food from farms near the Fukushima plant after abnormally high levels of radiation were found in milk and spinach. Very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine were also detected in tap water in Tokyo and most prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi plant damaged by last week's monster earthquake and tsunami. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said levels of radiation exceeding safety limits stipulated by Japanese law were found in some samples of spinach and milk from the Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures but authorities said the radioactive iodine-contaminated food posed little risk. Tainted milk was found 30 kilometers (18 1/2 miles) from the plant and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers (65 miles) to the south, almost halfway to Tokyo. ""Though radioactive iodine has a short half-life of about eight days and decays naturally within a matter of weeks, there is a short-term risk to human health if radioactive iodine in food is absorbed into the human body,"" warned the International Atomic Energy Agency. A person who consumed the tainted food continuously for a year would take in the same amount of radiation as a single CT scan, Edano said. That's about 7 millisieverts or double what an average person in an industrialized country is exposed to in a year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Beyond Saturday's food safety announcement, there have been few indications of any immediate fallout from the nuclear crisis. Airborne radiation levels around Japan have shown no signs of spiking drastically, according to measurements posted online Saturday by the nation's education and science ministry. Most readings showed detectable but relatively small amounts of radiation. Even the two top readings in Mito (in Ibaraki prefecture) and Utsonomiya (in Toshigi prefecture) are well below what's considered dangerous to humans and had fallen in recent days. Still, no one has said that authorities are in the clear. In fact, authorities acknowledged Friday that the situation is far more serious than they'd originally estimated. ""We sincerely apologize ... for causing such a great concern and nuisance,"" said a statement from Masataka Shimizu, the president of Tokyo Electric. And the company's managing director, Akio Komori, broke down in a tears after leaving a news conference in Fukushima at which exposure levels were discussed. Six members of the emergency crew at the plant have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation per hour, the equivalent of getting 10 chest X-rays per hour, Tokyo Electric Power Company said. The utility said the workers were exposed when trying to restore electricity to the stricken reactors in hopes of using the cooling systems again. Tokyo Electric had raised the exposure level for emergency workers from its previous standard of 100 millisieverts per hour to 250 millisieverts. People are naturally exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year. The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends no more than 50 millisieverts exposure in a given year for nuclear rescue and recovery workers. It offers no restriction in a crisis when ""the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer's risk.""

"(CNN) -- Having trouble hearing the dialogue in ""Interstellar""? You're not the only one. But that's the point, says director Christopher Nolan. ""Many of the filmmakers I've admired over the years have used sound in bold and adventurous ways,"" Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue."" ""Interstellar"" has been the subject of chatter about its layered sound design, which occasionally buries dialogue from the actors underneath sound effects and Hans Zimmer's sometimes booming score. One IMAX theater even posted a notice: ""Please note that all our sound equipment is functioning properly. Christopher Nolan mixed the soundtrack with an emphasis on the music. This is how it is intended to sound."" One viewer -- who saw the movie in a renowned Los Angeles theater -- told Billboard magazine, ""I noticed right away that there were parts where the music totally obliterates the dialogue."" Naturally, Twitter was all over it. ""Breaking! Christopher Nolan breaks silence on INTERSTELLAR sound issues: 'I don't care about dialogue!' "" wrote Kevin Carr. ""Christopher Nolan doesn't think INTERSTELLAR's sound issues are issues at all. What? WE SAID, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN..."" chimed The Dissolve. Nolan's sound design has come under fire -- and mockery -- before. The ""WHOOM"" of ""Inception"" became so well known that it even inspired a Web page. Nolan, who visits theaters in advance of his films' official release to make sure the audio is up to snuff, says he hasn't heard of any problems. ""The theaters I have been at have been doing a terrific job in terms of presenting the film in the way I intended,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""Broadly speaking, there is no question when you mix a film in an unconventional way as this, you're bound to catch some people off guard, but hopefully people can appreciate the experience for what it's intended to be.""

"(CNN) -- For the first time in decades, voters in Georgia are going to the polls Tuesday without the chance of having Justice Department observers inside their polling places. CNN has learned that's because Justice Department lawyers in recent months have determined they no longer have legal authority to unilaterally assign poll observers after the Supreme Court ruling invalidating key sections of the Voting Rights Act. The department has suspended posting observers inside polling stations except for in nine jurisdictions in seven states covered by separate court orders, government officials said. The internal legal finding hadn't been made public before. Observers had the authority to be inside polling places, and the department may still send monitors who keep an eye outside polling precincts. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department's civil rights division declined to comment. The department has been sending election-day poll observers and monitors to some Georgia counties since at least 1966, a year after the landmark civil rights law authorized it. The observers were there to document any interference or intimidation against voters, usually racial minorities in areas with a history of discrimination. At last count, the Justice Department said it sent personnel to observe and monitor elections in 153 counties and parishes in 11 states. Proponents of the poll watching say it helps prevent irregularities and has been useful to ensure federal voting rights are protected for minorities. The department didn't send anyone to monitor last month's Mississippi primary, which has been much disputed by losing tea party-aligned candidate Chris McDaniel. Incumbent victor Sen. Thad Cochran drew black Democratic Party voters to help defeat McDaniel in the GOP primary. McDaniel has alleged voting irregularities, but Mississippi judges have rebuffed his claims. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, under which the Justice Department compelled oversight of voting law changes in a patchwork of jurisdictions in states around the country. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has criticized the ruling and has urged Congress to pass new legislation to restore the Justice Department's oversight powers.","FIRST ON CNN: Feds determine they don't have authority to assign poll observers .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps The New York Times' T Magazine should have had Stephen Hawking interview Jaden and Willow Smith. Or the Dalai Lama. In a sort-of philosophical, sort-of promotional interview, the two children of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith talked about the flexibility of time, the feeling of the Pacific Coast Highway and, well, some new music. The interview attracted wide notice on social media, where the general reaction was, ""Huh?"" ""Have you guys read this bizarre Jaden & Willow Smith interview?"" asked Linda Ikeji. ""Every single thing about this Jaden and Willow Smith interview is nuts,"" Gawker observed. At the least, the 16-year-old Jaden and his 14-year-old sister did provide some fodder for interesting holiday party conversations. Here are five things we learned from the interview: . They have a fluid grasp of time. Jaden said he's reading about quantum physics; Willow said she's been immersed in ""ancient texts."" The works have obviously made an impression, since they both talked about how time is relative. ""Time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please, and that's how I know it doesn't exist,"" said Willow. ""It's proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe. It's relative to beings and other places,"" added Jaden, who noted there is ""a theoretical physicist inside all of our minds."" They separate themselves from their minds. If Roger Penrose is living in the Smiths' minds, they're trying to keep their distance. Willow said she's gotten better at ""caring less what everybody else thinks, but also caring less and less about what your own mind thinks, because what your own mind thinks, sometimes, is the thing that makes you sad."" Jaden agreed. ""Your mind has a duality to it. So when one thought goes into your mind, it's not just one thought, it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain. When you're thinking about something happy, you're thinking about something sad."" Creativity, he observed, ""comes from a place of oneness. ... And you can't listen to your mind in those times -- it'll tell you what you think and also what other people think."" They've been creative for years. Despite their youth, the Smith children have been active in the arts for awhile. Jaden has appeared in a handful of movies; Willow had a hit single with ""Whip My Hair"" in 2010, which came out just before she turned 10. But that's not the half of it, said Jaden. ""Willow's been writing her own novels since she was 6,"" he said. There's a reason for that, said Willow. ""There're no novels that I like to read so I write my own novels, and then I read them again, and it's the best thing,"" she observed. They don't care what you think. Even as they focus their own minds on oneness, they're making sure others' criticism doesn't intrude. ""Willow just dropped a song ('Cares'), let me quote the lyrics: 'I do not care what people say,' "" said Jaden. ""We both don't really care."" Part of the point, he added, is to keep others -- and themselves -- on their toes. ""The only way to change something is to shock it. If you want your muscles to grow, you have to shock them,"" he said. ""If you want society to change, you have to shock them."" The pair have big plans, they said. Besides making music, writing novels, being inspired by the Pacific Coast Highway and trying to get an ""authentic"" education (""you never learn anything in school,"" said Jaden), the siblings have an eye firmly on the future. ""I have a goal to be just the most craziest person of all time,"" said Jaden. ""And when I say craziest, I mean, like, I want to do like Olympic-level things."" ""I think by the time we're 30 or 20, we're going to be climbing as many mountains as we can possibly climb,"" Willow added. Go get 'em, kids.","Jaden and Willow Smith give philosophical interview to NYT T Magazine .

"Elbow Beach, Bermuda (CNN) -- Winds and rain associated with Hurricane Igor lashed Bermuda on Sunday ahead of the storm's arrival, forecasters said, as the island braced for a potential direct hit. The official weather-observing site on Bermuda reported sustained winds of 54 mph (87 kph) with a gust to 67 mph (107 kph), the National Hurricane Center said. A gust of 89 mph (143 kph) was earlier reported at an elevated observation site. As of 8 p.m. ET Sunday, Igor's center was about 60 miles (95 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda and moving north at about 14 mph (22 kph). The storm was a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), and forecasters said its intensity was not expected to diminish before it approached Bermuda. Igor was also very large, forecasters said -- hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 90 miles (150 kilometers) from the center and tropical storm-force winds outward up to 345 miles (555 kilometers). As of Sunday afternoon, CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf in Bermuda said the island was being battered by wind gusts and experiencing heavy surf. The airport was closed, and the capital of Hamilton was ""a ghost town."" It was estimated that half of the island's 67,000 people had lost power, he said. Some roads were closed. The island will bear the brunt of Igor, particularly its most destructive northeast quadrant, regardless of whether the storm makes landfall, he said. It is hoped that not much structural damage would result, as Bermuda does ""an incredible job in terms of hurricane-proofing their structures,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. CNN iReporter Alyson Ritchie in Bermuda showed video of rough surf churning at Warwick Long Bay, Bermuda, ahead of the storm's arrival. Ritchie said she lives up the street from the bay, but her home's windows were taped and she has ""plenty of supplies"" on hand. Another iReporter, Claire Hattie, shot video of palm trees swaying in the wind from her balcony in Pembroke, Bermuda, Sunday morning. Hattie said she lives in a sheltered area, not near the water, so the effects might be worse closer to shore. The weather is ""steadily deteriorating,"" she said, but she is prepared. ""Most people have stayed indoors since last night,"" she said, adding that  ""driving conditions are very dangerous."" ""There is also some flying debris already so it's too dangerous to walk either,"" she said. ""All of our storm shutters are secured, the cupboards are stocked with tinned and boxed food, and the baths and jugs have been filled with water. There is really nothing more we can do at this point to prepare. We just have to wait it out and hope for the best."" The center of Igor is projected to pass over or near Bermuda Sunday night. Hurricane conditions are expected to continue throughout the evening, the hurricane center said. A hurricane warning was in effect. ""A direct hit would be the worst-case scenario, because the island would have to endure the extremely strong winds in the eye wall, as well as a dangerously high storm surge,"" CNN meteorologist Angela Fritz said. In order for a hurricane to make landfall, the center of its eye must come ashore, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. If the center does not come ashore, but the eye wall moves over the island, it would be considered a direct hit. ""Bermuda could experience the strongest winds without Igor ever making landfall,"" he said. ""It is also possible that Bermuda may not experience landfall or a direct hit."" The hurricane center did not offer an estimate for how high the storm surge is forecast to be, but said it will produce ""significant coastal flooding"" and will be accompanied by ""large and destructive waves,"" particularly on the southern coast. Igor is forecast to dump 6 to 9 inches of rain on the island. Meanwhile, large swells are expected to affect the East Coast of the United States through Monday. Swells will subside over the next couple of days in locations including the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hispaniola and portions of the Bahamas, forecasters said, but may cause dangerous surf and rip currents. Tracking maps show Igor remaining off the coast of the United States, possibly brushing the tip of Newfoundland, Canada, next week. Farther east in the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Julia continued spinning with considerably less threat to land than Hurricane Igor. As of 5 p.m. Sunday, a weakened Julia was located about 1,280 miles (2,055 kilometers) west of the Azores Islands. It was headed northeast at about 14 mph (22 kph). Its winds had decreased to 45 mph (75 mph). Additional weakening was expected, and Julia was forecast to dissipate by Tuesday, forecasters said.","It's estimated half of Bermuda's residents have lost power .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Security Agency spent Friday on the defensive, after details got out about an internal audit that found the agency had broken privacy rules ""thousands of times each year"" since 2008. The audit was first reported by the Washington Post on Thursday, setting off another round of heated discussion -- and criticism -- in Washington over how the NSA had wrongly impinged on Americans' privacy. ""I ... will continue to demand honest and forthright answers from the intelligence community,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, noting the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs will hold a hearing on the Post's revelations. ""I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA."" In a call with reporters Friday, John DeLong -- the NSA's director of compliance -- acknowledged ""mistakes occur,"" even as he insisted only a ""tiny"" amount of such problems were intentional. ""No one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK,"" DeLong said several times in the call, which a spokesman said was conducted to ""address inaccuracies."" NSA leaker Edward Snowden -- whose ongoing leaks have riled the Obama administration and intelligence community -- provided the material to the Post earlier this summer. The May 2012 audit found 2,776 incidents of ""unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications"" in the preceding 12 months, the Post reported in its story. ""Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure,"" said the Post article by reporter Barton Gellman. ""The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders."" Leahy was not the only lawmaker, nor the only member of President Barack Obama's Democratic party, to call for more oversight and hearings. ""Press reports that the National Security Agency broke privacy rules thousands of times per year and reportedly sought to shield required disclosure of privacy violations are extremely disturbing,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi called for ""rigorous oversight"" by Congress on the ""incidents of non-compliance."" Another Democrat from California, Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, told the Post in a statement late Thursday night that her committee ""can and should do more to independently verify that NSA's operations are appropriate, and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate."" The Washington Post reported that most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country. In one case, the NSA decided it didn't need to report the unintended surveillance. In 2008, a ""large number"" of calls placed from Washington were intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol's 202 area code for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt. The information came from a ""quality assurance"" review that wasn't distributed to the NSA overnight staff, according to the Post. Separately, an NSA new collection method went undiscovered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for months. The court, which has authority over some of the agency's operations, ruled it unconstitutional. Responding to the Post's story, the NSA said, ""A variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next."" Factors can include implementation of new procedures, technology or software changes and expanded access. ""The one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent, dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment, implement mitigation measures wherever possible, and drive the numbers down,"" the agency said. The agency released another statement Thursday night defending its programs. ""NSA's foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally,"" it said. ""When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it."" On Friday, DeLong said his agency ""detects and corrects mistakes"" as these occur and are identified, which stops them from being ""propagated."" ""The NSA has zero tolerance for misconduct,"" he said, noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases. Overall, DeLong insisted, the NSA carefully adheres to privacy protections. White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement Friday, saying the NSA compliance office's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people's privacy. ""The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,"" Earnest said. The man who leaked the audit to the Post, Snowden, stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks. NSA: We read .00004% of Web traffic . Although polling shows Americans harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs Snowden revealed, a majority of Americans don't approve of the actions he took and they think he, as an American citizen, should be brought to justice. A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52% of the public disapproved of Snowden's actions, while 44% said they approved of the leaks. Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks. As for the program Snowden revealed, there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics, with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans.

"(CNN) -- A man authorities say was part of a Brooklyn husband-and-wife identity theft team has been convicted of the murder of two of his three identity theft victims, prosecutors announced Thursday. A federal jury found Dmitriy Yakovlev, 43, guilty of the murders and identity thefts of Irina Malezhik and Viktor Alekseyev, the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn announced. The remains of Malezhik, a Russian-language translator who lived in Brooklyn and worked in the federal courts, were never found; Alekseyev disappeared in December 2005, and his body was found in New Jersey in 2006. Yakovlev was also found guilty of stealing the identity of a third Brooklyn resident, Michael Klein, who disappeared in November 2003. ""Today's verdicts is the result of years of hard work and dedicated investigation by a team of law enforcement officers committed to bringing the defendant to justice for his crimes,"" Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement on the verdict. She called Yakovlev's conviction ""a successful and satisfying conclusion."" Yakovlev faces a possible sentence of life in prison. No sentencing date has been set. In addition to the murders, Yakovlev was also found guilty of bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy charges in connection with the stealing of his victims' identities, the press release said. Yakovlev's wife, Julie Yakovlev, pleaded guilty earlier this year to identity theft charges and is currently out on bail pending her sentencing, said Robert Nardoza, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. She was not charged in connection with the slayings. The couple was originally charged in August 2009 with illegally using the identities of three people between 2003 and 2007. Their attorneys did not return phone calls seeking comment Thursday.","Dmitriy Yakovlev was accused of killing two people and stealing their identities .

"Washington (CNN) -- They tried in Congress, at the ballot box and in the Supreme Court, but Republicans have been unable to stop Obamacare. Now they have a new angle: suing President Barack Obama over changes in enforcing his signature health care reforms. House Speaker John Boehner framed the issue as a matter of presidential overreach when he announced the focus of the lawsuit on Thursday. ""In 2013, the President changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it,"" Boehner said in a statement. ""That's not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,"" he said. Obama and Democrats called that premise malarkey. ""You're going to sue me for doing my job? OK,"" the President told an applauding crowd Thursday in Austin, Texas, using the opportunity to take a jab at congressional dysfunction he blames on Republican obstruction. ""Think about that,"" Obama said. ""You're going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job while you don't do your job."" The issue blends constitutional debate on the balance of government powers with the partisan fervor of election-year politics. Here are some questions that help provide a deeper look: . 1) What's this all about, anyway? Obama and Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 with no Republican votes. Ever since, the political right has tried to derail the law nicknamed Obamacare, with affection by the President and derision by his foes. Conservatives despise the measure that requires Americans obtain health insurance as part of reforms intended to lower the overall cost of U.S. health care, calling it an unworkable government expansion. Lawsuits challenging it as unconstitutional wound their way through the appeals process to the Supreme Court, which ruled it legal in 2012. Republicans led by presidential nominee Mitt Romney ran against it that year, making repeal of Obamacare a major campaign promise. Voters re-elected Obama and kept Democrats in control of the Senate, while Republicans maintained their House majority. House Republicans have voted more than 40 times to repeal or dismantle the law, but their efforts never advanced in the Senate. Now Boehner and his GOP colleagues are focusing on Obama's 2013 decision to delay a provision in the health care law that requires employers with more than 50 workers provide them with health insurance. The so-called employer mandate originally was to take effect on January 1, but the administration's move put it off for a year to allow more time for the transition. Another revision in February further extended the mandate's phase-in. 2) Thanks, but what's it really about? Election-year politics, mostly. Republicans contend Obama has routinely expanded his executive powers through presidential orders and other actions that usurp the authority of Congress granted by the Constitution. As examples, they cite a decision to stop deporting some young undocumented immigrants, as well as the employer mandate revision. Until now, none of the grievances reached the level of a lawsuit by the GOP-controlled House against the President. Thursday's announcement of the Obamacare focus came less than four months before congressional elections that Republicans hope will generate a huge conservative turnout to hold their House majority and seize control of the Senate. Boehner denied any political motive, telling reporters ""it's not about Republicans versus Democrats."" ""This is about the legislative branch that's being disadvantaged by the executive branch,"" he said, adding: ""What we're talking about here are places where the President is basically rewriting law to make it fit his own needs."" On Friday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the move ""a taxpayer-funded political stunt"" that he said failed to reflect the nation's priorities. 3) So did Obama overreach? Depends to whom you talk. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told the House Judiciary Committee in December that delaying the employer mandate provision of the health care law ""crossed the constitutional line."" Noting the original start date for the mandate was ""a matter of considerable debate within Congress during deliberations,"" Turley said ""no express power"" existed for the President to change it. Not so, countered Simon Lazarus, senior counsel of the at the progressive-minded Constitutional Accountability Center. ""These critics fault the Obama administration for making necessary adjustments in timing and matching enforcement priorities with resources and practical, humanitarian and other exigencies,"" Lazarus told the same December hearing. ""But exercising presidential judgment in carrying laws into execution is precisely what the Constitution requires."" 4) Typical lawyers. Please make it simple for me. The question is whether Obama exercised more power than allowed in changing how the health care law works. Reihan Salam, a conservative CNN political commentator, noted the Supreme Court recently voted 9-0 against Obama over recess appointments he made without congressional approval. ""There are many people who agree that this president has gone too far in abusing his executive power,"" Salam said Friday. ""That's not about Democrats and Republicans. That's about our system of government."" Democrats point out the lawsuit challenges a presidential action similar to steps taken by Obama's predecessors, such as GOP President George W. Bush's waiving of penalties for impoverished senior citizens who missed the deadline for enrolling in Medicare Part D in 2006. ""Presidents get to deal with the implementation of these laws through the administrative process,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN Contributor Donna Brazile. Ironically, House Republicans voted last year to delay the employer mandate just like Obama eventually did, but they are now planning to challenge Obama for it in court. Senate Democrats never took up the matter because it would have reopened debate on the health care law as the administration prepared to fully implement it. Asked about such an apparent reversal, Republicans say they were right back then and now, because Congress -- not the President -- is supposed to make such a change. 5) So what happens next? The House Rules Committee will hold a hearing next week on the proposal to sue Obama, with the GOP-led panel expected to approve it. However, legal experts say challenges remain to getting the case before a judge. For example, House Republicans must establish legal standing to file such a lawsuit, which means proving that Obama's action harmed the legislature as an institution. Meanwhile, the partisan carping and finger-pointing will continue in Washington. CNN's Jim Acosta and Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.","House Republicans say they'll sue President Obama over his health care reforms .

"(CNN) -- It took five tries and almost 15 years, but there is no question that North Korea's successful launch of a satellite into orbit on December 11 is a major technological achievement. It is not, however, a serious military threat to the United States or other nations. North Korea still has a long way to go before they can turn the orbiting of a baby satellite, reportedly tumbling out of control, into the ability to threaten others at long distance with a nuclear weapon. If the past is any guide, North Korea's launch of an Unha-3 rocket will have international security repercussions far out of proportion to its military capability. North Korea's first attempt in launching a satellite in April 1998 under Kim Jong Il failed, but it triggered a panic in the U.S. Proponents of elaborate anti-missile weapons seized on the launch as proof that dictators of small, undeterrable countries could soon attack the U.S. with nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles. Read more: Why did North Korea launch a rocket? At the time, a commission chaired by Donald Rumsfeld made headlines with its warning that ""A nation with a well-developed, Scud-based ballistic missile infrastructure would be able to achieve first flight of a long-range missile, up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile range (greater than 5,500 kilometers), within about five years of deciding to do so."" North Korea and Iran had Scud-based missile infrastructures: They were clearly trying to do so. Fifteen years later, they have not come close to succeeding. But the warning achieved its purpose: Missile defense programs and budgets soared and have never come down. Our nation today spends about $10 billion a year on such programs, even though the threat never developed as predicted. We can expect similar warnings now that Kim Jong Un has done what his father never could. And this is the really tragic news. Success raises stakes for U.S. missile defense system . Governments meeting in emergency session in Seoul and Tokyo will have to produce more than statements of condemnation. They will likely support more anti-missile programs. The U.S., feeling the pressure from them and from defense hawks at home, may increase efforts to field more of the systems it is developing. We deploy about 30 ground-based interceptors in silos in Alaska and California. These systems have some ability to hit a long-range rocket, like the Unha-3 should it be turned into a missile and aimed at the U.S. Some in Congress will no doubt demand that we deploy more. We are fielding interceptors at sea aboard Aegis-class destroyers and cruisers that have some capability against short-range missiles, with plans to grow the program to longer-range missiles and deploy them in Eastern Europe. The U.S. Defense Department just recently approved arms sales to Japan to help that nation upgrade its Aegis anti-missile system. Pressures will mount to deploy more capable anti-missile systems in Asia. Read more: North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . China and Russia will almost certainly react to these deployments, believing that they are aimed at them, not North Korea or Iran. This will chill efforts to negotiate reductions in Cold War stockpiles of nuclear weapons. How can we reduce, they will ask, if the U.S. is racing to ring us with new weapons? There is no reason for this cycle of action and reaction. There is no threat that warrants the panicked deployment of untested and unreliable anti-missile weapons. As my colleague and North Korean expert Philip Yun notes, ""A successful launch was only a matter of time, and it shows a level of technical sophistication that was always there. We need to take North Korea seriously but not make it more than it really is."" I pointed out in 2009, after North Korea's third failed attempt, that the nation was a long way from having a nuclear-armed ICBM. That is still true after this successful launch. North Korea would have to achieve three additional breakthroughs. First, it would have to demonstrate the reliability of its launcher. The first four tests failed. This one succeeded. Will the next? Sometimes, you really do have to be a rocket scientist to answer questions like this. The one I consult is David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists. He writes, ""From past launches, we knew that North Korea has been able to build or buy working components for a rocket. The main difficulty is getting all the parts to work together and at the same time, given the enormous complexity of rockets. Even with this success, North Korea has no confidence in the reliability of the rocket, which undermines its utility for military purposes."" Second, it will have to develop a nuclear warhead small enough and reliable enough to fit on a missile. North Korea (unlike Iran) has twice tested nuclear devices, but these are believed to be too large and heavy for use in a warhead. North Korea would need several more nuclear tests to achieve this capability. Read more: China's reaction . Third, as North Korea's long history demonstrates, it is very hard to get something up into space -- and it is just as hard to bring it safely down. North Korea will have to develop and test a re-entry vehicle that can survive the temperatures, pressures and vibration of coming back into the Earth's atmosphere and the accuracy to land where targeted. It is a long journey from initial satellite launch to an ICBM. Ask Iran. Iran first launched a low-Earth orbit-satellite in 2009, the same feat North Korea has now duplicated, but Iran does not now, nor is it likely to have anytime soon, an ICBM. A new study from the Congressional Research Service concludes that contrary to predictions in the late 1990s that Iran or North Korea or both would have ICBMs by 2015, ""It is increasingly uncertain whether Iran will be able to achieve an ICBM capability by 2015."" So, the lessons are: Don't underestimate North Korea. Don't count on this regime disappearing anytime soon. But don't panic. Don't start an arms race that undermines your greater strategic stability goals. We need to take a deep breath and work with our allies to get North Korea back to the bargaining table and off the test ranges. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joe Cirincione.","Joe Cirincione: North Korea's successful launch of a satellite is a major feat .

"(CNN) -- Dennis Rodman, the former NBA star and the first American known to have met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was in the secretive country again this past week, purportedly to meet his ""friend Kim, the Marshal"" and perhaps also, to negotiate for the release of Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen detained since November. Rodman's second trip to North Korea this year comes months after months of threats of nuclear annihilation from Pyongyang. His desire to help Bae is likely to be registered in the annals of diplomatic history as little more than a little diverting adventure. But one never knows. The ""Marshal,"" who has actually never served in the military, might choose to act in a statesmanlike manner and release Bae after another high-spirited soiree with the basketball legend. That would be good news for Bae, who is reportedly in poor health. Other detained Americans . Such a dramatic gesture of goodwill by the reclusive leader would achieve the effect of adding insult to the United States in light of North Korea's recent cancellation of an invitation to the U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues. Rodman, of course, is not qualified to carry out negotiations with North Korea on sensitive political issues. Nor does the North Korean leadership see him as a credible conveyor of official message to Washington. Kim's unconventional courting of Rodman is about equivalent to his enjoyment of Disney characters and scantily clad women on stage. It's all jolly and trite pleasure. Kim's attraction to American icons such as the NBA or Hollywood does not signal a genuine overture to Washington. It does not indicate intentions of reform or opening up of the isolated totalitarian state that imprisons some 1% of its population in political concentration camps. We should never forget that amidst the levity and bonhomie that will emanate from Pyongyang in the coming days, North Korea, throughout more than 60 years of its existence, has committed systematic and widespread attacks on its civilian population, including murder, extermination, enslavement, torture, enforced sexual slavery and disappearance of people. In short, these are crimes against humanity. But what about the residual effects of personal warmth and brotherhood between Kim and Rodman? Will not such a ""cultural encounter"" between the Korean and the American lead to a ""breakthrough,"" as ""ping-pong diplomacy"" between China and the U.S. in 1971 supposedly did? In 1971, American table tennis players were invited to China for the first time. Just three months after that unprecedented ""cultural exchange,"" U.S. national security adviser Henry Kissinger secretly visited Beijing, a diplomatic coup that was capped off by President Richard Nixon's visit to China the following February. Lest anyone think that ping-pong diplomacy and Sino-U.S. rapprochement are married by cause and effect and hastily draw the conclusion that Rodman's latest visit has a fighting chance of bringing about a diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Pyongyang, I'd say: Theatrics are not equal to politics. Kenneth Bae: Please help me . The goodwill triggered by ping-pong matches between Chinese and Americans in 1971 was a mood enhancer to the secret contacts between Washington and Beijing that had been underway since September 1970. The two countries wanted to discuss geopolitical issues of mutual concern: Containing the Soviet threat, the Vietnam War, China's seat in the U.N. Security Council and Taiwan. But theatrics are not entirely irrelevant to politics. If anything, the young North Korean leader's occasional displays of affinity for American pop culture will only irk the country's revolutionary old guards. Kim clearly lacks the gravitas of his late father. He may believe that he is exuding an affable image by being seen with an American star. But by traditional Korean standards on how a national leader should carry himself, Kim comes across as less charismatic than -- dare I say -- a lightweight. There is no reason to believe that the North Korean military would challenge anytime soon. Kim's hold on power over the party and the military seems, for now, firm. But the prospects for a long, happy reign for whom propagandists tout as a demigod are dim. With time, Kim will come to believe in his own infallibility if not in his omnipotence. And megalomania is particularly susceptible to mortal miscalculation, whether on matters of court intrigue or foreign policy. In other words, for Marshal Kim Jong Un, fantasy is reality. And for a ruthless dictator, that's an invitation to an early brush with mortality. If Dennis Rodman unwittingly sows the seeds of reality in the fantastical world of the North Korean leader by nudging him toward miscalculation and deeper depths of self-absorption or planting doubt in the minds of North Koreans with access to big guns -- then his latest courting of the Marshal may rightfully come to be remembered one day, indeed, as a game-changer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sung-Yoon Lee.","Dennis Rodman was in North Korea purportedly trying to negotiate release of a U.S. detainee .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Anita Hill, whose accusations of sexual harassment almost derailed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' high court nomination, has no plans to apologize for the charges she made nearly two decades ago. The response from Hill, now a law professor at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, comes following a voice-mail message left for her by Thomas' wife, Virginia, over the weekend, requesting an apology. Charles Radin, the Brandeis director of news and communications, said Hill received the voice mail and turned it over to the campus Department of Public Safety, which then turned it over to the FBI. Special Agent Jason Pack, an FBI spokesman in Washington, declined to comment late Tuesday. ""I certainly thought the call was inappropriate,"" Hill said in a statement to CNN issued by Brandeis. ""I have no intention of apologizing because I testified truthfully about my experience and I stand by that testimony."" In a statement to CNN, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas said: ""I did place a call to Ms. Hill at her office extending an olive branch to her after all these years, in hopes that we could ultimately get passed what happened so long ago. That offer still stands, I would be very happy to meet and talk with her if she would be willing to do the same. Certainly no offense was ever intended."" According to a source at Brandeis, who spoke on condition of not being identified, the message left over the weekend said: . ""Good morning, Anita Hill, it's Ginni Thomas. I just wanted to reach across the airwaves and the years and ask you to consider something. I would love you to consider an apology some time and some full explanation of why you did what you did with my husband. So give it some thought and certainly pray about this and come to understand why you did what you did. OK, have a good day."" Virginia Thomas is a conservative activist who founded the organization Liberty Central. Hill declined comment to CNN affiliate WCVB outside her Waltham home on Wednesday, saying, ""Please, let me go teach my class."" Then-President George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas -- a then-43-year-old conservative from Pinpoint, Georgia -- to the Supreme Court in 1991. The nomination was ""instantly controversial,"" according to an outline of the incident posted on the website for the Center for History and New Media, part of a history class syllabus. African-American organizations, including the NAACP and the Urban League, opposed it, fearing that Thomas' conservative stance on issues such as affirmative action would reverse gains his predecessor, Justice Thurgood Marshall, had helped achieve, the outline said. However, the nomination proceeded to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the first few days of his confirmation hearings were uneventful, according to the historical account. ""When asked about his stance on legal abortion, [Clarence] Thomas claimed that he had not formulated an opinion and the issue was dropped."" The nomination went before the full Senate, but a media frenzy developed when Hill -- then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma -- came forward and alleged that Thomas had sexually harassed her years earlier, when he was head of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and she worked for him, the outline said. The Senate Judiciary Committee launched an investigation. Hill actually had made the allegations during interviews with the FBI, but they were leaked to the press just before the final Senate vote on Clarence Thomas, according to the Museum of Broadcast Communications' website. The Senate delayed the vote in order to hear more about Hill's allegations. In three days of televised hearings that transfixed Americans, Hill testified that Thomas repeatedly requested dates with her and engaged in inappropriate discussions including references to pornographic material. In his testimony, Clarence Thomas denied the allegations and called the hearings ""a national disgrace ... a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves,"" according to the museum. Two days later, Clarence Thomas was confirmed on a 52-48 vote. ""Although the hearings themselves had no legal significance, to many observers they symbolized a public referendum on sexual harassment and other gender inequities in late twentieth-century America,"" according to the broadcast museum. The incident has been credited with increasing public awareness regarding gender discrimination and motivating female voters in the 1992 elections, which saw a record 29 women elected to Congress. ""Many feminist groups refer to Anita Hill as the mother of a new wave of awareness of gender discrimination, particularly given the attacks on her credibility that she withstood from the white male senators,"" the museum said. Harriett Woods, then-president of the National Women's Political Caucus, was quoted by the museum as saying, ""Anita Hill focused attention on the fact that there were no women in that Senate panel making decisions about people's lives.""","Hill's testimony in 1991 almost sank Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court nomination .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Egyptians turned out in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday to protest plans for a constitution that would shield the military from public oversight. The throng, dominated by Islamist parties but also including secular forces, comes ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28. Egypt has been ruled by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces since the departure of President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year. The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president. But protesters are upset about proposed principles for the constitution, in which the military's budget would not be scrutinized by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state. The outpouring reflects the power of Islamist forces in Egypt, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. The demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of Coptic Christians marching in Cairo were attacked by unknown assailants. At least 32 people, including two police officers, were injured. They were heading to Cairo's Tahrir Square to commemorate the deaths of pro-Coptic protesters killed in clashes in the Egyptian capital last month. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and the Copts have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report .","Islamists and secular demonstrators are in Tahrir Square .

"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea is breaking new ground Thursday on a resettlement facility for North Korean defectors, reflecting the increasing number of people escaping food shortages and harsh living conditions of the hermit state. CNN got rare access to the first Hanawon center built in 1999 south of Seoul. Hundreds of defectors learn how to live in a free and prosperous nation, the exact opposite of the nation they have fled. The oldest student is age 84 and the youngest just one month. Daily lessons teach the basics of life in South Korea such as how to buy a subway ticket, open a bank account and how to understand the language. With little outside influence since the Korean War in the 1950s, North Korean language is rigid and difficult for their Southern neighbors to understand. It's not just physical lessons that many Hanawon students need, said Youn Miryang, a center director. ""25% of refugees are suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, they feel anxiety, they can have phobia against the people,"" the director said. Counselors help defectors cope with the trauma of fleeing North Korea and in many cases the sense of guilt they feel at having left loved ones behind. Mobiles are strictly banned here. With a camera in every phone these days, officials worry photos of defectors could find their way back to North Korea and they say family members would be severely punished by the North Korean military. The new facility, the third such center, will cost the South Korean government $35 million and will be able to take up to 500 defectors for the mandatory three month training before being released to find their place in South Korean society. More than 20,000 defectors live in South Korea, according to the Unification Ministry. At the ground-breaking, Minister Hyun In-take said it is more than a building. ""With realistic concerns about future unification, we are making substantial and practical preparation for a society in which North and South Korean people live together,"" the minister said.

"(CNN) -- Violent protests erupted Friday in Syria, with dozens of people killed in and around the restive city of Daraa and a boy slain in the coastal town of Latakia, reports said. ""The situation in Syria has worsened considerably over the past week, with the use of live ammunition and tear gas by the authorities having resulted in a total of at least 37 people being killed in Daraa , including two children,"" said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Among the dead were 15 people who tried to march to Daraa, sources said, and nine others who died when security forces fired on demonstrators in Daraa's main square, said Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist. There were many casualties in Daraa, said Abdullah, who asked that his full name not be reported due to security concerns. He said he saw Friday's events in the city, where deadly clashes have taken place in recent days between security forces and protesters. ""Thousands gathered and moved to the governor's building in Daraa, and there they burned a large picture of Bashar al-Assad, and then they toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad in the center of the square,"" Abdullah said, referring to the current president and his late father, the former president. ""After that, armed men came out from the roof of the officers' club in front of the governor's office and started firing at the crowd,"" he said. Aman al Aswad, a political dissident, said dozens of people appeared to have been killed or wounded in clashes with security forces in the square, but he could not be precise on the totals. CNN could not independently confirm the accounts as the Syrian government has yet to grant access to the network. Earlier, more than 100,000 people attended an anti-government demonstration in the town, according to Kamal Aswad, a political activist in Daraa. There, people ridiculed recent government pronouncements for reforms and an assertion by government spokeswoman and adviser Bouthaina Shabaan that the country's president had ordered ""no live bullets"" would be used against demonstrators. One witness said the people chanted, ""Bouthaina we do not want your bread, we want dignity!"" He said an ""overwhelming number"" of protesters showed up in Daraa to support ""martyrs,"" people killed in recent clashes. ""The whole of the city was out in the street to bury the dead and demand that those responsible be tried for their crimes against the people of Daraa,"" the witness said. ""We broke the barrier of fear today and the security forces could not touch us."" The witness said the security forces had withdrawn from the center of the city and didn't interfere with the demonstrations, which are stoked by a range of political and economic grievances. This week, a video made by a lawyer who describes himself as secretary general of the Association of Arab tribes and Clans in southern Syria has been circulating on the Internet. In it, Ali Isa al-Obaidi says the tribes that make up the organization have ""declared revolution against the regime, the dictator and his supporters."" It is dated March 21. ""Dear brave Syrian people, the winds of freedom and change have erupted,"" he says. ""After 41 years of the non-legitimate Assad family rule, which included killing, imprisonment, displacement, stealing of money... the victims of the criminal system number more than 100,000. The displaced number the same and there are 3 million displaced... Your duty today is to stand with your country's people and the revolution."" He says the revolution opposes no particular group, sect, religion or race. ""It is against corruption and the corrupt, no matter what their background,"" he says, adding that he represents tribes and clans in Syria that together make up more than half of Syrians. The speaker calls on: . -- members of the Baath party -- in which Assad plays a leadership role -- to quit the party; . -- Syria's military to ""stand by the people and its revolution;"" -- scholars and religious leaders from all sects ""to stand by the revolution and support it;"" -- the nation's youth ""to demonstrate against the dictator and his supporters and stand by the revolution;"" -- Syrians everywhere to unite in peaceful protest. It was not clear how much influence al-Obaidi holds in the country. The situation in Syria has drawn concern from the international community. The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke by phone with President Assad. And in Washington, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Friday that the U.S. government condemns the outbreak of violence in Syria. ""We are making clear from here and from other places what our position is,"" he said. Human Rights Watch, among other groups, said Thursday that around three dozen people were killed in clashes in a 48-hour period. ""Syria's security forces are showing the same cruel disregard for protesters' lives as their counterparts in Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, and Bahrain,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""President Bashar al-Assad's talk about reforms doesn't mean anything when his security forces are mowing down people who want to talk about them."" The government announced a number of measures that apparently addressed protesters' demands. Among them are decrees to cut taxes and raise government workers' salaries by 1,500 Syrian pounds ($32.60 US) a month and pledges to provide more press freedoms, increased job opportunities and curbs on government corruption. The government said it will form a committee ""to contact and listen to citizens in Daraa."" It also said it would study lifting the country's emergency law and adopting new legislation that would license political parties. Syria's emergency law, which has been in effect since 1963, allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations. There were pockets of smaller turnouts in Syria on Friday. State TV showed what it said were pro-government demonstrations in Aleppo and Damascus. The state-run Arab News Agency said its correspondent in Daraa ""reported that the crowds in the spontaneous popular rallies chanted national slogans highly lauding President Assad's generous decrees and decisions, pledging their loyalty to his excellency and their unity under his leadership in the face of any conspiracy against Syria."" But video also emerged of protests in Hama, where the government violently suppressed an uprising in 1982. And the state news agency reported that an armed gang attacked security forces in the southern city of Sanamen, which ""resulted in the deaths of several attackers."" Video was posted on YouTube purporting to show the scene of the shooting. It shows hundreds of young men and boys walking down a street, then turning around and running back as gunfire breaks out. Over the course of the 5-minute video, they regroup several times and head down the street only to reverse course at each burst of fresh gunfire. Some of the demonstrators are clumped into groups of about five men each. As they approach the camera, the lens reveals their broken cargo -- some eight gunshot victims in all. One of them holds his fist aloft, another's limp arm points downward, jostling as he is carried away. Several of them appear drenched in red. Other videos showed young men defacing billboards of the Syrian president and pulling down a statue of the leader. Haytham Manna, a Syrian rights activist from Daraa who lives in France, reported demonstrations in the cities of Raqqa, where there were reports of arrests and injuries, Latakia, and Homs. Tarif said a 13-year-old boy was killed in Latakia after he was beaten by security forces when they tried to break up a demonstration. The teen was from the neighboring village of Jabla. Haitham Maleh, a Syrian human rights lawyer in Damascus, said demonstrators turned out in Deir Al-Zour and were roughed up in Damascus. ""Syria today is like a barrel of gunpowder, and may explode at any moment,"" Maleh said. ""What is happening in Syria cannot be tolerated anymore. We have been subjected to oppression, domination and suppression by the security authorities and we have unemployment exceeding 30%, while 60% of us live below the poverty line."" Maleh's son, Iyas, said a legal group asked the International Criminal Court to investigate possible crimes against humanity committed by Syrian forces. The group is the Haitham Maleh Foundation for the Defense of Syrian Human Rights Defenders. Because Syria is not a ""state party to the Rome statute,"" which established the International Criminal Court, it can't typically act on allegations of crimes in Syria. There are two exceptions, however. One would be if the Syrian authorities were to accept the jurisdiction of the court, and the other would be if the U.N. Security Council were to refer the situation to the court. Iyas Maleh said he hopes the Security Council will act. ""If not, then I guess we will have to wait until there is a recognized Syrian transitional government who can sign the Rome statute."" Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000, succeeding his father, who ruled Syria with an iron fist for nearly 30 years. The 45-year-old Assad studied to be an ophthalmologist, but became Syria's heir apparent after the death of his older brother. Assad was elected to a second term as president in 2007, with 97% of the vote. When he took office, Assad initially loosened some government restrictions on Syria's people, but analysts say that he has since slowed -- even reversed -- that move toward political reform. Assad is an Alawite, as are many of Syria's political elite, while Sunnis make up nearly three quarters of the population. The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama is poised to restore the United States' image in the international community, but experts say the president-elect must show the world that his actions will live up to his rhetoric. People in Kisumu, Kenya, celebrate the election of Barack Obama. Receiving a warm welcome is not the same as maintaining one, and Obama has a lot of work to do to improve the U.S. brand. America's image has declined in nearly every region of the world in recent years, but Obama's victory ""enables the United States to start again with a clean slate,"" according to John Quelch, the senior associate dean at Harvard Business School. ""Americans can actually go to dinner parties and cocktail receptions around the world today and not have to apologize for the United States the way they have had to do the last several years,"" he said. ""The election has made life a little bit easier for Americans living and traveling abroad to hold their head up high again."" The United States' tarnished reputation has been fueled by a combination of factors, including opposition to U.S. policies like the war Iraq and alleged torture and abuse of prisoners, the perception of hypocrisy, unilateralism, and the perceived war on Islam, according to a congressional report released in June. Obama represents a ""clean break"" from the past, and his election is the first big step toward change, said Dick Martin, author of ""Rebuilding Brand America."" ""Changing America's standing in the world was going to be the work of a generation, and it would have to start with some kind of grand gesture that demonstrated that things were changing. His election in itself is that kind of grand gesture,"" he said. Throughout the election season, Obama was largely well received across the globe. More than 200,000 people came to watch his speech in Berlin, Germany, in July, according to police estimates -- and it wasn't because they'd read his book or memorized his policies. ""It was because they all felt that he was the incarnation of change and they admired him. They had an emotional connection,"" Martin said. When Americans voted for Obama on November 4, citizens around the world celebrated his resounding win. People in cities and villages danced and cheered in the streets, and Kenya declared the day after the election a national holiday. In China -- where the media is state-run and domestic stories are almost always the top stories -- newspaper headlines read ""First Black President of the United States."" When President Bush was elected for his second term, the cover on the U.K.'s Daily Mirror read, ""How can 59,054,087 people be so dumb?"" The day after Obama's victory, the paper's cover read, ""GOBAMA!"" While the reaction around the world was mostly positive, some areas have been more hesitant to embrace Obama. The day after the election, IslamOnline published an article titled, ""Pakistanis Skeptical About Obama."" In the months before the election, a survey by the Pew Research Center suggested little enthusiasm for Obama or Sen. John McCain in the Middle East, especially in Muslim nations. But in general, people across the world have reacted with joy to Obama's election because they are looking forward to the end of the unpopular presidency of Bush, said Robin Oakley, CNN's European political editor based in London. ""The arrival of Obama, as an African-American president, gives people a reason -- an excuse even -- to start loving America again,"" Oakley said. But with expectations so high, experts say Obama will have to work to capitalize on the opportunity before him. ""Obama needs to show that he is prepared to listen to America's allies, to consult with them genuinely on issues like Afghanistan and climate change, to open up to new thinking about Iran and Cuba, to re-shape the world's economic institutions,"" Oakley said. The biggest thing Obama could do to reshape U.S. foreign policy would be to capture Osama bin Laden, Quelch said. ""For eight years he dodged George Bush and I think President-elect [Obama] has been pretty strong in terms of indicating his determination to secure bin Laden,"" he said. If that were to occur, Quelch said, ""the U.S. could then in a sense close that chapter in its history and perhaps reopen dialogue with many parts of the Arab world that the relentless pursuit of al Qaeda and the Iraq war have closed off in the last few years."" Obama must also bring a greater level of professionalism to the selection of the ambassadors he appoints, Quelch said. ""I think previous administrations have not served U.S. overseas interests and image that well by in some cases appointing cronies who haven't even set foot in the country to which they were appointed before they were named as ambassadors,"" he said. Martin said that most importantly, Obama must listen to what the international community wants if he wants to restore America's reputation. ""The number one thing the people hold against us is that we don't appear to take their interests into account,"" he said. Closing Guantanamo, adhering to the Geneva Conventions and eliminating torture are key issues for people around the world because they are the symbols of American unilateralism, Martin said. Martin also suggested that Obama take a page out of President Eisenhower's playbook and give the rest of the world an opportunity to experience American culture through an agency like the now-defunct United States Information Agency. In addition to exposing the rest of the world to U.S. culture, Obama should also make sure young Americans are citizens of the world. Martin recommends education reform, with an emphasis on world history and language classes. ""They think we are clueless, they absolutely think we are clueless, and in many cases we are,"" pointing to a 2002 National Geographic study indicating that nearly a third of young Americans could not locate the Pacific Ocean. Alessio Vinci, CNN's Rome bureau chief, said that if the president-elect wants to change the world's view of the United States, ""Obama has to be Obama."" ""Obama's support in Europe is pretty much based on the fact that most people on this side of the Atlantic are fed up with the Bush administration, not with America as a nation,"" he said.","People around the world celebrated the election of Barack Obama .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two top North Korean diplomats were traveling to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to hold talks with Gov. Bill Richardson, the governor's spokesman said. Kim Myong Gil is a senior diplomat with the North Korean mission to the United Nations. Kim Myong Gil and Taek Jong Ho, senior diplomats with the North Korean mission to the United Nations, left New York on Tuesday and are scheduled for a two-day meeting with Richardson, said a U.S. source with knowledge of the visit and a senior State Department official. Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has traveled to North Korea several times in the past, most recently in April 2007 to secure the return of remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean War. The U.S. source with knowledge of the visit said that the North Koreans had asked Richardson for the meeting. Richardson would listen to what the North Koreans had to say but would not do any negotiating, the source said. The three will meet at the governor's mansion in Santa Fe for all-day talks Wednesday and then discuss renewable energy initiatives on Thursday, according to Richardson spokesman Gilbert Gallegos. New Mexico is a leader in the United States in exploring renewable energy technologies. The visit comes on the heels of former President Bill Clinton's trip to North Korea to gain the release of two U.S. journalists held in Pyongyang. Obama administration officials had said they hoped the release of Laura Ling and Euna Lee would give North Korea a face-saving opportunity to return to talks aimed at ending its nuclear program. North Korea has said it would not return to the so-called six-party talks with the U.S., South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. The New Mexico trip could signal that the North Korean regime was ready to re-engage with the international community, the source said. ""The timing is interesting,"" said the U.S. source. ""It's two days. Interesting things can always be said. And any interesting thing can be passed on to the (Obama) administration."" Because of existing sanctions on Pyongyang, North Korean diplomats serving at the mission to the United Nations are limited to travel within a 20-mile radius outside the New York city limits. The North Koreans had asked for permission to travel to New Mexico, and the State Department granted it, a senior State Department official told CNN. ""The North Koreans asked for permission to travel and as in the past, we have said yes,"" the official said. ""But we don't know what they want to talk to Bill Richardson about. If the North Koreans want to talk, they know who to talk to. They can come back to the six-party process and tell us if they are ready to move toward denuclearization."" CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","Source: Richardson would be listening but not negotiating .

"(CNN) -- Minuscule levels of radiation from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant incident have been detected in a widening number of U.S. states, but the Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed this week that the levels represent no threat to public health. ""To date, data from EPA's real-time radiation air monitoring networks continue to show typical fluctuations in background radiation levels,"" Jonathan Edwards, director of the EPA's Radiation Protection Division, said in a statement Monday. ""The levels we are seeing are far below any levels of concern."" At least 15 states reported detecting radioisotopes in air or water or both. No states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide, a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine. Progress Energy reported over the weekend that iodine-131 was detected in the air near its nuclear power plants near Hartsville, South Carolina, and Crystal River, Florida. ""We know that it's not coming from our plant,"" said Progress spokesman Drew Elliot. Had the U.S. nuclear plants been responsible for the radioactive iodine, other isotopes would also have been found, he said. The levels detected were so low that authorities do not require they be reported, he said. Sensors in Maryland have also reported elevated levels of I-131 in air samples. ""None of these levels pose a risk to health,"" the state's Department of Health said. The Maryland secretary of health said Monday that microscopic amounts were also discovered Friday in rainwater. He said the levels found posed no risk to public health. The Massachusetts Department of Health said Sunday that a monitoring station in Boston detected I-131 in rainwater on March 22, but had not detected any in air. In a question-and-answer page on its website, it says the amount detected should not concern residents. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said rainwater collected Friday from his state's nuclear power plant facilities contained low levels of iodine-131 ""likely originating from the events at Japan's damaged nuclear plants. But weekend tests of drinking water found no elevated levels of radioactivity."" The levels reported ""are still about 25 times below the level that would be of concern,"" Corbett's office said in a statement. Similar testing in other states, including California and Washington, has shown comparable levels of iodine-131 in rainwater samples. Trace detections were found in the air in Oregon, Colorado and California. Duke Energy spokeswoman Rita Sipe said Duke Energy had detected trace radioactive elements, likely to have originated from Japan's Fukushima plant, in North Carolina and South Carolina -- but at a level ""far below"" reporting requirements. EPA is using the nationwide radiation monitoring system, RadNet, to monitor the nation's air and drinking water, milk and precipitation. An analysis from 12 monitors nationwide found ""slightly higher"" levels of radioactive isotopes in Alaska, Alabama, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Saipan, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state over the past week, the agency said. ""Some of the filter results show levels slightly higher than those found by EPA monitors last week and a Department of Energy monitor the week before,"" the agency said. ""These types of findings are to be expected in the coming days and are still far below levels of public health concern."" A spokeswoman for the EPA said Monday that 90 percent of the 124 RadNet monitors were working.","A growing number of U.S. states are affected, but none at levels that threaten public health .

"(CNN) -- The governor of New Mexico has received about 400 responses on a special website dedicated to answering a generations-old question: Should outlaw Billy the Kid get a pardon in the killing of a sheriff? Gov. Bill Richardson, called a Billy the Kid buff, is looking at an old promise by another governor, and not the Kid's cold-blooded reputation, in deciding whether to issue a posthumous pardon, officials said. ""I think he will take the responses into account, particularly the learned responses,"" Richardson's deputy chief of staff, Eric Witt, said Wednesday. So far, about 220 people are in favor of the pardon, while 180 are against, Witt said. Those interested have until December 26 to belly up to the bar and weigh in. The governor, who is also reviewing the historical record, has said he will announce a decision after Christmas but by December 31, when his term ends. Billy the Kid, born Henry McCarty, also known as William H. Bonney and Henry Antrim, died at the hands of another sheriff, Pat Garrett, when he was only 21. Some members of the Garrett family, including grandson Jarvis Patrick (J.P.) Garrett, oppose the pardon. Besides arguing that Billy the Kid was an incorrigible killer, they want to make sure Pat Garrett is absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing and a Bonney jail escape. But Witt said the governor will not do anything that casts a cloud on Pat Garrett. ""We consider Pat Garrett a true hero of the West."" Albuquerque defense attorney Randi McGinn, who volunteered to handle the case for free, filed the petition for the pardon. ""A promise is a promise and should be enforced,"" she wrote. Garrett killed Bonney on July 14, 1881, in Fort Sumner weeks after Bonney escaped from a jail. The sheriff, legend has it, was hiding in the dark and shot the Kid when he entered a room. Garrett himself was gunned down in 1908 at age 57. Richardson will be deciding only the matter of a promise to Bonney made by territorial Gov. Lew Wallace, Witt said. ""We're not offering a blanket pardon for everything he did."" Wallace -- who had also been a Union general in the Civil War and wrote the novel ""Ben-Hur"" -- had promised to grant Bonney amnesty for the fatal shooting of Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady and other ""misdeeds"" if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder. Bonney cooperated, but the pardon didn't happen. According to Mark Lee Gardner and other historians, Bonney at one point wrote to Wallace, asking him to honor the deal. The Garretts argue Bonney decided to flee house arrest, making the pardon moot. He eventually was convicted in Brady's death and was sentenced to death, the petition states. But he escaped from jail on April 28, 1881, killing two deputies. ""Still, regardless of Billy's crimes, the motives of Richardson or the hollowness of posthumous justice, it all comes back to Wallace's promise. A deal is a deal, and 129 years doesn't change that. Billy is owed a pardon,"" Gardner wrote earlier this year in the Los Angeles Times. The Garretts don't buy that argument. ""If Billy the Kid was living amongst us now, would you issue a pardon for someone who made his living as a thief and, more egregiously, who killed four law enforcement officers and numerous others?"" the Garrett family wrote Richardson last fall. J.P. Garrett told CNN Wednesday that there is no written proof that Wallace made the promise and that the charges were federal, which did not give the governor the right to make the offer. But McGinn said a written promise is not necessary and there is ample evidence and letters indicating it was made. And, she said, Bonney was convicted of state charges after federal ones were dismissed. McGinn also rebuffed Garrett's questions about her independence because her husband was appointed state chief justice by Richardson. Chief Justice Charles Daniels is not involved in the matter, she said, adding, ""I am not an appendage of my husband."" Popular history has Bonney gunning down 21 men, but many historians say the number was closer to nine. According to other legends, Bonney did not die at Garrett's hands and is not buried in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. He went to Texas and became known as ""Brushy Bill"" Roberts, they say. Poppycock, the Garretts argue. They asked Richardson to sign a petition signed by 100 people that reads, ""Whereas we the undersigned accept and agree the traditional history of Sheriff Pat F. Garrett and Billy the Kid (William Bonney), and believe that Billy the Kid died at Pat F. Garrett's hand; Therefore we oppose a postphumous (sic) pardon for Billy the Kid as Brushy Bill Roberts."" But McGinn said Bonney kept his bargain by testifying and should receive the pardon. The attorney said at least two killings attributed to Bonney were self-defense and five others could have been done by others. Evidence shows that ""it's ambiguous here who were the bad guys and who were the good guys."" ""Governor Wallace did not keep his end of the deal, which was to pardon Mr. Bonney for all outstanding charges, including the pending indictment related to the death of Sheriff William Brady,"" McGinn wrote last week. ""This injustice should be corrected."" ""Why would he [Bonney] surrender himself ... unless there was something in it for him?"" McGinn asked Wednesday.","Gov. Bill Richardson is considering pardoning William Bonney in a sheriff's death .
He is debating whether a promise made by an earlier governor should be honored .

"(CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has released newly corrected financial disclosure forms showing his wife's past employment, blaming a misunderstanding for years of omissions of Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas' salary at a conservative think tank and other jobs. Thomas was required to report the information on the annual disclosure forms all federal judges must file. The forms did not disclose how much money Mrs. Thomas was paid. The updated records go back 13 years and confirm Mrs. Thomas has worked for the Heritage Foundation, the Republican leadership in the House and Hillsdale College in Michigan. Her employers were known previously, since Virginia Thomas is a well-known conservative activist. She founded her own conservative group, Liberty Central, in late 2009. That information was also not disclosed on the justice's financial forms. She has since relinquished leadership of Liberty Central, but still has an advisory role. The new information came after the liberal advocacy group Common Cause noted the omissions last week. The group also urged the Justice Department to investigate whether a speech the justice gave in 2008 before a conservative seminar sponsored in part by prominent GOP fundraisers created a possible conflict of interest. Common Cause said its review of the Heritage Foundation's IRS forms showed Virginia Thomas earned nearly $700,000 from 2003-07 while at the think tank.","Justice Thomas releases details of his wife's past employment .

"(CNN) -- After being accused of taking thousands from illegal immigrants in exchange for driver's licenses, a Nevada state employee might be forced to pay a hefty price after being nabbed in a multi-agency inquiry. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Monday the results of their federal bribery investigation centered on Nancy Brown, a 28-year-old Las Vegas native. An anonymous tip into the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles' compliance division sparked the investigation in September 2010, with the caller alleging that two people had illegally gotten driver's licenses through one of the agency's employees. The resulting joint probe eventually involved members of the State Department and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which describes itself as ""the principal investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security."" According to Homeland Security's news release, illegal immigrants would go to a Las Vegas DMV office and wait in the lobby near Brown, a DMV technician. The federal agency said she'd then call them over to her station and fill out their ""fraudulent paperwork"" -- even though they didn't provide required documents to prove they were eligible for a driver's license. After taking their pictures and paying their fees, the people walked off with temporary licenses, the release said. Authorities estimate that Brown processed 187 such illicit driver's licenses, charging between $1,700 and $3,000 for each one. The complaint against Brown was filed April 29, and she was arrested on Thursday. The next day, she was in court to face a federal program bribery charge. U.S. Magistrate Judge George Foley Jr. released her on a personal recognizance bond, the Homeland Security Department said in its release. ""Trafficking in counterfeit document poses a serious security vulnerability, one that often contributes to a host of crimes -- including identity theft and financial fraud,"" said Angel Marcial, an ICE assistant special agent, in the statement on Brown's case. CNN called the federal public defender representing Brown on Monday evening, seeking her client's response to the allegations, but hasn't received a reply. This is the latest but hardly the only case involving people fraudulently getting driver's licenses. Earlier this spring, police arrested 11 bus drivers around New York area suspected of using phony aliases to get driver's licenses, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in a news release. New Mexico has also seen several such investigations. In February, Gov. Susana Martinez said in a statement that state and federal investigators there arrested five illegal nationals of Indian descent and accused them of charging people $6,000 to illegally obtain a New Mexico driver's license. Investigators claim that the men helped these people get fake documents so they could fulfill requirements to get a license. And in 2008, another Nevada DMV employee -- Marilyn Millender, then 52 and also from Las Vegas -- was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that she solicited and took money from illegal immigrants in exchange for driver's licenses and identity cards. After a plea agreement, she was sentenced to three years of probation and forced to pay a $1,000 fine, according to a federal court document.","Nancy Brown, a Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles employee, is arrested .

"(CNN) -- As Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast on Monday night, one Twitter user in New York City posted a flurry of alarming reports about fallout from the storm -- from plans to shut down all power in Manhattan to floodwaters pouring into the New York Stock Exchange. Like many social media messages about Sandy, they were scary and confusing, but some of them were reported as facts by news outlets. And, it turns out, many of them were outright lies. They were apparently posted by a Wall Street analyst who doubled as campaign manager for a candidate for Congress. After a blogger exposed him, the analyst apologized on Twitter Tuesday night amid a flood of online scorn and left the campaign. An elected official is pushing for criminal charges. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . The case reinforces how social media can spread misinformation at lightning speed and raises the question of whether users should face prosecution for knowingly posting false information during a natural disaster or other emergency. It all began Monday when Hurricane Sandy was approaching landfall and the owner of the Twitter account @ComfortablySmug, whose bio lists interests including ""Finance, Gin, Politics, Books, Food, Fine Clothing (and) Meeting Strangers,"" began posting rapid-fire tweets to his 6,500 followers. The tone of many of the tweets, which included false accounts of destruction, seem intended to spread confusion and fear. ""BREAKING: Con Edison has begun shutting down all power in Manhattan,"" read one tweet. ""BREAKING: Governor Cuomo is trapped in Manhattan. Has been taken to a secure shelter,"" said another. The user also wrote that all major lines of the New York City subways had been flooded and would be closed for at least a week. And he contributed to the confusion surrounding reports, which proved to be false, that the New York Stock Exchange had flooded. Some news outlets, including CNN, briefly mentioned the NYSE flooding accounts after they were reported on the National Weather Service's website. 7 ways to manage stress in a disaster . Two of ComfortablySmug's posts about Sandy were retweeted more than 500 times each. But many Twitter users challenged the truth of his reports, and the Con Edison tweet drew a direct rebuttal from the company itself. The Twitter account has no real name attached to it. But Buzzfeed contributor Jack Stuef reported he was able to compare altered photos posted on the account to unedited versions of them elsewhere on the Internet. Stuef identified the account owner as Shashank Tripathi, a hedge fund analyst and campaign manager for a candidate for Congress. While never giving his name, the account holder seemed to acknowledge as much Tuesday night in a post apologizing for his actions. He also announced his resignation from the campaign of Republican Christopher Wight, who is seeking New York's 12th Congressional seat. ""I wish to offer the people of New York a sincere, humble and unconditional apology,"" he wrote after Stuef's story had identified him. He then linked to a longer note. ""While some would use the anonymity and instant feedback of social media as an excuse, I take full responsibility for my actions,"" he continued. ""I deeply regret any distress or harm they may have caused."" On Wednesday morning, Wight's campaign website said Tripathi had been replaced. Tripathi did not respond Wednesday to a Twitter message seeking comment. 5 things you need to know . An investment banker on leave from J.P. Morgan, Wight faces Democratic incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney in a district that includes parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan and voted overwhelmingly for President Obama in 2008. In a statement posted Wednesday afternoon on his campaign site, Wight said he was ""shocked and disgusted"" by Tripathi's behavior. ""His actions were all the more distressing, occurring as they did, in the midst of Monday's disastrous weather -- during a time when no one was truly safe,"" he wrote. ""I learned from online reports yesterday, just as others did, that Shashank had been spreading false information from a personal and anonymous Twitter account. While he had been with my campaign for seven months, I had no indication that he was capable of the type of behavior he exhibited."" Less is known about Tripathi, whose account links to a fund raising site for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and who used Sandy to pepper his feed with nasty political jabs, including this fake retweet from President Obama's account: ""RT @BarackObama: If you are trapped in New York City and are running out of food, remember to eat your dogs first before going outside -bo"" His tweets suggest he attended this year's Republican National Convention, and he's listed as a volunteer coordinator for Romney and other GOP candidates. At least one elected official has asked that criminal charges be considered in the case. New York City Councilman Peter Vallone says he has asked the Manhattan district attorney's office to look into the possibility that Tripathi's tweets were the digital equivalent of shouting ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater. ""The Manhattan DA is taking this very seriously,"" Vallone, a Democrat, told Buzzfeed, while acknowledging it may be a hard case to make. ""I hope the fact that I'm asking for criminal charges to be seriously considered will make him much less comfortable and much less smug.""

"(CNN) -- Canada came to a standstill when a gunman killed a soldier outside a war memorial in Ottawa -- then stormed into parliament, sending lawmakers hiding behind barricaded doors. The incident has raised a concern: how secure is the nation's seat of power. A patchwork of jurisdictions . Unlike in the United States where the Capitol police is responsible for security at the U.S. Capitol, four different agencies are charged with ensuring the safety of various parts of the parliament building in Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- the national police force -- covers the parliament grounds while a House security detail is in charge of buildings under the House jurisdiction. A Senate security detail is responsible for one area of the building while the Ottawa Police keeps an eye on the surrounding streets. This could make communication a major challenge. Two years ago, Canada's auditor general issued a report recommending a unified security force. It wasn't acted upon. Communication breakdown? Authorities investigating Wednesday's attack will likely look at why the security agencies at the parliament did not tighten security after Ottawa police received a 911 call at nearby National War Memorial. It is there that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed Nathan Cirillo, a reservist guarding a tomb for the country's fallen, injured two others and then headed for the parliament. John Manley, a former deputy prime minister, said it's too early to make conclusions on whether there was a communication breakdown. ""In order to assess whether there was a failure of the security or whether it was inadequate, we need to know more about what happened,"" Manley told the Globe and Mail newspaper. ""But if this is linked to religious extremism, we've significantly changed the security game in Canada."" Easy access . Visitors have to go through metal detectors, but once they go through one set, they have easy access to most parliamentary offices. It's unclear how the gunman got past the metal detectors and into the building. ""Somebody who decides that they want to rush the building can walk up ... and then rush into the building before anybody can really effectively do anything,"" lawmaker Marc Garneau told CNN partner network CTV. He would like to see the security checkpoints moved to the ""edges of the parliamentary precinct, so that when people enter onto the grounds itself, they've already been screened."" Intensified security . In the past two decades, Canada has intensified security in government buildings after a man drove a bus into Parliament Hill in 1989. In 2009, environmental protesters made it to the top of two buildings. Each incidents led to calls for more security restrictions. A delicate balance . Still, lawmakers are loathe to see draconian measures imposed that will limit public access in favor of greater security. ""I just think what's really important to remember from this is that Parliament Hill is an incredible public place that's open for people to play football and come and protest and sit and have their lunches, do their yoga,"" Charlie Angus told CTV.","The nation's seat of power has various layers of security jurisdictions .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate found Federal Judge G. Thomas Porteous of Louisiana guilty on four articles of impeachment on Wednesday, which will remove him from the federal bench. He had been accused of accepting kick-backs and lying to the Senate and FBI. The vote makes Porteous, 63, only the eighth federal judge in the nation's history to be impeached and convicted. Porteous is also ""forever disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States,"" Sen. Daniel Inouye said during Wednesday's Senate hearing. The Senate adopted the motion barring Porteous from holding a future federal office by a vote of 94 to 2. In March, the House of Representatives voted unanimously to impeach Porteous on corruption charges. ""Our investigation found that Judge Porteous participated in a pattern of corrupt conduct for years,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Task Force on Judicial Impeachment. In a statement at the time, Porteous' lawyer, Richard W. Westling, said the Justice Department had decided not to prosecute because it did not have credible evidence. ""Unfortunately, the House has decided to disregard the Justice Department's decision and to move forward with impeachment,"" he said. ""As a result, we will now turn to the Senate to seek a full and fair hearing of all of the evidence."" Porteous, who turns 64 this year, was appointed to the federal bench in 1994. He has not worked as a judge since he was suspended with pay in the fall of 2008, Westling said. The most recent previous impeachment of a federal judge by the House was last year. Judge Samuel B. Kent of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas resigned after being impeached on charges of sexual assault, obstructing and impeding an official proceeding and making false and misleading statements, according to the website of the Federal Judicial Center. Before then, Judge Walter L. Nixon of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi was impeached in 1989 on charges of perjury before a federal grand jury. The Senate convicted him and removed him from office that year.","NEW: Porteous barred from future federal office, accused of taking kick-backs, lying .

""Now that I am here, I can feel the confrontation (with the north),"" he said. ""I realize the importance of Yeonpyeong island."" He was accompanied by Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin. North Korea shelled the island in the Yellow Sea in November 2010, killing two marines and two civilians. Pyongyang claims it was responding to South Korea holding a military drill nearby. The island is close to the maritime border, the Northern Limit Line, which Pyongyang does not recognize. Read more: S. Korea fires warning shots at N. Korean fishing boats .

"(CNN) -- An American man has been detained in North Korea, two State Department officials told CNN. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of not being identified said the man is a Korean-American businessman. One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea. The State Department is working with the Swedish Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, the officials said. The United States is urging North Korean authorities, through the Swedes, to release the man on humanitarian grounds. Sweden represents America's interests in North Korea because the United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations. The Swedes have been granted consular access to the man and have visited him, the officials said. The Swedes are asking for regular visits, the officials said. A Swedish official in Stockholm confirmed to CNN that the embassy in Pyongyang is working on the case. The sources declined to provide additional information because of privacy concerns. North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea. Gomes, who attempted to commit suicide while in North Korean custody, was believed to be a Christian activist. Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program.  The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry out the drills, calling them a provocation and threatening to engulf Seoul in a ""sea of flames."" South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and last November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.
