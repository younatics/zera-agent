"Madrid (CNN) -- The judge investigating the train crash that killed 79 people last July is expanding the preliminary charges to include numerous top officials of the state railway infrastructure company, Adif, for alleged negligence, a Tuesday court order shows. Judge Luis Alaez Legeren wrote that five Adif officials in charge of track and signal security, along with the current and two former Adif presidents, will face preliminary charges because there was no safety system that would have compensated for any human error by the train driver. The prime suspect remains the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, who already faces preliminary charges of 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness. The judge's latest order states that the passenger train was going more than twice the speed limit when it derailed on a curve near the northwest city of Santiago de Compostela. In addition to 79 fatalities, some 170 passengers were injured. Just before the crash, the driver took a phone call from another official on the train to discuss the train's route farther north on the journey, the judge wrote. An Adif spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment about the judge's order, and company lawyers were studying it. In the eight-page order sent by the court to reporters, the judge cites various security systems in place along the section of track where the accident occurred. But he adds it appears that Adif officials did not adequately mitigate all the predictable scenarios of human error by the driver. Since the accident, the speed limit at the curve has been reduced from 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph) to just 30, Adif has confirmed. Last week, Spanish newspaper El Pais exclusively obtained audio of the driver's first, desperate phone call, while injured and still trapped inside the engine, to the train's control center. The court said it did not release the audio, but there are several parties to the case who may have had access to it. In the audio, the driver told his control center he ""got distracted"" and was going 190 kilometers an hour when he should have been doing 80. News media reported that part of the conversation in the days after the crash, citing officials, who blamed excessive speed for the crash. But the audio recording also contains allegations by the driver that were not widely reported weeks ago, namely his contention that he had warned authorities about what he called the dangerous curve. ""I had already told security it was dangerous, that one day we were going to eat it, and it happened to me,"" the driver, Garzon, is heard telling the control center in the audio recording. A few moments later he added, ""Oh God, I had already told the people from security that it was very dangerous. We are human ... and this can happen... that this curve is inhumane. Understand? If there was a warning light ..."" For weeks, the judge has been investigating other potential causes for the accident, beyond the train's excessive speed. In the court order Tuesday, he also asked Adif to provide the names of all company board members and all rail security senior officials, since December 2011. That's when the section of track where the accident occurred, and its security systems, went into operation.","Preliminary charges in the Spain train crash will now include top railway officials .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama revitalized his push for holding down middle-class tax rates Monday, calling on Congress to pass a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for people earning less than $250,000 a year. In a White House statement delivered while people described as working Americans stood behind him, Obama said his proposal would provide the certainty of no tax increase next year for 98% of Americans. Noting that Republicans seek to maintain all of the Bush tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003, Obama said both sides therefore agree on extending the lower rates for middle-class families. ""Let's agree to do what we agree on, right?"" Obama said to laughter and applause in the East Room. ""That's what compromise is all about."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, indicated he would schedule a Senate vote on Obama's proposal, while House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said the chamber would vote later this month on a one-year extension of the Bush tax cuts for everyone. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama would veto the House version if it reached his desk. Facing a tough re-election fight against certain Republican challenger Mitt Romney, the Obama campaign seeks to frame the contest as a debate between the president's goal of restoring middle-class opportunity versus GOP policies that it says would primarily benefit corporations and wealthy Americans. Opinion: Class warfare discussion is essential . Obama and other Democrats said Monday that Republicans would have to decide if protecting wealthy Americans from a tax increase was worth holding ""hostage"" the extension of middle-class tax cuts. A Romney campaign official criticized Obama's announcement as more bad policy from the president in the wake of the latest disappointing jobs report. ""President Obama's response to even more bad economic news is a massive tax increase,"" said Andrea Saul, the Romney campaign's spokeswoman. ""It just proves again that the president doesn't have a clue how to get America working again and help the middle class."" Unlike Obama, Saul continued, Romney ""understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is raise taxes on anyone."" Republicans also complained that Obama's plan would raise taxes on more than 900,000 small-business owners who report their income in individual returns as so-called flow-through enterprises. ""The proposed tax increase on 53% of all flow-through business income would be especially harmful to small businesses,"" said a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, a leading conservative. Obama, however, said that under his proposal, 97% of the nation's small business owners would benefit from having their lower tax rates maintained at current levels. ""This isn't about taxing job creators,"" Obama said. ""This is about helping job creators."" Carney also took exception to the GOP argument, saying that the small-business people Republicans sought to protect from higher taxes included ""partners in law firms or hedge-fund managers."" ""They're not the kind of small businesses that you and I tend to think of when we talk about small businesses,"" Carney said. Monday's statement was part of a new presidential push on the tax issue following the weak June jobs report that came out Friday. Congress is returning from it's weeklong Independence Day break on Monday. An Obama campaign official said his re-election team will ""amplify the president's message on middle-class tax cuts"" by hosting a series of events this week in battleground states. In Las Vegas, for example, local elected officials will discuss Obama's efforts to fight for the middle class, the campaign official said. In Colorado, Aspen Mayor Mick Ireland, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio and state Sen. Gail Schwartz will hold a news conference to discuss the contrasting economic visions of Obama and Romney. Obama signed a bill in 2010 to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts until the end of 2012, citing the need for economic stimulus at the time. He has since vowed he would not permit another extension of the lower tax rates for wealthy Americans. His proposal Monday would maintain the current lower tax rates for families making up to $250,000 for another year while allowing tax rates to return to 1990s levels for those earning more. The president sounded major themes of his re-election campaign, saying his goal was ""putting people back to work but also rebuilding an economy where that work pays off."" He blamed a political stalemate in Congress for the failure to take decisive steps toward addressing rising deficits and other economic issues, saying he and Democrats disagreed with what he called ""top down"" policies of Republicans who favor tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. ""I believe our prosperity has always come from an economy that's built on a strong and growing middle class,"" Obama said, noting that he has cut middle class taxes as president. ""... So that's why I believe it's time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, folks like myself, to expire."" Extend the tax cuts for the middle class now, the president said, and then let the result of the November election decide the debate on broader tax reform, including how much the wealthy should pay . On Sunday, top Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs told CNN that the president was ""100% committed"" to ending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. The tax breaks are set to expire in what has become known as the ""fiscal cliff,"" a package of spending cuts and the removal of tax breaks that will take place on January 1 if Congress fails to act. In total, they could add up to $7 trillion. Tax breaks that would end include the Bush tax cuts, middle-class protection from the Alternative Minimum Tax and more than 50 ""temporary"" tax breaks for individuals and businesses that have been on the books for years. Should the rich pay more taxes? Share your thoughts in the iReport Debate . Obama also has backed the so-called Buffett Rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would impose a minimum 30% tax rate on those making more than $1 million. The measure was blocked by Senate Republicans in April. Republicans say the solution to the country's deficit problems should focus on shrinking the size of government, rather than raising taxes on anyone. ""In the wake of another weak jobs report, the president is doubling down on his quixotic call for the same small businesses tax hikes that have been routinely rejected by the House and Senate,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement Monday. ""How will these small business tax hikes create jobs?"" Opinion: 3 bipartisan bills that could get the economy moving . Middle class taxes may rise anyway . CNN's Ashley Killough and CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.","NEW: The House and Senate will vote on differing proposals on the Bush tax cuts .

"(CNN) -- Twelve years ago, New York City taught the nation about resilience in the face of a massive attack. On Tuesday, New York again taught the nation that character counts. There is, of course, no comparison between the horror of 9/11 and a mayoral primary in America's largest city. But while the shadow of the twin towers still hangs over the hearts of many in New York, the persistence of daily life remains a quiet sign of defiance. This year, city politics seemed determined to hit a new low rather than aspire to new heights. A series of scandal-scarred candidates sucked up the oxygen amid an otherwise forgettable field. And for a while, Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer seemed likely to win their respective races on the strength of name ID and notoriety. If successful, their candidacies could have compounded the cynicism that surrounds politics in an era where too few leaders feel the obligation to hold themselves to a higher standard. But when it was discovered that Weiner had been a recidivist sexter -- under the quintessentially creepy nom de guerre ""Carlos Danger"" -- something heartening happened: Common sense kicked in. Weiner plummeted from first to fourth in the Democratic primary polls, with much of his support shifting to the aggressively progressive Public Advocate Bill De Blasio, who rose to pole position aided by powerful ads featuring his biracial son, Dante de Blasio, and a campaign theme focusing on inequality. Likewise, Spitzer's last-minute entrance into the obscure city comptroller's race initially injected that campaign with a shot of adrenaline. The former state attorney general and governor had derailed a meteoric rise with ill-advised dalliances with hookers during a stormy tenure in Albany. Instant infamy was followed by a long slog for redemption, punctuated by a brief tenure as a cable news host on CNN and Current TV. But the brilliant, ambitious Spitzer was always aiming for a return to political power, and he saw the comptroller's race as a means to that end, threatening to bigfoot the otherwise pedestrian campaign of mild-mannered policy wonk and career politician Scott Stringer. But the self-funded Spitzer was ultimately denied victory, an outcome that largely represented more of a rejection of Spitzer than an endorsement of Stringer. On the Republican side of the aisle -- in a far less prominent race -- a self-made billionaire grocery magnate named John Catsimatidis essentially tried to buy the GOP nomination, encouraged by a cadre of consultants and a handful of high-profile endorsees, many of whom were persuaded to support the man at least in part because of his financial largess. A barrage of negative ads directed at his opponent Joe Lhota -- a Giuliani administration deputy mayor during 9/11 (whom I served alongside) and chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority during Hurricane Sandy -- failed. In a political world where big money often drives outcomes, this was one campaign where wealth didn't determine the winner. That's a win for representative democracy. There is a final hopeful note in this primary election, 12 years after 9/11. In the past it has always been a cynical article of faith that winning campaigns were cobbled together by ethnic algebra. But this year, New York voters sent the clear, hopeful message that identity politics would not drive their decisions. The African-American candidate, Bill Thompson, did not win the black vote. The openly gay City Council Speaker Christine Quinn did not win the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender vote or the female vote. That represents real progress and political evolution toward a more perfect union -- and that is the deeper purpose of our politics. Twelve years after 9/11, voter participation still isn't what it should be -- turnout is low in closed partisan primaries, and that represents a creeping complacency where openness and civic energy should be an obligation. But in rejecting the sociopathic circus in favor of more sober candidates who tried to build coalitions across old dividing lines, New Yorkers sent the message that substance can beat slick self-promotion. Simply put, character counts. And for that timely reminder, it is worth saying again -- thank you New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: New York's primary election sent an important message .

"(CNN) -- Residents of a Corpus Christi, Texas, neighborhood had the kind of wake-up call no homeowner wants to get. An early morning explosion Friday shook the area, sparking a fire that rushed through the neighborhood. In the end, three homes were flattened and about 70 others were damaged, the Red Cross told CNN affiliate KIII. Two people injured were in critical condition Saturday night. They were first taken to a local hospital and then flown to the burn unit at San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center, according to the Corpus Christi Fire Department. KIII news anchors, in the studio nearly two miles away from the blast site, were in the middle of their live morning newscast Friday when they -- and their viewers -- heard a loud boom. The room appeared to shake slightly. Eryk Phillips lives in the home behind the blast site. ""I woke up and my ears were ringing,"" Phillips told KIII. When his hearing started to come back, he said, ""I could hear sirens, car alarms going off and all that... and I'm thinking, 'Wow, am I going to die?'"" Phillips' home is littered with glass and insulation. Part of the ceiling is peeled away. He is among 34 people evacuated. The fire department believes the cause was probably a natural gas leak inside a home. But state and local investigators are on the scene digging through rubble to determine.","2 people are in critical condition at a San Antonio hospital burn unit .

"(CNN) -- Who would open one of the world's biggest casinos in the depths of a global recession? Big city dreams: Lawrence Ho's business portfolio in Hong Kong and Macau is growing. Answer: Lawrence Ho, the scion of a casino business mogul who has clearly inherited his father's love of a calculated risk. Ho's father Stanley is a man synonymous with the creation of Macau as the world's biggest gambling destination. ""Over the past 40 years he has put his thumbprints all over Macau. I think if you look at the major infrastructure projects, whether it's the airport, the ferry terminals, he was involved in building up a lot of those,"" Lawrence Ho told CNN. But in opening City of Dreams in Macau earlier this year, Ho is trying to carve his own niche and continue to build up his own business empire. ""I think gone are the days when you can open a property and 'Bang!' you would steal significant market share from others,"" he told CNN. ""Before we opened we were, like the rest of the world, a little bit wary of the timing, but I think in hindsight the world economies are doing a lot better and Macau has seen its first year-on-year increase in July and August was a booming month. So I think all in all we couldn't be happier."" Ho's company, Melco-Crown Entertainment, is independent from his father's huge portfolio of businesses and the multibillion dollar City of Dreams project is a partnership with Australian James Packer, himself the son of a media tycoon. Ho is respectful of his ailing father's achievements and the advantages that the family name has given him, but also the desire it fostered to forge his own success. ""The bigger the shadow the more we can feel the underdog syndrome. ... being his son opened many doors, but at the same time I grew up in a very big family with our own issues, but all in all certainly being his son has helped a great deal,"" he said. There are no worries about interference from the mainland -- ""I suspect that China definitely wants [Macau and Hong Kong] to do well"" -- and Ho remains positive that Asia will see the quickest recovery from the downturn. ""A lot of the Asian countries and economies have handled the [economic] crisis this time a lot better than the Asian financial crisis 10 years ago,"" he said. ""So I think, all in all, Asia has managed to come out of this much quicker than the rest of the world. And really when people are feeling better they travel and they spend more, and you know we are in the business of providing leisure and entertainment.""","Son of Stanley Ho, business tycoon who built up former-Portuguese colony of Macau .

"(CNN) -- If you take the long view - and by ""long view"" we're talking 10 days -- there have been three distinct paths the United States could have taken on Syria. First, way back on August 31, President Barack Obama seemed imminently close to a strike on President Bashar al-Assad's regime. After Labor Day, came a detour toward seeking congressional approval. That effort was overwhelmingly met by the public with a ""No thanks. We'll pass."" Then this week, thanks to a remark by Secretary of State John Kerry that may or may not have been off the cuff, Obama made a sharp turn -- toward diplomacy. For now, he's sticking with option 3. Obama seeks support for attacking Syria while pursuing diplomacy . During a prime-time speech to the American people Tuesday, Obama pressed the pause button on his hard sell for a military strike, and said he's waiting to see what kind of viable, verifiable plan Russia comes up with for al-Assad to give up his cache of chemical weapons. But Obama says he'll keep U.S. forces ready in case al-Assad's bluffing. Call it carrot-and-stick diplomacy. Here's what's on Obama's to-do list for the coming days. Make plans . Send Secretary of State John Kerry to Geneva on Thursday to meet with his Russian counterpart. The hope is that Kerry and Sergey Lavrov can draw up a timeline for Syria to hand over all its chemical weapons. The bad news: This is a crucial meeting, because the United States and Russia haven't always seen eye to eye. Many of the next steps, a White House official says, depend on what's agreed upon there. The good news: Despite a sometimes icy relationship with Russia, Kerry and Lavrov have been able to work well in the past. The talks should last two days. If a deal is reached, it's on to the United Nations next. 5 key themes from the Obama speech . Keep courting . Keep wooing a lukewarm Congress. Even though Obama asked Congress to postpone a vote on military action, the White House will push the idea, in case diplomacy fails. The bad news: Despite bending the ears of 93 senators and more than 350 members of the House since Friday, lawmakers weren't flocking to Team Obama. A CNN tally showed there was growing dissent in both chambers. The good news: Some are slowly coming around. A bipartisan group of eight senators is working on an alternative resolution that, according to Republican Sen. John McCain, will include ""guidelines, reporting process and benchmarks that have to be met"" before letting the United States unleash its military might. Read the speech . Set a deadline . How long should al-Assad get to comply? In his speech Tuesday night, Obama didn't specify. The bad news: No one's quite certain. After meeting with Obama on Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin said the president ""asked for some time to work things out -- a matter of days into next week."" Sen. Carl Levin said, ""I don't know if he put a specified period on it. He thought it could be fairly short."" And Kerry said, ""The president will decide what he thinks is the timeframe that he is prepared to live with."" The good news: Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said he was working on a version of a resolution that would authorize a military response if diplomacy doesn't produce an acceptable result in 30 days. Delegate to the U.N. Obama says this last-ditch diplomacy pitch will give U.N. inspectors time to issue their report on the August 21 incident. The United States and its allies claim that the al-Assad regime used poison gas on rebel strongholds that day, killing more than 1,400 people. The bad news: On September 1, the United Nations said the report would be complete in two or three weeks. Later, it said it didn't know how long it'll take. The good news: France is pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution that would give Syria 15 days to declare all its chemical weapons, according to Reuters. Be wary . Russia has agreed to play middleman to defuse this crisis. Syria says it's on board with Russia's offer, and will turn over its chemical weapons stockpiles to international control. Obama calls this an encouraging sign. But, he warned, ""It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments."" The bad news: It's unclear whether Russia is serious or stalling. On Tuesday, Russia canceled a U.N. Security Council meeting that it had called, and rejected an initial proposal by France for the framework of a resolution. The good news: TBD. Maintain pressure . The U.S. military will maintain its ""current posture to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails,"" Obama said Tuesday night. This means the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz that's in the Red Sea with destroyer ships nearby will stay put. The bad news: Russian President Vladimir Putin says that has to change. ""You can't really ask Syria, or any other country, to disarm unilaterally while military action against it is being contemplated,"" Putin said in an interview with a Russian television network. The good news (according to the United States): Kerry said the looming threat of a strike will prod Syria to play nice. ""Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging,"" he told lawmakers Tuesday. The bad news (again): A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday found 59% of respondents opposing congressional authorization of military action, while 72% said American strikes would achieve no significant goals. CNN's Tom Cohen, Tim Lister, Deidre Walsh, Dana Bash, Z. Byron Wolf, Barbara Starr, Ted Barrett, John King, and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Obama stalled the plan of a military strike on Syria .

"(CNN) -- Aircraft including long-range bombers may be used in any eventual strike on Syria, but ""that does not fundamentally change the parameters of the mission,"" a U.S. official said. Another official from the Defense Department said the White House has been calling the Pentagon almost every day asking questions about U.S. options in Syria and the feasibility of different plans. ""They're not the experts on this, we are. So it's our job to lay out what it would take to accomplish X or Y,"" the defense official said. The questions from the White House involve escalating the scope of the mission, but ""in increments -- nothing that's out of line with the original plans. From the start, we have always been developing a range of options, depending on what they ultimately wanted to do,"" the defense official said. U.S. assets and key locations . The first official said planners have had what he described as ""incremental inquiries into what we might apply, due to how things have been developing on the ground,"" but added that no final decision has been made on which assets to deploy and that a decision could still be a ways off. ""I wouldn't get out ahead of anything here,"" the official told CNN. ""You want to match the military effort to the target sets. Those target sets have changed, but they're probably going to continue to change even more,"" he said. The official characterized the bombers only as options and pushed back on any notion of U.S. pilots flying over Syrian airspace. ""You can employ stand-off weapons from an aircraft, just as easily as from a ship or submarine. Aerial assets can be used from a distance,"" he said. The official was responding to a report from ABC News' Jonathan Karl, who is traveling with President Barack Obama in Russia, that said the U.S. attack plan for Syria could potentially include missiles fired from B-2 and B-52 bombers flying from the United States. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, has reported that the Pentagon was preparing to employ greater firepower to reach shifting military targets. The revised options under development include the use of Air Force bombers to supplement U.S. destroyers in the Mediterranean, the newspaper said. U.S. long-range bombers such as the B-1, B-2 and B-52 are equipped with joint air-to-surface missiles, designed to destroy both mobile and fixed targets. The missiles' primary advantage is that they allow pilots to operate outside the lethal range of most hostile air defense systems. The United States has B-1 bombers stationed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which also operates as a forward headquarters for U.S. Central Command.","Long-range aircraft may be used in an attack on Syria, U.S. official says .

"London (CNN) -- The Beatles, the Beach Boys, Fleetwood Mac, the Kinks, the Clash, Oasis -- rock music's history is littered with bands marred by messy breakups. Even spending three decades on the road together seems no barrier to disharmony, as Peter Hook and his former New Order bandmates are finding out. The musicians are now exchanging bitter words in public while fighting in court over who owns the right to use the New Order name. Hook compares the situation to a bitter divorce; singer and guitarist Bernard Sumner says the bass player's decision to perform the band's early material on tour is ""disrespectful."" ""This is quite a unique way of arguing ... this fracas now of arguing over the trademark,"" Hook tells CNN by telephone. ""None of this 'namby-pamby sitting around a table and sorting it out,' we want to do it all in public."" New Order was formed in 1980 by Sumner, Hook and drummer Steven Morris, who had previously been in melancholy post-punk band Joy Division until the death of singer Ian Curtis. Along with keyboardist Gillian Gilbert they went on to break new ground by combining northern guitar music with synthesizers, and later dance rhythms. The group's 1983 single ""Blue Monday"" remains the biggest-selling 12-inch disc in UK chart history. Hook left in 2007, claiming it would be impossible for New Order to make music without him. However, Sumner, Morris and Gilbert reformed four years later without him and are now touring and planning to release new material under the New Order name. The bassist says he has raw feelings about his exclusion. ""I wasn't even told they were reforming,"" he says. ""I just got a cryptic message to listen to the radio at 1pm on the Monday when it was announced. It's like being divorced and getting shown the door without even being told why."" For his part, Sumner has laid into Hook, saying that the bassist was affected badly after being treated for alcoholism. ""When he came out of treatment for this event, he was a worse person, in my opinion,"" the guitarist told the now-defunct Spinner.com. ""He tore strips off me and said everything that had ever gone wrong with New Order was my fault; everyone was really puzzled... And then he just started attacking everyone else -- the management -- everyone was 's***' except him."" The singer also said he was saddened by his former bandmate's lack of interest in New Order, and Hook confirmed that a reunion seemed unlikely. ""Will we get back together? At the moment we're at the stage when, if you're getting divorced, your wife's cutting the dog in half and tearing all the sleeves off your suits ... so the answer would have to be no."" Hook likens the dispute to four people who run a shop for 30 years together. ""Then one day you came along and the others have locked you out. They're inside still selling without your knowledge and consent. How would you feel?"" Warming to his theme, the 57-year-old poses the question: ""Why was I locked out of the shop? It obviously has to do with the fact that I resurrected the Joy Division music. But they resurrected it first when they played as Bad Lieutenant (the band name Sumner performed under between 2008 and 2011) without asking me. It's do as I say, not as I do. ""But anyone has the right to play Joy Division. I can't stop a busker playing 'Blue Monday'; I might have an opinion about it, but I can't stop him."" Hook's new band The Light is playing two dates in the United States this week, performing the first two New Order albums, 1981's ""Movement"" and ""Power, Corruption and Lies"" from 1983 in their entirety. The divorce metaphor never far away, he says playing the older material is like ""getting the kids for the weekend after a particularly nasty split. It's nice to get the songs back."" ""'Movement' is a very Joy Division record with New Order vocals, whereas by the time ""Power, Corruption & Lies"" came along, it was a proper New Order record. On ""Movement,"" (producer) Martin Hannett played the vocals down a lot, so it's nice with the experience I have now, to be able to really belt it out properly."" On previous tours Hook's group played the two Joy Division albums, material New Order rarely performed. ""I'm celebrating the Joy Division thing that New Order made a conscious decision to ignore -- and were right to ignore. But once New Order split up and I was on the outside, you start thinking, hang on a minute everyone revered Joy Division. The only people who don't celebrate it were the people who were in Joy Division."" Hook acknowledges the name of his old band is far better known to fans than that of his new one, so the legal battle over who owns the trademark is not just a matter of pride. ""I'm trying to establish my name,"" he says. ""But if you're talking about a group like New Order that has an established brand and trademark, then yes, you make much more off live performances now than you do off recording. ""And it's the Rolling Stones phenomenon. No one wants to hear your new stuff anyway, they want to hear your old stuff.""","New Order former bandmates trade bitter words while fighting over right to name .

"(CNN) -- For the Obama administration, yesterday's gaffe may be tomorrow's masterstroke. The idea that Secretary of State John Kerry said would never work now appears to be the best chance of averting a U.S. military strike on Syria, and the Obama administration moved on Tuesday to stake its claim on the proposal. It started early on Monday, when Kerry broached the idea of Syria handing its arsenal of chemical weapons to international control. But Kerry immediately dismissed the idea, saying Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad ""isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously."" Shortly after, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Moscow would be willing to support it, and his Syrian counterpart quickly welcomed the concept. With the administration fighting an uphill battle to win support from Congress for military action, a U.S. official told CNN on condition of anonymity that Kerry's remarks were a ""major goof."" Kerry spokeswoman Jen Psaki sought to roll back the comments, saying he was simply responding to a ""hypothetical."" But by Monday evening, President Barack Obama called it a welcome development ""if true,"" warning that it couldn't be used as an opportunity for Syria to stall for time. Obama told CNN that the threat of American force ""has prompted some interesting conversations,"" including one he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 economic summit Putin hosted in St. Petersburg. ""When I was at the G20, we had some time to discuss this, and I believe that Mr. Putin does not see the use of chemical weapons as a good thing inside of Syria or anyplace else,"" Obama said. And by Tuesday morning, Kerry told the House Armed Services Committee that the Russian plan ""is not something that, you know, suddenly emerged, though it did publicly."" ""President Putin raised the issue with President Obama at St. Petersburg. President Obama directed us to try to continue to talk and see if it is possible,"" he said. The plan appears to have taken on ""a life of its own"" in the past day and could help Washington and Moscow reach ""a mutually face-saving solution,"" said Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program and the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""This is really a rabbit out of a hat,"" Kuchins said. For Obama, with Americans largely opposed to yet another military action in the Middle East, ""this is the way to at least buy some time and get diplomacy back in the game and in the front seat."" And Russia -- Syria's leading ally -- doesn't want ""to be viewed as the defenders of the user of chemical weapons, and Vladimir Putin would rather aspire to winning the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Kuchins said. A senior Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday's developments weren't pre-planned, but were an example of diplomacy in real time. Lavrov and Kerry had discussed the idea over the weekend; the two spoke again after Kerry's comments on Monday in a previously scheduled call, when Lavrov told Kerry he would make a public proposal based on the American's remarks. But Kuchins said Tuesday's explanation is ""almost not at all"" believable. ""I would hope that our two governments had talked about the possibility of cooperation and dealing with the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. I don't doubt that that's come up in conversations,"" he said. ""But to suggest that President Obama and Putin were talking seriously about this? They only talked for 20 minutes or so at the G20, and there has to be time for interpretation."" Kuchins cautioned that reaching agreement on a U.N. resolution to close the deal will be difficult, and implementing an agreement ""is going to be much more difficult."" But he added, ""We'll see how it goes."" Perhaps more will be known after Thursday. That's when Kerry travels to Geneva to meet with Lavrov to begin discussions on a possible deal, according to senior State Department officials. Kerry will be accompanied by a team of experts at the talks, which are expected to take place in several sessions over two days. The officials cautioned that the negotiations may not be concluded in Geneva and any agreement would be presented to the United Nations for consideration as a resolution. CNN's Jim Acosta and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","How did John Kerry's so-called ""major goof"" turn into a possible solution to Syrian crisis?

"Washington (CNN) -- Iran's foreign minister denied reports Sunday that his country could be planning a retaliatory strike against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad if the United States launches a military strike against Syria. ""Iran will take no action against its ally and brother -- Iraq -- and I believe all these allegations are there to justify any military strikes, which are a danger for those planning them,"" said Mohammad-Javad Zarif, according to the Iranian state-run news agency INSA. ""Iran has no plans to act against its friend and brother, Iraq,"" the minister added. Last week, a senior U.S. official told CNN the United States has obtained intelligence indicating that Iran ""may be planning"" such a retaliatory strike. He said that Iran has ""a lot of Shi'a friends"" in Iraq that would be willing to carry out an attack. The official was responding to a Wall Street Journal report that the United States intercepted an order from Iran to militants in Iraq to attack the embassy ""and other American interests in Baghdad,"" if the United States strikes Syria militarily for alleged chemical weapons use. The State Department had no comment on the report but added it had not taken any action in terms of security at U.S. diplomatic posts in Iraq. Zarif, who spoke during a one-day visit to Iraq, called for a ""peaceful and diplomatic"" resolution to the crisis in Syria. ""We should not beat on the drums of war in the region, since beating will only start a fire that would spread to all countries in the region. Those who insist on beginning a war are about to start a fire that will take over the entire region,"" the minister said, INSA reported.

"(CNN) -- Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei pledged to continue fighting injustice in his first interview since his release from detention. The outspoken critic of the nation's human rights record was arrested in April, detained for three months and charged with tax evasion. ""Of course you might live an easier life if you abandon some rights. But there are so many injustices, and limited educational resources,"" Ai told the Chinese Communist party's Global Times newspaper. ""They all diminish happiness. I will never stop fighting injustice."" The paper describes Ai as ""feisty"" in his first interview since being released from prison in June after a three-month detention on tax evasion charges that some observers alleged were trumped up. A condition of his bail forbids him from using Twitter, the newspaper said, but the artist has been outspoken on the social media platform. On Sunday his tweets were innocuous: ""Lunch 10 dumplings, regained 3 kilograms body weight."" Another said, ""Five cloves of garlic."" The tweets linked to pictures, including one of feet on a scale reading 214 pounds, and another one of Ai and an unidentified male peering into the camera. The playful tweets ended Monday night when he wrote about business colleagues detained with him. ""Today I met Liu Zhenggang. He talked about the detention for the first time. ... This steel-willed man had tears coming down. ... He had a sudden heart attack at the detention center and almost died."" Later, he tweeted, ""Because of the connection with me, they were illegally detained. Liu Zhenggang, Hu Mingfen, Wen Tao and Zhang Jinsong innocently suffered immense mental devastation and physical torment."" On Tuesday afternoon, he issued a call to action: ""If you don't speak out for Wang Lihong, and don't speak out for Ruan Yunfei, you are not only a person who doesn't stand up for justice and fairness, you don't have any self-respect."" Ai confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that he wrote the tweets, saying ""a bird needs to flutter its wings to see if it can fly."" The activist was detained at the Beijing airport on April 3 while awaiting a flight to Hong Kong. Police cordoned off his Beijing studio, and an assistant told CNN that eight employees had been called in for questioning. Ai was released June 22, and Beijing police told the state-run Xinhua news agency that he had confessed to his crimes. ""The decision (to release Ai) comes also in consideration of the fact that Ai has repeatedly said he is willing to pay the taxes he evaded,"" Xinhua reported. However, in July, a company that Chinese authorities say is controlled by dissident artist Ai Weiwei challenged tax evasion allegations. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report .","Ai Weiwei gives his first interview since his release from detention .

"(CNN) -- Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who is being sued in California by the federal government, said she has a duty to not pay taxes because her son died in what she called an ""immoral"" war. An Internal Revenue Service officer, in a federal filing Tuesday in Sacramento, said Sheehan has refused to provide financial information for the 2005 and 2006 tax years. The filing asks the court to order Sheehan to comply. Sheehan, of Vacaville, told CNN affiliate KXTV she has not paid federal incomes taxes since 2004 -- and has not disguised the fact. ""I feel like I gave my son to this country in an illegal and immoral war. I'll never get him back,"" Sheehan said. ""And, so, if they can give me my son back, then I'll pay my taxes. And that's not going to happen."" Sheehan drew national attention when she camped outside then-President George W. Bush's home in Crawford, Texas, throughout August 2005 to demand a meeting with the president over her son's death. Casey Sheehan, a 24-year-old Army specialist, was killed in an April 2004 battle in Baghdad. His death prompted his mother to found Gold Star Families for Peace. In 2011, Sheehan raised questions about whether U.S. special forces had indeed killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ""It's not that I don't believe (President Barack) Obama about Osama because he's Obama, I don't believe him because he is just one in along (sic) line of butt-naked emperors,"" Sheehan wrote on a blog. Her anti-war protests included a 2010 stint on the grounds of the Washington Monument.","IRS sues Cindy Sheehan to get financial records .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's speech to the American public Monday night was eloquent and forceful. But given the odds arrayed against him -- some of his own making -- the persuader in chief likely won't make the sale. Indeed, it's likely that none of the other great communicators and explainers -- Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton -- could have either. And here's why: . Chico Marx was right . Impersonating Groucho in ""Duck Soup,"" Chico makes a remark that sums up Obama's challenge: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"" The American people are their own experts this time around on what constitutes a vital national interest for the United States and what they want done about it. After two of the longest and most profitless wars in American history, the public has a more discriminating assessment of what's worth fighting for and what's not. And, deeply dismayed by the standard for victory -- when can we leave, not how do we win -- most Americans rightly see a U.S. military strike on Syria as an imperfect option that is likely either to be ineffective or to draw the U.S. into another country's civil war. One speech could never overcome the skepticism and doubts left by a decade of two pointless wars. And this one didn't. It's not that Americans are unmoved by the president's heartfelt descriptions of dead Syrian children gassed by, the administration says, President Bashar al-Assad's murderous forces; it's that their priorities lie elsewhere. But it's America's broken house that's in need of repair, not someone else's. And no amount of false analogies to Munich and appeasement will sway them. They know what they see, and it's not compelling enough to justify the uncertainties of a military strike. The president's words last night didn't allay those doubts. Opinion: Obama's speech a model of persuasion . Obama's Syria policy is a Marx Brothers movie . Over the past week, one got the feeling that every day another door opened on the Syria issue with yet another surprise. The twists and turns didn't help the administration's case for clarity and consistency, which is so critical to providing the background of a speech to the nation. Indeed, events of the past week made the president's task much harder. First, after a buildup to one of the most widely telegraphed military actions in the history of warfare, the president surprised the nation by deferring military action while he sought an authorization to use force from Congress. That was followed by an off-the-cuff remark by Secretary of State John Kerry on how al-Assad could preempt a military attack by turning over all his chemicals weapons. The next surprise was a Russian endorsement of Kerry's idea -- and then Syria jumping aboard the peace train. The result: On the eve of the president's speech -- presumably aimed at making the case for a military strike -- the momentum had shifted away from war as the United Nations, the French and the secretary-general all try to figure out how to make peace and take al-Assad's chemicals off line. The American public -- already confused as to whether the strike would be ""unbelievably small"" (in John Kerry's words) or, in the president's words, more robust (""the U.S. military doesn't do pinpricks"") -- could be forgiven if it was a tad bewildered. Read the speech . Overselling the risks of not acting . Much of the president's speech dealt with the consequences of not acting militarily in the face of the largest single deployment of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988. There's no doubt that doing nothing would broaden al-Assad's margin to use these weapons again if he felt it necessary. But we need to be clear: This regime is engaged in a fight to preserve itself and will do whatever is necessary to stay in power. A U.S. strike would have to be extremely punishing to deter al-Assad from using these weapons and extremely comprehensive in its scope to degrade al-Assad's capacity. The president can't make his case by playing down the severity of any U.S. response. The other risks of inaction -- deterring Iran from nuclear weapons or suggesting that the U.S. is threatened by these weapons -- just don't add up and aren't compelling. Indeed, should al-Assad be weakened or lose control, these chemical weapons might well fall into the hands of al Qaeda and other jihadist groups that could use them directly against the United States. Opinion: Speech aims to keep heat on Syria . Our cardboard conception of leadership . Even under normal circumstances, a single presidential speech to persuade Americans to back a military strike would be a tough sell. Presidential speeches rarely move the needle much on an issue like this. We have this artificial conception of our president's capacity. If only the president could make the case with powerful logic, he can indeed persuade. The only thing that's missing is leadership. But that's really not the way it works. Presidents are more often prisoners of events. The great ones -- Abraham Lincoln, FDR -- are fortunate (if that's the right word) to have circumstances that allow them to do so. And they intuit and extract opportunities from those circumstances that allow them to lead. Obama doesn't have these circumstances. He faces a public that is deeply skeptical of attacking another Arab/Muslim country; a divided and skeptical Congress; and an international community that fears military action. And he confronts this environment with a military option that he himself doesn't really believe in either. There's no real sense of urgency or emergency, partly because the president has willfully downplayed that sense of crisis. Obama seeks support for attacking Syria while pursuing diplomacy . Obama is an ambivalent warrior. He fashions himself the extricator in chief charged with getting America out of profitless conflicts, not getting them into new ones. And it shows. Monday night's speech reflected a man who on one hand would like to be rescued by a diplomatic solution to a problem he himself knows can't be resolved by military force and on the other, one who realizes he has a very bad military option if he must go forward. And as a consequence, what was hyped as a major speech really couldn't be, in large part because there was nothing to decide and no urgency to do so. Congress isn't going to vote this week; the U.S. isn't going to war soon; and Vladimir Putin's diplomacy from Russia has yet to play itself out. Indeed, right now the president can't be the decider in chief because there's nothing to decide. For now, Obama -- along with the rest of the country -- is stuck in limbo between a war he clearly doesn't want and diplomatic approach he knows faces long odds. And no presidential speech could free him or the country from that predicament. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller .","Aaron Miller: Speech could not sell skeptical Americans on need for action on Syria .
He says speech couldn't convince war-weary citizens that U.S. interests at stake .
He says Obama's handling of Syria issue has not inspired confidence .
Miller: A strike would have to be broader than Obama describing, and Americans fear this ."
"(CNN) -- No administration in modern times has been as confused, contradictory and incompetent in trying to make the case for war as this White House has been in its push for action against the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Listen to the words of the Obama administration: . On war and peace: At the G20 Summit on Friday, President Barack Obama said as he pushed for strikes in Syria, ""I was elected to end wars, not start them. I've spent the last four and a half years doing everything I can to reduce our reliance on military power as a means of meeting our international obligations and protecting the American people."" Then Obama signed onto a joint statement with 10 other nations present at St. Petersburg's G20 Summit, ""Recognizing that Syria's conflict has no military solution, we reaffirm our commitment to seek a peaceful political settlement through full implementation of the 2012 Geneva Communique."" On boots on the ground: Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry wavered on whether U.S. ground forces could be deployed in Syria. Kerry told Committee Chairman Robert Menendez, ""I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country."" Then Kerry backtracked when pressed by Ranking Member Bob Corker, ""Let me be very clear now, because I don't want anything coming out of this hearing that leaves any door open to any possibility, so let's shut that door now as tight as we can."" Kerry explained his contradiction by admitting, ""I was thinking out loud."" On who supplied al-Assad with chemical weapons: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told the House Foreign Affairs Committee this week when asked where al-Assad got his chemical weapons, ""The Russians supply them."" The Russians called that a lie and the Defense Department walked back the comment, saying Hagel meant Russians supply conventional weapons to Syria. On war objectives: Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, couldn't answer even the most basic question on U.S. objectives on a Syrian intervention. When Corker asked, ""What is it you're seeking?"" Dempsey replied, ""I can't answer that, what we're seeking."" On the cost of war: Hagel told the House Committee the entire Syria campaign's cost, ""would be in the tens of millions of dollars, that kind of range."" Since Tomahawk missiles cost about $1 million each, the administration would only be able to deploy several dozen missiles before going over its own budget. So this administration does not know if it wants war or peace, if it will need to deploy ground troops, where the chemical weapons it wants to eradicate come from, what our war objectives are and how much this war will cost. Russian President Vladimir Putin attacked Kerry's assertion that al Qaeda and radical Islamists comprise only a small part of the anti-Assad rebels, saying Kerry ""is lying and he knows that he is lying. This is sad."" That a foreign leader would so forcefully call America's top diplomat a liar points to the administration's growing credibility gap with the world and the American people. That is sad. Retired Gen. Robert Scales chalks up the public relations disaster to amateurism, writing ""[Military leaders] are embarrassed to be associated with the amateurism of the Obama administration's attempts to craft a plan that makes strategic sense. None of the White House staff has any experience in war or understands it."" Scales has a point -- when the sitting secretary of state, while discussing matters of war, admits to ""thinking out loud,"" something is very wrong. Every member of Congress should vote his or her conscience on matters of peace and war. After weeks of misstatements, contradictions and gaffes, it is becoming clear that the administration's leaders are in way over their heads on these weighty matters. For members carefully weighing the decision to authorize force, they should know that a yes vote rewards the most incompetent, atonal security team in our lifetime. It will only encourage more incompetence. If they can't even explain the war, how can they win it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: Administration officials seem confused on basic points .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army has suspended 55 soldiers from their duties as sexual assault counselors, recruiters and drill instructors after a review turned up violations ranging from alcohol-related offenses to sexual assault and child abuse, an Army official said Friday. The soldiers were identified as part of a review of the records of sexual assault counselors and recruiters ordered by U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel after a Pentagon report released in May found that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of ""unwanted sexual contact"" in 2012, a huge jump from the 19,200 figure in a 2010 report. The 55 soldiers who were identified in the ongoing review ""are no longer assigned to those positions of trust and responsibility,"" the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. The official was not authorized to release details, citing the ongoing review. Fort Carson soldiers accused of sexual misconduct involving minors . There has been no official disposition in most of the 55 cases, the official said. The Defense Department has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, establishing a special victims unit to handle cases, working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit. Military officials worry that many victims don't come forward because they are frightened of retaliation. Hagel said victims need to be made confident they can rely on the military's justice system and that commanders will be held responsible. Daughters and moms now consider rape before applying to military . The Army has confirmed it is reviewing the records of 20,000 recruiters, sex assault and drill instructors, and that it is on track to finish the review by October 1.

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina woman is alleging that ""American Idol"" winner Fantasia Barrino engaged in an affair with her husband, and says in court documents that the pair ""recorded"" their sexual encounters. Paula Cook, who separated from her husband, Antwaun Cook, in June, filed the documents -- seeking child custody, alimony and other monetary support -- Wednesday in Mecklenburg County District Court. The documents allege Antwaun Cook began the affair with Barrino, 26, in August 2009 after the pair met at a Charlotte-area T-Mobile store where Cook is employed. Barrino -- the 2004 winner of the popular Fox show and an eight-time Grammy nominee -- treated Cook to a lavish lifestyle over the course of their affair, flying him to Atlanta, Georgia; Miami, Florida; New York; Los Angeles, California; and Barbados, the documents allege. The pair ""have at times recorded their illicit sexual activity,"" according to the documents. A month after Paula Cook separated from her husband, Barrino is alleged to have interrupted a phone conversation between the estranged couple, telling Cook, ""He don't want you. Maybe the next time you get a husband you'll know how to keep him. That's why he is here with me,"" according to the documents. Barrino has appeared publicly with a tattoo on her left shoulder reading ""Cook,"" an apparent tribute to Antwaun Cook, who is said to have a similar tattoo in the same place on his shoulder, according to the documents. The alleged affair was first reported in November by gossip magazines and websites. Barrino and her record label Sony Music declined to comment on the documents Sunday. Paula Cook says that as a result of the affair, her husband became more and more withdrawn from their marriage, attributing late nights and other absences to work, the documents say. ""As [Paula Cook] contemplated ways to save her marriage and family, [Antwaun Cook] and Ms. Barrino continued to enjoy their open and notorious relationship without her knowledge and/or consent,"" the documents say.

"(CNN) -- Dennis Rodman's flashy visit to North Korea is just a big elaborate show. Don't be fooled by it. The bizarre, seemingly lighthearted episode comes at a time when tensions are again running high and overshadows the pain and suffering faced by ordinary North Koreans. The regime is continuing its dangerous weapons tests, treating its population terribly and starving countless people. On Tuesday, North Korea issued new hostile threats, this time to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War in 1953. The regime has made threats in the past, but the intensity of its recent belligerence is unusual. North Korea blatantly violated multiple U.N. Security Resolutions with its December 2012 rocket test and its third nuclear test in February. It has made hostile statements toward the United States and South Korea in reaction to the announcement of the new U.N. Security Council resolution that imposed more sanctions on the regime. Just when the situation seemed to be getting worse, the world suddenly saw the young leader Kim Jong Un receiving an American star with great hospitality and enjoying an afternoon of basketball. What this portrait lacks is the unimaginable level of the suffering of people inside the country who are deprived of basic human rights and food. The regime's track record on human rights is even more ominous than its threats of rockets and nuclear weapons that often provoke the international community. North Korea's history is marred by decades of unimaginable famine. In 2011, Freedom House listed the regime as one of the seven worst violators of human rights in the world. It is a place where political prisoners languish in gulags, escaped defectors testify of cannibalism, and famines decimate the population. The latest reports indicate that the food situation appears to be somewhat improved. In a recent survey conducted by U.N. agencies, the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children was 27.9% and acute malnutrition was 4%. These are not just numbers and statistics. Children's growth and development is being permanently stunted. The impact of endless hunger and recurrent famine has tremendous long-lasting impact on the North Korean people. It has been estimated that 3.5 million North Koreans died of starvation in the severe famine of the 1990s . In its November 2012 crop and food security assessment, the U.N. predicted a gap of 207,000 tons of food this year in North Korea. This deficit exists in spite of planned imports and Chinese assistance. In human terms, this translates into a situation where about half the country's most vulnerable population, those who are dependent on the regime's public food distribution system for sustenance, are severely food insecure. The fact is that, even if North Korea's harvests are improved this season, the public food distribution system is still extremely vulnerable to shocks, such as severe weather. At these levels of malnourishment, dramatic improvements to the system are still needed to ensure people are safe from famine caused by the next flood or severe drought. The world must be careful not to be blinded by congenial games and friendly speeches coming out of North Korea. It's just a staged show. It doesn't actually solve any of the problems the country is facing. Most importantly, such sideshows are not in the interest of the North Korean people. Some may contend that Dennis Rodman's visit brought exposure to the regime, which may in turn translate to some benefits, whether it is improved business relations, better communication or more spotlight through other famous stars. However, the world should not be distracted by the dictatorship's faÃ§ade and attempts at friendly gestures to lure other countries to start a dialogue or defuse the tensions it has created. Instead, the world needs to focus on the dire situation of the North Korean people and stay committed to finding solutions that will alleviate their hunger and improve their living situations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ellen Kim and Carolyn DuMond.","Ellen Kim, Carolyn DuMond: Dennis Rodman's flashy visit to North Korea is just a big show .

"(CNN) -- In his speech Tuesday night, President Barack Obama hammered Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad for his alleged use of chemical weapons, made the case for a military intervention, and then said he'll let diplomacy play out -- for now. The assertions Obama made weren't new ones. Both he and the White House have said them before. The difference? A majority of Americans who watched the prime time address said they favor the approach he spelled out. Here are the five broad themes from the speech, and the counterpoints that opponents of his approach have made. What's next on Obama's to-do list . POINT . Intervening is in the United States' national security interest. The president said chemical weapons in Syria are a future threat to the U.S. and its allies. What's more, they flout international law. ""This is not a world we should accept,"" Obama said. ""This is what's at stake."" COUNTERPOINT . No it's not. Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum says there's no reason for U.S. involvement. ""The bottom line here is we have no national security interest,"" the 2012 Republican presidential candidate told CNN. ""We have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation."" --- . POINT . Al-Assad must be held accountable. The president is playing up the two Ds of a military strike: degrading and deterring. ""Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver,"" the president argues. ""A targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons."" COUNTERPOINT . OK, but at what cost? A U.S. strike could lead to a regional conflict, a weakened Syrian regime, and strengthened opposition forces made up of multiple terrorist factions who could hurt the U.S., said Democractic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. ""Would it not be potentially irresponsible to take action against Syria just for the sake of saying we took action against Syria, when that action could lead to something far worse?"" she told CNN. --- . POINT . A U.S. military action would be limited. Obama said Syria is not Iraq, or Afghanistan for that matter. ""I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria,"" the president said. ""This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective, deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities."" COUNTERPOINT . There's no way to promise that. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, put it simply: ""There is no guarantee."" The Pentagon estimates it would take 75,000 troops to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. It's not up to U.S. forces, of course, but someone will have to do it. --- . POINT . Diplomatic avenues must be pursued first. The president made it clear: he prefers a peaceful solution. He did win the Nobel Peace Prize after all. Russia's diplomatic offer -- that Syria says it has accepted -- has Damascus putting its chemical weapons under international control. The potential is promising enough that Obama asked Congress to postpone a vote on military action. He said the U.S. will work with the U.N. Security Council on a resolution ""requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and to ultimately destroy them under international control."" COUNTERPOINT . This is just a Syrian stalling tactic. The opposition Free Syria Army, echoing widespread skepticism, says al-Assad isn't serious. ""Here we go again with the regime trying to buy more time in order to keep on the daily slaughter against our innocent civilians and to fool the world,"" said Louay al-Mokdad, a spokesman for the group. More than 100,000 people have died in Syria during its civil war. --- . POINT . The U.S. has moral responsibility. The president called the United States ""the anchor of global security"" for the last 70 years and then posed the question: ""America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way?"" COUNTERPOINT . The U.S. can't play global cop. The president agrees with this point too. Yes, it's complicated. ""America is not the world's policeman. Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong."" But, he added, ""When with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act."" Obama seeks support for attacking Syria while pursuing diplomacy .

"London (CNN) -- The leatherback turtle is one of the ocean's titans. The largest member of the turtle family, it is also one of the world's biggest reptiles, outsized only by some species of crocodile. Adults can weigh more than 900 kilograms and reach more than 2 meters in length, with the largest ever discovered measuring about 3 meters from bill to tail. The species gets its name from its ridged, dotted carapace which, unlike other sea turtles, has the texture of hard rubber. Spending virtually its entire life at sea, the leatherback -- the only warm-blooded sea turtle -- is able to withstand colder waters than other species. This has allowed it to become the most geographically dispersed reptile, spotted off the coasts of Newfoundland and Norway in the north, to New Zealand and the southern tip of Africa. But despite its wide spread across the world's oceans, leatherback populations have plummeted in recent decades. The impact of commercial fishing, the poaching of their eggs and other hazards saw their numbers drop by an estimated 80% during the 1980s and 1990s, and today the species is classified as critically endangered. On the beaches of Gabon on Africa's west coast, however, there are encouraging signs. Here, an important conservation project run by local NGO Aventures Sans Frontieres (ASF, or Adventures Without Borders) is attempting to save this ancient giant from extinction. Watch: New research to save Africa's leopards . Gabon is home to the world's largest nesting population of leatherbacks, with an estimated population of between 15,000 and 41,000 females using its warm, tropical beaches as a place to incubate their eggs. As ASF's Celine Gagne explains, if you know where to look, the man-sized leatherback can be glimpsed on a nightly basis for months at a time. ""There is, from October to March or April, perhaps every day some turtles coming to the beach to lay their eggs and go back to sea,"" she said. After mating with a male just off shore, the female leatherback will wait for nightfall to head for the beach, dig a shallow pit in the sand, and deposit her eggs -- as many as 150 at a time. See also: Meet Senegal's octogenarian master drummer . She buries the eggs about 80cm deep with her hind flippers, compacting the moist sand with the weight of her body to protect the eggs. Her work on land done, she returns to the sea. Gagne says that for every thousand eggs laid, perhaps only one turtle will survive to maturity. Some of the 10cm long hatchlings will be unable to dig their way to the surface to make it to the surf, and suffocate in the nests. Others are easily picked off by crabs, dogs, seabirds and other predators. ASF's program involves collecting data on the nesting patterns of the leatherback populations, and operating hatcheries. In these projects, eggs from the wild are allowed to hatch in a fenced-off location, before the hatchlings are introduced to the ocean, in order to improve their chances of survival. The organization also works to educate the public about turtle conservation. ""There is a lot of threat for young turtles,"" said Gagne. ""The most important are human threats, because activities, sounds, lights are ... a real problem for turtles."" Watch: Combating South Africa's rhino hunters . She said it was important to minimize human activity around beach areas used by nesting leatherbacks. The nests could be easily crushed by vehicles or beachgoers, and the noise they produced could scare off nesting females. Furthermore, because both female turtles and their hatchlings navigate their way to the ocean using the bright moonlight reflecting off the breaking surf, artificial lights could disorientate them and send them towards danger. Although leatherbacks have not traditionally been prized for their meat, their eggs have been highly sought in various parts of the world as a protein source, an aphrodisiac or for use in traditional medicines. Gabon was no exception, said Gagne. ""People used to eat turtle eggs, but only in [their] family,"" said Gagne. ""They take just a few eggs for children and wife."" See also: Kenya orphanage takes in elephant babies . ASF has encouraged locals not to eat or sell the eggs, stressing the greater economic value to the community in assisting conservation efforts. ""Turtles can be an important tourist product and if they disappear ... tourists may disappear with it. It's a source of money."" Even if the leatherback survives the hatching process, it faces many more dangers on its journey. Large numbers are killed each year on the long-lines or drift nets of commercial fishermen, in which the animals can become snared and drown within 40 minutes. Pollution also poses a threat: floating plastic bags look a lot like the jellyfish they rely on as their main food source, and have been found in the digestive systems of about half of the leatherbacks studied in recent times. If they can avoid these hazards, however, these solitary giants can live to be over 50 years old. The males of the species may never return to land after surviving the arduous hatching process. Remarkably, though, when it comes time to lay their own eggs, the female of the species will typically cross the ocean to return to precisely the same beach where she may have hatched 15 years earlier.","The leatherback is the world's largest turtle, and one of the largest species of reptile .

"(CNN) -- Summer is the best time for outdoor musical festivals and blasting music with all the windows open. We've done the legwork for you, and compiled what should be some of the best albums of the season, and the most tent-worthy festivals, organized by region. Find the ear candy that suits your taste best, and get busy listening: . ALBUMS . Queens of the Stone Age, ""... Like Clockwork,"" due June 4 . The band's sixth album, a follow-up to ""Era Vulgaris,"" welcomes founding bassist Nick Oliveri back into the band, and includes guest spots by Dave Grohl, Elton John, Trent Reznor, Mark Lanegan, Brody Dalle and Jake Shears, among others. It's one of the first meaty rock records of the summer and can be heard here. The Lonely Island, ""The Wack Album,"" due June 11 . An anecdote to the oh-so-earnest music out there, Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer are back with the hilarity, with help from friends Solange, Maya Rudolph, T-Pain, Adam Levine, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and more. ""Semicolon"" is a twisted update of ""Schoolhouse Rock,"" while ""Spring Break Anthem"" takes bromance to its logical conclusion. Kanye West, ""Yeezus,"" due June 18 . His follow-up to ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" is supposed to be a game-changer -- and we hope that doesn't mean too many Kim Kardashian songs such as ""Baby You're Awesome,"" which he played at the Met Ball and the Adult Swim upfront. A sneak peek of tracks ""Black Skinhead"" and ""New Slaves"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" suggest that he's been listening to a lot of DMX, while his collaborators include Daft Punk, Skrillex, John Legend, members of Odd Future, No I.D., Pusha T and Chief Keef. Potential tracks ""I Am a God"" and ""I Am Not a Celebrity"" also suggest 'Ye isn't leaving his ego at the door. The 20 best summer 2013 movies . Sigur RÃ³s, ""Kveikur,"" due June 18 . Now that multi-instrumentalist Kjartan Sveinsson's left to go compose elsewhere, the Icelandic band's sound has transformed from ambient music/dream-rock to something harder and darker, as indicated by first-released tracks ""Brennisteinn"" and ""Isjaki,"" which venture further into prog-metal. Don't worry, the gorgeous falsettos are still intact. MGMT, ""MGMT,"" June TBA . The duo's synth-heavy follow-up to ""Congratulations"" features influences by Aphex Twin and house music and was recorded with longtime Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann, which only can mean one thing -- expect it to be trippy. The first sneak peek track, ""Alien Days,"" was released on cassette for Record Store Day last month. The album is expected to include a version of Faine Jade's garage rocker ""Introspection"" as well as new track ""Mystery Disease."" What's new this summer on TV? Wu-Tang Clan, ""A Better Tomorrow,"" July TBA . For the 20th anniversary of ""Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),"" the Staten Island hip-hop group has a new and possibly final album, named after their 1997 track, ""A Better Tomorrow."" RZA told The New York Times that the group has one last mission: ""We need to, one time, completely, efficiently, properly represent our brand,"" while Ghostface Killah told the Guardian, ""We got verses and s---, but you gotta make sure it's right. Don't rush it."" Take your time. M.I.A., ""Mitangi,"" summer TBA . The full album was supposed to be out in April, but the Sri Lankan rapper gave us a taste of her new music (outside of last year's""Bad Girls"") during Paris Fashion Week for the runway show of the Japanese brand Kenzo. Advance word on ""Mitangi"" was that it was more upbeat than usual (""Come Walk With Me""), but leaked track ""AtTENTion"" is a bit darker: ""My existence is militant."" M.I.A. has said on Twitter that there are ""no collabs"" on this album, although she worked with producers Hit-Boy and So Japan, whose Kyle Edwards told MTV the album has ""a lot more bounce to it."" Beyonce, ""Mrs. Carter,"" summer TBA . Queen B has treated us to a few tracks so far from her fifth studio album -- ""Grown Woman,"" ""Standing on the Sun,"" ""Bow Down/I Been On"" -- so we know she's working on it. The only question is how much remains to be done before release, since she's currently on tour. Speaking of which ... FESTIVALS . Sure, most of your favorite artists are on tour this summer -- from Beyonce to Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake to Taylor Swift -- but you'll get more bang for your buck if you check out one of the many music festivals around the country. You might even discover a new fave artist while you're there: . West Coast . If you're on the West Cost (or thereabouts), you might want to go to Bumbershoot in Seattle August 31-September 2 (Labor Day weekend). The lineup at Bumbershoot includes fun., Death Cab for Cutie, MGMT, Bob Mould, The Breeders, Matt & Kim and Heart. Death Cab for Cutie plans to play the 2003 album ""Transatlanticism"" in its entirety. (You know, the one from which Seth had the poster on his wall in ""The O.C."") Also, the Experience Music Project will host an electronic dance music stage. Those farther south on the coast might want to hit up Outside Lands in San Francisco August 9-11 which will include Red Hot Chili Peppers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vampire Weekend and Willie Nelson. Midwest . If you're in the Midwest (or thereabouts), Lollapalooza in Chicago's Grant Park should be your destination August 2-4. The lineup includes Phoenix, Lana Del Rey, Queens of the Stone Age, The Cure, The Killers, The National, The Postal Service, Nine Inch Nails, Grizzly Bear and Ellie Goulding, plus plenty more. Granted, it's not the same as when Lollapalooza actually toured the country, but this is great for one-stop shopping to fulfill your summer music needs. Also in the Midwest, Kanrockas in Kansas City, Kansas, June 28-29 -- with Kendrick Lamar, Passion Pit, Pretty Lights, Tiesto and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. East Coast . Folks on the East Coast should try their luck at the Governor's Ball in New York June 7-9, which Kanye West is headlining (Guns N' Roses are slated to make an appearance, but you never know with Axl Rose). Also on the bill are the Lumineers, Kendrick Lamar and Kings of Leon. A little farther away from the Big Apple is the sure-to-be-eventful Hot 97 Summer Jam on June 2 in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which includes more Kendrick Lamar, plus A$AP Rocky, Wu-Tang Clan, Fabolous, Wale and Miguel. The Firefly Music Festival in Dover, Delaware, June 21-23 offers the Alabama Shakes, Tom Petty, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Vampire Weekend, while the Budweiser Made in America fest in Philadelphia August 31-September 1 has Beyonce leading a lineup curated by her hubby Jay-Z: Public Enemy, Phoenix, Emeli Sande, Deadmau5, Wiz Khalifa, Nine Inch Nails, Queens of the Stone Age and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. (If Hova's doc ""Jay-Z: Made in America"" is released first, watch it to get amped). The South . Down South, big festivals await. Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee, June 13-16 has an eclectic lineup this year, with seasoned vets (Paul McCartney, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, David Byrne) facing off against typical festival fare (Mumford & Sons, Wilco, The Lumineers) and some beyond the norm choices (BjÃ¶rk, R. Kelly, Wu-Tang Clan). And then there's the comedy lineup, featuring David Cross (in case you didn't get enough of him in the new season of ""Arrested Development""), Ed Helms (ditto for ""The Hangover III""), and Bob Saget, who will probably work blue. Meanwhile, the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans July 4 weekend will cool off with Jill Scott, Keyshia Cole, LL Cool J, Maxwell, Brandy and who else -- Beyonce. Does that mean we'll have to wait a little longer for her new album? We've got all summer.","There are some promising albums and music festivals on the horizon .

"(CNN) -- If anyone deserves the death penalty, surely it is a man who meticulously plans a mass murder and mercilessly carries it out, shattering the lives of innocents and their loved ones, rending the very bonds of humanity. Surely such a man deserves this punishment -- if, that is, his grip on moral reasoning has not been eviscerated by mental illness so severe that he can't be responsible for the conduct that would render him guilty under criminal laws. (Such laws have for centuries demanded blameworthiness as a prerequisite to conviction and punishment.) And if the months of trial preparation, years of hearings, trials and appeals that devour millions of dollars is the best use of those precious resources because -- in the words of the prosecutor representing the people of the state of Colorado in the case against James Holmes -- ""justice is death."" There are questions to consider as well: . Will the victims and their families somehow be made whole? Would the time and money devoted to achieving this man's death not be better spent on services and law enforcement initiatives meant to repair and prevent the mindless devastation of criminal homicide? Would this man's execution serve an ineffable impulse for justice? Would it be necessary to ensure that he does not kill again or to prevent killings by others? A claim of innocence does not stalk Holmes' trial, nor does the legacy of race discrimination that has so long infected capital punishment. He will be represented by well-trained and competent lawyers. He is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 more, unassuming individuals whose misstep that fateful July evening was gathering to enjoy a movie. The wheels of his capital prosecution have now been set in motion after the offer made by Holmes' defense counsel to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without the chance of parole was rejected by Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler. Judgments about Holmes' criminal responsibility and punishment now will be left to a jury. Under Colorado law, as in other states that authorize capital punishment, that jury will first be ""death qualified,"" that is, purged of citizens whose faith or moral precepts would not permit them to sentence Holmes to death. But there is more to capital punishment than the moral precepts and more that explains why the death penalty is a dying institution throughout the United States -- certainly in Colorado -- and worldwide. In a country topping 300 million in population and plagued annually by in excess of 13,000 murders, 78 offenders were added to the nation's death rows last year, down 75% from the 326 sentenced to die in 1995. In 2012, 43 executions were carried out, less than half of the 98 nationwide in 1998. Three convicted murderers inhabit Colorado's death row, a state that has carried out a single execution in the past 45 years. Many factors account for the dramatic downturn in the country's historic affinity for capital punishment: a revulsion against the awful prospect of executing an innocent person; the racial and social class inequities imbued in the death penalty's administration; the enormous financial burden placed on state and local budgets in supporting capital prosecutions; the availability of life imprisonment without parole to keep the streets safe. These are coupled with the paucity of evidence that capital punishment deters murder and the growing recognition that the U.S. is sorely out of step with other democracies around the world that have long since renounced it as a violation of fundamental human rights. If Holmes is convicted in a trial now scheduled to begin not earlier than February 2014, if he is sentenced to die, if no error is found by the appellate courts that will review the proceedings, and if his case is typical of other capital cases in Colorado and elsewhere, he would likely not be executed until 2029. The murder victims' family members -- those who supported a death sentence in the first place (and many will not have) -- who seek justice or finality through his execution will gain neither until then. Holmes' parents, who were in court when Brauchler announced that the prosecution would seek their son's capital punishment, will also await that long-postponed resolution, sentenced in effect to suffer through those years as well. While debating the abolition of capital punishment in England in the 1960s, Lord Chancellor Gardiner reminded the House of Lords: ""When we abolished the punishment for treason that you should be hanged, and then cut down while still alive, and then disemboweled while still alive, and then quartered, we did not abolish that punishment because we sympathized with traitors, but because we took the view that it was a punishment no longer consistent with our self-respect."" Lethal injection is some steps removed from Lord Chancellor Gardiner's description of the British practice of drawing and quartering capital offenders. Some today will maintain that drawing and quartering would be a fate richly deserved by Holmes. Yet despite the deep emotions and other justifications that might be offered in support of Holmes' execution, we might ask what good would be accomplished through this ritual act -- whether the lives of the individual victims and Coloradoans generally will be made better, and justice served by his lethal injection. We might ask whether, ultimately, such punishment would be consistent with our own self-respect. The answer to whether James Holmes should be executed arguably is less dependent on what we think about him than what it says about us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James R. Acker.","James Acker: If anyone has death penalty coming, it would seem to be James Holmes .
That's only if it's proved he's too mentally ill to be responsible in theater killings, Acker says .
He says death penalty costs too much, accomplishes little and is used less and less .
Acker: Does killing after murder make things better? Is it consistent with our self-respect?"
"(CNN) -- Legally married same-sex spouses seeking U.S. visas will now be treated the same as opposite-sex spouses, Secretary of State John Kerry announced Friday. Kerry told a meeting with consular staff in London that the change means that his department was ""tearing down an unjust and an unfair barrier that for too long stood in the way of same-sex families being able to travel as a family to the United States."" Beginning immediately, same-sex spouses of both U.S. citizens and foreigners will be treated equally as opposite-sex spouses, Kerry explained. ""As long as a marriage has been performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes it so that it is legal, then that marriage is legal under U.S. law, and every married couple would be treated exactly the same,"" he said. A State Department official told CNN on condition of not being identified that the change was expected to immediately affect up to 100 applicants. The official said the department expected the number of applicants from same-sex spouses to increase with expanded awareness of the new policy. Kerry's announcement followed a June ruling by the Supreme Court that struck down a key part of a law that denied legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided heterosexual spouses. On a 5-4 vote, the high court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as only between a man and a woman. Under DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions. At issue was whether DOMA violated equal protection guarantees in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their states.

"(CNN) -- A ninth woman is accusing San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment. Emily Gilbert told CNN Friday that she was hired to sing at a fundraising event in December. Afterward, she said, the mayor grabbed her, slid his hand down the small of her back and gave her ""tush a pat."" She said Filner had pulled her away and told his female assistant to give him and Gilbert a moment alone. He then asked her: ""Oh, Marilyn, can I get your card?"" she recalled to CNN. Gilbert bears a passing resemblance to Marilyn Monroe, but she hastened to add she was not performing as a Monroe impersonator. She said that he touched her, Filner told the singer, ""I hope to see you again, Marilyn."" Gilbert told CNN that her husband was upset but felt powerless because Filner was the mayor. CNN has made multiple efforts to contact Filner and his representatives on the latest allegations but has not gotten a response. The 70-year-old, dogged for weeks by sexual harassment allegations, served five terms in Congress before being elected mayor in 2012. Earlier this summer, when the allegations first began, Filner acknowledged ""I need help,"" and added, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them. It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong,"" he said in a statement issued July 11. Read the full statement . But Filner has also said he believes he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and he will not resign. In late July, Filner said he planned to enter ""a behavior counseling clinic"" for two weeks of intensive therapy starting August 5. In a statement given at City Hall, he apologized ""to the women I have offended."" ""The behavior I have engaged in over many years is wrong. My failure to respect women and the intimidating conduct I engaged in at times is inexcusable,"" he said. Before Gilbert, Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, and seven other women accused Filner of sexual harassment. Jackson has filed a sexual harassment suit against Filner. Read more: Mayor sued, called unfit for office . He asked the city to pay for his legal fees; the city council voted against that. Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching. She said she resigned as Filner's communications director in June after deciding the mayor would not change his behavior. None of the other women leveling claims of sexual harassment against Filner came forward until Jackson filed her suit in state court. Read more: Who are the women? One of the women is a nonprofit group founder who said she was lobbying Filner for her organization, which works with military and other families hurt by domestic violence. Morgan Rose met with Filner in 2009 at a Marie Callender's Restaurant & Bakery across the street from Filner's congressional office in Chula Vista, California, she told CNN. Filner allegedly looked her up and down, stared into her eyes and said, ""Your eyes have bewitched me,"" Rose said. Filner allegedly then made a remark along the lines of, according to Rose's paraphrasing, ""You'll have to excuse me for what's about to happen. It's your fault."" Filner then moved to her side of the booth, sat beside her, pinned her to the wall, and put his arm around her, Rose alleged. Rose avoided the advances, and Filner was suddenly interrupted by his ringing cell phone, Rose said. Filner got up from the booth, gathered his materials and left the restaurant, Rose said. Rose spoke of the incident to her closest friends and didn't pursue the matter because she feared her nonprofit might somehow suffer, she told CNN. But when Rose said that when she heard of similar accusations against Filner in recent weeks, she called a victim's hotline at the sheriff's department and spoke with a captain. Another woman, political consultant Laura Fink, has accused the mayor of patting what she described as her ""posterior"" at a fundraising event in 2005. At the time, Fink was working as the deputy manager of Filner's congressional campaign. Fink told CNN that she thinks Filner should resign. Sharon Bernie-Cloward, president of the San Diego Port Tenants Association, claims that when Filner was running for mayor in 2012, he approached her at a political event, according to San Diego's public television station. ""He touched me, actually groped me on my backside inappropriately,"" Bernie-Cloward told KPBS. ""I was left there startled and fearful. In fact, I actually had someone walk me to my car that night."" Patti Roscoe, a prominent businesswoman in San Diego's tourism and hospitality industry, told KPBS that on numerous occasions, Filner ""put in me what I guess now is the famous headlock."" ""I felt fearful, even as well as I knew him, because it was an invasion into my space,"" Roscoe told the station. ""And he would come in and try to kiss me on the lips and I'd have to squirm to get away. And just as recently as a few months ago this happened. I turned and he just slobbered down my chin. ""And I was so violated and so offended. It's just such a terrible invasion."" Veronica ""Ronne"" Froman, a retired Navy rear admiral and San Diego's former chief operating officer, told KPBS said that she and Filner, then a congressman, met a few years ago at his office after everyone had left. ""He stopped me and he got very close to me. And he ran his finger up my cheek like this and he whispered to me, 'Do you have a man in your life?' "" Froman said. ""I jumped back. I was very, very startled. And I said, 'Yes, I have a man in my life.' ""And he said, 'who?' And I said, 'Linden Blue.' He says, 'Oh, of the Blues Brothers?' And he says, 'Maybe we can get together sometime and have lunch and he can support me for mayor.' ""I was really rattled. I got in the car with the two guys I was working with and I told them never to leave me alone in a room with Bob Filner again."" Joyce Gattas, a dean at San Diego State University, told KPBS that she had several ""interactions"" with Filner ""where he's held me too tight, a kiss on the cheek which is inappropriate, hands on the knee that last too long."" The eighth woman to accuse the mayor was Lisa Curtin, who is director of government and military education at San Diego City College, according to KPBS. She said that he grabbed her hand, fingered her wedding ring and asked if it was real. She also said he tried to kiss her; she moved her head and she felt his tongue on her cheek.","Emily Gilbert tells CNN that the mayor gave her ""tush a pat"" at a fundraising event .

"(CNN) -- Last month, the New York Times published an article in its Sunday Styles section with the headline ""Sex on Campus: She Can Play That Game, Too."" It focused on what it called the casual hookup culture at my school, the University of Pennsylvania, where I am a junior. It found that many students see relationships from a purely economic standpoint, subjecting partners to a cost-benefit analysis that ultimately puts sex above romance. The piece sparked a furious response from students and alumni over its depiction of Penn women, including articles in Cosmopolitan, the Huffington Post and the Daily Pennsylvanian, our student paper. They criticized the article's sweeping generalizations about young women's sexuality and its blasÃ© conclusions about the men on campus. A section inaptly titled ""The Default Is Yes"" claims that, when alcohol is involved, guys cross the line. The author, Kate Taylor, describes an environment in which men take advantage of young, drunk women and then brag about it to their friends, suggesting that this behavior is the norm in an alcohol-driven ""frat"" culture. But not one male student was quoted in the article. I understand that men were not the focus of the piece, but when an article header is titled ""The Default Is Yes,"" the men of Penn must stand up for themselves. Opinion: Young adults and a hookup culture . Here's the reality: Not only does Penn have more than 30 fraternities representing a multitude of interests, but the members of these groups span the full range of ethnic, racial and sexual spectrums. Furthermore, as a collective student body, we take consent very seriously. Groups like One in Four, an all-male peer-education group that, according to its Facebook page, ""focuses on sexual assault awareness and rape prevention,"" includes students from both Greek and non-Greek organizations. This past year, Penn hosted a Sex Week to initiate a dialogue on campus about sexuality. Take Back the Night, an international movement and rally opposing violence against women and sexual assault, was the centerpiece of the event. The incidents presented in the article -- a guy ""scoring"" while his partner is unconscious and a young woman forced into oral sex -- are undeniably awful. If 10 to 16 forcible sex offenses were reported annually between 2009 and 2011, then we know there must have been many others that went unreported. These numbers were enough to spur the formation of a faculty-led commission to address alcohol and drug related sexual violence, but it is an issue that goes beyond policy changes. The students at Penn, not just this commission, are well aware that there is a problem, but it is a problem that we are committed to solving. There are men who speak out against violence; there are men who want monogamous relationships; there are men in fraternities who walk girls back to their dorms and make sure that they are OK, never even thinking of taking advantage of the situation. The default answer is not yes, because there is a host of college students who admire the women with whom they go to school and refuse to blame sexual violence on alcohol. These women are future world leaders and innovators who might not feel like they have time for a relationship at this stage of their lives, and we respect them even more for making that decision. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Yellin.","Daniel Yellin. An article depicted UPenn culture of female students casually ""hooking up""

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated Saturday along China's southeastern coast as Typhoon Soulik struck, where the storm was expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain. Upwards of 305,000 people left their homes in eastern China's Fujian province, according to state-run China Daily, citing the provincial flood control headquarters. Soulik made landfall Saturday afternoon, bringing it with winds that reached a top speed of 118 kilometers per hour (73 mph), according to forecasters. More than 140 flights have been canceled since Friday at Changel International Airport in the provincial capital of Fuzhou, and high-speed train services have also been suspended, authorities said. Soulik also lashed Taiwan on Saturday, where it dumped up to 8 inches of rain on the capital city of Taipei and up to 14 inches in the island's mountain region in a single day, CNN meteorologist Samantha Mohr said. This week in south-central China, downpours triggered flooding and landslides that killed dozens and wiped out thousands of homes. More than 100 are still missing, according to Sichuan province officials. The typhoon's path should spare the region, according to the China Meteorological Administration. But it will drop rain on areas in the east and north already soaked. More than 5,000 Chinese soldiers have been deployed in the province in advance of the storm to help with possible rescues, China Daily reported.","NEW: Upwards of 305,000 people have been evacuated along China's southeast coast .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A federal judge has thrown out a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the failure of levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Levees failed in several areas, flooding about 80 percent of New Orleans with water up to 20 feet deep. U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval acknowledged Wednesday that the agency failed to properly safeguard the city, but he ruled that the Corps was protected by the Flood Control Act of 1928. It shields the federal government from liability when flood control projects fail. The Corps designed the levee system that was supposed to protect the low-lying city. But after Katrina stuck the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, steel-and-concrete levees eroded and failed in several areas, flooding about 80 percent of the city with water up to 20 feet deep. In 2007, the Insurance Information Institute estimated insured losses for Katrina across Louisiana at $25.3 billion. In his ruling, Stanwood said the Corps deserves blame for its role in the flooding even if it can't be held legally responsible. ""While the United States government is immune ... it is not free, nor should it be, from posterity's judgment concerning its failure to accomplish what was its task,"" Stanwood said, lamenting his inability to take further action. ""It is hopefully within the citizens of the United States' power to address the failures of our laws and agencies,"" he said. ""If not, it is certain that another tragedy such as this will occur again."" Stanwood called the story of the Corps failure to protect New Orleans ""heart-wrenching."" ""Millions of dollars were squandered in building a levee system ... which was known to be inadequate by the Corps' own calculations,"" the ruling said. The Corps' own studies recommended upgrades that were never implemented. Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Bruno said he intends to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Bruno and other attorneys will hold a news conference Thursday in response to the ruling. Reached in Washington, Corps spokesman Gene Pawlik applauded the decision. ""We agree with the judge's ruling and can't say too terribly much more because there's other legal matters to be settled,"" he said. A number of other lawsuits remain unsettled in the aftermath of Katrina. Pawlik said the Corps is doing everything it can to improve the city's much-maligned levee system. ""We're trying to learn from the lessons of Katrina and put the best system in place for the people of New Orleans,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five year-old student Greg Dash was frustrated. He wanted to take ""fisheye""-style camera pictures without having to pay for an expensive lens, or fiddle around with a smartphone app. He wanted something light and small that he could pull from his pocket at a moment's notice. Unfortunately such a device did not exist. So, he went ahead and invented it. Measuring just four centimeters long and two centimeters high, the ""Little Cyclops"" has only two buttons and no viewing screen. However, an array of nifty features -- including a timelapse mode, 12 megapixel resolution and HD video recording capabilities -- have proven so popular with photography enthusiasts that the camera easily surpassed its funding target on the crowdsourcing website, Indiegogo. The Little Cyclops had raised $100,000 as donations came to a close this morning, almost double the initial $53,000 target. ""It's all been a bit overwhelming,"" said Dash. ""At one point I was getting an email every seven minutes and it has been just impossible to respond to everyone. ""Because the money has gone so far over the goal now though I can get other people on board to help get the cameras out,"" he added. See also: The ingenious refocusing camera . Dash says he first came up with the idea for the camera late last year when he was unable to find an affordable fisheye lens to use with his own digital SLR camera. He resolved to fashion one himself using an old camera and a lens he had custom made. When friends were impressed with the results he decided to see if he could raise the funds to put his invention into production. A manufacturer -- which he doesn't wish to reveal as he is still in the pre-production phase -- was then sourced to make a limited run of 1,000 devices completely from scratch which will be sold on a first-come first-served basis. The cameras are priced at $100 each and orders have already arrived from as far afield as Japan and Taiwan. ""It's been amazing as there has been interest from everywhere really, all over the world,"" Dash said. ""I was even invited to go on Dragon's Den (a popular British TV show where entrepreneurs pitch their products and ideas to prominent businesspeople) but there's no way I'm going on that,"" he added. See also: $30 gadget lets your eyes take control . Despite the unforeseen level of interest, Dash says he has no plans to go into the serious business of mass production any time soon. His main priority remains studying towards a PhD on the economic and social impact of wind energy development at the University of Aberystwyth in his native Wales. The success of Little Cyclops however has helped him pay-off mounting student fees and encouraged him to further test his powers of invention. He now has a new limited edition camera in the pipeline which he hopes to release at the end of the summer, although he remains tight-lipped as to what exactly that may be. ""There's going to be a view finder added and a load of other features but I don't want to give away what it is yet,"" he said. ""It's going to be able to do something that you can't do on any smartphone and would usually cost hundreds of pounds but I can do it for about Â£50 ($76)."" See also: Print a life-size robot for under $1,000 . Dash plans to listen to feedback on the Little Cyclops before finalizing the design of his next product and crowdsourcing for funding. For now, however, the main priority is to continue with his studies while indulging his passion for photography and camera development when he can. ""It's not a business really, just a project that I'm working on to see what we can do with cameras and have a bit of fun with them,"" he said. ""I really enjoy my PhD and the work that I do so if the money I make from the cameras makes that a bit easier or more comfortable for me then all the better.""","A Welsh student has invented a key-ring sized digital fisheye camera .

"(CNN) -- When Benedetto Vigna set out to create a 3D motion sensor that had the strength to resist the stress of rough and tumble yet the smarts to detect human movement, it would have been easy to look for answers in academic papers and the latest scientific theories. Instead, the Italian nuclear-physicist-come-microelectronic-specialist cast conventional wisdom aside and sought inspiration in the architectural splendor of the Japanese city of Kyoto. It was here, in early 2003, that Vigna came to wonder at the towering Toji Pagoda -- a 58-meter-tall wooden structure that has remained unmoved for more than 1,200 years despite being situated in an active earthquake zone. See also: The new age of driverless cars . As he paced around the majestic five-storey monument, Vigna began to consider whether he could transfer the engineering philosophy that underpinned the ancient building to the problems he faced in the high-tech world of micro-processers. ""There's a single pillar (in the Toji Pagoda) and then it is like a flower with different levels of floors,"" Vigna explained. ""When there is an earthquake ... structure(s) like this don't go down because you have only one pillar. Usually if you have two pillars, because of movement in the earth, then you may have some breakage. ""Instead of making (the sensor devices) like we were at the time with a lot of pillars ... we found a way to make a single pillar structure to make it more robust."" Vigna's observation led to a flurry of excited development at his company, STMicroelectronics, in Milan, Italy, upon his return from Japan. Just five weeks later and the first micro-electrical mechanical sensor (MEMS) device with Vigna's single-pillar theory was validated by his colleagues. MEMS were not a new invention at the time but using this off-beat technique to make the tiny silicon components more resilient whilst maintaining performance was a major breakthrough. After many years of research ""we had the industrial solution from a performance point of view, form a cost point of view (and) from a quality point of view to realize our business idea,"" Vigna enthused. See also: Teen builds one-man submarine for $2,000 . The first company to pick up STMicroelectronics' newly developed technology -- perhaps aptly given its eastern origins -- was Nintendo in 2005. The Japanese gaming giant used the devices to detect and interact with user movement in the control pads of its Nintendo Wii system (which subsequently became one of the most popular computer consoles of all time). Versions of Vigna's MEMS chips have since been applied to desktop computers and are now an integral feature of smartphone and tablet devices. MEMS is the component responsible for enabling users to flick between apps, tilt their smartphones to engender movement in a game they may be playing as well as stabilizing camera images when pictures are taken. Without Vigna's eureka moment, it can safely be concluded that cellphone technology would be nowhere near as advanced as it is today. ""Sometimes I think about this and I am glad to see that what I started (has been useful) and I like when I hear people, especially in the crisis times, saying thanks to MEMS we have a job,"" Vigna said. See also: Ex-cop builds robot from household goods . While content with the progress of his invention thus far, Vigna believes MEMS still has much more to give in the years to come. The technology has already ballooned into a billion dollar industry with 18 million sensors now produced every week (of which STMicroelectronics are responsible for around 60%). He highlights a strew of potential new uses, including indoor mapping, healthcare devices that measure movement over a certain period as well as a exciting new smartphone applications. ""Today there are many applications using MEMS,"" Vigna said. ""If you go on the internet you are looking at about tens of thousands of applications."" ""This (field) is a place where big companies, but also start-ups, can think about new applications and make it happen,"" he added.","An ancient Japanese temple inspired an Italian inventor to create a piece of technology vital for smartphones .

"(EW.com) -- It's bizarre to think that 2 Guns and The Smurfs 2 are competitors in any regard, but the pics happened to open in theaters on the same weekend. While the R-rated, buddy thriller and the PG-rated CG and live action sequel about some mystical blue creatures probably aren't drawing the same audience, in the wold of box office returns, only the winner matters. And it turns out that more people turned out for the male-dominated violent comedy than for another kid-friendly sequel. 2 Guns (CinemaScore: B+) opened at first place, earning an estimated $27.4 million for the weekend. This is a squarely solid opening for stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. According to exit polls, males, who comprised about 51 percent of the audience, gave the movie an A-- CinemaScore. For director Baltasar KormÃ¡kur (The Deep), this opening is a career high. The charisma and chemistry of two stars seems key to the appeal, especially for a movie with such an ambiguous and generic ""action"" title. Playing in 3,025 locations and averaging about $9,025 per screen, 2 Guns exceeded Universal's expectations for the weekend, which had put the movie in the $20 million range. Co-financed by Emmett/Furla Films and Foresight Unlimited with an estimated production budget of about $61 million, the big question is: How the movie will fare in weeks to come? It remains to be seen whether or not the solid reviews and word-of-mouth buzz can help make it significant hit. The Wolverine fell about 59.1% from its opening weekend to bring in about $21.7 million during this frame. Playing on 3,924 screens, Fox's $120 million X-Men pic now boasts a domestic total of $95 million. Overseas, the well-reviewed Hugh Jackman-starrer has made an estimated $160.2 million, bringing its worldwide total to $255.2 million. The third place spot went to The Smurfs 2 (CinemaScore: A--), which made about $18.2 million over the three-day weekend, bringing its domestic total up to $27.8 million. As we mentioned about yesterday, the domestic returns don't really matter around this sequel, as it's all about how the movie (made for $105 million) performs internationally. Playing in 43 overseas markets, The Smurfs 2 made about $52.5 million overseas. Worldwide, it has taken $80.3 million. Though it will be pitted against the other animated offerings of the season, The Smurfs 2 is really only competing with the success of its 2011 predecessor, which made $536.7 million worldwide ($421.1 million of which was overseas). The Conjuring blew past the $100 million mark, adding a $13.7 million weekend. Unlike most of the movies on the slate, The Conjuring actually added theaters to its count, helping to account for a modest 38.5 percent drop from the previous weekend. After three weeks in theaters, director James Wan's horror film has made about $108.6 million and looks poised to continue its streak in the weeks to come, especially considering it'll exist without direct competition until You're Next opens on August 23. Despicable Me 2 came in fifth place this weekend with about $10.4 million. After five weeks in theaters, the animated juggernaut is the second-highest-performing movie of the year, behind only Iron Man 3. So far, the sequel has also brought in about $387 million internationally, with a global total of $713.7 million. Here's an at-a-glance view of the top 5: . 1. 2 Guns -- $27.4 million . 2. The Wolverine -- $21.7 million . 3. The Smurfs 2 -- $18.2 million . 4. The Conjuring -- $13.7 million . 5. Despicable Me 2 -- $10.4 million . The Spectacular Now also opened this weekend in four theaters (in New York and Los Angeles) to about $200,000, with a $50,000 location average. The lauded high school-set, coming-of-age drama starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley has garnered significant buzz since opening at the Sundance Film Festival in February and could be another gigantic hit for new film distributor A24 (Spring Breakers, The Bling Ring). Next weekend should be exciting in the box office race: We're the Millers and Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters both open on Wednesday, while Elysuim and Planes hit theaters on Friday. It will be interesting to see how a comedy, a sci-fi dystopia pic, and another animated feature will factor into the game, and whether or not they'll all be able to secure top spots in the rankings.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani police have revised the cause of a blast that killed 83 people on Saturday, saying a suicide bomber was behind the attack that pulverized a busy marketplace. The explosion targeted Shiite Muslims in Hazara, on the outskirts of the southwestern city of Quetta, authorities said. Police now say a suicide bomber, driving an explosive-laden water tanker, rammed the vehicle into buildings at the crowded marketplace. The water tanker carried between 800 and 1,000 kilograms (1,760 to 2,200 pounds) of explosive material, Quetta police official Wazir Khan Nasir said. Previously, police said explosives were packed in a parked water tanker and were remotely detonated. The blast demolished four buildings of the marketplace, leaving dozens dead and 180 injured. The banned Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack, spokesman Abu Bakar Sadeeq told CNN Sunday. The assault left some wondering what could stop the bloodshed in Quetta. Zulfiqar Ali Magsi, the governor and chief executive of Balochistan province, told reporters Saturday that law enforcement agencies were incapable of stopping such attacks and had failed to maintain law and order in Quetta. Pakistan, which is overwhelmingly Sunni, has been plagued by sectarian strife and attacks for years. Last month, two deadly suicide bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Quetta known as Alamdar Road killed 85 Shiite Muslims. Police described that double bombing as one of the worst attacks on the Shiite minority. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi also claimed responsibility for that dual attack. According to its interpretation of Islam, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi believes that Shiites are not Muslims. The group believes Shiites insult close companions of Muslim's prophet Muhammad. Therefore, the militant group believes killing Shiites is a justified in Islam. Families of victims from Alamdar Road protested for several days by laying their relatives' bodies on a road in Quetta until the federal government dissolved the provincial government and imposed governor rule. Although Balochistan is the largest Pakistani province in Pakistan, analysts and some locals have criticized the federal government for neglecting it, leading to instability. The Shiite community has repeatedly asked for more protection but to no avail. During the Alamdar Road protest, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf met with Shiites in Quetta, Pakistani media reported. He agreed to toss out the provincial government and putting a governor in charge. All administrative powers of the provincial government were given to the governor, who deployed paramilitary forces to maintain law and order in Quetta. Nasir Habib reported from Islamabad, and Holly Yan reported from Atlanta. CNN's Shaan Khan in Islamabad also contributed to this report.","NEW: The banned Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claims responsibility .

"(EW.com) -- Sometimes even earning the No. 1 spot can be seen as a modest disappointment, or at least that's what the new narrative around The Wolverine (CinemaScore: A-) would have you believe. With no competition this weekend, The Wolverine pulled in about $55 million domestically in 3,924 locations — on target with studio estimates, but far below tracking projections, some of which went so far as to predict an $80 million weekend. With the majority of screens showing the Fox tentpole in 3-D, the movie averaged about $14,016 per screen on an estimated budget of $120 million, so this weekend's performance is really nothing to scoff at. Interestingly, at $55 million, the film is right in line with 2011′s X-Men: First Class which made $55.1 million in its first three days at the box office in early June. But so far The Wolverine is holding steady as the second lowest opening of all of Fox's six X-Men movies — that title goes to the first in the series which opened at $54.5 million. But X-Men was also released 13 years ago with no 3-D surcharges, so it's not an entirely fair comparison. The Wolverine opened internationally this weekend as well to grosses of $86.1 million, playing on 15,152 screens in 101 territories, bringing its worldwide total to about $141.1 million. Fox estimates that audiences were about 58 percet male, and 42 percent under the age of 25. EW: 'The Wolverine' claws its way to a $21 million Friday . The Conjuring held its ground in second place with $22.1 million, gaining momentum throughout the weekend. It fell only 47.1 percent from its opening last week. The R-rated $20 million horror movie has made about $83.9 million so far, making it director James Wan's biggest film to date, surpassing even the adjusted grosses for 2004′s Saw, which clocked in at $72.5 million. In third place, Despicable Me 2 continues to rack in the profits, earning $16 million despite losing nearly 344 theaters. But the big story is that Universal's $76 million sequel has passed the $300 million mark after 26 days in theaters, and can now boast a domestic profit of about $306.4 million and a worldwide total of $660.9 million. Currently, it's the second-highest-grossing movie of the past year, trailing behind Iron Man 3 by about $100 million. Turbo fell about 37.5 percent from its opening weekend and earned an estimated $13.3 million to take fourth place. Despite a respectable second-week drop, the animated, radioactive snail story still floundered out of the gates. With an estimated budget of $135 million, the Ryan Reynolds-voiced family movie has only made about $55.8 million so far, and things aren't going to get easier as the weeks go by. The little blue guys are coming, after all. Smurfs 2 opens wide on Wednesday and could be the death knell for poor Turbo. EW: Casting Net - Meet your new Lance Armstrong . Rounding out the top five is Adam Sandler's Grown Ups 2 with $11.5 million, edging the domestic grosses for the raunchy, star-studded comedy past the $100 million mark. Amazingly, it's still only Sandler's 15th-highest-grossing moving, but it has been in theaters for just three weeks, so there's room to grow. Fruitvale Station and The Way, Way Back, both Sundance movies, expanded their theater counts this weekend. Playing in 1,064 theaters, The Weinstein Company's Fruitvale Station made the top 10 with weekend grosses of about $4.7 million, and an overall domestic total of $6.3 million. Ryan Coogler's independent drama chronicling the true story of Bay Area resident Oscar Grant's last day won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The themes and events are also quite resonant with current events, and could perhaps be another factor as to why the film is performing so well. Meanwhile, The Way, Way Back, from the writing, directing, and acting team of Jim Rash and Nat Faxon (who won an Oscar for their adapted screenplay for The Descendants), expanded to 886 theaters and took the 11th spot with $918K. The To-Do List, Aubrey Plaza's first major starring role, opened in 591 theaters and earned an estimated $1.5 million — right on track with estimates from CBS Films. With a production budget of $1.5 million as well, the R-rated sex comedy also stars Bill Hader and Rachel Bilson. Finally, Woody Allen's latest, Blue Jasmine, opened in six theaters in New York and Los Angeles and brought in $613K, with a stunning $102K per-theater average. Starring Cate Blanchett as a fallen 1 percenter, Allen's well-reviewed elegant ode to wealth, mental illness, and happiness is one of the first films of the year to elicit earnest Oscar buzz. Despite its PG-13 rating, it's also one of the few serious adult films in theaters at the moment. Check back in next weekend for more summer box office.

We already know she fancies labels such as Alexander McQueen and Jenny Packham, but now we can say, with certainty, that she dons blue more than any other color, and she wears boat necks to 42% of the engagements she attends. And while her style choices can influence sales -- a phenomenon dubbed the Kate Effect -- designers such as Roland Mouret say it's not so cut and dried. ""The kind of people who like Kate's style are not the kind to rush out and copy her dress,"" Mouret told British Vogue. ""You don't see hundreds of women running around looking like her.

"(CNN) -- If someone in your house is mad for One Direction, get ready to lay out some serious cash. The boy band tops the list of most expensive concert tickets with the average ticket costing $674.23. That's a lot of hours of babysitting for your average teen girl to be able to buy her own ticket. According to Jesse Lawrence, founder and chief executive officer of the ticket search engine, TiqIQ, there are a few reasons for the super-sized prices. Acts such as the Rolling Stones price their tickets high in the primary market (Companies such as TicketMaster, Live Nation and your venue's box office) so that the secondary ticket market (those brokers/companies that resell those tickets) can't make as much money off of their show. So while an upper level ticket for One Direction may have originally been as inexpensive as $29.50 from a primary seller, those prices rise much higher when they are scarce and being sold in a secondary market. Lawrence said the Rolling Stones strategy of pricing their primary tickets high can backfire as the group recently discovered when they found themselves unable to sell some tickets. But it's the secondary markets that help to keep the ticket prices high in the rafters, Lawrence said. ""They get sold in the primary market for, say a round number of 100 bucks, a broker buys those and says 'I'm going to mark these tickets up to $300 because I think that's what the market demands,'"" he said. There also is the matter of the scarcity of tickets. Many fans have experienced the utter frustration of waiting for tickets to go on sale at 11 a.m. only to have a site register that there are no more tickets available just minutes later. But what about those phrases you have to type in that ensure that you are a human and not a bot attempting to buy blocks of tickets? It matters not, Lawrence said. ""One of the worst examples of that was a Justin Bieber concert in California,"" he said. ""Only 8% of the tickets went on sale to the general public. The rest were getting sold through his fan club, through [credit] cardholder [special promotions,] and artist hold-backs. Literally, that on sale to the public is a really small percentage of tickets."" New Jersey U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell has drafted legislation that would require more transparency. ""What I want is that people will know ahead of time how many tickets are going to go on sale for the general public,"" Pascrell told Today. If you are lucky enough to score one, it's going to cost you. The Brits are the hottest tickets this summer with the Rolling Stones clocking in just behind their countrymen, One Direction, with the average ticket price being $637.50. Super Diva Beyonce came in third place, commanding an average $358.97. Such prices are the reason Rolling Stone magazine recently reported that ""The days of seeing the world's biggest rock and pop bands for a few bucks, plus a little extra for parking and service fees, are as long gone as Peter Frampton's curly hair."" Lawrence said fans are willing to pay for a chance to see (maybe) the Rolling Stones last concert or Beyonce's moves in person. ""There is a lot of interest in the live concert experience, especially with the Internet and TV even, concerts are kind of the last thing that you can't experience the same way in your living room or on your computer,"" he said.","Summer concert tickets are averaging several hundred dollars .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer secured a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title to dash the hopes of Andy Murray and a partisan Centre Court crowd. Federer made it 17 grand slam titles to his name after a two-and-a-half-year drought and matched the haul of American Pete Sampras at the All England Club. The Swiss will return to the top of the world rankings as a result of his 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 victory, meaning he will match his hero Sampras' record of 286 weeks at No. 1. For Murray, the first Briton to reach a men's singles final at Wimbledon in 74 years, it represented his fourth defeat in major finals, and his pain was acutely felt by a fervent crowd at Wimbledon. Sampras: I hated (and loved) Wimbledon . Federer's triumph was his first at Wimbledon since 2009, with his last major win coming at the Australian Open in 2010 when he also beat Murray. ""It's amazing,"" Federer told the host broadcaster. ""It equals me with Pete Sampras, who is my hero, so it feels amazing. ""I think I played some of my best tennis in the last couple of matches. It's worked out so many times here that I play my best in semis and the final. I couldn't be more happy -- it feels being great being back here as the winner. It's a great moment."" Federer's victory means he is only the second player in the men's game to have held the top ranking over the age of 30, alongside Andre Agassi. ""As we know, the world No. 1, you don't get that gifted,"" he added. ""I was up two sets to love in the quarters last year, two sets to love up at the U.S. Open ... so many chances, maybe I got nervous, maybe the other guys were just too good. ""I never stopped believing and I started playing more even though I have a family and it all worked out, I got great momentum and confidence and it all came together. It's a magical moment for me. ""I've obviously gone through some struggles as well, a lot of changes have happened in my life since so this one comes at the right time, as any grand slam victory."" Murray had started well, spurred on by a fervent home crowd desperate to see a first British winner in the men's singles since Fred Perry in 1936, breaking Federer in the very first game. Wimbledon grass faces Olympic race against time and nature . And though the 25-year-old then lost his own serve, he summoned another break to take his first set in a grand slam final. As a tense second set neared its climax, Federer then executed two perfect drop shots to stun Murray and take it 7-5. The third set was locked at 1-1 when a heavy burst of rain arrived, forcing the players off court as the recently installed roof was closed. The change in atmosphere played into Federer's hands as he reappeared rejuvenated. An epic sixth game of the set lasted for 20 minutes and 10 deuces as Murray desperately tried to cling on to his serve. But once Federer secured the break he quickly finished the set and then broke for 3-2 in the final set, sinking to the turf as a cross court forehand from Murray handed him his seventh title. Afterwards, a tearful Murray joked: ""I'm getting closer. I'd like to congratulate Roger. I was getting asked the other day after I won my semifinal, was this my best chance because Roger is 30 now? Well, he's not bad for a 30-year-old. ""He played a great tournament. He showed what fight he still has in him. So, congratulations Roger you deserve it."" Murray saluted the fans who offered him such support throughout the tournament, and remarked on the pressure that comes with carrying a nation's hopes of finally ending a 76-year British wait for the men's title. Expectations had been raised even higher after Jonathan Marray became Britain's first men's doubles champion at Wimbledon since 1936 on Saturday. ""Everyone always talks about the pressure of playing at Wimbledon but it's not because of the people watching,"" Murray said. ""They make it so much easier to play. The support has been incredible so thank you.""","Roger Federer wins his seventh Wimbledon title beating Andy Murray 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 .

"(CNN) -- Defense contractor KBR was negligent in exposing National Guard soldiers to toxic chemicals at a water plant in Iraq, a federal jury in Portland, Oregon, found Friday. The lawsuit was filed by a dozen National Guard soldiers, who accused the defense contractor of ""knowingly"" exposing them to the carcinogen hexavalent chromium while providing security to civilian workers at the Qarmat Ali water facility in 2003. While the jury found KBR negligent in the case, it did not find that the contractor committed fraud. The total judgment was more than $85 million. Each soldier was awarded $850,000 in noneconomic damages and $6.25 million in punitive damages. ""The Oregon Qarmat Ali veterans are very pleased with the verdict,"" said David Sugarman, one of the attorneys representing the 12 soldiers. KBR attorney Geoffrey Harrison said the company, which was involved in the Iraqi facility's restoration, would appeal. ""KBR did safe, professional and exceptional work in Iraq under difficult circumstances -- and multiple U.S. Army officers testified under oath that KBR communicated openly and honestly about potential health risks."" In their complaint, the soldiers said they suffer from respiratory and skin ailments as a result of the exposure and ""now require ongoing, expensive follow-up health care."" U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer called the jury's decision ""an important milestone."" ""I've met with these brave soldiers and hearing their ordeal made me heartsick. They have clearly been damaged as a result of their service and negligence on the part of the contractor.""

"(CNN) -- A series of cities are in the grip of soaring temperatures this weekend. From Phoenix, to Las Vegas, to Death Valley in California, which set a world-record high a century ago. Death Valley was the hottest spot Saturday, reaching 127 degrees, and Arizona and Nevada continued in a record-setting heat wave that is forecast to last through Tuesday. The heat may have led to the death of a man in his 80s in Las Vegas, where the temperature Saturday hit 115 degrees, tying a record set in 1994, the National Weather Service said. Paramedics found the man dead in his home, which did not have air conditioning, said Las Vegas Fire & Rescue spokesman Tim Szymanski. He died of cardiac arrest and the heat may have contributed to his death, although the coroner will make the final determination, he said. The heatwave comes just a couple weeks before the 100th anniversary of what the National Weather Service calls the ""highest reliably recorded air temperature on Earth"" -- 134 degrees on July 10, 1913, in Death Valley's Greenland Ranch. At Furnace Creek, the heat will stay on full blast through Tuesday, at least. At night, the mercury will drop to a relatively cool 96 degrees. ""We have more work than we can handle,"" said Max Ghaly of Cathedral City Air Conditioning and Heating in Palm Springs, California. ""We're running all over the place trying to do what we can."" The only time the technicians can have some cold air, Ghaly told CNN, is when they're driving. Fun aside, the heat wave scorching the Southwest is dangerous, as 170 concertgoers found out Friday evening in Las Vegas, according to the fire department. Ambulances plucked them out of 110-degree heat in an open-air music venue and drove them to a shady spot, where they could sit down and drink water. Another 30 people were treated for heat ailments in local hospitals. Heat hurts your insides too . ""I'm not worried as much about the people who have lived here a while,"" said Sgt. Troy Stirling, police spokesman in the Lake Havasu, Arizona, near the California state line. ""It's more the tourists coming into the area, even from Southern California, who aren't used to this kind of heat."" A man driving from northern Nevada to southern Arizona stopped at a Las Vegas highway exit Saturday after his car's air conditioning unit broke and he drove for several hours without it, Szymanski said. He stopped at the exit to call 911, and when paramedics arrived, they found the man suffering from heat stroke. Civic and emergency officials throughout the Southwest say that if there was ever a time to worry, this would be it. The reason isn't just the oppressive heat that is plaguing the region: It's the fact it is expected to hang around, and possibly even get worse, over the next few days. Extended heat warnings . The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning for large parts of California, Nevada and Arizona, and a heat advisory for other parts of Nevada. Many of the excessive heat warnings extend through Tuesday night. Starting Wednesday, temperatures will drop by a couple of degrees, moving closer to normal temperatures. ""It'll still be hot, but not as intense as we're seeing now,"" said Chris Stachelski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. Forecasters say temperatures through the weekend could rival a 2005 heat wave that killed 17 people in the Las Vegas area. The culprit is a high pressure dome that's blocking cooler air coming down from the Pacific Northwest, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. That system won't begin to break up until early next week, she said. As a result, Phoenix residents saw a high of 119 degrees on Saturday -- setting a new record for the day. Temperatures should max out at 113 in the coming days in Palm Springs, California. It's not like sunset will provide much respite, as temperatures may not drop below 90 degrees in many places, even in the middle of the night. Some heat wave advice . ""The No. 1 thing is to absolutely know your limitations and to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water,"" Stachelski advises those coping with the high temperatures. He recommends limiting time outdoors. For those who have to do any strenuous activity outside, he advises doing it in the early morning, evening or simply putting it off until the end of the week when the temperatures are lower. Such high temperatures can put people at risk for heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can be fatal. The elderly, infants, children and people with chronic medical conditions are the most prone to heat stress. Heat exhaustion is the body's response to an excessive loss of water and salt, usually through excessive sweating, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include extreme weakness or fatigue, dizziness, nausea and fast and shallow breathing. Heat stroke is even more serious and happens when the body becomes unable to cool down, the CDC says. It can cause death or permanent disability if untreated. Heat stroke symptoms include hallucinations, chills, confusion and dizziness, along with slurred speech. To protect against heat stress, the CDC advises spending time in air-conditioned places, staying informed of heat warning and drinking lots of fluids. CNN's Joe Sutton, Michael Martinez and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","NEW: The heat may have contributed to the death of a Las Vegas man .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson ""had a real monkey on his back"" with a longtime drug addiction, his family kept it secret from the world and it led to his overdose death, a lawyer for AEG Live said. The concert promoter's defense against the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit began Tuesday and will include testimony from ""all of the many, many doctors"" who treated Jackson over the past decades, AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam said. AEG Live executive John Meglin, who is the CEO of the Concerts West division, returns to the stand Wednesday after testifying Tuesday that Dr. Conrad Murray's request for $5 million to work as Jackson's personal physician was a topic at a meeting of the company's executive committee. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish said that was an important revelation that would help his case. Panish pressed Meglin on the question of if he agreed with his boss, AEG Live President Randy Phillips, who testified that he thought Jackson was the greatest artist of all time. ""I think that Michael's very big in the pop world, but the Rolling Stones are bigger, or Led Zeppelin,"" Megline said. ""I'm a rocker."" Defense witnesses will also include a parade of Jackson family members, including a return appearance by matriarch Katherine Jackson, who just concluded two days of testimony as her lawyers presented their case. ""They kept his private world private as best they could and now they would like to blame somebody else for things that only they knew privately,"" Putnam said. Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live, which was producing and promoting his comeback concerts, is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray. Jackson's mom faces cross examination in death trial . Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the coroner ruled was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. The doctor told investigators he was using the drug to treat Jackson's insomnia as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" debut in London. Jackson, not AEG Live, chose and controlled Murray, Putnam argued. He said in his opening statements at the start of the trial 12 weeks ago he would show jurors ""ugly stuff"" about Jackson to prove that AEG Live executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving in the privacy of Jackson's bedroom. Michael's mom speaks . The appearance of Katherine Jackson, Michael Jackson's 83-year-old mother, as a concluding witness in her case gave Putnam a chance to probe what family members knew about Jackson's drug abuse history. ""There are a lot of enormous inconsistencies in what is being said and what the truth is,"" Putnam told reporters Monday after he finished his cross-examination of Katherine Jackson. She ""reported to the world and to the press that he never had a problem with prescription drugs,"" that he never entered drug rehab and that the family never attempted an intervention to stop his drug use, he said. ""As we now know, Michael Jackson had a longtime problem with prescription drugs, so what had been told to the world during his lifetime wasn't true."" The Jackson family's lawyer, Brian Panish, said AEG Live executives were ""in the best position to help Michael Jackson"" when they saw his health deteriorating in the last two months of his life. Show director Kenny Ortega sent a series of e-mails to top AEG Live executives warning them that Jackson showed ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" at a rehearsal. ""I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP,"" Ortega wrote. ""It's like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not waiting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state."" Production manager John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl sent an e-mail to producers saying he ""watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now."" ""They knew he was having a problem,"" Panish said. ""He needed them for this concert. They could have easily told him, 'Look, until you go see the appropriate doctor and come back, we're not going on with the rehearsal.' They're the only ones that really had the ability to do something about it and they chose not to."" Ortega testified this month that he thought AEG Live should have halted production on the show until Jackson was well. Mother: 'I want to know what really happened' Despite the e-mail evidence and testimony, Putnam insisted Monday that AEG Live executives knew nothing about Jackson's failing health. ""They had little interaction with Michael Jackson in terms of the production and promotion of that,"" Putnam said, adding that the executives ""certainly"" did not know ""that he was having any problems."" But Panish said the executives should have known: ""He was deteriorating in front of their own eyes."" ""They watched him waste away,"" Katherine Jackson testified. Jackson testified in her first day on the stand Friday that she filed the lawsuit ""because I want to know what really happened to my son."" During cross-examination, the AEG Live lawyer played a clip from an interview she gave to NBC a year after her son's death in which she said Michael Jackson had hired the doctor. In response, her lawyer argued she made the statement before seeing AEG e-mails indicating that the company hired him. Putnam questioned her about a statement she and several of her children signed in 2007 accusing People Magazine of publishing ""untrue and inaccurate information"" about Michael Jackson's drug use. ""We categorically deny ever planning, participating in, or having knowledge of any kind of intervention, whatsoever,"" the statement read. Katherine Jackson acknowledged, however, that she participated in an attempted intervention with her son at his Neverland Ranch in 2002. ""I wanted them to stop lying,"" she testified, referring to the magazine. ""I was worried about all the lies they were telling about the family."" ""Was it a lie to say your son had a problem with prescription drugs?"" Putnam asked. ""He did not have a problem,"" she insisted. Putnam later asked Jackson's mother if she liked to ""shut your ears to bad things."" ""I don't like to hear bad news,"" she said. Jackson appeared combative at times when Putnam cross-examined her, punching back at his questions. ""What does this have to do with my son dying?"" she replied at one point. ""I think she was badgered, but that wasn't the first time,"" Panish told reporters later. ""In her deposition, she was asked questions like, ""Does your husband ever beat you?'"" Doctor: Promoter knew about Jackson's drug dependency . For the pretrial deposition, she was questioned for about 12 hours over three days. Putnam denied he was being overly aggressive in his questioning of her. ""I just wanted to know the facts from her and there was no reason to be aggressive with her,"" he said. ""She was combative, but you can't blame Mrs. Jackson for that. None of us want to find ourselves in a situation where we're having to confront the very public death of our child."" Putnam refused to discuss why he asked Katherine Jackson in the deposition if her husband, Joe Jackson, ever beat her. ""What occurred in those depositions was confidential at Mrs. Jackson's request, therefore I am not at liberty to go into to the private matters that we went into in that deposition,"" Putnam told CNN. However, Katherine Jackson and her lawyer both brought up the question in court Monday. ""I am not going to go into what we went into about the very tragic history Michael Jackson had with his parents and father over the period of his life,"" Putnam said. ""That is something we did not go into on the stand because it is not relevant. I'm not bringing that up."" Testimony is expected to last into September, the judge told the jury.","AEG Live will question ""all of the many, many doctors"" who treated Jackson, lawyer says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two charges against Chris Brown were dropped Tuesday, but the singer is still accused of hit and run after a minor traffic crash. Brown's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf and a judge ordered him to show up at a sheriff's station within a week to be officially booked on the charge, according to a court spokesman. The prosecutor dismissed charges of driving without a license and driving without proof of insurance during a hearing Tuesday in a Van Nuys, California, court. Brown allegedly sped away from the accident scene in May after a confrontation with the driver of another car, having refusing to provide his name, driver's license and insurance information. The hit and run charge threatens Brown's freedom since it led a judge to revoke his probation last week in connection with his conviction in the beating of his girlfriend, Rihanna. The judge allowed Brown to remain free until a trial is held. A Brown representative said last week that the singer expected all of the charges to be dropped and probation reinstated this week. Brown, 24, was already facing a probation violation trial after prosecutors accused him of not completing the community labor ordered for his 2009 felony assault conviction. Brown was ordered to return to court on August 16 for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand. If it does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna. A woman whose Mercedes was allegedly rear-ended by a Range Rover that Brown was driving on a Los Angeles street told investigators that he ""went ballistic"" after the traffic accident and screamed at her. According to the police report on the incident, the other driver, Olga Gure, quoted Brown as shouting at her: ""You are a b---h!"" The report added more from Gure, who quoted Brown as saying, ""Who do you think you are, b---h? Do you think if you driving Mercedes so got money, b---h? Do you think I am just a black n----r? I got more money than you, b---h!"" The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said. When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed, ""Don't touch her, don't touch her,"" Gure said. ""I was so shocked that I was speechless,"" she said. ""Just a moment ago he was a nice guy. After screaming some insulting nonsense for a while longer, he slammed a door and drove away fast and noisy."" Brown's Twitter defense . Brown used his Twitter account to protest the traffic charges last month: . ""It's not a hit and run if u get out the car, exchange information (who has NO DAMAGE to either cars).This is really ridiculous"" ""I have a valid drivers license and I gave the woman the right info. She saw cameras and wanted to make a scene."" ""She contacted the cops thinking of a payday from Chris Brown when I followed the proper procedures."" ""My lawyers will be contacting you. I will not stand for this bullying and yellow journalism!"" ""My profile pic is the pic I took of the persons car after ""the hit and run"". NO damage. Just a dirty car. once again, I gotta clear my name"" ""I work my ass off to provide for my entire family. I've made mistakes in the past and have worked hard to be a better person. "" ""19-24 years of age. I don't have all the answers and you can't show me a person that age who has it figured out. We live and grow. Let me live"" Other probation violation charge . Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years' probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. The judge allowed him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct supervision of the police chief. In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. ""And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,"" Geragos said. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has ""tortured"" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. The prosecutor is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Chris Brown must report for booking within a week .

"Wageningen, The Netherlands (CNN) -- The dandelion's bright yellow bloom and fuzzy, parachute-like seeds are a familiar sight across the continents. But scientists at Dutch biotech firm KeyGene believe the flower's true beauty could lie beneath the soil. The dandelion's roots contain latex, the milky liquid that is a source for natural rubber and the origin for the plant's name in a number of languages (the Danish for ""dandelion"" translates as ""milk pot""). Global demand for natural rubber is expected to outstrip supply by 20% by 2020. But KeyGene believes that the dandelion can be developed into an important natural source of the commodity, worth more than $100 billion a year. The dandelion's roots are smaller than ideal for commercial rubber production. So KeyGene is putting the plant through a process of plant phenotyping in order to develop a variety of dandelion with a fatter root and higher yield, that would be better suited for industrial processing. ""We are making ... crosses between the Russian dandelion and the common dandelion using those modern DNA profiling technologies,"" says KeyGene CEO Arjen Van Tunen. ""We're making and developing a better rubber dandelion, which produces more rubber because of an increased size."" Read also: The bionic hand with the human touch . The company's process, he said, involved analyzing different specimens of a given crop in its greenhouses, scanning them for mutations that delivered beneficial characteristics in terms of yield, quality, sustainability or tolerance to drought and disease. The genetic material of strains with desirable characteristics was then isolated and sequenced to create improved crops -- fungus-resistant wheat, high-yield rye, or heat-resistant cabbage -- that were ""better suited for the conditions"" of the future, he said. With the global population tipped to hit nine billion by 2050, he said, and a growing proportion switching to animal protein, agricultural production would need to be doubled to feed the planet. Creating improved crops -- such as those that could return higher yields on more marginal land -- was essential to achieving this, he said. Multinational tire manufacturer Apollo Vredestein also thinks dandelion rubber has potential, and is collaborating on the project with KeyGene. Peter Snel, Apollo Vredestein's research and development director, said prototype tires had already been produced. Commercial dandelion tires were likely to be ready for production in as little as five to ten years, ""as soon as material is ready in volume to be put in to tires,"" he said. Snel was confident that harvesting rubber from the tiny flowers would be economically viable. ""Raw materials are a big part in the cost price of tires,"" he said. ""Investment in this will pay back."" Read also: Expert advice for inventors on how to get your product on the market . Van Tunen said the KeyGene's methods were a quicker and cheaper way of improving crops than genetic modification -- and differed from that process in one crucial aspect. ""We don't introduce a gene from a different species into our crops. We always take advantage of DNA that is already in that species itself,"" said Van Tunen. ""You might say we speed up the natural breeding system that is all ready there for hundreds of years ... We are taking advantage of the natural evolution process and speeding it up."" That was an important distinction for some of the company's customers, as there remained ""a lot of resistance in Europe"" to genetic modification, he said. ""Many of the growers in Europe want genetically improved crops, but not GM crops. So for them we can provide an alternative,"" he said. ""We have developed a number of technologies which enable us to very quickly genetically improve crops in a very natural way without crossing the species barriers, but still achieving the yield improvements or the resistance improvements.""","A Dutch biotech company is developing dandelions for commercial rubber production .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Alexei Navalny has said all along that a court would convict him. Not because he's guilty, but because it would prevent him from running for mayor of Moscow. On Thursday, a Russian court did just that to Navalny, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics. The court, in the city of Kirov, ruled that Navalny was guilty of misappropriating about $500,000 worth of lumber from a state-owned company. He was sentenced to five years in prison. The activist has called the trial politically motivated. Navalny has often accused government officials of dipping into the earnings of state-run companies. ""These people steal billions,"" he alleged in a CNN interview in April. ""I'm making it harder for them to steal."" He said his conviction is retaliation for taking to task the Kremlin, specifically over corruption. Russian authorities insist that's not the case. But others disagree. Protest leaders arrested at Moscow rally . The trial was a sham, the European Union's top diplomat said after Navalny's sentencing. ""This outcome, given the procedural shortcomings, raises serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia,"" EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton said. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said the case had ""left a very serious impression,"" in a statement published in Russian on the Gorbachev Foundation website. ""Everything I know about this case -- how it started, how it was closed, and then opened again, how it was considered in court -- unfortunately confirms that we do not have an independent judiciary,"" he said. ""I am convinced that using the judiciary to fight political opponents is not acceptable. Since Navalny's lawyers are filing an appeal, I believe the final full stop has not yet been put on this case."" UK Foreign Secretary William Hague also voiced his concern about Navalny's conviction. ""The decision to sentence him for five years has highlighted once again the concerns felt by many about the selective application of the rule of law in Russia,"" he said. Street movement . Three months ago, Navalny's voice boomed out over a microphone from a Moscow stage in front of tens of thousands of people, as he blasted Russia's most powerful man as the foe of democracy. It was one of many street protests challenging the Kremlin that have burgeoned in recent years. Navalny is one of their most prominent organizers. Last year, the Kremlin took action. It passed new laws to curb demonstrations. Then Navalny was arrested and charged. He immediately believed he would not get off the hook. ""They didn't fabricate the case to allow that,"" he told CNN at the time. The real penalty . Navalny now faces a five-year prison term, a year less than the prosecutor asked for. But a jail cell is not the main punishment, he said in April. And he had anticipated that someday, he would do time for his activism. If his conviction stands, Navalny will, by law, not be able to run for public office. It's not an uncommon law. Convicted felons in the United States, for example, are also prohibited from doing so. But Navalny hopes through his protests to one day overturn that law, which he calls part of ""Putin's system."" Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division, said that while the guilty verdict came as no surprise -- as ""the culmination of a criminal prosecution brought for political reasons with a preordained conclusion"" -- the sentence was still shocking. It can only be seen through a political lens, as part of a broader government crackdown to silence a fierce critic and the opposition movement, she said in an online statement. ""Russia's new laws are aimed at putting public life in Russia under greater government control, and Navalny's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger,"" she said. Rights group Amnesty International added its voice to the chorus of condemnation. The charges against Navalny were ""highly questionable,"" and ""the way his guilt was supposedly proven raises serious doubts,"" said John Dalhuisen, the organization's Europe and Central Asia program director. ""This was a parody of a prosecution and a parody of a trial. The case was twice closed for lack of evidence of a crime, before being reopened on the personal instruction of Russia's top investigator,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- What a drag it is getting old. How many times has someone mocked Mick Jagger by using that lyric from the Rolling Stones hit ""Mother's Little Helper""? Jagger and Keith Richards wrote and recorded the song in late 1965, when they were 22, with Jagger alternately lecturing, alternately pitying dejected housewives and their pills. Ah, youth. Sir Michael Philip Jagger is going to be 70 years old on Friday, and if it's been a drag getting old for him, he certainly hasn't shown it. The Rolling Stones are celebrating their 50th anniversary as a band with new music and an extensive tour. Jagger can still move like, well, Jagger, his sinewy dancing and endless energy showing little sign of flagging despite his grandfatherly age. (The man has two children in their 40s, for Pete's sake!) He's made classic records, kept the gossip columns busy and always maintained an astute eye on the spotlight. CNN photo blog: Never before seen Rolling Stones photos . Besides, Jagger is only the latest of the 1960s musical heroes -- the backbeat of every classic rock station and baby-boomer record collection -- to cross the three-score-and-ten age threshold. Paul McCartney turned 70 last year. So did Brian Wilson. Bob Dylan hit 70 two years ago. Grace Slick, Paul Simon, Jagger's bandmate Charlie Watts -- they're all in their seventies. Sure, it's easy to make fun of that. Pop music is a young person's game, after all. ""Everybody that you mention looks like an old woman now,"" says Chris O'Dowd, playing an employee of a record company specializing in heritage acts, in the movie ""This Is 40."" ""You're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys."" By the numbers: Mick Jagger . We should all be so lucky, though. Jessica Tandy lived until she was 85, acting until almost the very end. Better that than the alternative. If you're doing something you love, you should keep doing it. McCartney still tours. Dylan, who calls his travels the ""Never Ending Tour,"" hasn't stopped in years. Why not? Most of the '60s-era rock stars, believing the music was just a fad, had no idea they'd still be rockin' and rollin' as they entered their eighth decades. Asked in 1964 why they were so popular, the Beatles could only shrug. ""If we knew, we'd get together four boys with long hair and be managers,"" said John Lennon. So go ahead and sneer at them like the oldsters of their own youth did. Mick and his ageless friends are having the last laugh. What can a poor boy do, 'cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band, right?

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside the Mogadishu office of Somalian Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon on Tuesday, his spokesman said. The spokesman, Garad Salad, could not immediately say whether the explosion resulted in casualties. But eyewitnesses said a security guard was killed while trying to fight off the bomber. The blast shattered windows of nearby buildings and left two others wounded, witnesses said. No one claimed responsibility for the attack and it was unclear if Shirdon was in his office during the time of the attack. Shirdon, an economist who used to run an import business in neighboring Kenya, was named prime minister in October. When he accepted the position, Shirdon told the parliament that his government will do more to ensure the security of the country and to fight against terrorism and piracy. Somalia plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 21 years ago. Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. The nation since then has mostly been under a shaky transitional federal government. No group immediately took responsibility for the attack.","It is unclear if there were any casualties, the spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Before heading to Comic-Con in San Diego last weekend, the cast members of ""The Walking Dead"" were each given a folder with talking points about the upcoming fourth season. The folders contained information on what the actors could and couldn't say about the new episodes, which premieres October 13 on AMC. Although none of the actors could reveal the contents of the folders, it was clear that there are lots of secrets to be kept about where ""The Walking Dead"" will be headed when it returns. Last season raised the stakes for the already tumultuous show by introducing a human threat to the zombie-infested world. Much of the season, which -- spoiler alert -- left several main characters dead, centered on the conflict between a man called the Governor (David Morrissey) and the group led by protagonist Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln). As Season 3 came to a close, the Governor had vanished, and his community of Woodbury had joined Grimes' group in a prison. Michonne (Danai Gurira) had witnessed the death of her friend Andrea while couple Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) celebrated a very unconventional engagement. Season 4 will air its 16 episodes in two parts, with the first eight kicking off October 13 and the subsequent episodes premiering in February. For the most part, the new season will bring fans right back into the action of last season. ""There is a little bit of a time jump, but we certainly pick up where we left off,"" Executive Producer and Special Effects Make-up Supervisor Greg Nicotero said. ""The prison has changed a bit, and Rick has changed his position in the group. We don't really want to give it away just yet."" Nicotero confirmed that a new threat will present itself to the humans this season, and it's something that cannot be killed. That threat will be apparent by the end of the season premiere and will launch a narrative arc that he said will keep the jeopardy level high for all the episode. Nicotero said he and showrunner Scott Gimple made the decision that they wanted the threat to be ""ever-constant and ever-present"" in the new season. ""So we've devised ways to put our characters in instantaneous jeopardy,"" Nicotero said. ""That is something that was really important to us, because that is the world we live in, which is that danger could come out of anything. It was really important that we re-establish the rules of our world."" Gimple, who has written for the series for three seasons and replaced Glen Mazzara as showrunner for Season 4, said he sees this season as a ""greatest hits"" of the show. ""The Walking Dead"" is based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, and although it has stayed largely true to its source material in past seasons, Gimple confirmed that Season 4 will exist in its own frame. ""It's remixing different elements from the book in different contexts,"" Gimple said. ""Taking the emotional thrusts of those elements and giving them a different rhythm. People will see stuff from the book, and they'll know exactly where it came from, but it will be in a very different context. It has to be. ""It's a very creative, exciting thing to be doing,"" he added. ""And you'll see stories that are totally outside the comic that you've never seen before. But the basis of those stories is the from the spirit of the stories in the comic."" The characters find themselves part of a new, larger community this season in the prison, and their roles have changed. Lincoln, whose character Rick Grimes has largely been the central point of the show, said there will be a shift in leadership as the story unfolds. This is particularly significant as Rick's wife, Lori, was one of last season's casualties, leaving Rick as the sole parent of their two children. ""He's a man that is wrestling with a modus operandi that didn't work last season,"" Lincoln said. ""The brutality that's always going to be in him, he's trying to suppress for the sake of both of his children. He's trying to parent in an apocalypse, (and) he's trying to return to the man he once was for the sake of his children."" Lincoln said it's not been easy for his character to balance leading the survivors and being a dad. ""He's realized that the distraction and the pressure of leadership drew him away from his responsibilities as a parent,"" the actor said. ""He focuses his energies into something completely different but still helping the people of the community, and I can't tell you what that is yet."" For Cohan and Yeun, this season gives their characters an opportunity to explore having a relationship in a (sort of) normal situation -- at least initially. Cohan said there will be ""some semblance of a community and a life."" ""There's some kids; I think we can say that. And there's some stability,"" she said. ""There's hope beyond just them being in love now. As important as that was there's hope of 'Could this be OK? Are we starting again?' What happens next is anybody's business."" ""You find these little moments to really enjoy life,"" Yeun added. ""That's going to be the beauty of this season. There's a scope, and there's a diving into the world of the characters and getting to know the characters we haven't traditionally gotten to know. Seeing what they're about and seeing how they choose to live and seeing what decisions they make going forward in a horrible time. I think those little moments are going to be the key to balancing out this chaos."" As for the Governor, his whereabouts remain a mystery. Morrissey said the character has gone through some changes, however, as the events of last season weigh heavily upon him. ""From an emotional point of view, I think it's much more about what this man is carrying inside him, really, and it's about how he deals and comes to terms with the man he is,"" Morrissey said. ""And what he's capable of. And which side he's going to fall on. That's the choice he has to make. What the writers have done for the Governor in this season is just wonderful."" A key question is whether Michonne will succeed in her desire to exact revenge on the Governor for Andrea's death. ""Michonne as a character is very invested in what happened with Andrea and I think more than any other character is driven to find the Governor, figure out what's going on with him, figure out where he is, what he may be plotting and trying to do,"" Executive Producer Robert Kirkman said. ""And bringing him to justice. That's something her character is dealing with very early on. I can't say anything more than that."" What the writers and actors could say is that creating ""The Walking Dead"" is a highly collaborative and enjoyable process. Although there is always the lingering fear that a beloved character will be killed off (the producers have said that no one is safe), the cast is deeply invested in making this the best show possible. ""We all respect the fact that we're only as good as each other,"" Morrissey said. ""We've got to look after each other.""","""The Walking Dead"" was well-represented at this year's Comic-Con .

"(CNN) -- It's happened to all of us: You print something from the Web, and all you get is a sheet of paper with nothing but a URL or something equally useless. New software is designed to prevent printing blank pages from the Web, its inventor says. This printing pain in the neck happened to Hayden Hamilton so much that he invented a solution: GreenPrint, software that analyzes what a computer sends to a printer. It looks for pages that have no type or just a few lines of type (users can set the parameters). Then, the software automatically eliminates these pages from the print job. Users can reselect the pages if desired and deselect any other pages they don't want to print -- say, the pages of legal jargon at the end of an airline reservation. The software lets users eliminate images from a print job -- for instance, the maps generated in online driving directions -- thus saving ink. GreenPrint also allows users to avoid printing altogether by saving documents as PDF files. ""The average employee prints about 10,000 pages a year, and roughly 20 percent of that is waste,"" Hamilton said from his GreenPrint office in the Old Town section of Portland, Oregon. ""We estimate if [GreenPrint] got into widespread use, in the U.S. alone it would save tens of millions of trees a year and hundreds of millions of pounds"" of polluting carbon-dioxide gases. Leigh Stringer, a vice president at the Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum architectural firm, heard about GreenPrint from bloggers and decided to give it a try. ""I'm an architect by education and print a lot of large drawings as well as a lot of documents,"" she said from her Washington office. ""So the ability I have to self-select just a little bit saves a lot of paper fast."" With GreenPrint, it takes a few extra seconds to print. But, Stringer said, ""In a way, that's a good thing, because you take that pause and decide if you really wanted to print it or not."" GreenPrint tells users how many pages, and how much money, they have saved. Stringer said that based on a rate of 6½ cents per page, she paid off the $35 cost of the software in one day. But now, GreenPrint is offering a free version of the software for non-business use, supported by advertising. Tens of thousands of people have downloaded the program in the weeks since its January 28 debut. ""Our goal is nothing short of ending wasteful printing worldwide,"" Hamilton said. The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank, is using GreenPrint in a pilot project, sending feedback to the company to help fine-tune the software for the corporation's needs. And Hamilton said that more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies are testing out the product. He's hopeful that several deals will be closed this year. So, is Hamilton getting rich off this? ""Not yet,"" he said with a laugh. ""It's still early days, but hopefully over the next couple of years I'll start at least making a salary.""","Software prevents computers from printing unnecessary pages from Internet .

"(CNN) -- Badam Zari is a novelty in the tribal districts of northern Pakistan. Like many women in the towns along the Afghan border, the 38-year-old Zari has only a grade-school education. But unlike others before her, she's taking her frustrations with conditions in her hometown into the political arena. Zari is the first woman to run for Pakistan's parliament from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the restive region that has become a hotbed of the Taliban. Disgusted with what she says is the failure of the established political parties to improve things, she's running as an independent. ""They kept on making promises and never fulfilled them,"" she said. ""Each time, new promises were made, and a new person took over, and nothing happened -- we just kept on waiting."" Opinion: Why there is no peace time for women . When election day comes in May, Zari hopes to win one of the 60 seats set aside for women in the 342-seat National Assembly. She campaigns in the traditional head-to-toe garb worn by Muslim women in Bajaur Agency, calling for peace, jobs and proper basic services -- garbage collection, electricity and clean water. She's also an advocate of education for all children, girls as well as boys. That's a dangerous position in a region where the Taliban shot and grievously wounded a 15-year-old girl who pushed for sending girls to school. ""I have faith in God, and I know I am standing for a noble cause with a clean heart,"" she said. ""I have nothing to be scared of."" Zari's own father forced her to drop out of school in the fifth grade. But she has been involved in local civic and charitable work, and has pondered a run for office for several years. ""The village elders did not like the fact that I walked through the town to get to school,"" she said. ""I am now 38 years old, and I do not want any other little girls to be kept from going to school just because society doesn't think it is right or proper."" She also has the support of her husband, Sultan Mohammed, a school teacher. He said he knows his wife's life could be in danger, but believes God will give him strength and her success. ""I am very happy that she has decided to stand in the elections,"" he said. ""I have promised her that I will do whatever she wants me to do in support of her.""","Badam Zari is running for Pakistan's parliament in a Taliban hotbed .

"West, Texas (CNN) -- Walls warped or blown off entirely, even ones made of brick. Roofs sunken in, if they are still visible at all. Garage doors lying in yards. And, at the center of it all, a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep. On Tuesday, the devastation from last week's explosions at a West, Texas, fertilizer distributor became more eerily apparent as officials offered new details and opened more roads around the town's hardest hit areas. While the blast's lethal power was clear, many other questions remain. Town devastated by explosion is guided by the West way . Why did a fire start in the facility, which had shut down to workers for the day? How did that fire spark the massive explosion that tore through the northern part of town -- killing 14 people, including nine first responders, and injuring hundreds of others? What, if anything, could have been done to prevent the tragedy? So far, investigators have eliminated the possibility that natural causes started the fire, but they haven't gone beyond that. Brothers, friends lost in Texas explosion . When not funneling in and out of the command center at West High School, federal, state and local officials spent Tuesday outside using shovels to methodically search for clues. Assistant State Fire Marshal Kelly Kistner said investigators were starting in the least-damaged areas, hoping to determine the heat source or material that ignited the fire. The West Fertilizer Company said its officials are focused on ""fact finding,"" not lawsuits that may come after the blast. ""We continue to do everything we can to understand what happened to ensure nothing like this ever happens again in any community,"" the company said. Residents of this tight-knit town of 2,800, meanwhile, tried to get back to normal, though the explosion is never far from their minds. At the Pizza House on Oak Street, waitstaff and locals discussed the state of their homes while drinking their beers, trying to figure out how to deal with the fact their once quaint farming town now resembled a war zone. Several hundred residents gathered Tuesday night at a Knights of Columbus hall, some of them standing because the place was so packed, hoping to get answers from officials. They kept their tempers in check, though it was apparent many residents just want to go home. Some who live in damaged residences in areas that have been opened up to traffic have gotten that chance. On Tuesday -- two days before President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama head to Waco, about 18 miles south, for a memorial service at Baylor University -- some of them stood motionless on their front lawns, taking in the devastation. Others kept busy sifting through what remained or trying to fix what they could. The sounds -- of trailers full of debris rolling by, or the buzz of power tools -- were reminders that, for some, life was moving on.

"(CNN) -- If you travel by plane and arriving on time makes a difference, try to book on Hawaiian Airlines. In 2012, passengers got where they needed to go without delay on the carrier more than nine times out of 10, according to a study released on Monday. In fact, Hawaiian got even better from 2011, when it had a 92.8% on-time performance. Last year, it improved to 93.4%. The Airline Quality Rankings Report looks at the 14 largest U.S. airlines and is based on an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation figures. It's co-authored by Brent Bowen, the head of the Department of Aviation Technology at Purdue University, and Dean Headley of Wichita State. In addition to on-time performance, the joint project looks at three other categories: rate of consumer complaints, mishandled bags and denied boarding performance. At a time when U.S. airlines are a whipping post for passenger complaints about crowded flights, tight seats, costly tickets and unsatisfactory service, there is a glimmer of hope. Eight airlines improved their on-time arrival performance in 2012. Nine of the 14 rated had an on-time arrival percentage of more than 80%. ExpressJet and American Airlines had the worst on-time performance (76.9%) last year, according to the data gathered in the 23rd annual report. Virgin America had the best baggage handling rate of all the airlines (0.87 misplaced bags per 1,000 passengers.) American Eagle showed improvement from 2011 but still came in last, fumbling baggage at a rate of 5.80 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers. When it came to complaints last year, Southwest again had the lowest consumer rate (0.25 per 100,000 passengers) while the distinction of being the airline with the highest consumer complaint rate went to United Airlines (4.24 per 100,000.)

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama and his wife released their tax returns from 2000 to 2006 on his campaign Web site Tuesday, and the Illinois senator challenged Sen. Hillary Clinton to release hers. Later, Clinton said she expected to release her tax returns ""shortly, I hope within the next week."" Sen. Barack Obama is challenging Sen. Hillary Clinton to release her 2006 tax returns. The Obama campaign said Clinton should immediately release her 2006 return, pointing to her decision to lend her campaign $5 million earlier this year. The Obama camp also cited former President Bill Clinton's $20 million payout from supermarket holding company Yucaipa as a reason why the couple should release the documents. The Obama campaign said that company invests in tax shelters in the Cayman Islands. Clinton has promised to release 2007 returns sometime after this year's April 15 income tax deadline, just a few days before Pennsylvania's April 22 primary. ""Senator Clinton recently claimed that she's 'the most transparent figure in public life,' yet she's dragging her feet in releasing something as basic as her annual tax returns,"" Obama's communications director, Robert Gibbs, said in a statement. ""Senator Clinton can't claim to be vetted until she allows the public the opportunity to see her finances -- particularly with respect to any investment in tax shelters."" But Clinton made her own challenge to Obama during a press conference in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. ""I am pleased that Senator Obama has released his tax returns. I think that's a good first step,"" she said. ""Now he should release his records from being in the state Senate and any other information that the public and the press need to know from his prior experience."" According to the 2006 return, Obama and his wife, Michelle, earned over $991,000 in 2006 and paid $277,431 on the income. More than half of the couple's income in 2006 -- nearly $507,000 -- came from royalties from his two books, ""The Audacity of Hope"" and ""Dreams From My Father."" In 2005, Obama earned over $1,210,000 from royalties, according to the couple's returns that year. The Obamas earned nearly $431,000 in wages in 2006, according to the returns. The documents do not show what Obama or his wife individually earned, but the senator's salary was $165,000 that year. They also earned more than $51,000 from Treehouse Foods, an Illinois-based food manufacturer. Michelle Obama served on Treehouse's board from June 2005 to May 2007. Before 2005, the couple had more modest incomes. Between 2000 and 2004, they earned between $207,647 and $275,123 a year. The returns were posted just minutes after the Clinton campaign attacked Obama for not releasing them. ""In the public record, there are 20 years of Hillary's tax returns, hundreds of thousands of pages of records from her time in the White House and countless other documents detailing her time in public life. ""Sen. Obama's record is far more opaque. Sen.

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber hugged an Iraqi lawmaker and detonated an explosive vest, killing the official and two others, police said Tuesday. Lawmaker Ayfan Sadoon al-Essawi was visiting a construction site on a commercial street in central Falluja on Tuesday when the bomber, disguised as a laborer, approached him, authorities said. The bomber hugged al-Essawi and then set his bomb off, police said. Four others were wounded in the blast, authorities said. Al-Essawi was a member of the al-Iraqiya bloc, which is headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Al-Essawi used to be the leader of Falluja Awakening Council for several years and was also a tribal leader there. Falluja is a predominately Sunni town about 35 miles west of Baghdad, in Anbar province. The lawmaker had escaped a number of previous attacks. He was wanted by the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group of al Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups. The special representative for the U.N. secretary-general in Iraq called the attack a ""heinous killing."" ""I call again on all political forces to foil any attempt at instigating strife and to demonstrate utmost restraint,"" representative Martin Kobler said. Separately, on Monday evening, Iraqi Finance Minister Rafie al-Essawi escaped an attack unharmed when a roadside bomb exploded near his convoy on the western outskirts of Baghdad, police officials there said.

"(CNN) -- The news reports streaming out of the Middle East this week have understandably focused on concerns Iran is working to build a nuclear weapon, challenging Israel's own widely believed but publicly undeclared nuclear arsenal and threatening stability across the region. Iran's record supporting terrorism in the Middle East through groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon elevates those concerns. Some say President Barack Obama only needs to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""green light"" to carry out an attack that would aim to damage or destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities at the core of concerns. Other Israeli sources are insistent that the U.S. military is better able to carry out the attacks and should therefore take the lead. Nuclear weapons: Who has what . As the world marks 10 years since the Iraq invasion, it might be a good time to look ahead and ask the decision-makers some basic questions about the threat and the strategy to deal with it. They've been wrong before, but plenty of pundits are laying out a ""spring or summer"" timeline for military action. Is this to be a pre-emptive strike? In April, 2006 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad stood onstage, surrounded by dancers holding glowing vials representing enriched uranium and declared: ""I am officially announcing that Iran joined the group of those countries which have nuclear technology."" Iran has repeatedly denied it is trying to ""weaponize"" its nuclear program and spiritual leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei has even issued a fatwa in a speech against the production and use of weapons of mass destruction. The IAEA says it has no evidence Iran is diverting its enriched uranium to make a weapon, but refuses to give Tehran a clean bill because inspectors have been unable to visit a military location where nuclear weapon research could be conducted. There is no shortage of experts who believe Iran is doing everything it can to ready nuclear weapons technology so that if it considers itself threatened, it could produce one relatively quickly. The question is not whether Israel and the U.S. would attack Iran if it developed a nuclear weapon. Both states have said they will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons. The question is at what point Iran's capability to go nuclear is unacceptable. It is important because it's relatively easy to bomb buildings and factories, but you can't bomb knowledge. What would be the U.S. or Israeli military goals? Any strategy that involves attacking Iran to control its nuclear program compels us to ask what the U.S. and Israel hope to achieve? Will it be enough to shut down the nuclear enrichment process for a year...two years...five years? In the event of a strike on its nuclear program, it is reasonable to assume Tehran would immediately resume its research in deeper, hidden underground shelters. It may already be preparing to do that. The U.S. can expect Iran would try to rebuild and improve on its past efforts with a vengeance. It is also reasonable to assume Iran would end cooperation with the IAEA nuclear inspectors and the United States, Europe and Israel would lose the window to look inside Iran's nuclear program, however imperfect it may be. A more important question the U.S. needs to ask is whether a military attack strategy will force it into a ""lawn mowing"" ritual that has to be repeated, again and again? Military experts have been clear that a strike on Iran's nuclear program isn't going to be simple or easy. It might have to include scores of targets like radar installations, airfields and missile sites. Those same military voices remind everyone there will be necessary bomb damage assessments -- possibly by drone, aircraft or satellite -- in the wake of any strike to determine what was damaged or missed. It all tends to add up to a very major military effort -- not the simple ""one and done"" raid Israel carried out on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. The only way out of a cycle like this would seem to be negotiations, or perhaps even to learn to live with a nuclear capable Iran. It bears mentioning because that's precisely where the U.S. and Israel are right now -- before taking on the high costs and high risks of another military ""solution."" Has the diplomatic route been exhausted? Obama has repeatedly said there is ""a window -- not an infinite period time, but a window of time -- where we can resolve this diplomatically."" This week, it became clearer than ever that Netanyahu is growing impatient with the lack of progress that talks and sanctions have achieved. That's understandable. Israel and Iran are already locked in a covert war. Since 2007, Iran has alleged at least five of its nuclear scientists have been assassinated by Israeli agents. There was no official response from Israel. In July 2012, a suicide bomber attacked a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Bulgaria. Five Israelis were killed -- along with their Bulgarian driver -- and a Bulgarian investigation established links between the bomber and the pro-Iranian Lebanese group Hezbollah. So the most important question of all is: When does America give up on diplomacy with Iran? Iran is different from other Middle East countries in an important way. For decades, the United States propped up Arab leaders and had, on the surface anyway, warm relations with them. But almost universally, the man in the street detested the U.S. government. In Iran, it's the man on the street who is largely supportive of America. It's the government and the extremists it trains that have all the hatred for what the U.S. represents. Perhaps the question right now isn't about giving up, but whether it's time to double down on diplomacy to avoid a conflict that poses serious and unpredictable consequences.","Pundits are laying out a spring-summer timetable if the U.S. or Israel is to attack Iran's nuclear program .

"(CNN) -- Universal Pictures debuted new footage from the upcoming film ""Kick-Ass 2"" during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con. The stylized, violent clip introduced fans to the sequel's aesthetic and revealed several new characters, including Colonel Stars and Stripes, played by Jim Carrey. Although Carrey -- who has withdrawn his support for the film over the violence - was not on hand, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist) and director-screenwriter Jeff Wadlow spoke with the convention-goers. Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays fan favorite Hit-Girl, made a special appearance via satellite to discuss her character's arc. The cast and director didn't reveal too much about the film's actual plot, although it was clear from the footage that Hit-Girl's path takes her to high school and deals with her issues following the death of her father (played by Nicolas Cage) in the first ""Kick-Ass"" film. ""That was a big, interesting arc that Jeff had the smart idea of putting in the movie,"" Moretz said. ""Hit-Girl decides to give up her life of crime. She goes to high school, and what she realizes is that whether it's a drug dealer on the streets and a murder or a bad girl at school who is hating on these kids, she has to bring justice to the situation. She realizes she and Hit-Girl are the same person. It could also really touch young teenagers, because it's what they're going through in school."" For Taylor-Johnson, the sequel was an opportunity to pick up where he left off with his character. The only major difference, he said, is that he has been doing a lot of one-armed push-ups to bulk up this time around. ""It felt like a natural progression,"" Taylor-Johnson said of the sequel. ""For my character, what's nice is that he hasn't changed at all since the first one. It's always been a conversation about when are we going to do the second one. I got a call from (producer) Matthew Vaughn saying, 'I've got someone really great who's written a fantastic script and I'd like you to read it and see what you think.' And it was a page-turner. He took these characters through a wild journey that was really complex. It took these characters to a whole new level."" Batman, Superman to team up . Mintz-Plasse's character takes on a much bigger role as the villain in this new film. Shooting those scenes was intense for the actor, but he said he feels that the journey his character takes is important to the story laid out both in the graphic novel and the film. Red Mist, who lost his father as well in ""Kick-Ass,"" is reborn in this film as The Mother F----r, which should give an indication of his qualities. ""I was really scared to do something this intense and nerve-wracking, but Jeff (Wadlow) had a great acting coach that came onboard,"" Mintz-Plasse said. ""We worked for a month prior to shooting and read every line and figured out what to do for the character. I'm wearing a gimp outfit in this movie. It's super dark. There's some things in the comic book that we took out, which I think was a good choice. It was very intense to play."" ""Kick-Ass 2"" will be in theaters on August 16, but fans are already wondering about a third film.

"(CNN) -- Two commuter trains collided near Argentina's capital on Tuesday, killing at least three people and injuring hundreds more. Rescuers rushed to evacuate people and tend to the wounded, who were lined up on stretchers near the smashed train cars. At least 315 people were hurt in the accident, which occurred just after 7 a.m. in a western suburb of Buenos Aires, Argentina's state-run Telam news agency reported. ""The lights went out suddenly, and there was an explosion. I was in the last car. The only thing you could hear were screams,"" passenger German Garay told Telam. ""People became desperate to get out. They were stepping on each other."" Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner expressed solidarity with the train crash victims and their families in a speech at an event in Buenos Aires Thursday night. ""In addition to solidarity and pain, I feel anger and impotence,"" she said. ""Because the truth is, we are putting everything (into the train system), not just economic resources and investment, but also time and human resources. When things like this happen, it hurts all of us."" A preliminary investigation indicates that one train rammed into another train that was stopped between stations, Telam said. Authorities said they were still looking into what caused the collision, which occurred near the Castelar stop on the Sarmiento line. ""We want to determine if it was foul play or an accident,"" Transportation Minister Florencio Randazzo told reporters. ""If it could have been avoided, it was not accident, and there will be one or more people responsible."" Transportation officials said the trains had been checked by mechanical engineering inspectors in March. Thursday's crash happened nearly 16 months after a commuter train on the same rail line crashed into a barrier at a station in Buenos Aires, killing 50 people and injuring hundreds. That crash sparked a criminal investigation. More than two dozen suspects, including former government officials, are awaiting trial, accused of mismanagement and defrauding the public. Now a government consortium oversees the train line, rather than a private company. But family members of victims of the 2012 crash said Thursday's collision was a sign that little has changed. ""It is the same and it keeps getting worse. As the days pass, the trains get older,"" said Maria Lujan Rey, whose son died in the 2012 crash. And government officials, she claimed, continue sending trains to corrupt companies for repair. ""So what do you think could have changed?"" she said. ""Nothing.""

"Paris (CNN) -- Despite his brushes with the law involving allegations of sexual assault and prostitution, Dominique Strauss-Kahn insisted in a CNN interview that he doesn't ""have any kind of problem with women."" The former head of the International Monetary Fund, once considered a likely candidate for the French presidency, talked to CNN's Richard Quest in his first English-language interview since resigning in 2011 after being charged with sexually assaulting a New York City maid. All sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn related to the maid were dismissed at the request of the prosecutor. Quest asked what Strauss-Kahn thought about some who perceive the economist as viewing women as ""sexual objects."" ""No, I don't actually,"" Strauss-Kahn replied. ""I don't think so. I don't think I have any kind of problem with women. I have a problem with understanding what is expected from politicians of highest level. It's different from what [a] Mr. and Miss in the street [can do]."" Quest asked the economist straight out: ""What were you thinking that day in New York?"" ""Firstly, I don't remember it exactly,"" he replied. He went on to say, ""I wasn't thinking anything. It happened, something happened, which is a private thing and I still say what happens in a room is a private thing unless the prosecutors find something to tell you that you are going to be charged for something and they have proof of that..."" The maid, Nafissatou Diallo, told police that she was cleaning when Strauss-Kahn emerged nude from a room in his luxury suite at the Sofitel hotel. She claimed that he tried to force himself on her, dragged her into the bathroom and tried to pull off her underwear. On May 14, 2011, the economist, once widely predicted to become France's Socialist presidential candidate, was escorted off an Air France flight headed to Paris and taken to a Manhattan police station for questioning about the alleged sexual assault. Strauss-Kahn was charged with attempted rape and imprisonment of the hotel employee, denied bail and transferred to New York's Rikers Island jail. Within days, he resigned his $500,000 job and was indicted on seven counts -- two counts of a criminal sexual act; two counts of sexual abuse and once count each of attempted rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. After satisfying a $1 million bail and $5 million bond, Strauss-Kahn got home confinement and had to surrender his travel documents. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. By the end of the summer, prosecutors had disclosed that the maid admitting lying about certain details, the maid had filed a civil suit against Strauss-Kahn and all charges against the ex-IMF head had been dismissed. Strauss-Kahn, often referred to as DSK, left the United States for France. More than a year later, in December 2012, Strauss-Kahn reached a settlement with the maid, the terms of which were not released. Quest asked Strauss-Kahn why he settled with the maid. He explained that he felt he would have to pay more money in legal fees fighting it. He opted to ""pay and go on with my life,"" he said. But there have been numerous allegations against Strauss-Kahn. While the case involving the maid was playing out, French journalist Tristane Banon filed a complaint against Strauss-Kahn alleging attempted rape. Strauss-Kahn filed a counterclaim against Banon for ""false declarations."" And the following year, in February 2012, French police questioned Strauss-Kahn about an alleged prostitution ring possibly operated out of luxury hotels. In May 2012, a French investigation into Strauss-Kahn's alleged involvement in a prostitution ring widened, and authorities said police would open a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in Washington in December 2010, which they believed could constitute gang rape. But in October, a French prosecutor dropped the investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to the alleged Washington incident. The testimony on which the investigation was based was withdrawn and the woman declined to press charges. Strauss-Kahn also told Quest that he felt he was treated poorly by police in New York. ""I think it's a terrible thing, frankly,"" he said. ""The problem is, it's a moment where in all European, American society you're supposed to be innocent, you're supposed to be innocent until you're convicted."" Strauss-Kahn's arraignment was televised and clips played on U.S. and international networks. ""Perp walks,"" in which defendants -- accompanied by police -- walk in front of photographers handcuffed, are standard fare in America. Underscoring the cultural differences between France and the United States, many French recoiled from images of Strauss-Kahn being paraded before the news media in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under French law to protect the presumption of innocence. Strauss-Kahn: A reputation battered by sex allegations . So, after all that, would Strauss-Kahn still consider running for the presidency of France? No, he answered. He said that sometimes he gives advice -- and sometimes he does so for free -- to underdeveloped countries. Strauss-Kahn said he thinks France's current president, Francois Hollande, is ""doing his best."" He spoke at length about the European economic situation. He criticized leaders for not dealing with a downturn when it first developed. ""What the Europeans tried to do was to buy time, for political reasons, not to admit the losses so they were unable,"" he said. ""Still now they are unable to have a plan for the future. They just try to buy another six months and another six months and that's a catastrophe because the cost today is much higher than the cost -- what would have been the cost two or three years ago."" Quest asked Strauss-Kahn whether he's frustrated that he's not part of the discussion to find a solution to the problem. ""No, it's my fault,"" he replied. The economist reflected on work he says he's done internationally, including some work he says he's recently done in South Sudan. ""I spent all my life trying to help my people in France to have a better life,"" he said. ""It appears to me while I was working that I could do this at the global level. Again, I must be humble."" He said of his work in South Sudan: ""I'm doing it totally for free because I want to help them. I'm happy to see the government of South Sudan tell me, 'Come to us and help us, We need you.'"" ""That's much more rewarding than any kind of election in any country.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York woman is facing multiple fraud and larceny charges for allegedly pretending she had terminal cancer to get thousands of dollars from sympathetic donors to pay for an over-the-top wedding and honeymoon, according to a court statement released Tuesday. Jessica Vega, 25, who was arrested last week in Virginia and later brought to New York, has been indicted on fraud and grand larceny charges and one misdemeanor in the alleged ruse. She could face up to 24 years behind bars if convicted. Vega is suspected of fabricating the tale to con sympathizers into buying her gifts and giving her money, according to a statement from the New York Attorney General's Office. Officials said the scheme lasted from January 2010 to June 2010 and involved eliciting gifts from a bridal couture shop and a high-end restaurant. It is not clear how much money the alleged scheme netted, but it is believed to be in the thousands of dollars, said Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Jennifer Givner. ""By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community's hearts and minds, and profited off of their generosity,"" said Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. Vega was married in May 2010 and allegedly ""went to Aruba for her honeymoon with expenses paid for by members of the mid-Hudson community touched by her story,"" the statement said. The man Vega married, who was not named in the indictment, is not facing charges. Givner said the man says he was not involved in the alleged scheme. Vega remains at New York's Orange County Jail, where her bail has been set at $10,000 cash or $30,000 bond, according to the jail's record department. Vega, whose attorney could not be immediately reached for comment, is scheduled to appear in court on April 20.","Jessica Vega, 25, was arrested last week in Virginia .

"Moscow (CNN) -- There wasn't a shadow of a doubt that former presidential aide and interim mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin would win the mayoral race against blogger and anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny, not as President Vladimir Putin's hand-picked man. The only question was by how much. Anything less than 50% would have meant a run-off election. Opinion: Putin, a hypocrite on Snowden, Navalny . There will not be a run-off. Sobyanin squeaked by with 51.37% of the vote. Navalny won 27.24%. Calling the preliminary results ""sheer falsifications"" Navalny demanded the annulment of ""off-site"" elections, in which voters are allowed to vote at home, without having to come to polling stations. ""We also demand a second round of voting for the election,"" he said. Navalny can ask for a re-count but there is little chance he will get a run-off.

Up to now, Navalyny was known mainly in Moscow and St. Petersburg as a crusader against government corruption, calling out politicians for illegal behavior. He was a leader of the 2012 street demonstrations in Moscow, motivating educated, middle-class young people in Russia's big cities with blogs and Tweets. The Kremlin's game with Alexei Navalny .

He claims the charges were politically inspired to sideline him from politics and is appealing the sentence. Before the mayoral vote some observers predicted that, if Navalny's supporters felt the election had been stolen, they would turn out again for street protests. A demonstration was planned in advance for Monday evening. But some Kremlin opponents don't sound that angry; they're taking heart from the vote totals.

"Kabul (CNN) -- A suicide bomber dressed as a security guard blew himself up Wednesday in a street near the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital, killing himself and two other people, authorities said. The attacker set off the explosives attached to his body around 8 a.m. after he was noticed by security guards in the neighborhood, said Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry. The blast took place in a district that houses international organizations, diplomats and senior government officials. Afghan authorities don't know what the bomber's intended target was, Seddiqi said. One of the people killed was a security guard and another was a civilian, Seddiqi said. One person was wounded in the attack, he said. Violent attacks are frequent across the country, where Afghan and NATO troops are battling an insurgency led by the Taliban. Kabul, where the Afghan government is based and many foreign organizations have heavily guarded headquarters, hasn't been spared from the unrest. In September, a suicide bomber killed six people and wounded four others near the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). And in April, Afghan security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces. Buildings that came under attack included the Afghan Parliament and the American, German and Russian embassies.","The explosion happens in a district housing international organizations .

"(CNN) -- Recent security changes at New York City's Ellis Island and Liberty Island were under scrutiny Monday as summer started and tourists looked forward to the reopening of two of New York's historic landmarks. Sen. Chuck Schumer and New York City Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly have asked the National Park Service to re-evaluate a recent change in its security procedures that will allow visitors to board ferries headed to the islands and go through a security screening after they arrive. ""The NYPD and the National Park Service have differences when it comes to ideas on how to protect visitors from a terrorist attack,"" Kelly told reporters Monday. ""Al Qaeda and its surrogates, those who share its jihadist goals, have continually called for attacks against America, in America."" Kelly wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell asking her to revisit the decision and alerted Schumer to the potential security risks. ""It's sort of ridiculous. It's sort of saying we are going to screen people at airports after they get on the plane,"" Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. ""They've made a serious mistake here, and we are asking them to rethink it, to change it and simply go back to the old procedure."" A park service representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since 9/11, visitors have been screened at a lower Manhattan security checkpoint before boarding the daily ferries to the islands. Liberty Island, home to the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island, home to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, sustained extensive damage in Superstorm Sandy and have been closed since the storm hit in October.

"London (CNN) -- They are a formidable new force in the tech world -- tween developers with world-class coding skills and firsthand insights into the games kids really want to play. At the forefront of this wave of young developing talent are a couple of entrepreneurial Irish boys who have emerged from the CoderDojo, a volunteer movement to teach kids computer programming. Since the first CoderDojo started up in Cork, Republic of Ireland two years ago, the free, not-for-profit coding clubs have spread to 180 locations in 22 countries. Harry Moran was hailed as the world's youngest app developer in 2011 when, as a 12-year-old, he released his app ""PizzaBot"" -- a game where a pizza tries to eliminate salami slices from a kitchen. He created the game as a class project at a CoderDojo, less than two months after he started learning to code. It became an instant and unexpected hit, shooting to the top of the UK/Ireland App Store chart, overtaking giants like Angry Birds on the way and also performing well in the U.S. and Australia. ""PizzaBot was an experiment really,"" Moran said. ""I didn't want it to be successful, I just wanted to put an app up."" The secret of the game's success? ""It's pizza and it's a robot,"" he ventures. ""Maybe because it was kind of based on Space Invaders, people felt they could relate to it."" Opinion: Teach U.S. kids to write code . While he admits coding ""is not for everyone,"" it felt like a natural fit for Moran, even though it was not a talent that had been strongly fostered at home. Before he started at CoderDojo, his parents would only allow him 20 minutes of screen time a week. ""That's computers, PlayStation and TV put together,"" he says. ""After I went to CoderDojo one of the mentors took my mum aside and said, 'You've really got to let him have more time on the computer.'"" That extra time is now paying dividends, as Moran has followed up his hit game with a sequel called ""PizzaBot Season(ing)s,"" and a new game -- ""Robot Run!"" -- about a quest to stop a rogue killer robot. Read more: Demystifying cloud threats and firewalls . Moran credits his success to his affiliation with CoderDojo, co-founded by fellow Irishman James Whelton and Australian entrepreneur Bill Liao. Whelton, 20, had run a computer club at his own school, and saw a huge demand for more resources to teach computer programming skills to young people. After leaving high school, with Liao as an angel investor, Whelton launched CoderDojo, in which volunteers donate their time to teach code to 10-14 year olds. About 10,000 children have participated in the program. Read/Watch: Gates, Zuckerberg: Kids, learn to code . Jordan Casey, a young software developer who also released an app game, ""Alien Ball vs Humans,"" at the age of 12, is another CoderDojo success story. Now aged 13, he has spoken at conferences in France, Germany, and India, while his company, Casey Games, has released an online multiplayer virtual world game called ""Food World,"" and another called ""Save the Day"" to mark International Children's Day in Brazil. Casey had already begun playing with code before he joined CoderDojo, and played a role in having a branch set up in his town. ""I think the best aspect of CoderDojo is the collaboration and social aspect,"" Casey says. ""Most people when they think of programmers think of people in their room alone, curtains down ... Now, thanks to CoderDojo, people see it just like any other club."" Read more: The smartphone app that maps your mental state . Young people had some distinct advantages when it comes to tech, said Whelton, in that they picked up coding much more quickly than adults. ""It's a generational thing. They've grown up with this stuff around them, so it's quite instinctive,"" he says. They also had an edge in terms of an instinctive understanding of what appealed to their age group. ""I think their biggest strength is their age. It's like they're covert agents among their peers."" Coding had the potential to empower young people, he says, particularly in struggling economies such as Ireland where unemployment is approaching 15%. ""There are still vacancies in tech though -- people can't get enough developers and technical talent,"" he said. On a personal level, the clubs played an important role in helping to give young people confidence, a peer group of like-minded kids, and a sense of identity. ""When I was young, coding was my thing -- I wasn't into the academic thing or the sporting thing,"" said Whelton. ""It was always a passion. It wasn't to do it to get a job, or make the new Facebook -- it was to have fun, to build apps and games."" But from an early age, he had an appreciation of the ways in which coding could have a more serious impact as well. When he was 14, he came to the aid of his neighbor's nephew who had been diagnosed with a tumor behind his eye. Doctors in the U.S. needed to see a scan within a day but the inferior broadband quality of the time wouldn't allow for the scan to be sent. Whelton stepped up by swiftly putting together a software app that allowed the doctors to view the scan over the Internet, allowing them to make a correct diagnosis and treatment plan and saving the child's life. Read more: Heal thyself - the bio-inspired materials that self-repair . Anyone can learn to code, he says. ""Myself, I did quite poorly in maths in school. But in the context of coding it makes sense. It's more based around logic than it is around arithmetic."" The trick is to make lessons fun and relevant. ""Instead of making a website for the sake of it, you should be making a website for the local football club."" The open source, workshop culture of the CoderDojo adds to its appeal by encouraging students to quickly become mentors themselves. ""If someone learns or creates something new,"" says 14-year-old Moran, ""it's really easy for them to teach other people and share that thing."" In this way, the first generation of CoderDojo prodigies like Moran are already working to inspire the next. ""I've taught quite a few people Android app and web development, and I really enjoy doing that.""","Developers as young as 12 are having success developing game apps .

"New York (CNN) -- The FBI is investigating the theft of $1.2 million from Swiss International Airlines Flight 17, which arrived at New York's JFK International Airport from Zurich, Switzerland, on Saturday afternoon, a spokesman said Tuesday. The money was in $100 bills, J. Peter Donald said, adding it's still unclear when it was stolen. Flight 17 was a passenger flight with air cargo, including a shipment of currency, according to another FBI spokesman, Jim Margolin. After the plane landed, the shipment of cash was discovered to be $1.2 million short. Margolin said investigators have not determined whether the money was taken before the flight left Zurich. He said the cash was missing from a container that the bank uses to transfer currency, which is loaded into a larger cargo container. He said it would take a forklift to lower the currrency container into the larger container, or to remove it. How safe is your carry-on bag? A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said the money was headed to the Federal Reserve. Andrea Priest, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had no comment. Another law enforcement source told CNN the money belonged to a U.S. bank that was transferring currency from offices in Switzerland to the U.S. It was a transaction within the bank, but the money was passing through a Federal Reserve facility in New Jersey, according to the source, who said it's fairly common, when large sums are transferred, even internally, for them to go through a federal facility, where old bills are exchanged for new ones. The shortfall was discovered Monday when the shipment was delivered to the Federal Reserve facility in Rutherford, New Jersey, the source said.

"(CNN) -- The husband of an accomplished Pittsburgh doctor has been arrested in connection with the death of his wife, the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, district attorney's office, said Thursday. Authorities have ruled that 41-year-old physician Autumn Klein's cause of death was cyanide poisoning. It was not immediately clear whether Klein's husband, Robert Ferrante, had retained representation. Klein was a physician and former head of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. She died on April 20. Officials said Ferrante was apprehended by West Virginia State Police after his car was stopped while heading north on Interstate 77 near Beckley, West Virginia. Ferrante is a researcher and professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. He has been placed on immediate and indefinite leave, according to John Andrew Fedele, a school spokesperson. As part of his position there, Ferrante managed a laboratory where he conducts trials of various drugs and chemicals, according to a criminal complaint. On April 17, Allegheny County 911 dispatch received a call from Ferrante requesting medical assistance for his wife, who he said was possibly having a stroke, the complaint read. He described her condition as ""conscious and breathing, but not alert."" The complaint, citing witnesses, alleges that Ferrante requested the purchase of cyanide. It was delivered one day later, on April 16. Cyanide is a naturally occurring toxic substance that can be found in seeds of different plants. It is widely distributed throughout research laboratories as a chemical used in scientific experiments. Cyanide interferes with the ability of the body to use oxygen to produce energy, which can lead to rapid death. According to the complaint, text messages were found between the couple on April 17, the day Klein fell ill. The exchange included Ferrante suggesting creatine to Klein in hopes of stimulating egg production. When paramedics arrived, they found the victim on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine. According to Karl Williams, chief medical examiner of Allegheny County, there is no connection with creatine and fertility. Creatine is a supplement that bodybuilders uses to increase body mass, Williams said. Sole and legal custody of Ferrante's child has been placed with the maternal grandparents, according to a statement form the district attorney's office. His financial assets have also been frozen. CNN's Erinn Cawthon and Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.","Autumn Klein, 41, a physician, died on April 20 .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Syria will soon complete its official investigation into last week's massacre in Houla, the country's U.N. ambassador said Wednesday. ""The national commission of investigation in Syria will terminate its investigation tomorrow or after tomorrow,"" Bashar Jaafari told reporters at the United Nations. ""And then you will hear, all of you ... the results of this investigation. And all of us will know for sure the identity of the perpetrators."" Syrian officials have repeatedly denied government involvement in the massacre that left more than 100 people dead, about half of them children. But Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said Tuesday that it's ""clear"" government forces were involved. Most died as a result of ""summary executions"" by ""armed men going into houses and killing men, women and children inside,"" Colville said, saying the Shabiha militia, a government militia group, appeared to be behind the executions. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the massacre was carried out ""by every indication, by the Shabiha militias acting on behalf of the government. We think it's quite clear-cut."" Since the conflict began more than a year ago, President Bashar al-Assad's regime has blamed violence against civilians on ""armed terrorist groups,"" a line Jaafari continued Wednesday. Those behind the ""heinous crime,"" which was ""unjustified and unjustifiable,"" will be brought to justice, Jaafari said. He also argued that other countries are supporting groups that are smuggling weapons into Syria. The remarks came after a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, in which countries sought new ways to increase the pressure on the regime. Rice said after the meeting, ""We certainly agree with Kofi Annan that this is a moment where we have reached, in effect, a tipping point."" Air strikes would wreck al-Assad, says former Syrian general . Annan, special envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, who has pushed a six-point peace plan, used the phrase ""tipping point"" Tuesday. ""I think we may be beginning to see the wheels coming off of this bus,"" Rice said. ""And that means that what happens next and the steps that are taken by the Syrian authorities and by this council could well be dispositive."" ""The political process, which is so crucial to the success of any transition, which is the purpose of the Annan plan, is thwarted by the ongoing, escalating, expanding violence perpetrated by the government, and the reality that the opposition cannot possibly be expected to come to the table while the violence is intensifying, escalating and the government is lying about it,"" she said. But Jaafari insisted that his government was doing all it could to protect Syria's citizenry. ""We are facing terrorist armed groups -- trained, financed, harbored and protected by some countries in the area -- Arab countries, regional countries and internationally speaking also."" Eleven nations -- the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Bulgaria and Canada -- announced Tuesday that they were expelling Syrian diplomats. Turkey joined that list Wednesday, expelling the charge d'affaires and other diplomatic personnel from Syria's embassy in Ankara. In turn, Syria said Wednesday it was expelling the Dutch charge d'affaires from Damascus, giving her 72 hours to leave the country. Jaafari said the diplomatic moves against Syria were not helping the situation. ""Sanctions, expulsions of diplomats -- this is not diplomacy,"" he said. ""Diplomacy is totally different."" Russia called the expulsions of Syrian diplomats ""counterproductive"" and insisted that a U.N. Security Council statement Sunday condemning the incident was ""a strong enough signal to the Syria parties."" A central question hanging over the Security Council meeting is what steps Russia and China will countenance. As permanent members, they have veto power, which they have used previously to block two resolutions. Many world leaders assailed the two nations, saying they were preventing steps that could stop the violence. But the two countries said they were seeking more balanced resolutions. Both have major trade deals with Syria. While no nation is openly pushing for military action, French President Francois Hollande has said it cannot be ruled out. U.S. sticking with 'Plan A' for Syria . China and Russia spoke out Wednesday against such an idea. ""China opposes military intervention and does not support forced regime change,"" said Liu Weimin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""The fundamental route to resolving the Syrian issue is still for all sides to fully support Annan's mediation efforts and push all the relevant parties to carry out diplomatic dialogue."" ""One cannot take decisions on military operations in Syria by being guided by only emotions,"" said Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov, according to Russian news agency Itar-Tass. Denisov also said ""the Russian position is not formed on the basis of emotions, which our respected French partners have unfortunately not escaped in the formulation of their position,"" according to Russian news outlet RIA Novosti. In Washington, State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner said U.S. officials were not putting all their hopes into the Annan plan. ""We're also continuing with these other options that we're pursuing, which is support for the opposition, humanitarian assistance, working through the (opposition group) Friends of Syria to increase financial and political pressure on Assad,"" he said. In a statement from a spokesman, the Free Syrian Army said it was giving the Syrian regime until noon on Friday to implement the Security Council resolutions or it would stop complying with them. ""Immediately halting gunfire and all violence, pulling out all the troops, tanks and machinery from the cities, towns and residential areas, allowing humanitarian aid to reach all stricken areas, releasing all prisoners and allowing media access, guaranteeing the freedom to demonstrate, not attacking the U.N. monitors like what happened in several areas, and entering true and serious dialogue through the United Nations in order to hand over the power to the people,"" said the spokesman, Col. Qasim Saad Eddine. ""Our national, moral and humanitarian duty make it necessary for us to defend and protect our civilians and their cities, towns, blood, and dignity,"" the statement said. ""And this right to protect ourselves does not go against international laws and norms."" The United States announced Wednesday it was sanctioning a Syrian bank that al-Assad's regime was using to circumvent other sanctions. The U.S. Treasury said its action will help isolate the regime. U.S. intervention: Damned if they do, damned if they don't? Peter Wittig, Germany's U.N. ambassador, said he hoped the Houla massacre was ""an eye-opener for some members of the council."" He said he hoped the council would consider expanding the U.N. monitoring mission in Syria. Also, he asked, ""How does the council deal with violations of its own resolutions? Because the massacre in Houla was a clear violation of the Security Council resolution."" He added, ""We have to exhaust all means to find a political solution,"" and ""militarization, for us, is not an option."" In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney took a similar tack: ""Right now we believe that, for example, on the issue of providing lethal aid, that that's not the course of action that's the right one to take for this country,"" he told reporters. ""We're providing nonlethal assistance and humanitarian assistance in coordinating with other nations and providing support for the opposition as it forms itself."" Since the uprising in Syria began nearly 15 months ago, Syrian government forces have engaged in a crackdown on the opposition. At least 46 people were killed Wednesday, including 14 in Homs, 12 in the Damascus suburbs and 10 in Daraa, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC also said regime forces launched tear-gas grenades at Aleppo University students and made arrests. Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. observer mission said 13 bodies were discovered Tuesday night in the area of Assukar, 30 miles east of Deir Ezzor in the eastern part of the country. ""All the bodies had their hands tied behind their backs and some appear to have been shot in the head from a short distance,"" according to a statement from the office of Maj. Gen. Robert Mood. Mood called the act ""appalling and inexcusable"" and urged ""all parties to exercise restraint and end the cycle of violence."" Syria, on the state-run news agency SANA, said 25 ""army, law enforcement and civilian martyrs"" were buried Wednesday. Also, an ""armed terrorist group"" attacked an oil pipeline in Deir Ezzor, SANA reported. CNN cannot confirm death tolls or reports of violence from Syria because the government limits access to the country by foreign journalists. Jaafari insisted Syria supports Annan's six-point plan to halt the violence in Syria, and reiterated that his government is acting only against terrorist groups, but finds itself in a difficult position. ""On one hand, if we deploy our army and the law enforcement forces to protect the civilians, somebody would come and criticize us -- Why are we doing that? But if we let the people get killed by the terrorist groups, then we will be also blamed again -- Why you didn't protect your civilians?"" Jaafari described the talks between al-Assad and Annan during the former U.N. secretary general's visit to Damascus as ""good,"" adding that Syria supports his peace plan. But, Jaafari said, other nations must cooperate if peace is to be achieved. ""President Assad reviewed with Kofi Annan the progress that has been achieved by the Syrian government in implementing his plan,"" Jaafari said. ""However, President Assad reminded Mr. Kofi Annan of the necessity to have everybody else committed to respecting his plan and to stop financing and arming and smuggling weapons into Syria.""

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden isn't yet allowed to step outside the Moscow airport where he's been holed up for weeks, despite reports to the contrary, his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, said Wednesday. Russian media had reported Wednesday that the U.S. intelligence leaker was issued a document that would allow him to wait elsewhere in Russia while his request for temporary asylum was considered. But Kucherena, after meeting with Snowden in Sheremetyevo International Airport's transit area Wednesday, told reporters that Snowden hadn't received the certificate and that he would remain in the transit area for now. That certificate still could come at ""any time,"" Kucherena told CNN. Interactive: Snowden's options . The news is the latest development in Snowden's search for a place to settle after the United States charged him with espionage. The former National Security Agency contractor, who admitted last month to revealing sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs to the news media, left Hong Kong for Moscow on June 23. Since then, he's been unable to leave the airport's transit area because the United States revoked his passport. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday the U.S. government is seeking ""clarity"" about Snowden's status. And a spokeswoman for Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would find it ""disappointing"" if Snowden were allowed to leave the airport. Kerry spoke with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, on Wednesday morning, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""He reiterated our belief, which we stated publicly and privately, that Mr. Snowden needs to be returned to the U.S., where he will face a fair trial,"" Psaki said. CNN exclusive: George W. Bush on Snowden . Snowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia on July 16. If granted, he would be able to live in Russia, and even travel abroad, for at least a year, Kucherena said last week. A ruling on the application could take months. But Kucherena has said that the Russian government could issue him a certificate that would allow him to leave the airport and wait somewhere else in the country while the application is considered. On Wednesday, Kucherena said that he is in daily contact with Russian authorities about securing Snowden permission to leave the airport, state-run media outlet RIA Novosti reported. If Snowden is granted temporary asylum in Russia, it's unclear whether he'd try to move elsewhere. He's previously indicated that he eventually wanted refuge in Latin America. But Kucherena suggested last week that Snowden might take his time in Russia. ""As far as I know, he's planning to stay in Russia to learn Russian culture, Russian language and (to) live here,"" Kucherena told CNN last week. Washington has no extradition agreement with Russia, and FBI agents who work at the U.S. Embassy there have no authority to make arrests. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that Snowden would need to ""stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wanted to stay in the country. In a subsequent meeting with human rights activists and lawyers at the airport on July 12, Snowden reportedly said he wanted temporary asylum in Russia while awaiting safe transit to Latin America, and added that he would not harm the United States in the future. Official: Snowden didn't access 'crown jewels' of NSA intel . The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give Snowden asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it ""if circumstances permit."" But he would need the legal ability to travel there -- something that temporary asylum in Russia could give him. The U.S. government has asked Russia to expel Snowden. Absent that, it will watch carefully the route he takes if he tries to reach one of the Latin American countries willing to take him in. The United States could grab Snowden if any plane carrying him were to refuel in a country that respects U.S. arrest warrants. But he probably will be careful to avoid that scenario. Nevertheless, the United States has sent provisional arrest warrants to a number of countries where Snowden could either transit or seek asylum, a U.S. official said last week. CNN's Phil Black, Alla Eshchenko, Jason Hanna and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Kerry presses Russia on Snowden .

"Rome (CNN) -- Five people were convicted of multiple manslaughter and causing personal injury Saturday over the deadly wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise liner off the Italian coast last year -- but only two may serve any prison time under the plea bargain accepted by the judge. The convictions, the first in the case, came after Judge Pietro Molino accepted their plea bargain Saturday morning. The five were originally co-defendants with the cruise ship's captain, Francesco Schettino. But he is now being tried separately on charges of multiple manslaughter in the wreck and abandoning ship. Court proceedings in his case began this week. Thirty-two people died when the Costa Concordia, a luxury liner carrying 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, struck rocks off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13, 2012. Another 150 people were injured in the evacuation of the ship -- 65 of them seriously. The injuries include partial paralysis, amputations and, in one case, blindness. Under the deal, Roberto Ferrarini, Costa Cruises' emergency manager in Genova, was sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison and Manrico Giampedroni, hotel director of the Costa Concordia, was given two years and six months. Ferrarini spoke on the phone and by radio to Schettino the night of the crash between impact and evacuation, and Giampedroni was in communication with Ferrarini on Schettino's behalf that night. Schettino's first mate Ciro Ambrosio, who was the officer on the bridge and in command of the ship when it went off course, was handed a sentence of one year and 11 months; third officer Silvia Coronica, who was second in command to Ambrosio at the time, received 18 months; and helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin was sentenced to 20 months. Those three were also convicted of causing a shipwreck, or maritime disaster. Audio recordings played to the court showed that helmsman Rusli Bin misunderstood Schettino's directions to turn moments before the ship ran aground. Lawyer: 'We will appeal' In Italy, sentences less than two years do not generally have to be served in prison except in some cases of homicide, but not in manslaughter. As a result only Ferrarini and Giampedroni aren't likely to serve any time in prison, although they would first have to exhaust the appeals process. The prosecutor backed their plea bargain requests and all five are on the prosecution witness list for the trial of Schettino in Grosseto, the Tuscan city nearest the site of the wreck. Read more: Costa Concordia reveals its darkest secrets . But Pierpaolo Lucchese , who is one of the many lawyers who objected to the plea bargains, told CNN he will appeal the sentences. ""It is unthinkable that these lives and the damage to the island are worth two years or less,"" he said by phone. ""We will appeal this to Italy's highest court."" Schettino also asked Wednesday for a plea bargain in exchange for a sentence of three years and five months in prison, but the request has not yet been decided. However, the prosecutor adamantly opposes it so there is little chance it will be accepted. The next hearing in Schettino's case is scheduled for September 23, but the judges could rule officially on his plea bargain sooner. Night of chaos . Schettino faces three criminal charges: involuntary manslaughter for the 32 deaths, causing a maritime disaster and causing personal injury to 150 people who were badly hurt in the accident. Read more: What cruise lines don't want you to know . According to passengers' accounts, chaos ensued that night as guests rushed to fill lifeboats and escape the shipwreck. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard, passengers said. Remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee. The case against Schettino centers on several questions, including why it took him more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why the captain allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it. Given the complicated nature of the case, his trial could drag on for a year or more. The prosecutor presented the court with a list of 357 witnesses Wednesday. Running in tandem with the criminal prosecution are numerous civil suits against Schettino, which can be heard at the same time. This means more than 250 civil parties are also represented in court. Read more: Cruise passengers get bill of rights . Meanwhile, the Costa Concordia lies half-submerged on its side on the shore of Giglio Island, rusting and rotting in the waters off Tuscany's coast. Nearly 500 workers are involved in an operation led by Titan Salvage to remove the wreck while protecting the marine environment. Titan and Costa Cruises said earlier this month that they hope to be able to rotate the vessel to a vertical position in September. They will then be able to assess whether it can be refloated and towed away. 1 year on, survivors to mark the disaster .

"(CNN) -- It might be better to travel than arrive, but in the case of British footballers succeeding abroad the journey has all too often been painful -- and all too frequently they have returned home after barely arriving. Quite what Gareth Bale's $134 million journey to Real Madrid brings is open to conjecture, but with his painfully protracted transfer now concluded, the hard part really begins. The spotlight on a British footballer on a global stage has never been greater, with the 24-year-old having eclipsed Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's most expensive player of all time. But there are no guarantees that Bale will live up to the price tag nor shine in La Liga. After all, many of the great and good of British football have faltered away from home. ""Why are there over the last 40 years only about five English players who have done well abroad?"" said Dutch great Johan Cruyff, who both played for and coached Real's rivals Barcelona. ""There's something going on there, something strange."" Herbert Kilpin was the first British footballer to ply his trade overseas professionally in 1891 and he was a founding member of Italian club AC Milan eight years later. There have been others to have made their mark since: John Charles at Juventus, Gary Lineker at Barcelona and, most recently, David Beckham at Real Madrid, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. But for the successes, there have been under-performances and failures, ranging from Ian Rush, who was famously but falsely quoted as saying his spell in Juventus was ""like playing in a foreign country,"" to fellow striker Mark Hughes, who managed just four goals in 28 games at Barcelona. The language barrier is often given as the main reason for the initial struggle for Brits who have failed to settle. It is no surprise that among those to shine were the players who swotted up on the lingo early on. David Platt began Italian lessons while still at Aston Villa -- a move to Bari then just a possibility -- while Steve McManaman mastered Spanish quickly to become at ease almost instantly with Real Madrid teammates and fans alike. Looking back on his foreign sojourn, Lineker recalled: ""I looked at British players who went abroad and were successful. They were the ones who learned the language and adapted to the culture. The ones that didn't tended to be home pretty quickly."" One of the current crop of Britons on the continent is Kris Thackray, currently with German side Alemannia Aachen, who has also had spells with Italian sides in five seasons away from home so far. ""Leaving home and settling in was difficult,"" he said of the early days abroad. ""The complete change of culture from food, people, climate and mainly the language was challenging. ""The language is the most important thing, not knowing it isolates you and stops you from expressing your personality and prevents you from understanding simple messages on and off the pitch."" Read more: Bale becomes latest 'Galactico' Rush never really mastered the language and, as a result, felt a lonely figure in the Juve dressing room while Paul Gascoigne made no secret of being homesick while in Serie A with Lazio as he never managed more than a few token phrases of Italian. Chris Waddle, who won three league titles in France with Marseille as well as reaching the 1991 European Cup final, said that it took three months to learn the language and, after that, he slotted right in. But language is not the sole barrier, the cultural differences as a whole are a more deep-rooted issue for many, and, like with Gazza, plain old home sickness. Rush used to get his family to bring over digestive biscuits while former England goalkeeper Scott Carson, who spent two seasons in Turkey with Bursaspor, repeatedly bemoaned a lack of baked beans. Jamie Lawrence is a young English player who has been in Holland since the age of 16. He initially joined Ajax in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam and now, aged 21, plays for RKC Waalwijk's under-23 team. His advice for Bale would be to immerse himself in the Spanish culture, which in turn will help him settle into the Madrid way of life. ""The great thing about moving to a new country is all the new experiences,"" London-born Lawrence told CNN. ""If you don't put too much pressure on yourself, you can really enjoy it. ""I would say learn the most you can about the Spanish culture and become a part of it. I lived in an English culture for 16 years, moved here and it's completely different. It's so great the culture here, I'm involved in it."" For others, the issue was of being the virtual alien in the midst of a new bunch of players. Kevin Keegan was a huge success story abroad with a spell at Hamburg, which resulted in two Bundesliga titles and with him twice being named European Footballer of the Year. But things started far from well, with reports that some players would not even pass to him in training, unhappy he had been brought to the German club. So, playing abroad -- for a Brit or otherwise -- takes a certain strength of character. Former Liverpool striker Stan Collymore admitted he wasn't up to such a culture shock, leaving Spanish side Real Oviedo after just three appearances for the club. So how exactly does Bale avoid falling into the trap of some of his esteemed predecessors? After all, Real fans can be a heartless bunch, whatever the price tag. One former player, Jonathan Woodgate, another Brit, was voted the worst signing of the 21st Century in a poll by Spanish newspaper Marca. ""The world has been littered with English players who haven't adjusted to being a big player at a European club,"" journalist Michael Calvin, who has regularly crossed paths with Bale during his meteoric rise over the past three years, told CNN. ""He knows he is a disposal commodity. If he doesn't perform he is toast."" Making sure he does not fall by the wayside particularly with the size and variety of expectation -- from what he does on the field to off it -- is the big trick. ""Real Madrid and Perez are looking at him as helping them launch into a completely different commercial market,"" added Calvin, author of the recently published ""Nowhere Men,"" which looks at football's unknown football talent spotters -- a club's scouts. ""They want him to do a Beckham and his world is going to change irrevocably. He is right up in the upper strata. ""Is this a top three player and can he drive that commercial momentum? Can he operate in the same side as Ronaldo? Is he Ronaldo lite? Will he have physical weaknesses? It is unique opportunity and unique challenge. ""He will need that foundation stone of his family and his friends. It is a huge leap from being the boy at home playing FIFA to being the hope of world football."" Calvin, though, also makes the point that Bale is no innocent bystander in all this. ""The whole scorpion dance of a big move comes in,"" added Calvin. ""He understands his clout. He is not an innocent. People in his situation aren't innocent. They are products of an occasionally brutal world."" In Spain, there is the goldfish bowl aspect for Bale to encounter along with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones, bigger at Real than at most clubs in the world. Already, Bale has made about a third of Spanish newspaper Marca's front pages in August alone. On the issue of the media spotlight, Calvin said: ""His parents are model parents and helped him get through an academy system, which is predisposed to producing bad Dads and mad Mums. ""That value structure will come under unprecedented scrutiny and he will have to quickly get used to the current absurdities of that world. That's where he is going to have to readjust and recalibrate his life."" It could go a number of ways. He could become Charles, nicknamed the gentle giant and voted Juventus' greatest foreign import above Zinedine Zidane and Michel Platini, or else McMamanan, who is still talked favorably about by the Madridistas after winning the Champions League in his first season with Real. Or else he could do down the Woodgate route, of being reviled rather than revered. The eyes of the world will be watching which way it goes.","Gareth Bale faces pressure to live up to $134 million price tag at Real Madrid .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tread marks in a footprint at one of the sites of recent paint vandalism in Washington matched the tread on a shoe belonging to the woman charged in one of the incidents, a police detective testified Friday. The testimony came during a probable cause hearing in District of Columbia Superior Court for Jiamei Tian, charged with destruction of property in the splattering of green paint in two locations inside the National Cathedral. A judge ruled that she will be released to a halfway house until her next hearing. Judge Frederick Sullivan said Tian must wear an ankle monitor and that she will be allowed no social visits, meaning no one can visit her and she cannot leave the halfway house. It was unclear how quickly Tian would be released to the halfway house. A status hearing in her case was set for August 29. The 58-year-old Tian was dressed in a navy jumpsuit and appeared calm throughout the hearing, during which the government called two law enforcement witnesses. Tian followed the proceedings with the help of an interpreter. According to court documents, Tian had a visa allowing her to be in the United States that expired on Saturday. She had traveled on a Chinese passport. Prosecutors argued after her arrest that she was a serious flight risk with no fixed address. But the judge, explaining his ruling Friday to release her to a halfway house, said, ""Holding somebody without bond is a very extreme remedy, which in many respects abridges a presumption of innocence."" The Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had placed an immigration detainer on the woman but lifted that Friday. ""Based on the judge's orders, ICE is lifting the detainer on Tian ... and enrolling her in Alternatives to Detention so ICE can closely monitor her while she is in removal proceedings,"" said agency spokesman Brandon A. Montgomery. Alternatives to Detention is a federal program of supervised monitoring for people who are in immigration removal proceedings but who do not require detention. Tian was arrested Monday after paint was discovered splattered on an organ console and casework inside the historic Bethlehem Chapel, located in the National Cathedral's lower level. A spokesman said the paint was wet when it was discovered. Paint also was found in the Children's Chapel, located in the cathedral's nave. When officers arrested her, Tian had green paint on her clothes and shoes, and paint cans were found in three bags she had with her, according to a police report obtained by CNN. If found guilty, she could face up to 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine. U.S. Park Police say Tian is a ""person of interest"" in other recent paint incidents, including the splattering of green paint at the Lincoln Memorial and on a statue outside the Smithsonian Castle, but Park Police Sgt. Paul Brooks said the investigation into those incidents is still ongoing. No other paint incidents have been reported since Tian's arrest on Monday. At the hearing Friday, city police Detective Wai Tat Chung testified in the Cathedral case, saying another detective who investigated the Lincoln Memorial incident told him the tread on the suspect's shoes matched a footprint found at that site. ""He said the shoe and the prints matched,"" Chung told the court. A fourth landmark in Washington - Luther Place Memorial Church -- was also marred with paint last week. Church officials found green paint on a statue of Martin Luther and later the pastor and organist found white paint mixed with feces and urine splattered on the front of the organ and up onto the organ pipes and the chairs where the choir sits. After Tian's arrest, witnesses at the church recalled seeing her in a service there on Sunday. ""There were a few people here incuding our pastor who recognized her from the TV,"" said Jack Reiffer, the parish administrator at the church. Reiffer said police had taken paint samples from the church to compare it to the paint found at other sites.","Jiamei Tian was arrested Monday after paint vandalism at Washington's National Cathedral .

"London (CNN) -- There's a new menace lurking in the streets of London -- exploding sidewalks. It may sound like a joke, but for Indran Sivarajah, who experienced a near miss three years ago, it was no laughing matter. Sivarajah, who works for a communications firm, was walking along a sidewalk in the trendy Shoreditch neighborhood of east London when he saw a puddle. He stepped into the road to avoid it -- and two seconds later heard a large explosion just behind him. ""I turned back and saw a big fire gushing up,"" he said. ""I could feel the heat from it."" One potential reason is that water or gas entered electricity cable boxes and cabling running under the sidewalks or pavement. The Health and Safety Executive, a UK public body that oversees safety in the workplace, has ordered UK Power Networks, which runs the power network for London, to carry out a major inspection program in the London area -- and ""find long-term solutions"" to the problem. It was when he sat down at his desk, Sivarajah said, that he realized what a close shave he'd had. ""If I hadn't been avoiding that puddle, it could've been me in that blast. I count myself very lucky,"" he said. At least five people have suffered injuries in sidewalk explosions, according to information compiled by government officials since January 2012. Three women were injured in a blast in central Edgware Road just over a year ago. One, age 55, had 20% of her body burned and was said to have suffered ""life-changing"" injuries, London's Evening Standard newspaper reported at the time. The other two also suffered burns. Another woman suffered whiplash injuries a month later when a cable box blew up in north London. In November, a cyclist who was knocked off her bike after a cable pit exploded to the west of the city was reportedly taken to a hospital, but no details of her injuries were given. Asked about instances of exploding sidewalks, UK Power Networks said there had been ""relatively few cases"" where its equipment has developed a fault. It has about 100,000 cable boxes and 36,000 kilometers (22,369 miles) of cables under the city's streets. ""We regularly inspect, maintain and reinforce our network to ensure that London maintains its position as the most reliable electricity network in Britain,"" the company said in a statement. ""Underground equipment can always develop a fault, but most of the time it has no external impact. Some events have involved gas or third party damage and were not necessarily just caused by an electrical fault."" UK Power Networks said it was sending teams out to inspect thousands of cable boxes and pits each year and investing tens of millions of dollars over the next several years to ensure they are safe. The Health and Safety Executive said it had been informed of about 45 incidents involving boxes or cable pits owned by UK Power Networks since August of last year. Not all of them caused an explosion, it said. In some cases, passersby have seen smoke or flames come out of a manhole cover or from link boxes in the sidewalk, according to the government reports. In other instances, the cover for a cable pit has been blown off, damaging nearby cars or buildings. UK Power Networks distributes more than a quarter of the United Kingdom's electricity, serving about 8 million customers in London, the southeast and east of England. It is owned by the Cheung Kong Group, a Hong Kong-based multinational conglomerate. It also operates electricity distribution businesses in Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 5 people have been hurt in London sidewalk explosions since January 2012 .

"(CNN) -- CNN's new documentary, ""Our Nixon,"" tugs open the curtain for a moment on one of the most complex, haunted presidents in modern times. I worked on his White House staff for more than three years and can attest that that while this isn't the complete Richard Nixon, viewers get a revealing, first-hand look at parts of the man rarely seen. It is hard for younger generations to grasp just how dominant a figure Nixon was for over four decades in American life. With the exception of Franklin Roosevelt -- the Babe Ruth of 20th century politics -- only Nixon has been nominated by his party for high office in five national elections. From the days he rocketed to power as a young, ambitious congressman until he went to his grave, Nixon made the cover of Time magazine 56 times. No one else in his time was as widely respected or reviled; no one else won a massive re-election only to leave the White House in disgrace. Nixon almost had it all -- and then he lost it. Why? Why do colossally powerful men make a colossal hash of things, even down to today? I was a relative innocent when I left the Navy in the early 1970s and by serendipity, was offered a job in the Nixon White House by Raymond Price, then the head of the speechwriting team and soon a wonderful mentor. Ray asked me to be his administrative assistant and within weeks, I was a note taker in Cabinet meetings, where I had a bird's-eye view of Nixon at his best. The CNN documentary captures some of those heady moments through the home movie cameras of Bob Haldeman (chief of staff), John Ehrlichman (top domestic adviser) and Dwight Chapin (RN's aide-de-camp and television impresario). The films show how much Nixon doted on the pomp and circumstance of the office -- the balloon drops at conventions, waving to mammoth crowds (7 million turned out when we went to Cairo), walking the Great Wall in China, sipping champagne with Zhou Enlai. Nixon lapped it all up. Photos: Nixon through the years . What is missing from the films are the serious, thoughtful conversations of Nixon away from cameras. In truth, he was the best strategist I have seen in the presidency -- someone able to go up on a mountain top, look 30 years into the future and try to bend the arc of history to favor the nation's security interests. He was a student of the past and like one of his heroes, Winston Churchill, thought that a leader who can see farther back can see farther ahead. Americans knew he could be mean and duplicitous, but I sensed they voted for him because they also thought he was smart enough and tough enough to keep the Soviets at bay. They were right. If your home is threatened, you want a German shepherd, not a cocker spaniel. In my early days as a junior lieutenant, I mostly saw the bright side of Nixon -- the one who read books recommended to him by his early counselor, Pat Moynihan, and debated the virtues of World War I generals with Henry Kissinger. Only when I had more experience and he invited me in closer did he begin to reveal the rest of him -- the dark side. That darker side is woven through the CNN documentary, mostly through the secret tapings that he made of himself and those with whom he was talking. Only a select few knew of the taping system; learning of it was a shock to all the rest of us on staff. I had not heard most of the tapes here but found them consistent with the Nixon I eventually came to know: a brooding, deeply insecure man who laments how little support he has from his own Cabinet and how much bias he sees in the press. It has been said that even paranoids have real enemies. Indeed, Nixon had plenty of real enemies, but his insecurities prompted him to create even more in the way he lashed back. He came to believe that politics is a jungle and that to survive, one must observe the law of the jungle: Either eat or be eaten. Zelizer: Four lessons from Nixon's presidency . The late Leonard Garment -- along with Ray Price, one of the white hats in that White House -- thought Watergate could be traced back to the Vietnam War. Nixon came to power not only with insecurities but with a bitterly divisive war on his hands, one that threatened to tear the country apart. As was his wont, Nixon thought he had to control events, not be controlled by them. So, he started bugging the phones of reporters and his own appointees and eventually he set up a ""plumbers"" unit to stop national security leaks. In view of Garment, who served as a close legal adviser to Nixon, that effort to control anti-war fever turned into a political operation during the 1972 re-election. From there, it was only a tiny step to the Watergate break-in at Democratic headquarters. That is a persuasive theory, but I concluded there was something more basic also at work in Nixon's downfall -- and we see pieces of it in the CNN documentary. Fundamentally, I believe that as Carl Jung argued, each of us has a bright and dark side, and that the task of becoming a mature, integrated adult is to conquer one's dark side or at least bring it under control. Nixon simply did not have that dark side under control -- he had demons inside him and when they rose up in fury, as they did so often, they could not only destroy others but destroy him, too. There have been moments since his downfall that I have actually felt sorry for him. As a wise counselor of his, Bryce Harlow, once observed, we will never know what happened to Nixon when he was young, but it must have been something terrible. A word about the three men behind the cameras in the documentary: I knew each of them in varying degrees and am sure they never envisioned themselves as Nixon ""henchmen."" As their films suggest, they thought they had a ringside seat on one of the greatest shows ever -- and loved it. But they were swept into the web of intrigue in that White House and went along with the deceits, the dirty tricks and yes, the criminality. Ehrlichman eventually felt bitter and betrayed by Nixon; Haldeman, as the film represents, felt the critics were terribly wrong and that one day, Nixon would be better understood. Emotionally, I was drawn more to Chapin: he was young and relatively innocent, too, and he was one of the most creative advisers I have seen in the White House -- an impresario in the league of Mike Deaver and Jerry Rafshoon. His ""sin,"" I believe, is that he was so devoted that he would do anything to protect Nixon. He paid with a broken career -- the price reckless leaders often exact from the young. Forty years later, Dwight -- to his credit -- is still trying to protect what he can of Nixon, telling me and others where he thinks the CNN documentary film is wrong (too one-sided, he thinks, and misleading in various ways). To this day, historians as well as those of us who lived through the Nixon period, disagree in our judgments. I will always believe that Nixon had elements of greatness in him, but he was ultimately the architect of his own downfall -- he could not control that dark, inner fury and, for the good of the country, he had to go.

"Washington (CNN) -- The wealthy will account for more tax revenue, House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday, while challenging President Barack Obama to sit down with him to hammer out a deal for avoiding the fiscal cliff. ""We have got to cut spending and I believe it is appropriate to put revenues on the table,"" Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. ""Now, the revenues that we are putting on the table are going to come from guess who? The rich."" He continued, ""There are ways to limit deductions, close loopholes and have the same people pay more of their money to the federal government without raising tax rates, which we believe will harm our economy."" Read more: House GOP sticks with Boehner on cliff . Obama, however, continued to insist that Republicans have to ensure no one except the highest-earning 2% of Americans will face higher taxes, before working out a broader agreement on tackling the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. In remarks to business leaders on Wednesday, Obama said Boehner and Republicans have to take the first step. ""I think there is recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it is combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts,"" the president said. ""And if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework, to acknowledge that reality, then the numbers actually aren't that far apart."" He added that ""we can probably solve this in about a week -- it's not that tough."" The statements reflected how negotiations on the automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set to occur on January 1 -- the fiscal cliff -- have evolved since Obama's re-election, and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress, last month. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CNBC Wednesday the Obama administration is ""absolutely"" prepared to go off the fiscal cliff ""if there's no prospect to an agreement that doesn't involve those rates on the top 2%."" Republicans opposed to any new revenue in their quest to shrink government now realize Obama's victory and public support for the president's campaign theme of higher taxes on the wealthy leave them with little negotiating leverage. Read more: The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions . Less than four weeks from the fiscal cliff, GOP leaders face a choice: Agreeing to Obama's demand to hold down tax rates on most Americans while allowing higher rates on top earners, or being blamed for everyone's taxes going up in 2013. Polls show that more Americans will blame Republicans, instead of Obama and Democrats, if there is no deal and the nation goes over the fiscal cliff. A Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53%-27% in citing Republicans or Obama. A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45% would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34% who would hold Obama responsible. Economists warn that the fiscal cliff's automatic tax hikes and spending cuts would invite recession. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, a leading deficit hawk, said Wednesday that to avoid the crisis, he would support higher tax rates on wealthier Americans as part of a broader deal with Obama and congressional Democrats. Homes, cars, jobs: Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff . ""I know we have to raise revenue,"" the senator from Oklahoma told MSNBC. ""I don't really care which way we do it. Actually, I would rather see rates go up than do it the other way, because it gives us a greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future."" Despite the public stance softening of some Republicans in each house, signs point to a continuing standoff. Obama and Boehner spoke on the phone Wednesday afternoon, for the first time in a week, according to a source familiar with the call. But the source said the conversation didn't lead to any breakthrough. And moving forward, no formal negotiating sessions are known to be scheduled, and congressional aides say no back-channel discussions are taking place. The House is scheduled to adjourn for the year on December 14, but Boehner's number two, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said Wednesday the chamber would remain in session until a fiscal cliff deal gets reached. Read more: Americans make big choices over fiscal cliff . And Boehner said, ""I'll be here and I'll be available at any moment to sit down with the president to get serious about solving this problem."" Obama demands that the House immediately pass a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Democrats, including the president, argue that both sides agree that the 98% of Americans making less than $250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the tax cuts from the Bush administration expire on December 31. They call for the House to guarantee that outcome by passing the Senate measure now. Once that happens, Obama and Democratic leaders promise, they will work out compromises on other spending cuts sought by Republicans to reduce the deficit, such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs. The latest proposal from House Republicans could reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits by $2.2 trillion over 10 years. The GOP proposal includes $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. While the Republicans gave ground by calling for more revenue through tax reform, the plan only mentioned unspecified elimination of some deductions and loopholes. Jason Furman, an assistant to Obama on economic policy, told reporters Wednesday that the president wants to ensure additional revenue from higher taxes on the wealthy now to help avoid the fiscal cliff. He described the Republican proposal for more revenue as lacking specifics. ""Tell us what it is. Show us a score,"" Furman said. ""Tell us how it locks in revenue because you're trying to actually pass a bill this year, not engage in some long process around tax reform, which we don't have time to do by the end of this year."" Opinion: Millionaires' tax bracket would be a smart compromise . While some Republican senators have blasted the House proposal, others have signaled a willingness to use it as a starting point. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said he would support Boehner's plan to raise revenue, but only if there is a ""willingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three-to-one or four-to-one."" While the White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy, aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013, but only after those rates increase now. Obama's deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant portion of a $4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal. It also would close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. The Obama plan includes $50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs, such as repairing roads and bridges. Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action. Read more: Same players, same disputes in fiscal cliff debate .

"(CNN) -- I've written quite a bit about medical myths, so I'm always a bit skeptical about medical ""knowledge."" But one thing I, and I'm sure many of you, think we understand is obesity. After all, weight issues crop up in media constantly. Just last night, Gov. Chris Christie was joking about donuts and his weight on The Late Show with David Letterman, and the First Lady's weight is once again a subject of discussion in the Washington Post--even though by any objective standard she's in great shape. We know how people gain weight, and we think we know how to lose it. Except a study in this week's New England Journal of Medicine shows us that's just not right. Pretty much everything we ""know"" about obesity and weight loss is wrong. Let's start with some things that are true. More than a third of Americans are obese. Many more are overweight. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that obesity-related medical costs were almost $150 billion in 2008, and the cost in health related expensed for an average person who was obese was more than $1,400. This doesn't count the physical, mental or quality-of-life toll that obesity can levy on a person. Few of us dispute that we need to do something about this problem. There are plenty of experts (present company included) who will tell you what needs to be done. The sad truth, though, is that lots of that advice (even mine) turns out to be mistaken. I know I've told people that making small, sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time. But it turns out that making such changes, say by deciding to walk a mile every day for five years, results in far less weight loss than you'd expect. Coca-Cola weighs in on obesity fight . I've lectured people about the importance of physical education in schools, and I've seen countless reports declaring that the decrease in PE nationwide is one of the reasons that more children are obese or overweight today. It turns out that studies don't show that's the case. My family loves watching ""The Biggest Loser."" But I've found myself telling my kids again and again that what's shown on TV isn't the best way to lose weight. I tell them that slow and steady works better in the long-run than rapid weight loss. I also tell them that setting unrealistic weight goals can actually sabotage your efforts. So imagine my shock to discover that what evidence exists in this new study hints towards ambitious goals being a good thing, and that quicker weight loss isn't less likely to be kept off in the long-term. People will say eating breakfast is a good idea when you're trying to lose weight, because it will keep you from binging later. But studies show that there's no protective effect from eating breakfast at all. People will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight. But studies show that, on their own, eating more of them without making other behavioral changes doesn't result in any weight loss. There's no magic to fruits and vegetables. Eatocracy: Chefs with Issues: Farm-to-table should still be on the table . People will say that snacking in between meals can lead to weight gain. But studies don't show that to be the case either. In general, people compensate for snacking throughout the rest of the day. In other words, it's not necessarily bad to snack outside of usual meal times. It's all enough to cause one to despair. But just because so much of what we believe is wrong doesn't mean we still can't do something about the issue. Studies do show that you can absolutely overcome genetic and familial factors to lose weight. They show that significant physical activity can help with weight loss, and that it has the added bonus of making you healthier in general. Reducing your caloric intake works overall, especially if it's done in a way to change your overall eating habits. Getting the whole family involved is important. And finally, for some, bariatric surgery can result in life-changing outcomes. Over the past five years, my wife and I have lost quite a bit of weight. I'm down somewhere between 15% to 20% of my high of more than 200 pounds. My wife lost even more, although I'm not going to give you any numbers (I like being married). Now that I look back, if I'm going to be honest about it, I did it in bursts over a few months here and there, each time gaining back less than I had lost. 7 weight loss myths (sort of) debunked . Each time, I had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months, and each time I really restricted my caloric intake. But I've kept the weight off by radically changing my overall eating habits. My breakfast consists of just coffee, I eat very light lunches, such as salads, and dinner is usually a healthy home-cooked meal with the family. My wife cooks way more than she used to and is obsessed with finding ways to make meals healthier. I avoid fried foods almost entirely, and I can't remember the last time I ate in a fast food restaurant. I also get to the gym two to three times each week. I don't tell you this because I think this is what you should do, or because I think it's the key to getting thinner. I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path. Perhaps our problem is we're trying to find a one-size-fits-all solution. I'm not sure that exists. Lastly, what was left out of this new scientific paper was prevention. The single best way to fight obesity is to avoid it in the first place. That has to start when kids are young, and it's a lifelong journey. But one thing I doubt will ever be proved false is that it's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A nurse Tuesday accused San Diego Bob Filner of rubbing her arm in his office and asking for dinner dates in June in exchange for his helping a brain-injured Iraq War veteran. The allegations make her the 11th woman this summer to accuse Filner of sexual harassment while he was mayor or a congressman. Filner, who this week began intensive counseling for his behavior with women, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. ""I felt that his rubbing my arm and telling me to relax and making me feel that help for Katherine was contingent on my going out with him was extremely inappropriate and unacceptable,"" Michelle Tyler, a licensed vocational nurse, told reporters at a San Diego press conference where she was accompanied by her attorney, Gloria Allred. Tyler was the caregiver to Katherine Ragazzino, a Marine injured in Iraq, who was seeking Filner's assistance in negotiating problems with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for her traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Ragazzino was homeless during her post-war ordeal and now resides with Tyler, Allred said. The alleged incident occurred June 11 when Tyler, Ragazzino and a veteran's representative were in Filner's office, and then Filner asked to meet alone with Tyler, telling Ragazzino and the veteran's representative: ""Please step out, you don't need to hear this,"" Allred said. Then Tyler was alone with the mayor in his office. ""The mayor sat back in his chair and said, 'Wow, you are really magnificent.' The mayor started rubbing Ms. Tyler's arm and stated 'Relax, you are incredible. I will help your veteran. I want you to go out to dinner with me and spend time with me,'"" Allred said. Filner allegedly asked Tyler if she was married, and she replied she was in the middle of a divorce. The mayor allegedly replied, ""Good,"" according to Allred. Filner then allegedly referred to Tyler's paperwork requesting the meeting and asked, ""Is that your phone number that I can call you at?"" Allred said. Stunned, Tyler responded, ""I am here to focus on Katherine,"" according to Allred. Filner allegedly persisted and said, ""I am going to help her but I would really like to be seen in public with you, you are really something,"" Allred said. Filner allegedly asked Tyler, ""Will you go to dinner with me if I help your Marine? Can I call you?"" according to Allred. Tyler said she needed to leave his office, but the mayor allegedly told her, ""If we were not here in my office, I would like to kiss you,"" Allred said. After telling the mayor he should focus on Ragazzino's issues, Tyler stood up and left his office, and the mayor allegedly said on her way out, ""I am going to call you,"" Allred said. Tyler and Ragazzino, who have known each other since 2004, first met with Filner when he was a congressman in 2011, and ""he encouraged us to seek him out again if appropriate corrective measures were not taken by the VA,"" Ragazzino said. Ragazzino was injured in Iraq and spent 18 months in a hospital as a result of her traumatic brain injury. She and Allred declined to elaborate on the injury. At one point, Ragazzino was living in her car, and her problems with the VA about her disability ""seriously affected my healing process,"" she said. After discharged from the Marines, Ragazzino was ""at rock bottom and pushing everyone away"" because of the brain injury and post-traumatic stress, she said. Ragazzino said she felt ""deeply disappointed and upset"" by Filner's alleged misconduct toward Tyler. ""I don't appreciate being used as a bargaining chip to fulfill his sexual desires,"" Ragazzino said. Said Tyler: ""It was extremely disturbing to me that he made it very clear to me that his expectation was that his help for Katherine depended on my willingness to go to dinner with him, spend personal time with him and be seen in public with him."" Tyler and Ragazzino are asking the city attorney to investigate the mayor for sexual harassment. Tyler doesn't have plans to file any civil lawsuit, Allred said. During Tuesday's press conference, Allred displayed a warning sign that she said should be displayed out the mayor's office: ""Danger. Warning to women. Keep out. Keep out. Mayor is in his office. Proceed at your own risk."" Earlier this summer, when the allegations against him emerged, Filner acknowledged ""I need help,"" and added, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them. It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong,"" he said in a statement issued July 11. But Filner, 70, has also said he believes he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and he will not resign, though alleged victims have so asked. Filner served 10 terms, or 20 years, in Congress before being elected mayor in 2012. Many of the accusations come from his time as a congressman.","A nurse and a brain-injured Iraq War vet meet with mayor in his office in June .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Three suicide car bombs were used to target a joint U.S.-Afghan base in eastern Afghanistan early Sunday in an attack that left at least three Afghan soldiers and two civilians dead, officials said. The attack began shortly before sunrise when insurgents -- wearing coalition uniforms -- attacked three different points at Forward Operating Base Fenty, near the Jalalabad Airfield, according to the NATO-led International Assistance Security Force's regional command in Nangarhar province. It's the latest in a series of attacks in recent years that have targeted the base, and it comes just months after NATO troops turned over security responsibilities for Nangarhar province to Afghan forces. There were conflicting reports over casualties. ISAF said the attack, which it described as ""complex,"" left at least one Afghan soldier dead and several wounded. A provincial police spokesman put the toll at two civilians and three soldiers killed. At least 14 Afghan soldiers and four civilians were wounded in the blasts, said Havrat Hussain Mashriqwal, the police spokesman. There were no immediate reports of any U.S. casualties. The attack began shortly after 5 a.m. when insurgents detonated a car bomb near the front gate of the base, according to Mashriqwal. A second bomb-rigged car attempting to breach the base exploded after U.S. and Afghan troops opened fire, Mashriqwal said. A third car bomb was detonated outside the base's perimeter, according to the coalition. ""Afghan National Army and International Security Assistance Force soldiers repelled the attack and prevented any insurgent fighters from entering the perimeter, causing numerous insurgent casualties in the process,"" the statement said. The insurgents -- three suicide bombers and six gunmen -- were killed in the blasts and the firefight that ensued, Mashriqwal said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call to CNN. Mujahid said there were two suicide car bombs and a suicide bomber with an explosive belt used in the attack, which he claimed killed at least 20 people. The Taliban routinely make telephone calls or send out e-mails claiming responsibility for attacks against coalition and Afghan troops. The province borders Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, home to a number of insurgent groups, including members of the Haqqani Network. Insurgents have been active in Nangarhar, which is home to the Tora Bora region -- where al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden escaped after a 2001 battle with coalition forces. Sunday's attack at FOB Fenty is the latest in a series to target the base and neighboring Jalalabad Airfield. In February, nine people were killed and 12 wounded in a suicide bombing at the front gate of the base near the airfield. Two months later, four suicide bombers wearing women's burqas tried to launch an attack there, airfield commander Jahangir Azimi said at the time. In June 2010, Taliban insurgents hit the front gate with a car bomb, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A South African chef who has worked in New Zealand for six years claims his work visa was denied because of his obesity. But New Zealand immigration authorities say the visa was denied because the man ""no longer had an acceptable standard of health,"" that his ability to work was in question and that there is potential ""high cost"" of his healthcare. Albertus Buitenhuis, 50, as described by his wife, has ""always been on the larger side."" And the 278-pound man (126 kilograms) says he struggles with his weight. So how did a chef who specializes in South African cuisine get caught in the crosshairs of two major controversies -- immigration and obesity? ""I am a chef, not a politician and I do not want to be the poster child for immigration issues -- but I have become that I feel,"" he told CNN. ""I just want to work and live here."" After Buitenhuis and his wife arrived in New Zealand in 2007, they were granted subsequent visitor and work visas. They settled in the city of Christchurch and Buitenhuis found work at a restaurant, the Cashmere Club, where he became known for his ""curry of the day."" Their run-in with immigration began when the couple applied for New Zealand residency in 2011. To qualify for residency, Buitenhuis had to take several medical tests. After the exams, the immigration authorities found that ""he did not have an acceptable standard of health."" Although Buitenhuis withdrew his residency application, his health information was now on record. In May, Immigration New Zealand rejected his work visa application for health reasons. Immigration New Zealand did not cite Buitenhuis' weight for rejecting his work visa. The agency stated in a media release that obesity alone is not enough to fail the country's required health screenings. Instead, it cited a litany of Buitenhuis' obesity-related complications and stated that he had evidence of chronic knee joint condition, impaired glucose tolerance and enlarged fatty liver. The agency noted that a replacement surgery for Buitenhuis' knee joint condition could cost over US$16,000 (NZ$20,000). ""The applicant's ability to work is affected by the chronic knee joint condition that he suffers from,"" the agency stated. It also listed his ""significant risk of obesity complications"" as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, some cancers and premature joint diseases. The agency's medical assessors ""have to consider to what extent there might be indications of future high-cost and high-need demand for health services."" New Zealand has a public health system, which is free or low cost to users because of government subsidies. Also the country's immigration policy states that people with a body mass index over 35 are not likely to meet health requirements due to health risks. Buitenhuis agrees with the notion that countries have to protect their taxpayers from high health expenses. ""I see no problem with potential immigrants being screened for risks to either national health or maybe becoming a financial burden on the taxpayers,"" he said. ""All countries do that."" But he said they would've wanted to know sooner. He said they've already put down their roots in New Zealand. Buitenhuis was heavier at 353 pounds (160 kilograms) when he first arrived to New Zealand. Now 75 pounds lighter, Buitenhuis said he was never warned about not meeting an ""acceptable standard of health"" until about a year ago. The only previous mention of his weight was when he applied for residency and an agent warned them that ""INZ is very strict on weight and that it was unbelievable that I was actually given a work visa in the first place."" The couple has filed an appeal to Immigration New Zealand, which they expect to hear back in two weeks. His doctor has written a letter of support, stating that Buitenhuis had brought his cholesterol and blood pressure under control and that his BMI is high because of his build. Since May, the couple have had to stop working because they are considered illegal aliens -- which has thrown their lives into turmoil. ""We've been kicked out of our home. We're in the process of losing our phones, we're going to be cut off. We're living with my sister,"" he said. ""It hurts your pride, it's humiliating."" The couple hopes to remain in New Zealand as their relatives live there. ""We committed no crime and did nothing wrong other than my husband being a foodie,"" wrote Marthie Buitenhuis, his wife. ""We also feel that this situation is treated very lightly while it should be abundantly clear to the officials involved with our case that the situation is urgent."" Countries are limited in what health screening measures are applied to short-term visitors. But the International Health Regulations, a legally-binding international agreement to prevent the spread of diseases, allows countries to apply additional screenings for people who seek long-term residence because of health expenses picked up by the nation's services. Boyd Swinburn, professor of Population Nutrition and Global Health at the University of Auckland, said in an era of growing waistlines and soaring health costs, tough policy decisions have to be made. ""I think governments are looking for ways to reduce the health care cost burden on the population on the taxpayer,"" he told CNN. ""So they'll be looking at all sorts of ways to do that.

More than a quarter (28%) of New Zealanders are considered obese, which is considerably lower than the United States (35.7%). This is not the first time New Zealand has made headlines on this issue.

"(CNN) -- The guns that have ravaged much of Syria since March 2011 may fall silent Friday, now that Syria's government has agreed to a cease-fire. Syria's government and its main rebel force, the Free Syrian Army, said Thursday they would halt military operations during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which runs from Friday to Monday. But the terms of Syria's agreement have raised skepticism among some observers: Damascus reserves the right to respond to ""terrorist"" attacks, including bombings, as well as ""terrorists"" trying to reinforce their positions; and to protect neighboring borders crossed by ""terrorists."" On the rebel side, a top Free Syrian Army general said his fighters had agreed to halt military operations if the Syrian government were to do so as well. But he said he doubted that the truce would hold. Syria's rebel opposition is fractured, and Gen. Mustafa al-Sheikh noted that some rebel groups have not agreed to halt operations. The United States and the United Nations, which helped negotiate the truce through U.N.-Arab League special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, welcomed the news, despite the uncertainty. Barbara Walters says she regrets trying to help Syrian aide . ""What we are hoping and expecting is that they will not just talk the talk of cease-fire, but they will walk the walk -- beginning with the regime,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""welcomes the reported announcements,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters. ""Obviously, the world is now watching to see what will happen on Friday morning,"" he said. ""We cannot be sure yet what will transpire, but the hope is that the guns will fall silent for the people of Syria so that they will have peace and quiet during this holy holiday."" U.N. humanitarian workers, working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, are on standby to provide aid to areas that have not been easily accessible, he said. Opposition forces said government troops struck rebel targets Thursday in the war's major hot spots, particularly in Aleppo, Syria's most populous city. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported violence in Homs and Deir Ezzor. At least 106 people were killed Thursday amid fighting and shelling nationwide, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. At least 36 of them died in Damascus and its suburbs and 33 in Aleppo. Rebels expressed skepticism over the truce. ""They have betrayed us many times and they do not care if it is Eid or anything else, they will continue to kill,"" said Abdualla Yasin, the rebel Free Syrian Army spokesman in Aleppo. Eid al-Adha is a major holiday on the Muslim calendar. It is described as a joyous time of peace as the faithful celebrate the end of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The government touted several goodwill efforts Thursday leading to its announcement that it will stop fighting. State-run TV aired footage of men walking out of a prison -- part of a government amnesty program, a commentator said. The release comes a week after rebel fighters told Al Jazeera news agency that they would agree to a proposed cease-fire only if the government were to release detainees, end a siege in the city of Homs and halt aerial attacks. As the cease-fire was announced, rebels reported strategic military advances in the city of Aleppo. Syria cease-fire: Could it really happen? The rebel spokesman singled out Aleppo's Kurdish community for permitting the presence of rebels in their neighborhoods. Much of the opposition is Sunni Arab, and rebels said they were heartened to receive support from all groups in the diverse society. ""We were welcomed by the Kurds because people believe the FSA will liberate Syria,"" Yasin said. ""Every small gain brings us closer to victory. The FSA was also happy to unite another facet of Syrian society under the FSA umbrella."" Previous truces have failed to take hold in Syria, which has been wracked by civil war since March 2011. In April, a cease-fire lasted barely a day before the killing resumed. In total, more than 32,000 Syrians have died since the conflict began, opposition activists say. A spokesman for the Syrian National Council, an opposition coalition, said the truce is an attempt by President Bashar al-Assad to buy time. ""The whole world knows that the Syrian regime cannot be trusted and doesn't have any credibility in fulfilling any promise that they make to anyone,"" said George Sabra, a Paris-based spokesman for the Syrian National Council, which speaks for rebels fighting al-Assad. ""The Assad regime is trying a diversion."" It's foolish to expect a total cease-fire, said Aram Nerguizian, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. A cease-fire in this context is about a larger goal of getting most rebel brigades and al-Assad forces to halt or reduce the killing. The rebels themselves are partly to blame for the failure of this spring's cease-fire, Nerguizian said. They have been just as vicious in their killing as al-Assad's forces, he said. But getting them to work together and resist the urge to fight, he said, is unrealistic. Meanwhile, the United Nations' investigation into alleged war crimes in Syria is moving forward. The Geneva-based U.N. commission investigating war crimes announced Thursday it has requested a meeting with al-Assad to discuss gaining access to Syria for the team. 5 things you need to know about Lebanon and Syria . Carla del Ponte, who once served as prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, is part of the commission. Noted for her investigation of war crimes in the Balkans in the 1990s, she cited similarities with past probes. ""The similarity is, of course, we are handling the same crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes for sure,"" she said. The Syrian government's isolation continued to grow. In Jedda, Saudi authorities announced the deportation of three staff members of the Syrian Consulate General, the official Saudi Press Agency said Thursday. The move was taken because ""authorities have concluded that their behaviors are incompatible with their consular duties and assignments,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- An Illinois sheriff filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the owners of craigslist, accusing the popular national classified-ad Web site of knowingly promoting prostitution. ""Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation,"" says Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart. Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart wants craigslist to eliminate its Erotic Services section. ""Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation,"" Dart said. ""Missing children, runaways, abused women and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they're being pimped on craigslist."" The FBI found more than 2,800 child prostitution ads posted on craigslist, with Chicago, Illinois, in the top 10 cities for juvenile prostitution, Dart said. The sheriff also noted instances of what he said was child neglect while parents were engaged in activity solicited on the Web site. In an e-mailed statement, craigslist told CNN it had not seen Dart's complaint but that ""craigslist is an extremely unwise choice for those intent on committing crimes, since criminals inevitably leave an electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will follow."" ""On a daily basis, we are being of direct assistance to police departments and federal authorities nationwide,"" spokeswoman Susan McTavish said. ""Misuse of craigslist to facilitate criminal activity is unacceptable, and we continue to work diligently to prevent it,"" she said. ""Misuse of the site is exceptionally rare compared to how much the site is used for legal purposes. Regardless, any misuse of the site is not tolerated on craigslist."" But Dart said that the Web site for two years has ignored his written requests to shut down the Erotic Services section and failed to take action or adequately monitor the section despite hundreds of arrests. ""Pimps are preying on the most vulnerable members of our society and taking advantage of our struggling economy,"" he said. ""The worst part is craigslist's owners know their Web site is still being used for illegal purposes and they're doing nothing to stop it."" Craigslist entered into an agreement with 43 states' attorneys general in November to enact measures that impose restrictions on its Erotic Services section. The agreement called for the Web site to implement a phone verification system for listings that required ad posters to provide a real telephone number that would be called before the ad went public. Craigslist also imposed listing fees, requiring a credit card, for ads in the section. The proceeds were to be donated to charity. Dart called the fees ""dirty money"" and said the move was a ""publicity stunt"" that had little practical effect because pimps use stolen credit cards or post ads in free sections.","Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart wants craigslist to cut Erotic Services section .

"(CNN) -- Charity: water will receive a $5 million grant from Google's Global Impact Awards to provide clean and sustainable water supplies to the world's most far-flung and impoverished regions. The non-profit group that builds water wells for communities in the developing world is hoping to install 4,000 low-cost remote sensors. The sensors will transmit real-time data to the charity and its donors on the condition and flow of water at particular wells. Charity: water founder Scott Harrison announced the new plan today at the 2012 LeWeb conference in Paris. Read more: 'Father of the internet': Fight to stay free . ""We realize 4,000 [sensors] is an aggressive target to implement by the end of 2015, but we've always set aggressive goals,"" Harrison told CNN.

The entire initiative will be funded through Google's Global Impact Awards, a scheme designed by the Silicon Valley tech giant to support pioneering technologies. Read more: What it means to be a digital native . Harrison said the charity is planning to test different technologies for each country depending on the type of well installed there. ""For example, our commitment in Ethiopia has consisted mainly of hand-dug wells, and in Nepal, we fund large-scale spring systems. Two completely different sensors, partners, and methodologies,"" he explained. Knowing the location of the well isn't enough anymore -- the charity also wants to collect information to establish if the wells are working and if they need to be fixed. A large part of the pilot program would also involve continuing its work in training local mechanics to maintain the water supply, which Charity: water says will spur job creation. Harrison added: ""We want to do the best job of fully implementing the technology as well as building up response teams (mechanics) to ensure the sustainability of the projects and continue serving our beneficiaries with full transparency.""

"(CNN) -- The Ashes is not a sporting event -- it is an obsession. Since 1882, England and Australia's cricketers have fought, wrestled and spilled blood in one of the world's fiercest rivalries. Whether it be on the rugby field or on the cricket pitch, these two countries only care about one thing -- winning. On Wednesday, when England and Australia go head to head in cricket's biggest contest, the Ashes, two countries will hold their collective breath and prepare for a brutal battle. It seems perverse that a game, which pauses for tea, and has the possibility of not having a winner after a five day contest, can stir such fierce emotion. But for these two countries, thousands of miles apart, the yearning for victory could not be greater. Rivalry . It's a rivalry which encompasses everything good, and sometimes bad, about sport. It's about pride. It's about passion. It's about blood, guts, victory at all costs. But it's also about respect, a love of the game and the realization that these two nations are forever intertwined through one of sports greatest and most dynamic rivalries. Then there's the history. There's Captain James Cook discovering Australia in 1770 and the settling of British prisoners in Australia 18 years later. Add to that the brotherhood and bond between the two countries in time of war and the union of the Commonwealth. And why not throw a shared monarch into the mix too? United by history, divided by sport. It's one rivalry which threatens to remain eternal. So when when the players of England and Australia walk out at Trent Bridge, with the words of William Blake's Jerusalem ringing in their ears, they will know that the battle has begun. The CNN Ashes guide . To understand the birth of this great rivalry requires a glance at the past. After enduring a dismal defeat by Australia on home soil at The Oval in August 1882, English cricket was left in a state of shock and embarrassment. A newspaper, the Sporting Times, carried a satirical obituary of English cricket, which stated that: ""The body will be cremated and the ashes taken back to Australia."" When England traveled to Australia for the return series, it gained revenge with captain Ivo Bligh awarded a small terracotta urn to symbolize the winning of the Ashes. That small urn is arguably the most precious prize in world cricket with Australia holding it on 31 occasions to England's 30. Controversy . There has been no shortage of drama during Ashes encounters -- but some are better remembered than others, although not always for the right reasons. The most controversial Ashes series remains that of 1932-33, which was known as ""Bodyline"" after England captain Douglas Jardine ordered his bowlers to bowl straight at the bodies of their opponents. It was a tactic which caused huge uproar, with Australian batsman Bert Oldfield suffering a fractured skull as England's bowlers showed no mercy. A 4-1 defeat was difficult to take for Australia and enshrined an extra edge to an already intense rivalry. Stars . Some of the most famous names in cricket have played in Ashes Test matches -- but there are some which are synonymous with this particular battle. One of those is Ian Botham, widely regarded as England's biggest Ashes hero having had a Test series named after him. ""Botham's Ashes"" which took place in 1981, produced one of the most spectacular moments ever witnessed in an Ashes series. After resigning as captain just days earlier following an opening Test defeat, England were on the cusp of going 2-0 down in the series. A dismal start to the second Test at Headingley left Australia tantalizingly close to victory -- but Botham's heroics defied all the odds. An unbeaten 149 from 148 deliveries gave England hope, forcing Australia to score 130 to win the match. But the tourists only managed 111 -- handing the victory to England, which eventually went on to win the series. Australia dominated between 1989 and 2003 -- winning eight consecutive series. The undisputed team of the decade in the 1990s and early 2000s, Australia boasted several world class players such as Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting and brothers Steve and Mark Waugh. Then there was wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who scored the second fastest century in Test match cricket during Australia's 5-0 whitewash of England in 2006-7. But Australia's and indeed the world's greatest ever batsman, is widely acknowledged to have been Donald Bradman. 'The Don' scored 5,028 runs in Ashes contests during his career from 1928-1948 and finished with an average of 99.94. Australia have also dominated with the ball with Warne the leading wicket taker in Ashes cricket with 195, while McGrath claimed an impressive 157. Recent history . While, England might be favorites to win this series, it's important to realize it wasn't always this way. When the 2005 series came to England, Australia was hoping to win its ninth consecutive Ashes series. A routine victory in the opening Test appeared to confirm its status as favorite before a narrow two-run defeat at Edgbaston drew England level. A crucial England victory at Trent Bridge in the fourth Test, coming in between two drawn games, gave the host nation its first series win since 1989. It was the series which introduced Kevin Pietersen to the world stage and led to Andrew Flintoff establishing himself as favorite with cricket fans across the world. Flintoff's 24 wickets and 402 runs were integral to England's success . But his next venture did not go so smoothly as he captained England during its tortuous 5-0 whitewash defeat in Australia in 2006/7. That result left a huge scar on English cricket as Australia humiliated its rival in ruthless fashion. But England bounced back in 2009, winning the home series, before achieving its first victory on Australian soil in 24 years following a 3-1 win in 2010-11. The players . For the players of both teams, playing in the Ashes is the pinnacle. It means everything. There is no greater honor for an English or Australian cricketer -- the stakes are at their highest and victory ensures sporting immortality. But where there are great gains to be made, there are also great losses which can be suffered. And while Australia may not be at its strongest, England is not taking anything for granted. ""It's a bit of a dream come true starting an Ashes series at home in front of all your family and friends at Trent Bridge,"" said England bowler Stuart Broad, who plays for Nottinghamshire. ""But it's all about winning, because if you lose, you look back at that match with horrible memories. But if you win, you have very fond memories, so it's an advantage for us as a team. ""You know what Australians are like. They are tough characters who love to win and you would be disappointed if they didn't come out with a lot of fight. ""You'd be disappointed if there wasn't fire in their bellies in an Ashes series anyway."" Australia might start the series as underdogs but its captain, Michael Clarke, is confident his players can provide a shock result. ""I know especially back in Australia, this is the pinnacle of an Australian cricketer, to play Test cricket in England, be part of an Ashes series and I'm sure there will be judgments made on our performances, and as captain of the team you should be accountable,"" said Clarke. ""I've said for a while now that we come here as underdogs but that hasn't affected our preparation and it won't affect our performance either. ""We know it's going to be tough but I know our boys are up to the challenge. The fans . England's cricket team enjoys unparallelled support in international cricket with is fans universally known as ""The Barmy Army"". Created in 1994 by three friends, the ""Army"" now boasts over 5,000 members and arranges tours across the world to watch England compete. Singing, often accompanied by Billy Cooper, a classically trained trumpet player, adds some color, while the chanting can often provide some light entertainment -- unless you're an Australian. The Barmy Army has a reputation for going after Australia's players with bowler Mitchell Johnson the unfortunate victim during the 2010-11 series. Australia's fans, known as 'The Fanatics' will be hoping to have something to shout about following two consecutive defeats. The two sets of supporters groups play a cricket match against each other during every series with England coming up on top this time around. Where to watch . The five Test matches are taking place throughout England with the opening contest at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. Following that, the series will move to the Home of Cricket, Lord's, in London, before moving up to Manchester, Durham and back to London. The English Cricket Board (ECB) has agreed a deal for cricket fans living in mainland Europe and Latin America to watch the series on YouTube. Star Men . While one captain Cook changed the tide of history in 1770, another is hoping he can make his own mark by putting Australia to the sword. England captain Alastair Cook enjoyed an outstanding 2010-11 series in Australia, scoring 766 runs. He has more than 7,500 runs to his name and is hoping to win the Ashes for the first time since replacing Andrew Strauss as captain. The host nation will also be relying on fast bowler James Anderson, who has emerged as one of the most talented players in world cricket. Anderson, who is particularly adept at swinging the ball in either direction, has taken 307 Test wickets in his career -- a number which ranks him joint-third in the all-time list of England bowlers. For Australia, much depends on the experience of captain Michael Clarke, who has only recently recovered from injury. In his 24 Test matches as captain, he has excelled with the bat at an average of 66. End game? England is the favorite to win its third consecutive Ashes series -- a feat which not long ago would have sounded almost impossible given Australia's dominance in the 1990s. Now, with Australia no longer the force it used to be, England expects. The pressure to deliver is on, the nation awaits the opportunity to taunt the old enemy once more. But whichever team comes out on top, the world will surely be treated to another epic encounter -- just weeks before both teams do it all over again, this time in Australia. This is one obsession which won't be ending anytime soon. Australian cricket coach axed ahead of Ashes .","England and Australia will compete for The Ashes in a five-match series .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A top executive with AEG Live insists Celine Dion is a ""bigger"" artist than Michael Jackson. John Meglin, testifying Wednesday at the wrongful death trial of AEG Live, also downplayed how many tickets Jackson could have sold if he had not died while preparing for his comeback concerts. AEG Live lawyers are challenging an entertainment expert hired by Jackson lawyers who estimated the King of Pop would have earned $1.5 billion touring the world before his 66th birthday had he not died from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic at age 50. Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend the company is liable for damages because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death. If jurors agree, they could then use estimates of Jackson's lost earnings as a guide to determine how much AEG Live -- the promoter and producer of his ""This Is It"" tour -- must pay the Jacksons in damages. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson -- not its executives -- chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor who signed a $150,000 a month contract with the company to serve as Jackson's doctor for the tour. AEG Live executives never signed the contract, which Murray returned to them just hours before Jackson's death. A nurse anesthetist will testify Thursday about administering anesthesia to Jackson during a medical procedure. He will be the first of what AEG Live lead lawyer Marvin Putnam said would be a parade of ""many, many"" medical professionals who treated Jackson. The company will try to prove that Jackson was a secretive drug addict, which prevented promoters from knowing about the dangers he faced under Murray's care. AEG Live tries to show Jackson had secret drug addiction . Meglin, who has been a concert promoter since the 1970s, is the CEO of Concerts West, the division of AEG Live that was in charge of Michael Jackson's tour. He was the first witness called as the company began presenting its defense in the 13th week of the trial. Much of his testimony was focused on attacking the analysis of certified public accountant Arthur Erk, who testified last week that he was ""reasonably certain"" that Jackson would have performed 260 shows around the world as part of his ""This Is It"" tour. He would have earned $890 million over the three years of concerts in Europe, Asia, South America, North America and Australia, Erk said. Jackson would have earned at least $1.5 billion from touring, endorsements and sponsorships had he lived to age 66, Erk said. Erk's analysis suggested Jackson would stage many of his shows in large stadiums, with more than 90,000 fans buying tickets to many of the concerts. But Meglin testified that his experience told him that no stadiums would seat that many people for Jackson's kind of show. The Erk estimates were inflated by about 30%, Meglin testified. The Rose Bowl would only seat 60,000, Meglin said. Although Billboard Magazine reported that U2 performed for 97,000 people in the Pasadena, California, venue in 2009, Meglin said he was ""trusting my gut"" that the numbers were inflated. ""I know how those numbers can be manipulated,"" he said. Jackson lead lawyer Brian Panish noted that 98,000 people were in the Rose Bowl seats when Michael Jackson performed the halftime show for Super Bowl 27 in 1993. Jackson's mom faces cross examination . Meglin also contested Erk's suggestion that Jackson would have taken his tour to India for at least three shows. ""Nobody goes to India,"" he said. He later acknowledged that Jackson performed there during his HIStory tour. ""It's not a very big market,"" Meglin said of India, which is home to about 1.25 billion people. Meglin also disagreed with what one of his superiors, AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips, wrote in an e-mail that there was enough demand in England alone to sell out more that 200 Jackson shows. ""He believed that,"" Meglin testified. ""I don't believe that."" Fans bought all 750,000 tickets put on sale for 31 shows in March 2009 in just two hours, Phillips said. Enough buyers were already registered to sell out another 100 shows, Phillips wrote. Meglin also disagreed with Phillips' opinion that Michael Jackson was the biggest entertainment artist ever. ""I do myself personally believe that that is not true,"" Meglin testified Wednesday. ""In my opinion Celine Dion is right up there with Michael Jackson and, to me, she is bigger.""","AEG Live's John Meglin disputed an estimate of how much Michael Jackson could've earned .

"(CNN) -- Saudi King Abdullah announced greater political participation for women in the conservative kingdom this week, but Tuesday, a human rights group decried the promised reforms in light of a flogging sentence for a woman who dared to drive a car. Amnesty International said a Saudi woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for getting behind the wheel. The group said the harsh sentence demonstrated the scale of discrimination against women in the Islamic nation, and it urged the dismantling of the ""whole system of women's subordination."" ""Flogging is a cruel punishment in all circumstances, but it beggars belief that the authorities in Saudi Arabia have imposed lashes on a woman apparently for merely driving a car,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""Belatedly allowing women to vote in council elections is all well and good, but if they are still going to face being flogged for trying to exercise their right to freedom of movement, then the King's much-trumpeted 'reforms' actually amount to very little."" Amnesty said a court in Jeddah handed down the sentence Tuesday. Two other women are believed to be facing charges for driving, one in Jeddah and one in al-Khobar. The Women2Drive campaign said the woman who was sentenced to 10 lashes has appealed the sentence. She said she did not want to be identified or speak publicly about her case for her own safety. Women2Drive also said police pulled over women's rights activist Madeah Alajroush for driving in Riyadh on Tuesday. She was taken to police headquarters for questioning and released after she signed a pledge not to drive and called for a taxi home, a statement from Women2Drive said. ""After the euphoria of the announcement on voting, we are saddened and shocked to hear the news today,"" said Maha Al-Qahtani, a member of Women2Drive. No specific traffic laws make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers. Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts, obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian. Authorities stopped Manal al Sharif, 32, for driving a car May 21 and detained her the next day. She said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail. Her case became a rallying cry for female activists. The Women2Drive campaign on Facebook and Twitter encouraged women to drive as part of their normal daily activities rather than converge in one place. On Sunday, King Abdullah announced two changes for women, which would be historic for Saudi Arabia. He said women will be allowed to serve as members of the Shura Council, the appointed consultative council that advises the king. He also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections. It is unknown when those may ultimately take place. The changes do not apply to elections scheduled for Thursday, which will be only the second set of elections in the kingdom since 1963. The U.S. State Department's human rights report on Saudi Arabia, published in 2011, noted many challenges facing women in Saudi Arabia in 2010: . -- ""By law a female rape victim is at fault for illegal 'mixing of genders' and is punished along with the perpetrator."" -- ""The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her 'guardian' with the authority to approve her travel."" -- ""Women risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative."" -- ""Women also faced discrimination in courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women."" -- ""The law requires a woman to obtain the permission of a male guardian to work if the type of business is not 'deemed appropriate for a woman.'"" CNN's Kindah Shair, Mohammed Jamjoom and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Saudi king announced greater political participation for women this week .

"(CNN) -- Novelist Michael Peterson walked out of a North Carolina jail Thursday, eight years after he was convicted of murdering his wife. A jury convicted Peterson in October 2003 of murder, siding with prosecutors who argued he had bludgeoned Kathleen Peterson to death in the stairwell of their Durham home. But on Wednesday, Judge Orlando Hudson ruled that Peterson deserved a new trial and finding that North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation agent Duane Deaver had misled jurors about bloodstain evidence. Deaver was fired by the agency last January. Peterson addressed the press after being released Thursday on bond. ""I have waited over eight years -- 2,988 days as a matter of fact ... for an opportunity to have a retrial,"" Peterson said, while surrounded by family. ""I want to thank Judge Hudson for giving me that opportunity so that I can vindicate myself and prove my innocence, in a fair trial this time."" His son, Clayton Peterson, told CNN affiliate WRAL that he was happy to hear Thursday that his father could get out of jail -- in contrast to his feelings after the verdict came down. ""I sort of went numb, just like I did when I heard guilty,"" he said. ""I love Kathleen more than anything, but he didn't do it. He told me, and I know it and I believe it with my heart."" But Caitlin Atwater, Peterson's stepdaughter, was far less enthusiastic in her remarks. ""My thoughts, as always, are focused on the loss of my Mom -- a wonderful, beautiful and vibrant person,"" Atwater said. ""She meant much to Durham and everything to me. Michael Peterson is still charged with her murder, and this is still in the hands of the justice system."" Peterson, now 68, had made a frantic 911 call on December 9, 2001, about his wife of five years. Police initially believed Kathleen Peterson died as a result of an accidental fall down a flight of stairs, but the sheer volume of blood at the scene and a coroner's report that she had several head lacerations changed their minds. Sixty-five witnesses testified, and more than 800 pieces of evidence were presented, over the course of Peterson's three-month trial in 2003. The jury of five men and seven women deliberated 15 hours over five days before reaching their decision. According to the North Carolina Department of Correction's website, Peterson has had eight infractions since being incarcerated -- including four last year alone, with two for disobeying an order and one each for creating an ""offensive condition"" and theft of property. His books include ""The Immortal Dragon,"" ""Charlie Two Shoes and the Marines of Love Company"" and ""A Time of War."" Peterson's attorney, David Rudolf, predicted that the next trial will be ""very very different"" than the first one. ""Some of the evidence that was introduced at the first trial simply will be inadmissible,"" Rudolf told HLN's Vinne Politan on Thursday.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- America's top commander in Afghanistan warns that more troops are needed there within the next year or the nearly 8-year-old war ""will likely result in failure,"" according to a copy of a 66-page document obtained by The Washington Post. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, right, arrives at a U.S. base in Logar Province, Afghanistan, last month. ""Failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible,"" U.S. and NATO commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal said in the document, according to the Post. Bob Woodward of the Post -- who wrote the article -- called it ""a striking thing for a general to say to the secretary of defense and the commander-in-chief."" McChrystal ""really takes his finger and puts it in their eye, 'Deliver or this won't work,'"" Woodward told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday. ""He says if they don't endorse this full counterinsurgency strategy, don't even give me the troops because it won't work."" The document was ""leaked"" to the newspaper, but parts were omitted after consultations between the newspaper and the Department of Defense, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. ""While we would have much preferred none of this be made public at this time, we appreciate the paper's willingness to edit out those passages, which would likely have endangered personnel and operations in Afghanistan,"" Morrell said in a statement. President Obama is considering the assessment of troop levels completed by McChrystal over the summer, however, a review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan won't be driven ""by the politics of the moment,"" Obama said on Sunday. ""Every time I sign an order, you know, I'm answerable to the parents of those young men and women who I'm sending over there, and I want to make sure that it's for the right reason,"" Obama told CNN's ""State of the Union."" The president put off questions about whether additional troops would be needed, saying, ""I don't want to put the resource question before the strategy question."" But he said Afghans need to show that they are ""willing to make the commitment to build their capacity to secure their own country."" The United States now has about 62,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, with NATO and other allies contributing about 35,000 more. The Pentagon is planning to add 6,000 troops by year's end, and some members of Congress say McChrystal soon will call for thousands more. The fighting has ramped up sharply in the past year as U.S. troops and a NATO-dominated coalition battle a resurgence of the Taliban, the al Qaeda-allied Islamic militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the attacks. Washington poured an additional 21,000 troops into Afghanistan to provide security for its recent presidential election, which has been marred by allegations of fraud. In August, 48 U.S. troops were killed in the fighting, surpassing the previous high of 45 in July. And the war has spread into Pakistan, where Taliban fighters are now battling government troops in that nuclear-armed country. Obama said he has ordered ""a soup-to-nuts re-evaluation"" of the U.S. strategy, refocusing ""on what our original goal was, which was to get al Qaeda, the people who killed 3,000 Americans"" in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  Watch Obama's views on the Afghan war » . ""To the extent that our strategy in Afghanistan is serving that goal, then we're on the right track,"" he said. ""If it starts drifting away from that goal, then we may have a problem."" But support for the Afghan war hit an all-time low in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released last week. That survey found 39 percent still favor the war, compared with 58 percent who oppose it -- making it almost as unpopular as the Iraq war has become in recent years. And calls for more troops could be a tough sell in Congress. Sen. Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has argued that the allies should bolster Afghan forces before sending in more troops of their own.  Watch what Levin has to say about Afghanistan » . ""If we can get the Afghan army much larger, much better equipped, and if we can also get a plan, finally, for co-opting or reintegrating those lower-level Taliban people the way we did in Iraq -- if we can get that in motion -- that hopefully will have an effect on how many additional troops we need to go to Afghanistan,"" Levin told CNN on Sunday. Leading Republicans have called for McChrystal and Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in the Middle East and Central Asia, to testify publicly about their recommendations. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told CNN that it was time for lawmakers to hear what McChrystal has to say. ""We would like to see Gen. McChrystal and Gen. Petraeus come up to Congress, like they did during the Iraq surge and give us the information about what they're recommending,"" McConnell said. ""We think the time for decision is now."" But he added that if more troops were needed, ""I think the president will enjoy a lot of support among Senate Republicans."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, another Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said a decision on additional troops needs to be made soon. ""I've been told Gen. McChrystal's ready to hit the send button in terms of how many more troops he needs, and the longer we wait the harder it is,"" said Graham, of South Carolina. Levin said hearings would be held ""when we have a recommendation that is made to the president, and when the president makes his decision.""","NEW: General puts heat on president, secretary of defense .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lawyer for Michael Jackson's estate gave an entertainment industry consultant permission to help AEG Live in its defense of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the pop singer's mother, the expert testified. The revelation was a surprise to Katherine Jackson, who was sitting in court Tuesday listening to the expert testify that he believed her son would not have earned any money even if he had not died of a propofol overdose. If jurors decide AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death, testimony by Eric Briggs -- whose company billed the concert promoter $700,000 to prepare his opinion -- could be used to determine how much in damages the company would have to pay to Michael Jackson's mother and three children. Briggs, however, previously consulted for the Jackson estate in determining a value of it's biggest asset -- the Sony-ATV music catalog that includes the Beatles songs. He testified that before he signed a contract to serve as an expert in AEG Live's defense he sought and gained permission from the Jackson estate lawyer Jeryll Cohen to waive any potential conflict of interest. ""She (Cohen) was well aware of everything that was going on,"" Briggs testified. A spokesman for the Michael Jackson estate was unaware of the circumstances or reasons why the estate would approve the waiver that could be counter to the interests of its beneficiaries -- Jackson's mother and three children. Bad news hurt Jackson's earning potential, witness says . An entertainment industry analyst hired by Jackson lawyers testified he was ""reasonably certain"" Jackson would have earned $1.5 billion from touring before retiring if he had not died while preparing for his comeback concerts in 2009. Briggs testified that it was ""speculative"" that Jackson would have even completed the 50 ""This Is It"" concerts that AEG Live had already sold out in London. Briggs said that based on what he'd learned from testimony in the case, he believed that Jackson would have died before the first show -- even if he had not suffered the fatal overdose of a surgical anesthetic on June 25, 2009. He cited the testimony of a doctor who said that Jackson would have been dead within a week if he remained under the care of Dr. Conrad Murray. The Jackson lawsuit contends AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon's death. The Erk opinion included $300 million that he estimated Jackson would have earned from endorsements and sponsorships. But Briggs testified that ""significantly negative headlines, drug abuse and other issues"" had ruined Jackson's ability to earn endorsement and sponsorship money. ""Q score"" data for Jackson, which measures his ""likability,"" became dramatically negative by 2006 -- a year after he was acquitted in a child molestation trial, he testified. More than seven people said they disliked Jackson for every one who said they liked him, he said. Companies would be ""very anxious"" about putting someone with such a negative ""likability"" next to their products, he said. Jackson's drug use explored in trial . One issue hurting Jackson's endorsement deal potential was his financial debt, estimated to be $400 million at the time of his death, Briggs said. But Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Briggs if he considered that Jackson's assets -- most notably the Sony-ATV catalogue -- were greater than his debts. Briggs stuttered on the witness stand, saying he was reluctant to discuss Jackson's assets because of a client confidentiality issue. He eventually acknowledged that he had worked for the Jackson estate as a consultant analyzing the value of the music catalog. He signed a confidentiality agreement with the estate, which he said prevented him from discussing it. His company did, however, clear his participation in the wrongful death case with a Jackson estate lawyer before he agreed to be an expert for AEG Live, he said. Briggs also said AEG Live lawyers were aware of the potential conflict before hiring him and had no problem with it. Wednesday is the 60th day of testimony in the trial, which began 14 weeks ago in a Los Angeles County court. The judge told jurors she expects testimony to conclude in mid-September.

"(CNN) -- In the frigid cold of Sweden, police discover a savage triple homicide, a family murdered, a killer still on the loose. There is a sole survivor, a young boy, gravely wounded, his family killed before his eyes. Desperate to find the killer, Detective Inspector Joona Linna turns to a retired hypnotist for help. He convinces Dr. Erik Maria Bark to put the boy under hypnosis, hoping to discover the killer through his eyes. But entering the boy's damaged consciousness unleashes a terrifying chain of events. Hooked yet? This is the premise of ""The Hypnotist,"" the latest ""Nordic noir"" title wowing readers around the globe. One of the first things you should know about the chilling debut thriller from the author, Lars Kepler, is there is no Lars Kepler. Kepler is the pen name of Alexander Ahndoril and Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril, a charming married couple from Sweden. Both authors in their own right, their first collaboration has turned into an international sensation. ""The Hypnotist"" is a best-seller in Sweden and across Europe, with a movie in the works. Now the novel comes to the U.S., and Kepler, or rather the Ahndorils, have drawn the inevitable -- but in this case, well-deserved -- comparison to Sweden's best-known crime writer, the late Stieg Larsson. CNN recently talked to the couple, and the following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind ""The Hypnotist""? The Ahndorils: We happened to have several years of direct insight into professional hypnosis, so the idea of using a hypnotist as a key character came naturally to us. Many crime novels are about getting as close as possible to victims and perpetrators. We thought it would be exciting to use a hypnotist, because he can actually step into other people's memories. When we decided to write together, we challenged ourselves to transfer a filmic atmosphere into words. We want the readers to feel that they are there, inside the fiction, when they read Lars Kepler, almost believing they can influence the course of events. CNN: What do you think about all of the positive international attention? Ahndorils: We are of course very happy, but at the same time, we really need a kind of inner calm to be able to write, so we're actually trying hard not to think about the success. ""The Hypnotist"" has sold to more than 36 countries and has been a best-seller wherever it's been published. The director Lasse Hallström is making it into a movie. It's fantastic, but a good friend of ours, who understands the importance of relaxation when you write, gave us a number to a skillful hypnotist! CNN: There was a big furor in Sweden to find the real Lars Kepler, so why did you choose a pen name? Ahndorils: A pen name is often a way for an author to signal that he or she is writing with a new voice or in a new genre. We've been writers in our own right for several years before we started to write together, and from the beginning we thought it was a great idea to stay secret behind a pen name. Then two things happened unexpectedly: First, writing together was the most creative and enjoyable thing we'd ever experienced; and second, the media went crazy when the ""The Hypnotist"" was published in Sweden in 2009. The whole nation was suddenly searching for the person behind Lars Kepler. We tried to hide, but one dark night in August, two journalists with flashlights and cameras found us in our summer house. The next day, we packed our three daughters in our car and drove to Stockholm to meet the media and readers. CNN: How does your writing partnership work? Are there any special challenges because you are married? Ahndorils: If you told a couple who's been together for almost 20 years, and live with their three young daughters in an apartment, that they were going to share a small study for several years and write novels together, they would probably just laugh, no matter how much they love each other. We'd tried to write together several times previously, but each time, the cooperation has almost immediately turned into arguments and big fights. It was actually because of this we came up with the idea of creating a brand new writer. Lars Kepler is not Alexander, nor Alexandra. He has a life of his own. And the truth is, since we started to write as Lars Kepler, we haven't had a single fight. Many authors who work together write alternate chapters, or divide the characters in the story between them. We don't do that; we write everything together, like two people playing the piano four-handed. We discuss the plot all the time -- when we pick up our children at school, when we shop for dinner. We even wake each other up in the middle of the night to discuss turning points. If we were to page through ""The Hypnotist"" or our sequel, we wouldn't be able to find a single sentence that only one of us wrote. It's all the work of Lars. CNN: What kind of research did you do on hypnosis? Ahndorils: Alexander's big brother is a professional hypnotist and writes books about practical hypnosis. He was a perfect source. We read a lot of other works about hypnosis, and Alexander was actually hypnotized himself. It was a surprise that hypnosis was truly enjoyable, even though you hand your own choice over to the hypnotist. And we were also surprised when we understood that the hypnotist himself goes into a kind of special trance during the sessions. Almost everybody can be hypnotized, except if they don't want to be (such as Alexandra). A person who is being hypnotized is in a state of deepest relaxation and seems to be nearly asleep. But if you look at the person's brain activity, you see that the brain is totally awake, extremely active and alert. Deep hypnosis is a very powerful elevator into the subconscious. Sigmund Freud used it for a while but thought it revealed too much too fast. CNN: What do you think of the comparisons to Stieg Larsson, and what are your thoughts about the continuing Scandinavian crime fiction craze? Ahndorils: In fact, the name ""Lars"" in Lars Kepler is an homage to Larsson. We have a lot of ideals in common with him. On one hand, crime novels paint a very violent and dark world; on the other hand, they make the failures of society clear and open for discussion, though the riddles should be solved and the perpetrators stopped when you close the book. We also share the love for complex characters with Stieg Larsson. Because no matter how interesting the plot is that you create, the story will not be exciting if you don't care about the characters. One thought we had about the Scandinavian trend concerns the fear of darkness, because the source for all thrillers is that fear. But as a writer, you are almost certain that you can stop the perpetrators and guarantee happy endings. So writing is a way to disarm the fear for a moment, just like a roller coaster transforms the fear of heights into something fun during the ride. People have always been afraid of the dark, not only children. ... And the fact is that it's not that easy to find a darker place than Scandinavia during the winter. The sun doesn't even rise for three months in the northern parts. So with all this darkness, it's maybe not that strange we have this strong tradition of crime writing. CNN: What's next? Will you continue to work as a team? Ahndorils: Our second Lars Kepler novel was published in Sweden in July 2010, and we're deep into the third, which will come out November 11 in Sweden. We have the plot for the fourth book finished, plus a whole lot of exciting investigations, cold cases, mysteries and ideas that we think will be enough for at least eight books. Every new book about Detective Inspector Joona Linna is independent and will have different main characters, but Joona is the main character of the series. Most writers are really lonely. You can't share your inner world with anybody for years while you're writing a novel. But now, since Lars Kepler appeared, everything is different for us. We don't long for the usual loneliness of a writer after this shared rush of creativity.","Lars Kepler is the pen name of a married couple from Sweden .

"(CNN) -- In the scorching desert of Qatar, scientists are showing that saltwater can be used to help grow crops. A one hectare research initiative known as the Sahara Forest Project -- modest in size, but not in ambition -- has produced a harvest of barley, cucumbers and arugula in the last few months using a mix of ingredients not usually associated with successful agriculture: seawater and Qatar's ample supply of heat. Conceived in Norway, the first-ever Sahara Forest Project facility launched last November to coincide with the United Nations Climate Conference e(COP18) in Doha. It implements a range of cutting-edge environmentally-friendly technologies that takes the things that Qatar has in excess -- heat and seawater -- and converts them into a range of valuable resources. ""These are ideas that could sound too good to be true,"" admits the project CEO, Joakim Hauge, adding that in the early days the project met with an equal measure of enthusiasm and skepticism. ""Really, though, there's a very simple principle behind this. Our starting point was to take what we have enough of -- seawater, heat -- and use it to produce what we need more of -- water, energy and a sustainable production of food."" The project has a global scope. It boasts seawater-cooled greenhouses, concentrated solar power and algae production -- all working symbiotically to solve several of the world's ecological crises in one go. Read more: Crowdfunding innovation in the Middle East . ""Qatar is one of the most challenging climates in the world to work in for this kind of thing,"" says Dr. Virginia Corless, the science and development manager. ""The high temperatures and humidity make it very challenging for our technology. But if the technology works there, and it has, it proves it's feasible for many locations around the world."" In addition to producing food and desalinated water in regions that indigenously lack both, the facility is also looking into greening the desert and creating alternative, eco-friendly fuel sources. Synergy is one of the cornerstones of the project; it's what allows it to address so many issues at once, like an elaborate, environmental Rube Goldberg mechanism. The facility features a concentrated solar power plant, which turns heat into steam, then, with turbines and generators, into electricity, which in turn pumps seawater to the site, where it is used to cool the greenhouses. Freshwater waste from the greenhouses is then used to irrigate plants outside. Strategically planted hedges outside the greenhouse help filter the remainder, creating a humidified and cooler environment for plants downwind. Read more: Qatar's new cultural jewel . Lastly, the saltwater is also used to cultivate algae, which can be used for large-scale bio-energy production -- though currently the algae plant is still in the research phase. Algae production on its own, says Corless, can be expensive and dependent on geographical constraints (it usually needs to be developed along expensive, sought-after coastal property). ""What we're doing is putting an algae cultivation system into an even broader system that can share costs and increase energy. One of the biggest shared costs we have is the saltwater infrastructure,"" she says. Neil Crumpton, the chair and CEO of Planet Hydrogen, an NGO that promotes green energy, says the project is, potentially, a ""game changer"". ""The biggest issues right now are climate change and water resources globally, and these simple technologies can tackle both,"" he says. ""I can't help thinking that this is vision, not mirage."" Read more: Risks and rewards in West Bank city project . Some experts, however, question if the Sahara Forest Project is the best use of resources. The facility, which was funded by fertilizer companies Yara International and Qafco and cost $5.3 million to set up. ""With the same funding, you could restore ecosystems and help people more effectively through community-based natural resource management,"" says Patrick Gonzalez, a forest ecologist who has conducted research in the Sahel region of North Africa with the University of California, Berkeley. ""Rather than pouring water on desert sands that haven't had much vegetation in centuries, you can restore land that until recently had a healthy tree cover. Natural regeneration of trees in the Sahel is less flashy and more difficult, but you could directly benefit the families that depend on the trees,"" he adds. Despite the mixed reviews, Hague says that the site has proven itself with the new crop influx, adding that many skeptics have been won over. ""It helps when people can see it on the ground, and taste the cucumbers and see that this is real,"" he says. ""We've proven that this can be implemented.""","Sahara Forest Project in Qatar implements a range of cutting-edge green technologies that all work together .

"(CNN) -- Substance abuse is one of the most pervasive and costly problems in our country. Over 68 million American adults have some form of substance use disorder and about 25 million are addicted to one or more substances. Every year, millions of lives are lost because of it. What makes substance abuse hard to combat is the fact that addiction plays such a central role. Addiction is a nondiscriminating and devastating illness, affecting everyone from celebrities to teachers to soldiers to neighbors. Despite the prevalence of substance abuse, addiction remains widely misunderstood and misrepresented. However, major advances in scientific research have given us a much clearer picture of addiction -- what it is, what is isn't, and what causes it. Addiction is now known to be a chronic illness that affects the brain, behavior and health of people in progressive and lasting ways. More importantly, substance addiction is largely affected by genetic heritability. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The truth about prescription medication addiction . Everyone has seen firsthand the friends or loved ones who were not equally affected by the same amount of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana or pills. These obvious differences between people have been attributed to ""character,"" ""upbringing"" or ""personal strength,"" but they're actually the result of genetic heritability combined with environmental factors. Brain imaging has shown us that drugs and alcohol work powerfully on the dopamine system, the reward-driven learning center, by stimulating pleasure that cannot be matched in normal human experience. This brain jolt results in a compelling desire in a person to repeat an experience, which then leads to signs of addiction: loss of control over use or the inability to temper use once started. If a person has untreated mental illness such as depression or anxiety, this effect can be greater. Once someone has become addicted to a substance, there are significant changes in brain functioning. Even after three to six months of sobriety, the brain is susceptible to relapses. For these reasons, punishments are rarely effective by themselves in reducing addiction. Most drug-related prison sentences, for example, result in relapse within months after release. Despite incarceration, the brain chemistry changes so that cravings do not completely disappear and the right environmental cues can trigger relapse. Family members of addicts know well the mystifying single-minded focus their loved ones show when they are in the throes of a compulsive cycle. Drug-seeking behavior becomes more extreme, interfering with work, education and family responsibilities. In short, users are no longer themselves, as their decision-making process has been short-circuited. So there is no ""cure"" for addiction. But the disease can be managed and recovery is possible. The most successful treatments are modeled after treatments for other chronic, noncurable, relapsing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension or asthma. Treatments for these diseases focus on helping patients comply with medications (which reduce symptoms) and adopting new health behaviors. Behavior therapy can help addicts by identifying their triggers and equipping them with coping skills for dealing with the overwhelming urges to use substance. FDA-approved medications can break the relapse cycle by helping addicts manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. For those addicted individuals with untreated mental illness, we should persuade them to go into treatment early on, because that may be contributing to their urges to use substance. It is critical to remember that addiction is a chronic illness and recovery is a lifelong process. The likelihood of sustained recovery is significantly improved after a year of continued abstinence. The chances of achieving this milestone are greater with the support of family and friends and a ""recovery network of peers"" such as Alcoholics Anonymous or other self-help organizations. Most of the public is unaware that relapse rates for all the substance use disorders are about the same as relapse rates for other chronic illnesses such as hypertension, asthma or diabetes, or that there are approximately 20 million individuals who are in stable, long-term (a year or more) recovery. These successes are not observable in part because those individuals wish to remain anonymous while they look and act exactly like the rest of us. Addiction is not hopeless, intractable or untreatable. Millions of people are in recovery from it. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- The Humane Society of the United States said Wednesday it does not fault authorities in Ohio for using lethal force against exotic animals running loose. Police believe the animals' owner, Terry Thompson, 62, freed the animals -- lions, tigers, leopards and grizzly bears -- at his preserve near Zanesville, Ohio, before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said. Ohio authorities were called to the scene Tuesday night. As of Wednesday, 49 animals had been killed and the rest were accounted for except for one monkey, according to authorities. But Lutz and conservationist Jack Hanna, who assisted in the effort, said the animal may have been eaten by one of the big cats. A preliminary investigation showed Thompson had pried open cages and left fences open, Lutz said. Autopsy results on Thompson were pending. Authorities were trying to use tranquilizers whenever possible in capturing the animals, said Zanesville Mayor Howard Zwelling. But Lutz said some animals were shot at close range by deputies who found themselves in a dangerous situation. A Bengal tiger was put down after it became agitated following a tranquilizer shot. 49 animals killed, authorities say . While the killing of animals might prompt initial concern, ""we do not fault them for using lethal force,"" said Debbie Leahy, captive wildlife regulatory specialist for the Humane Society of the United States. ""What we're finding, in places where they have lax regulations ... rural sheriffs and local animal control officers are being forced to deal with issues ranging from rampaging chimpanzees to tigers running amok,"" Leahy said. Such officers are not trained to deal with such situations and may lack the proper equipment, she said. Zwelling said he had received calls from people concerned the animals were killed. But, Lutz said, ""we are not talking about your normal everyday house cat or dog. These are 300-pound Bengal tigers that we have had to put down. When we got here, obviously, public safety was my number-one concern. We could not have animals running loose in this county."" While tranquilizers are an option, there are issues involved in their use, Leahy said. For one thing, they take time to work on an animal, potentially giving it time to harm someone or to get away. In addition, if an animal has a high level of adrenaline, tranquilizers can make them more agitated, she said. ""People shouldn't be blaming (authorities),"" she said. ""They should be blaming the Ohio government for not taking action to prevent this incident."" CNN.com readers disgusted . The Humane Society urged Ohio officials Wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership. A previous emergency order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in April. The organization said Thompson ""would almost certainly have had his animals removed by May 1, 2011, if the emergency order had not expired."" ""Every month brings a new, bizarre, almost surreal incident involving privately held dangerous wild animals,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society, in a prepared statement. ""In recent years, Ohioans have died and suffered injuries because the state hasn't stopped private citizens from keeping dangerous wild animals as pets or as roadside attractions. Owners of large, exotic animals are a menace to society, and it's time for the delaying on the rulemaking to end."" Opinion: Wild animals belong in the wild . People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also said the lack of an exotic animal ban is to blame. ""The shooting of dozens of exotic animals in Zanesville is a tragic example of just how wrong things can go when people are allowed to keep wild animals,"" PETA said in a written statement. The organization said it hoped the incident will be a ""wake-up"" call to current Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who, according to PETA, refused to extend the emergency ban on exotic animals. ""Keeping exotic animals is inhumane and unsafe for both animals and people, and it's time that Ohio did something about it,"" PETA said. ""People have to understand something ... human life comes first,"" Jack Hanna, director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo, told CNN. He said some had asked why the animals weren't tranquilized by authorities searching for them Tuesday night, but ""you can't tranquilize an animal in the dark. It upsets them ... they settle in, they hunker down, they go to sleep. Obviously, we can't find them in the dark. So what had to be done had to be done. Even a bear came after one of the officers last night, and she was just trying to get out of a car. ... No one loves animals more than me, but human life has to come first."" When first responders do have to shoot an animal, ""we have found, in some cases, they're just as traumatized as the rest of us,"" Leahy said, and sometime require counseling. ""They don't want to have to shoot these animals."" She recalled a case a few years ago involving a Florida police officer who shot an elephant running wild with children on its back. ""He was so totally upset by that incident that he became a huge elephant advocate,"" speaking out for stronger laws on their behalf, Leahy said.","Ohio authorities have shot some loose exotic animals .

"New York (CNN) -- A heat wave continued to blanket the U.S. Northeast with scorching temperatures on the first day of summer, as residents across the region sought to keep cool amid national heat advisories. Severe heat and humidity stretched from Vermont to North Carolina on Thursday with temperatures reaching the mid- to upper 90s, the National Weather Service said. The Northeast will begin cooling slightly Friday, the service said, but the heat is expected to continue with forecasts in the low 90s and high 80s across the mid-Atlantic states. Cool down with summer treats . Cities across the Northeast designated cooling centers, turned on outdoor sprinklers and splash stations and issued advisories in an effort to help keep residents safe, emergency management officials in several cities said. ""[More than 400] cooling centers will continue to remain open Friday,"" said New York Emergency management spokeswoman Judith Kane. The city advised residents to turn on their air conditioners or to go to air-conditioned locations such as museums, malls and movie theaters to stay out of the sun. In Boston, 15 indoor public pools, outdoor wading pools and splash stations were available, said John Guilfoil, spokesman for Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, in addition to air-conditioned community centers. ""We actually weren't going to come out, because it was so hot today, but they turned on the sprinklers and we're going to have some fun,"" first-grade teacher James Bernardini said in Manhattan's Central Park. More than 700 sprinklers were available in parks across New York City, said Parks Department spokeswoman Vickie Karp. ""It's 90 degrees outside. Imagine how it is in a classroom without a fan, without an AC,"" Bernardini said. According to the National Weather Service, Baltimore and Washington reached high temperatures of 98 degrees on Thursday. Farther north, Boston, New York and Philadelphia reached, respectively, 95, 93 and 97 degrees, the service said. The service advises residents to drink plenty of water, to stay out of the sun, to take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned environments and to check on relatives and neighbors during the heat wave. Young children and the elderly are especially at risk for heat-related injuries, the service said. Last year, it reported 206 heat-related deaths. In the past decade, heat has been the second-leading cause for weather-related fatalities, the service said. Residents are advised to call 311 or to go to their city's website online to find cooling centers and to get further information on how to keep cool as the heat continues.","Severe heat and humidity stretches from Vermont to North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- I feel guilty. My iPhone has been great to me. Loyal. Hard working. Holds a charge well. Sure, we had some dropped calls, but who hasn't? But something is wrong with our relationship. And I know it's not my iPhone, it's iDean. Yes, I know this isn't the best time to bring this up, what with Apple's earnings report showing that so many others are also falling out of love with their iPhones. But I could not keep it inside any longer. I realized our problems had gotten bad when reading media reports about the new iPhone 5 expected to be released this fall. In the past, those articles truly excited me. I couldn't wait for the new iPhone. I would scour the net looking for more hints. An image. A rumor. Anything. In those days, I was crazy about the iPhone. But when I read about the iPhone 5, my reaction was not one of excitement, but pity. The iPhone is doing all it can to stay attractive. Lose weight. Increase its screen size. Work faster. It's like the phone version of Madonna. Maybe the iPhone caught me looking at the younger Samsung Galaxy. I tried not to look. But how can I be blamed for taking a glance? So, I Googled an image. And yes, I asked a friend if I could try his. But I haven't done anything wrongâ€”at least that's what I keep telling myself. CNNMoney.com: Apple badly misses forecasts . I longingly think back to how my relationship started with the iPhone. It was the summer, 2007. I thought it would be a typical summer. I'd use my phone to make some calls, text friends from it. Nothing exciting. But then I saw it. Sure, I had seen the commercials, but I didn't fully appreciate the beauty of the iPhone until I saw it in person. At that moment, I vowed that nothing would stand in my way of getting my hands on one--except the hundreds of people standing on line in front of me at the Apple Store. My first iPhone had me at ""Hello."" Actually, there were a lot of dropped calls in those days, so technically it had me at: ""Can you hear me now?"" But hey, we were young. Neither of us knew what we were doing or where it would lead. But we agreed to give it a shotâ€”a one-year shot, to be precise, per the terms of my service agreement. That amazing year flew by. Before you knew it, the iPhone 3G arrived. It looked like the original, but was faster. More powerful. It could do things the first iPhone couldn't. In defense of my first iPhone, it would have gladly done these other things if it were technologically capable. CNNMoney.com: AT&T and Verizon shine as iPhone sales sink . Then in June 2010 came the biggest moment of our relationship: The iPhone 4. Just as Steve Jobs promised: ""This changes everything. Again."" It felt like 2007 all over again. Plus it was better. The new iPhone was sleeker. Thinner. Faster. It was beautiful. Those were probably the best days of our relationship. Texting, e-mailing, surfing the Internet while speaking on the phone. Even our worst moment, the time I accidentally dropped the iPhone in the toilet bowl, didn't slow us down. Despite everyone saying my iPhone would never be the same after this incident, it was better than ever. Maybe it was foolish to think that this bliss would last forever. But I did. The first time I sensed something was wrong was in mid-2011. June 7, if I recall correctly. That's when the iPhone 4S was announced. I had hoped for an iPhone 5. A fully redesigned, greatly improved iPhone. Instead it was just a slightly faster version of the same old thing. Maybe my expectations were to blame? Maybe it was Siri's fault? But in any event, my feelings sadly began to fade that summer. Since then, I have found myself increasingly checking out the Android and Samsung Galaxy. I'm not saying I'm moving on. Even though the thrill might be gone, there's a comfort to being with something you know well. But there is no longer passion. I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I mechanically dial phone numbers or mindlessly type texts. I don't even scream at Siri anymore when she says: ""Sorry, Dean, I don't understand what you're asking."" I know it's just a matter of time before it ends. But I want to make it clear that I'm not going to break my commitment. That's my word -- plus there's a $350 early termination penalty. However, when I'm eligible for a new phone in six months, I can't promise I'll stay with my iPhone. But if I do buy a new phone, I'll probably change my service carrier to help me forget. Not that I'll ever be able to. Regardless of how this turns out, iDean will always be grateful to my iPhone for being the first to show me what a real phone could do.

"(TIME.com) -- Job burnout can strike workers in nearly any field, but a new study finds that doctors are at special risk. Nearly 1 in 2 U.S. physicians report at least one symptom of burnout, with doctors at the front line of care particularly vulnerable, the study found -- a significantly higher rate than among the general working population. Overtaxed doctors are not only at risk for personal problems, like relationship issues and alcohol misuse, but their job-related fatigue can also erode professionalism, compromise quality of care, increase medical errors and encourage early retirement -- a potentially critical problem as an aging population demands more medical care. The new findings, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, are based on a survey of 7,288 physicians conducted in June 2011. Led by researchers from the Mayo Clinic and the American Medical Association, the study asked participating physicians to fill out a questionnaire asking about their feelings of burnout -- including ""emotional exhaustion"" or losing enthusiasm for their work; feelings of cynicism or ""depersonalization""; and a low sense of personal accomplishment. Seriously? Doctors say they're underpaid . The 22-item questionnaire, called the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), is considered the gold standard for measuring burnout; the doctors also completed a shorter, modified version of the MBI, the answers to which researchers used to compare with the general population. Researchers also asked doctors how long they worked each week, how satisfied they were with their work-life balance, and whether they had any symptoms of depression or thoughts of suicide. TIME's mobile tech issue: Better care delivered by iPad, M.D. The data showed that rates of burnout were high: 45.8% of doctors experienced at least one symptom of work-related burnout. When each symptom was considered separately, 37.9% of the physicians had high emotional exhaustion, 29.4% had high depersonalization and 12.4% had a low sense of personal accomplishment. U.S. doctors are burning out ""at an alarming level,"" the authors write. ""Our finding is concerning given the extensive literature linking burnout to medical errors and lower quality of care,"" says study author Dr. Tait Shanafelt of the Mayo Clinic. ""Most previous studies of physicians from individual specialties have suggested a burnout rate of 30% to 40%. Thus, the prevalence of burnout among physicians appears to be higher than in the past."" The study found that practitioners of front-line care -- including physicians in emergency medicine, general internal medicine and family medicine -- fared worst. ""Nearly 60% of physicians in those specialties had high levels of burnout,"" says Shanafelt. ""This is concerning since many elements critical to the success of health care reform are built upon increasing the role of the primary care providers."" Doctors practicing pathology, dermatology, general pediatrics and preventive medicine (including occupational health and environmental medicine) had the lowest rates of burnout. TIME's mobile tech issue: Tracking disease one text at a time . The researchers also compared physicians' job-related fatigue with that of 3,442 working American adults in the general population, and found that physicians were significantly more burned out overall. Among other working adults, only 27.8% were likely to experience burnout, 23.5% had high emotional exhaustion and 15% had high depersonalization. The authors found also that physicians worked about 10 hours more per week than other people on average (50 hours a week versus 40), and were much more likely to work extra long weeks of 60 hours or more: 37.9% of doctors worked at least 60-hour weeks, compared with only 10.6% of the general population. More than 40% of doctors reported dissatisfaction with their work-life balance, saying their jobs didn't leave enough time for a personal life or family, compared with 23.1% of non-doctors. Why doctors fall asleep while treating you . In addition, while higher levels of education were associated with less risk of burnout for people in other professions, doctors' advanced degrees didn't afford them the same protection from job-related stress. ""While individuals in other professions do experience burnout, it seems to be largely driven by the hours,"" says Shanafelt. ""In addition to their high work hours, there appears to be factors related to the nature of the work that increase the risk for physicians."" TIME.com: Should Medicaid be expanded? Study finds it may lower death rates . ""Unfortunately, little evidence exists about how to address this problem,"" the authors write, urging additional research to figure out what can be done to support doctors at the individual, organizational and societal level. ""Policy makers and health care organizations must address the problem of physician burnout for the sake of physicians and their patients."" This article was originally published on TIME.com.

"(CNN) -- An asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier passed within the moon's orbit Tuesday, the closest approach by an object that large in more than 30 years. Asteroid 2005 YU55 passed within 202,000 miles of Earth -- about four-fifths of the distance to the moon -- at 6:28 p.m. Tuesday, NASA said. Marina Brozovic, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said the space agency was able to train a great deal of high-powered instruments -- including the massive radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico -- on the asteroid as it approached. ""This is a rare event, and we learned a lot,"" Brozovic told CNN. Follow space and science news on Light Years . Though the space agency classified the asteroid as a ""potentially hazardous object,"" it posed no threat of a collision, according to NASA's Near Earth Object Program. If the asteroid had crashed into Earth, it could have caused a 4,000-megaton blast and a magnitude 7.0 earthquake, according to scientists at Purdue University. If it fell into the ocean, it could have caused a 70-foot-high tsunami within 60 miles of the crash site, the experts said. The last time a space rock in the same league as 2005 YU55 passed as close to Earth was in 1976, NASA said. The next similar encounter is projected for 2028, Brozovic said. Podcast: Asteroid close encounter . As the object neared Earth, NASA studied the asteroid with the Goldstone radar antennas in California's Mojave Desert. Goldstone antennas are very sensitive radio telescopes used to investigate quasars, radar mapping of planets and comets. Scientists plan to reconstruct the shape of the asteroid with a resolution as fine as 13 feet (4 meters) using the antennas. Share your view of the asteroid . The approach also provides a rare opportunity for amateur astronomers to directly observe an asteroid with optical telescopes. But because the object is so dark, NASA said stargazers would need a telescope with an aperture of 6 inches (15cm) or larger to see it. ""It's visible across North America in the ensuing hours, dim at 11th or 12th magnitude and moving fast,"" Sky & Telescope magazine said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Martin Ginsburg, husband of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has died of cancer at age 78. A statement from the Supreme Court said Ginsburg died Sunday at his Washington home, due to complications from metastatic cancer. The court said a private ceremony will be held at Arlington National Cemetery, but no date was given. Ginsburg, known as Marty to his friends and family, was the outgoing, jovial opposite of his soft-spoken, diminutive wife, but the couple maintained a strong, happy marriage over 56 years. Their wedding anniversary was four days ago. The Supreme Court will wrap up its work for the term Monday, and recess for the summer. Justice Ginsburg was on the bench as recently as Thursday as rulings were announced. Until his recent illness, Ginsburg worked as a lawyer at the Washington law firm Fried Frank, and as a professor at Georgetown Law Center. He was constant presence at his wife's side at many social and court-related events. Ginsburg was known inside the court for cooking meals for the justices, their families, and for his wife's law clerks, a skill he picked up when discovering his wife possessed few culinary talents. That became a running joke in the family, and one which the justice regaled audiences with over the years, somewhat sheepishly. ""Professor Ginsburg is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the Supreme Court,"" said the justice in March 2009. ""Mainly he performs in the kitchen, for the quarterly spouses' lunches held at the Court and, occasionally in past years, at a dinner for the entire Court family -- justices, their spouses, and widows of former Court members. In the beginning, when I was the newest justice, my dear husband offered aid in lightening my load."" Ruth Ginsburg, who joined the Supreme Court in 1993, long credited her husband's open-mindedness for the success she has enjoyed in her legal, academic, and judicial career, especially at a time decades ago when women were encouraged to stay home and devote their energies to supporting their spouses. Martin David Ginsburg was born in 1932 and grew up in Long Island, New York. He met his future wife on a blind date at Cornell University, and they married in 1954. After he served a stint in the military, the couple both attended Harvard Law School. During his third year, Ginsburg developed a rare form of testicular cancer and underwent two surgeries. He credited his recovery in part to wife's ability to juggle caring for him, their young daughter, and their dual legal studies. He later worked as a lawyer in New York and a professor at Columbia University's law school, where Ruth Ginsburg had transferred and graduated. Unlike her husband, the future justice was unable to find a job at her alma mater or any decent offers at a law firm, so she began teaching at Rutgers University, and developed a national reputation taking on gender discrimination cases. He was known for quietly helping build and organize political support for his wife's appointments to those top government jobs. The justice has called her husband her ""best friend and biggest booster."" ""A supportive husband who is willing to share duties and responsibilities is a must for any woman who hopes to combine marriage and a career,"" she recently told a forum on professional opportunities for female lawyers. "" Through his friendship with billionaire businessman and onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot, a special position -- or ""chair"" in academic circles -- was created at Georgetown for the study of tax law, and named in Martin Ginsburg's honor. It was less than successful, however, as the professor himself explained in his professional resume. ""In 1986, someone who probably prefers never to be identified endowed a Chair in Taxation in his name at Georgetown,"" wrote Ginsburg. ""No one appears willing to occupy the Ginsburg Chair, and it remains vacant,"" a fact he always laughed about. The Ginsburgs had two children, Jane -- a professor at Columbia -- James, an independent record producer in Chicago, and four grandchildren.","Martin Ginsburg was Washington lawyer, law professor .

"(CNN) -- More than a week after the Egyptian military ousted the Islamist-led presidency of Mohamed Morsy, the Muslim Brothers, from which Morsy hails, continue to mobilize their followers on the streets and demand the reinstatement of Morsy. Far from backing down, the Islamist organization has pledged to resist what it has called a ""fascist coup,"" and has rejected any dialogue with the transitional government that does not restore the popularly elected Morsy. Opinion: Egypt's secularists repeating Islamists' mistakes . For the military, the Brotherhood's demand is a non-starter, and both camps and their supporters face a deadlock that can now only be broken through either a political compromise or an all-out confrontation. There is a real danger of further polarization and escalation in Egypt, where the writing is already on the wall with the arrest of Morsy and the demonization of the Brotherhood by the Egyptian media and elements of the secular-leaning opposition. Analysis: Will Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood survive? The interim authorities are clamping down on the Brothers, accusing senior leaders of inciting violence while arresting eight of its top figures, including the group's most influential leader, Khairat al-Shater, and the former speaker of parliament. Prosecutors have also issued another arrest warrant for the Brotherhood's supreme guide, Mohammed Badie, and four others. Human rights organizations have criticized the government's clampdown on the Brotherhood's television channel and others channels sympathetic to the group, as well as the deaths of dozens of protesters in recent weeks. CNN Explains: What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brothers cannot politically afford to climb down because that would be an acknowledgment of their defeat and probably cause cleavages within their social base. So instead they will continue to peacefully resist and flex their muscle and exert pressure on the country's interim rulers. The goal is to force the military-led authority to come to terms with the Muslim Brothers and stop persecuting them. ""The goal of our peaceful mass rallies and peaceful sit-ins in squares across Egypt is to force the coup plotters to reverse their action,"" Essam el-Erian, acting head of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, said on his Facebook page. If history is our guide, in the short and midterm, Islamist leaders will prioritize unity and solidarity of the organization. The Muslim Brothers have already begun to mobilize tens thousands of followers, a task made easier by a strongly-held belief that the Islamists are defending constitutional legitimacy against military putschists. Opinion: Overthrow of Muslim Brotherhood leader 'has international reverberations' As one of the most powerfully organized social and political movements in Egypt and the region, the Brotherhood can rely on its power base, which represents between 20 to 30 percent of the electorate, to remain a force to be reckoned with either at the ballot box or in the streets. In the eyes of the Brotherhood leadership, conceding defeat would harm the base and fracture it. The advantages of resistance outweigh any potential disadvantages; the 85-year old Islamist organization is better equipped to endure repression by the post-Mubarak military than internal dissention and fragmentation. It is worth remembering that mainstream Islamists of the Brotherhood variety have survived decades of persecution, incarceration, and exile by military-led authoritarian regimes -- and they will most likely weather the latest coup that has swept away Morsy. Despite concerted efforts in the last six decades by secular strongmen like the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to weaken and isolate their religious rivals, the Islamists' close-knit networks and ""asabiya"" (group loyalty) have allowed them to withstand the brutal onslaught of secular authorities and grow their organization. Opinion: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy . In my interviews with the Islamist rank-and-file over the past 20 years in Egypt and elsewhere, it has become clear to me that religious activists are nourished on a belief in the movement's divine victory and they are willing to endure sacrifice, hardship, and loss to bring about that desired end. But the decades of persecution that drove the Islamists underground left deep scars on their psychology and imagination -- and as a result, they often view wider society as intrinsically hostile to their cause. The Egyptian military's ouster of Morsy will reinforce this siege mentality and the sense of victimhood and injustice among the Muslim Brothers and their followers. The likelihood of the Brotherhood taking up arms against the military like their Algerian counterparts in the early 1990s is minimal. The most influential Islamist group in the Arab world renounced the use of force and violence in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of the lessons learned by the Brothers from their experience underground from the 1940s until the late 1960s is that violence is counterproductive and endangers the very survival of the movement. In particular, the old guard, including Badie, who have a vivid institutional memory of the underground years, won't fall into the trap of militarily confronting the state; they would not risk it all. The real potential danger is that individual members could join extremist groups in the Sinai desert and elsewhere to exact vengeance against Egypt's security forces. If the political deadlock continues, the Brotherhood might not be able or willing to control some of its followers, a recipe for creeping armed clashes with the security apparatus. The longer the Muslim Brothers continue their protests and resistance, the more likely the military is to intensify its crackdown against them. At this stage, it is unconceivable that the military would reinstate Morsy as his supporters demand -- far from it, in fact. In his first address, as an interim president last week, Adly Mansour, previously head of the constitutional court, warned against stoking unrest and promised to fight those he said wanted to destabilize the state. His warning is designed to convey a message to the Brotherhood by the military. ""We are going through a critical stage and some want us to move towards chaos, and we want to move towards stability. Some want a bloody path,"" Mansour said in a televised address. ""We will fight a battle for security until the end."" The interim governing body is rapidly shaping up with a newly-formed cabinet and a roadmap for drafting a constitution and then holding presidential and parliamentary elections. The interim authority has obtained de facto legitimation and recognition at home and abroad. The Islamists are pitted against an influential alliance composed of a substantive segment of Egyptians, together with the military, the police and entrenched elements of the old regime. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Egypt's new foreign minister, Nabil Fahmy, and expressed hopes that the transitional period of government would be successful, according to the Egyptian foreign ministry. Neither the Obama administration nor the European Union has taken the military to task for toppling Morsy. The Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, have already pledged $12 billion in financial and material aid, a substantial package that gives the transitional authority breathing space to get its economic house in order. There is a race against time between escalation and a political dialogue, and neither the military nor Morsy's supporters are disposed to compromise. While the military is emboldened and in charge, the Muslim Brothers have their backs against the wall. Regardless of the outcome, this titanic and seemingly intractable struggle undermines Egypt's fragile democratic experiment because there is a real danger that once again the Islamists will be suppressed and excluded from the country's political space. This does not bode well for Egypt's democratic transition because there will be no institutionalization of democracy without the Brotherhood, the biggest and oldest mainstream religiously based Islamist movement in the Middle East. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fawaz A. Gerges.","Gerges says there is a real danger of further polarization and escalation in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- They chased tornadoes not so much for the thrill, but in the hope that their research might help people avoid the fate to which they succumbed last week. Veteran storm chaser Tim Samaras, 54; his chase partner of a decade, Carl Young, 45; and Samaras' son, Paul Samaras, 24, a photographer, died Friday in an EF-3 tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma. Crews hauled away their white truck Sunday. It had been crushed like a tin can, its metal frame violently twisted and its windows smashed. Tim Samaras' brother, Jim Samaras, said he was stunned to learn of his brother's death, simply because Tim Samaras was so well-versed in the ways of tornadoes. Storm chasing: Science, thrill-seeking or tourism? ""I just couldn't ever think it would ever happen to him because of his level of expertise, years of doing this,"" the brother said. ""If I had to have a way for my brother to die, it would be doing what he did -- chasing tornadoes."" Tim Samaras, whose team's work was featured on the Discovery Channel's ""Storm Chasers,"" had been on twisters' trails for more than a quarter-century, and The Weather Channel described him as a self-taught forecaster and engineer who developed much of the equipment he used to measure storms. ""He was a pioneer in terms of making surface measurements inside of tornadoes. He was always at the forefront of tornado measurements,"" said the channel's severe weather expert, Greg Forbes, who further described the elder Samaras as an ""amazing scientist."" Tim Samaras told The Weather Channel years ago that he caught the engineering bug as a kid dismantling his mother's appliances -- ""blenders, toasters, television sets, you name it"" -- and reassembling them. Yet he was no one-trick pony. He had a penchant for studying high-speed camera imaging, lightning and explosions. Per the latter, he participated in the investigations of the crash of TWA Flight 800 and of the Oklahoma City bombing. Per the former, his son in December posted a photo of a tornado on the horizon, an unpaved rural road buttressed by farmland in the foreground. ""As much as he denies it, my dad does have an artistic side,"" Paul Samaras wrote on Facebook, garnering 115 likes. Tim Samaras also co-authored the book ""Tornado Hunter,"" held a patent for a thermal imaging system for internal combustion engines and had a patent pending for a ""new, 3-dimensional windspeed measurement,"" according to a copy of his resume posted at TWISTEX, a company he founded to learn more about tornadoes with the goal of increasing public warning times. Carl Young had been heading out with Tim Samaras since 2003, according to his Discovery Channel biography. A native Californian who had worked on Hollywood film crews up until 2000, he began chasing storms as part of a two-month adventure to catch glimpses of the storms along the Great Plains. ""Experiencing the raw force of nature in Nebraska was unlike any pyrotechnic display on a high-tech Hollywood set!"" the bio says. ""This inspiration led Carl to the study of tornado dynamics and ultimately a masters degree in atmospheric science from the University of Nevada, Reno."" At a meteorological conference, Tim Samaras encouraged Young to gather data from inside tornadoes for his thesis, and a partnership was born. The pair would go on to track more than 125 tornadoes. ""Carl's finest moment came on June 11, 2004, near Storm Lake, Iowa. Working with Tim, they defied the odds and deployed their probes right in the path of a tornado,"" according to the Discovery Channel. ""The six-camera video probe captured amazing footage from multiple angles while the sensor probe recorded data that revealed just how fast wind speeds are close to the ground."" Tornadoes rip through heartland again: How to help . Paul Samaras had recently started joining his dad on chases. In a National Geographic interview last month, ahead of a trip father and son would take together, Tim Samaras said Paul was becoming ""quite a talented videographer"" and joked about how well his team members got to know each other during their days-long pursuits. ""You spend three or four days in a vehicle, it develops a certain scent. After a three- to four-day trip, we've got a lot of knowledge of each other and what's going on in our lives,"" he said. ""Fortunately, our group gets along really well. That's the secret -- you need people who are compatible. And of course, showering regularly is a good thing, too."" Paul Samaras ""loved being out with his Dad,"" his sisters and mother said in a statement. ""He had a true gift for photography and a love of storms like his Dad. They made a special team."" Fellow storm chaser Tony Laubach said on Facebook that he and his colleagues were often impressed with Paul Samaras' work from behind the camera. He and another storm chaser, Ed Grubb, ""would always laugh cause we'd take great shots then see Paul's, and just shake our heads cause he just had the talent."" ""Paul was goofy, and it was fun to watch him grow over the years. He was so quiet in the early times, and watch him become someone who could capture a moment so vividly. He shot one of the most amazing tornado photos I have ever seen hanging out the window of my mesonet car in Oklahoma back in 2011,"" Laubach wrote on his Facebook page, referring to the meteorological monitoring network known as a mesonet. ""He was quirky, fun, and just so easy going. He always (rode) along with Ed and I during our missions, and you could count on him to make them all memorable."" The Samarases and Young fell victim to particularly unpredictable storm, even for a tornado. Not only does a preliminary National Weather Service rating peg its winds at more than 136 mph, many reports indicate it took a sudden left-hand turn along its path, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. Photos from a professional storm chaser . ""It was a wobbler. And it was big,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""I think the left-hand turn made a big difference on how this thing was chased as well and why people were killed and why people were injured in their vehicles."" Mike Bettes, an anchor and meteorologist for The Weather Channel, felt the storm's ferocity when it picked up his crew's truck and tossed it 200 yards into a field. Bettes said the incident, the most frightening moment of his life, unfolded in slow motion, ""especially when we were floating ... I kind of felt like I was being lifted to heaven or something."" ""I think this was just an erratic tornado. I think the size of it and the speed of it changed very, very quickly,"" he told CNN on Sunday. ""I think the direction of movement changed quickly. And I think there were a lot of people out there that, you know, ended up getting stuck in positions we didn't want to be in."" Bettes and his crew fared far better than Tim Samaras' team. One member had a broken backbone, rib and breastbone, while the rest suffered scratches and bruises. In its April 2004 edition, National Geographic chronicled how Samaras and his team drove directly into a tornado's path at a moment's notice. They used a van carrying six probes called turtles, which are 45-pound metal disks resembling flying saucers. Opinion: Why we chase storms . ""Through embedded sensors, the probes can measure a tornado's wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature,"" the magazine wrote. ""Samaras's mission, and his passion, is to plant them in the path of the funnel. His hope is that both he and the instruments survive."" The website for TWISTEX, which stands for Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in Tornadoes Experiment, says Tim Samaras in June 2003 secured a pressure drop measurement in a violent South Dakota tornado that has never been matched. Samaras had received 18 grants from the National Geographic Society for his research, said Terry Garcia, the organization's executive vice president of missions. In a written statement, he described Samaras' studies of lightning as ""pioneering."" ""Tim was a courageous and brilliant scientist who fearlessly pursued tornadoes and lightning in the field in an effort to better understand these phenomena,"" he said.

Tim, he would never put himself in danger,"" Myers said. ""He certainly wouldn't put his son in danger."" Myers also emphasized that Tim Samaras was in an upper echelon among his forecasting and storm-chasing brethren. ""We all know that this is difficult and dangerous and sometimes things go wrong. But I think to portray Tim as just a chaser out for a thrill is just the wrong thing,"" Myers said. ""I just want people to know that Tim was a scientist. He was out there to put probes out there. He was out there to learn and understand and to make science more understandable. ... We all go out there and we try to protect the public, but Tim was even one step higher."" Doug Kiesling, a videographer who chases storms and calls himself The Weather Paparazzi, said the three men were more than storm chasers. ""They're researchers,"" he said. ""This thing is really shaking up everyone in the chasing community,"" he said. ""We knew this day would happen someday, but nobody would imagine that it would happen to Tim.

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, from his comments to police to the arguments of his lawyers, has steadfastly maintained he shouldn't be found guilty of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, contending he shot the teen in self-defense. But jurors weighing his fate won't hear that from him directly. On Wednesday afternoon, Judge Debra Nelson asked Zimmerman if he'd made a decision about taking the stand in his own defense. ""After consulting with counsel,"" Zimmerman replied, he'd decided ""not to testify, your honor."" Moments later -- and after Nelson refused a request from Zimmerman's team to dismiss the case before the jury could weigh in -- the defense rested its case. That closed another chapter in a case that has transfixed much of the nation on issues such as race and gun violence and set the stage for closing arguments starting Thursday and a jury decision as soon as Friday. What exactly the jury will be deciding, though, is still in question. Zimmerman, 29, is accused of second-degree murder in the February 26, 2012, death of Martin, a 17-year-old from Miami who was staying with his father in Zimmerman's Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. He was shot dead after an altercation with Zimmerman that occurred as he was walking back from a nearby convenience store. Prosecutors asked the court Wednesday to let jurors consider two charges other than murder in relation to Martin's death: manslaughter and aggravated assault. Zimmerman's lawyers objected, saying it should be murder or nothing. Nelson, with Florida's 18th Judicial Circuit responsible for overseeing cases out of Seminole County, is expected to decide that matter Thursday. Another point that will be addressed is whether Florida's controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" law -- which gives a person facing a ""presumption of fear of death or great bodily harm"" extra protections should they respond with force instead of retreat -- can be applied by the jury. Zimmerman has never denied shooting Martin. But he's contended that he had to do so to save his own life, portraying himself as the victim and Martin as the aggressor. But the late teen's backers insisted the shooting could not be justified, with activists leading widely attended rallies and taking other steps urging authorities to press charges. Faulting Zimmerman for ignoring a 911 dispatcher's direction not to follow the teen, they believe Zimmerman profiled Martin because he was black. Zimmerman trial: It's about race . Many of those arguments, on both sides, will likely play out during closing arguments. Those start Thursday afternoon, when Bernie de la Rionda makes the prosecution's case for up to two hours. Defense lawyer Mark O'Mara will make his case, for up to three hours, on Friday morning, followed by a rebuttal of up to one hour from prosecutor John Guy. Then, later Friday, the case will be in the hands of the all-female jury. Lawyer wrestles with foam dummy . The prosecution had once stated its intention to call up to three witnesses in the rebuttal phase of the trial. But for various reasons -- because the judge ruled they couldn't pursue one line of questioning, amid uncertainty if one witness was unavailable and in the other case unexplained -- they did not. That means the last witness the jury will have heard from is Robert Zimmerman, George's father. He testified -- like his wife, Gladys, had earlier in the trial -- that he believes it was his son who was screaming on the infamous 911 recording of the altercation that ended in Martin's death. Contrast their testimony to that of Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, who said she was ""absolutely"" certain that the panicked voice was that of her son Trayvon. The late teenager's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, made a similar declaration in court. Defense attorneys argue Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense after the Miami teenager charged him. Prosecutors argue Zimmerman followed Martin through his neighborhood and shot him without provocation. Besides Robert Zimmerman, others took the stand Wednesday as well in the defense team's fourth day presenting their case. They included a ""use-of-force"" expert and Olivia Bertalan, who spoke of being appreciative of her neighbor Zimmerman's support after being the target of a home invasion. Still, the day's star may have been a foam dummy. O'Mara grappled with the life-size model inside the courtroom, working to show rapt jurors the competing versions of what happened the rainy night Martin was killed. Assistant State Attorney John Guy brought out the dummy in an effort to demonstrate that it would have been difficult for Zimmerman to retrieve his handgun from his pocket with Martin straddling him, as defense attorneys have argued was the case. The fatal gunshot, Guy reminded defense witness Dennis Root, was fired at a 90-degree angle into Martin's body. 'Raise your voice, not your hands,' cops urge as Zimmerman verdict looms . ""Wouldn't that be consistent with Travyon Martin getting off of George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman raising the gun and firing it?"" Guy asked Root, a use-of-force expert. ""It could be consistent with any kind of movement ... We weren't there so the info that we have is George Zimmerman's statement,"" he said. Later, defense attorney Mark O'Mara straddled the dummy himself, pounding the back of its head against the carpeted courtroom floor, demonstrating how he says Martin gave Zimmerman the head wounds seen in police photographs from the night of the shooting. He later asked Root -- a former police officer with extensive training in firearms and self-defense -- if it would have been possible for Zimmerman to reach around Martin's body to get at a gun located near his hip. ""Yes, sir,"" Root replied, minutes before Nelson called a lunch break. Earlier, Root testified the apparent fight between Zimmerman and Martin went on for a relatively long time -- some 40 seconds -- and was clearly marked by a high level of fear and anxiety. ""I have personally sat there and timed it myself, where it is about 40 seconds of time. That's a very long time to be involved in any type of physical altercation,"" Root said. ""We have a golden rule,"" he told defense attorney Mark O'Mara. ""If you have not successfully completed the fight, if you have not won the fight in 30 seconds, change tactics, because the tactics you are using are not working."" In trial, it's a jury of millions . HLN's Grace Wong, Graham Winch, Jonathan Anker and Anna Lanfreschi and CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","The defense rests their case after George Zimmerman declines to testify .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of 19 Arizona firefighters killed in a wildfire went home Sunday in a somber procession of more than 100 miles across the state. White hearses flying American flags carried the Prescott Fire Department's Granite Mountain Hotshots from the State Capitol in Phoenix to their hometown of Prescott, passing through the community where they died battling the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30. People from across the state and around the country gathered along the route of the public procession, withstanding triple-digit temperatures to pay respects to the elite wildfire-fighting crew. 19 profiles in heroism . ""These men are heroes. They've earned the respect of everyone in this line,"" an onlooker told CNN affiliate KTVK as he awaited the procession in Phoenix. Just one member of the elite 20-man wildfire-fighting crew survived the Yarnell Hill Fire, which started June 28 and spread to more than 6,000 acres in two days. The incident, part of a fire that destroyed more than 100 homes, was the deadliest day for firefighters since the 9/11 attacks. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . As of Sunday, at least 90% of the fire had been contained, officials said. Residents who were forced to evacuate Yarnell and Peeples Valley will be permitted to return to their homes at 9 a.m. Monday morning, a spokesman for the Yavapai County Emergency Management office said. Hotshot crews are called to get close to the blaze, dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it. Erratic winds were blamed on the sudden shift in the fire's direction that trapped the group. The deaths are under investigation, but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under blankets meant to protect against flames and heat as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them. The procession of hearses and police motorcycles passed through Yarnell on its way to Prescott, where they will be honored in a memorial service Tuesday that Vice President Joe Biden is expected to attend. The firefighters left behind wives and children. One firefighter left behind his pregnant fiance. ""I feel for the people they left behind,"" an observer of the procession in Phoenix told KTVK.

"(CNN) -- Cruising a luxurious superyacht with your own custom-built limousine onboard, ready for offshore jaunts, sounds like an experience fit only for royalty. Likewise, lounging in your very own salon designed by one of the biggest fashion houses in the world could perhaps come with a lifestyle limited to supermodels. But it need not be just for kings and queens or even leading fashionistas. The Sovereign superyacht can be anyone's, that is, if they have around $132m to spare. Sovereign is the brainchild of Gray Design who insist the finer details of the superyacht would please monarchs around the world. Gray Design specializes in high-end, luxury yachts that often incorporate designer cars. Sovereign is no exception with its sleek lines inspired by a limousine. ""We thought about a typical person on board one of these yachts and asked: how do they travel on land? Well limousine,"" says Gray Design CEO Eduard Gray. ""It's a very unique concept in the yacht world."" The matching custom-built car is an added extra, but regardless if the new owner requests one or not, there will be space on the yacht for a garage to store their wheels whilst they are at sea. If the owner's car are left at home, the garage becomes an ideal area to store all the boat's toys such as jet skis. Designers say production will start in the coming months. ""The plans are so advanced that ship builders can bring production by the end of the year,"" says Gray. ""It's not conceptual anymore; it's gone into the engineering stage."" The design team is now in talks with potential owners about special modifications to suit their tastes, including working with fashion house Armani to fit out the interiors. Discussions are also underway to install a patch of grass out the back as a makeshift golfing green that can also be used for a play area for the potential owner's dog. At the back end of the yacht, is a circular infinity pool that surrounds a reinforced glass helipad. The latter also acts as a skylight for the room below. There's space for ten guest suites, in addition to the owner's quarters, as well as a cinema, gym, nightclub and library. But the Sovereign is not simply designed for luxury, she can reach speeds of up to 30 knots. ""It's the most high performance 100 meter yacht ever,"" says Gray.","Sovereign comes with its own custom-built limousine for offshore trips .

"(CNN) -- Once a racist, always a racist? Will bigots always be bigots? Or can people truly evolve over time for the better? And if they do, should we applaud their metamorphosis and welcome them back? The easy answer -- as we are seeing with Paula Deen -- is to quickly label the person a racist for past insensitive remarks and cast her out to the fringes of society. But that's not the best answer for our nation. I say this as a person who has been called racist slurs on numerous occasions. I'm of Arab heritage. I have an inbox full of e-mails from people calling me things like ""sand n----"" or telling me ""Go back to where you are from."" (Which, I should note, is New Jersey). I'm also a Muslim, and I don't even want to describe here the litany of hate-filled insults that have been directed at our community and myself. The worst part is that these slurs don't come just from ignorant bigots who can easily be dismissed, but often by elected officials and even religious leaders. But I will say this -- if a person who had called me a ""sand n----"" later expressed remorse and sincerely explained that they now understand it was hateful and wrong, I wouldn't respond with: ""Too bad, you're a bigot for life."" Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't invite them over for dinner, either. However, I would cautiously applaud their change of heart and hope to see it evidenced by not just an apology, but by deeds as well. Carter: Deen should be forgiven . And I would do this not just because they did the right thing by me, but also because they did the right thing by our society. They were evolving for the better and this in turn makes us a better nation. Our country's history is filled with examples of people's views changing over time for the better -- the most recent example being on the issue of marriage equality. Polls now show support for same-sex marriage is at between 51 and 58%. But just 10 years ago, only slightly over 30% of Americans supported it. If 10 years ago supporters of marriage equality dismissed all those who opposed gay marriage -- or who had even had used derogatory terms about gays -- as bigots incapable of evolving, we never would have seen the new acceptance of marriage equality by mainstream America. We also witnessed America evolve for the better regarding interracial marriage. In 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws that barred interracial marriage in the famous case of Loving v. Virginia, 73% of Americans actually supported such laws. That wasn't a Red State-Blue State divide. The mainstream American view at that time was that blacks and whites should legally be prohibited from marrying each other. When did a majority of Americans finally begin to accept interracial marriage? The late 1990s -- almost 30 years after the Supreme Court's landmark decision. In tearful interview, Deen slams 'horrible lies' Paula Deen recently admission that she used the hateful ""N word"" to describe a black man back inthe 1980's. But could Paula Deen -- as she has claimed -- have evolved over the past 30 years for the better? It's possible. Former President Jimmy Carter believes so, noting that Deen's programs in Savannah, Georgia, benefit ""almost exclusively oppressed and poverty-stricken black people."" And as of the writing of this article, no one else has publicly come forward to say that Deen has used racially insensitive words in recent years. If she is still using racist and bigoted words, I would expect to see at least one other person substantiating such a claim. On the other hand, Deen's assertion on the ""Today"" show earlier this week that she only used the ""N word"" one time in her life is so ridiculous that I believe it made her situation even worse -- especially since at her recent deposition she appeared to admit having using it more times in the past. Can Paula Deen change? Of course she can, just as others have changed their views on issues of race and marriage equality. Clearly it will take more than a few tears on a morning show and a disjointed apology to prove that to us. But in time, if she and others like her do evolve, we should applaud and embrace them. As the Rev. Jesse Jackson stated this week about Deen: ""She should be reclaimed rather than destroyed."" Certainly if someone is spouting racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic or Islamaphobic comments today, they deserve the punishment they receive -- be it losing their job of being cast from mainstream society to the fringes to wallow with the hate mongers. Deen and Southern food: Critics say credit is past due . But let's not close the door on their redemption. If we do, our nation will be frozen in its progress forward on societal and racial issues. And that would truly be unforgivable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Can someone who is a bigot evolve? And does society then forgive them?
He says people call Paula Deen a racist and cast her out; that's not good for society, though .
He says history is full of viewpoints evolving for the better, such as on gay marriage .
He says some of Deen's apology implausible, but public should be open to redemption ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Longtime observers of the Middle East are baffled by allegations that high-ranking officials in the Iranian government approved a plan to assassinate Saudi Arabia Ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, and blow up the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Washington. Commentators have described the plan as ""brazen,"" but ""bizarre"" and 'bone-headed"" might be more appropriate adjectives. It's difficult to comprehend either the motives or the means selected to carry out the plan outlined by the Justice Department in its criminal indictment of Manssor Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri. Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are not new, but Iran has been both cautious and clever enough to restrain its ambitions for regional dominance. If the allegations of the assassination and bombing plot are true, and the covert operation had proved successful, Iran's leaders would have invited retaliation on a scale far more vigorous than any they might have contemplated. Indeed, I think it's fair to say that the Iranian landscape would likely have been substantially altered. Assuming, however, that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad never authorized the action or were ever aware of it, both have great cause for concern. Elements in their covert, black bag, assassination/ terrorist unit were planning an attack that could have brought about the decapitation of their leadership, the obliteration of their ambitions to enter the nuclear weapons club and quite possibly have precipitated a global depression by engulfing the region in war. Rather than dismissing the plot as a Zionist fabrication, these leaders should be looking inward and holding accountable those who were responsible for undertaking such a dangerous and destructive mission. While awaiting greater clarification from those responsible for moving forward with the prosecution against Arbabsiar and Shakuri, the United States should explore several options: . 1. Bring the assassination and bombing plan to the United Nations Security Council and seek much tougher sanctions against Iran; . 2. Encourage Saudi Arabia to review and revise its contractual arrangements with any country that refuses to support the imposition of tougher sanctions against Iran; . 3. Intensify the effort to expose the activities of those nations who are circumventing the existing sanctions against Iran; . 4. Make it clear to all members of the U.N. that Iran's nuclear weapons program poses a serious threat to global stability. If a non-nuclear Iran initiated an assassination plan through a Mexican drug cartel, what would it be tempted to do once it possesses a nuclear weapon? 5. Strengthen our ability to keep the Persian Gulf open should hostilities ever break out; . 6. Force the administration and Congress to move forward on improving the defense posture of our friends and allies who are threatened by Iran; . 7. Urge Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States to move more aggressively in constructing coordinated, regional defense and security policies; and . 8. Release intelligence information, to the maximum extent possible, which exposes those in the Iranian regime responsible for this act -- as a means of galvanizing support for the actions, such as additional sanctions, mentioned above. The above options are illustrative only. Others may have more punitive measures in mind. But right now, the United States and Saudi Arabia should proceed with vigor and not permit Iran to hide its dagger behind its back in its left hand, while professing its innocence with the right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William S. Cohen.","William Cohen: Longtime Mideast observers baffled by reports of the plot .

"(CNN) -- Is al Qaeda looking to ground transportation as a promising target after the introduction of intense security measures for air travel? And are its supporters able to operate out of Iran without hindrance? Those two questions have been raised after the announcement by Canadian police on Monday that they had thwarted a plot to attack a rail link between Canada and the United States. The Canadian announcement has puzzled some terrorism experts, because Iranian authorities are widely seen as hostile to al Qaeda. Iran has denied the conspiracy could have been plotted from its territory. Canadian officials say they did not think the alleged conspirators were ""state-sponsored"" but suspect al Qaeda elements in Iran had provided two men in Canada with direction, guidance and information. As CNN National Security analyst Peter Bergen noted, ""If these allegations are true, it would appear to be the first time that al Qaeda elements based in Iran have directed some kind of plot in the West."" While Western intelligence agencies have long thought that al Qaeda operatives are present on Iranian soil, they were thought to be under some form of house arrest and under strict control. Many al Qaeda sympathizers and members took refuge in Iran in the aftermath of the post 9/11 invasion of Afghanistan, including one son of Osama bin Laden, Saad bin Laden, and a son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith. Abu Ghaith left Iran in February this year and entered Turkey, but was subsequently arrested in Jordan and flown to the United States in March. It's still unknown whether he left Iran of his own volition or was told to go. But Iran has become increasingly hostile to al Qaeda as it has become a Sunni sectarian group, especially in Iraq and Syria, as much as an anti-western outfit. In Syria, the al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al Nusra is one of the most effective fighting groups against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which is heavily backed by Tehran. The vast majority of Iranians are from the Shia sect of Islam, and al Qaeda has frequently targeted Shia communities and mosques in Iraq. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri has often railed against Iran in his speeches. But the United States says there appears to have been some tactical co-operation between the Islamic Republic and al Qaeda. In 2011, the U.S. Treasury Department accused Iran of a ""secret deal with al-Qa'ida allowing it to funnel funds and operatives through its territory."" Railroad Targets . Another aspect of the alleged Canadian plot is that it underlines the enduring interest of al Qaeda and its supporters in attacking railroad systems, seeing such operations as relatively cheap and easy to carry out -- with potentially devastating results. A senior law enforcement official in the United States told CNN's Gloria Borger that one of the routes targeted was between New York and Toronto, with the alleged conspirators looking at possible targets in the Toronto area, such as trestles over roads or water. ""I worry about the vulnerability of mass transit because we know they've been on al Qaeda's radar screen,"" Robert Liscouski, a former director of infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security, told CNN. Liscouski said that while significant steps had been taken in the United States to make air travel more secure, not enough was being done to reduce the vulnerability of mass transit to bomb attacks. He told CNN that there needed to be greater investment in random searches by agents with explosive trace detection equipment and greater deployment of CCTV cameras, saying the extra investment needed in mass transit security amounted to a fraction of the economic cost of a successful attack. Al Qaeda's interest in attacking railroads was underlined in the wake of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. Documents recovered from his compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan revealed that early in 2010, al Qaeda had discussed an idea to derail a train in the United States, several U.S. officials told CNN. The plan was to be executed coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. By then, two plots against U.S. railroad targets had already been foiled. In March 2008, American al Qaeda recruit Bryant Neal Vinas discussed a plan to attack the Long Island Railroad with al Qaeda operatives in a jihadist encampment in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Vinas later testified that his idea was for an al Qaeda operative to leave a suitcase bomb with a timer on a train and then exit at a station before the device exploded. His al Qaeda handler then decided the best scheme would be to launch a suicide bombing on a train as it entered a tunnel, to create maximum devastation. In September 2009, the FBI broke up an al Qaeda plot by Najibullah Zazi and two others to bomb New York subway lines. At their subsequent trial two of the group testified that they settled on a plan to target New York subways during rush hour so they could cause the heaviest number of casualties, instill fear, and inflict maximum economic damage. Authorities were alerted to the planned attack only days before Zazi drove from Denver to New York, after his communication with a known al Qaeda facilitator in Pakistan was intercepted. Zazi had apparently been asking his handler for help in making the explosive TATP. Al Qaeda cells have also plotted attacks on railway systems in Spain and Germany. The most lethal was carried out on board several commuter trains in Madrid in March 2004, in which 191 people were killed and more than 1,700 injured. There is little evidence to link ""al Qaeda central"" with the Madrid attack, which involved a cell of mainly Moroccan immigrants. Several weeks later the cell that carried out the attack attempted to blow up a bridge on the Madrid-Seville high-speed train line. The plot was abandoned after the terrorists realized they had been spotted by nearby workers, who alerted police, a Spanish official told CNN. The official added that hundreds could have been killed given the quantity of explosives left at the scene. The explosives were similar to those used in the Madrid attacks. Bomb disposal experts found between 24 pounds (10 and 12kg) of explosives connected to a detonator with a 440-foot (135-meter) cable. On July 7, 2005, al Qaeda suicide bombers killed dozens on the London underground system. A follow-on attempt two weeks later failed when the bombs malfunctioned. In December 2012, German police discovered a crude improvised explosive device placed in a bag on a platform at the main railway station in Bonn. German authorities have stated they have ""robust evidence"" Islamist extremists were involved but no arrests have yet been made.","Canadian authorities suspect al Qaeda elements in Iran provided guidance to alleged plotters .

"(CNN) -- Bob Besal went on a fishing trip this month off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida. The 62-year-old retired rear admiral, who earned two Distinguished Flying Cross awards and spent a lifetime on the water and above it, didn't catch any fish, but he did return with some memorable souvenirs. Twenty miles from shore and 80 feet under the Atlantic, parts of Besal's past were brought to the surface. Nearly 38 years ago, the naval aviator made a critical decision that almost cost him his life and ultimately defined it. Besal and three other pilots were simulating bombing runs on a training mission when his Vought A-7 Corsair clipped the plane next to him. Besal ejected at a speed close to 350 mph. ""It's not one of those things you brag about, honestly,"" laughed Besal. ""I didn't cover myself in glory on December 2, 1974. So it's one of those things if people asked I would tell them, but I didn't try to advertise it as such."" Pilot who survived midair collision decades ago learns wreckage found . The wreckage of Besal's plane was found last month by a team of divers from TISIRI (Think It Sink It Reef It), a Jacksonsville-based marine conservation company that specializes, among other things, in building artificial reefs. A data plate picked up off the ocean floor was traced back to Besal, who now teaches aviation maintenance technology in Charleston, South Carolina. Joe Kistel, executive director of TISIRI, asked Besal if he would like to return to the wreckage site, an invitation Besal eagerly accepted. Just after dawn on a recent Saturday morning, Besal joined a crew for a 90-minute ride to the wreckage site. Little did he know that the decades-old ruins had become part of a productive ecosystem. ""The fact we could determine it was his aircraft and locate Bob and actually bring him out here to visit the reef his wreckage had created, it's actually a very gratifying experience for us,"" said Kistel who had previously dived several times at the site now thriving with fish. Sea bass, scorpion, trigger and octopus now call the broken metal structure home. See the underwater wreckage . Kistel has no immediate plans to retrieve the larger plane parts. Said Kistel, ""We've notified the military of where (the plane is located) ... Mother Nature is doing the rest."" Daughter searches for missing father . The trip brings back memories for Besal, who was just 24 at the time of the accident. His misjudgment during a roll left brought his plane too close to an aircraft piloted by his squadron's commanding officer. ""It was the last thing he expected that morning, I'm sure, that I would bump into him up there."" That plane made it safely back to base. Besal never saw his own aircraft go into the water because he was above the clouds when he ejected, and shortly afterward he was picked up by a training helicopter in the area. Besal, who went on to become commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS America, spent 30 years in the Navy. He used his flying miscalculation to develop a greater appreciation for errors made by others.

"(CNN) -- Days after torrential rains caused intense flash flooding, residents of northeastern Minnesota and neighboring Wisconsin spent Friday coping with the aftermath -- including numerous road closures and continued worries about still dangerously high waters. Flood warnings remained in effect for parts of Burnett, Pine and Carlton counties in Minnesota, as well as in Ashland County, Wisconsin, even though waters in some creeks and rivers were receding, the National Weather Service said. Many of these warnings extend through Sunday, though the flooding concerns may not abate then. Water levels in Big Sandy Lake, which is about 60 miles west of Duluth, are rising at a rate of one foot per day, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports. The lake is expected to crest June 30 just above or below record highs. In Ashland County, emergency management officials were discouraging travel because most roads in the county had been compromised by water, according to the National Weather Service. Hundreds of people in the cities of Barnum, Moose Lake and Thomson were either partially or fully evacuated, and the city of Willow River was under a boil-water order, state officials said. ""It feels like a whale is swallowing us, like we're swimming in an ocean,"" Kris Huse, a city council member in Moose Lake whose own backyard was inundated by water, told CNN affiliate KBJR. ""I feel like I have to save the town."" Minnesota officials have requested federal damage assessment assistance in 14 counties, the first step in deciding whether Gov. Mark Dayton will ask for federal disaster assistance funding, according to the Minnesota Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. More than 150 people remained in Minnesota shelters on Friday, according to the state Department of Public Safety. The floods followed heavy storms Sunday through Tuesday that dropped as much as 10 inches of rain on Duluth and neighboring communities, according to the weather service. The flooding washed out roads and bridges, inundated neighborhoods and killed 11 animals at the Duluth zoo. No people were reported dead in Minnesota, but three fatalities were reported in Clark County, Wisconsin. Those three were in two cars that crashed Wednesday on a washed-out road, the state emergency management agency said. A calamity was averted near Proctor, Minnesota, when an 8-year-old boy was swept into a culvert while playing in flood waters. But after floating six or seven blocks, he survived the ordeal except for a few scrapes, the National Weather Service said. Numerous roads remained closed in Minnesota, and Jay Cooke, Moose Lake and Savanna Portage state parks were closed until further notice due to flooding damage, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said. Recovery will be a long process, KBJR quoted Duluth Chief Administrative Officer David Montgomery as saying. ""This is going to take months in many cases,"" he said. ""It'll take upwards to a year and into next year for some of the major items."" Images of flooding and aftermath . Officials at Lake Superior Zoo were tallying damage there after water surged through the park, leaving 11 animals dead and allowing several others to briefly escape their enclosures. CNN iReporter Ellie Burcar snapped a picture of one of the escaped animals, a seal, on the road outside the zoo early Wednesday morning. ""The amazing thing is that the seal was moving across Grand Ave heading (toward) the Lake Superior Zoo as if it just wanted to go home,"" Burcar said. The zoo moved some animals to other facilities, and some were being kept in quarantine inside the zoo's animal care building during cleanup efforts, the zoo said in a statement posted to its website. The zoo is planning a volunteer cleanup project this weekend. Seal survives being washed away during flood . Despite the damage, Minnesota officials stressed that Duluth and many state parks in the northwest part of the state are open for tourism and tried to highlight at least one positive effect from the recent storms.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- More than seven months after the U.N. Security Council authorized NATO forces to protect demonstrators in Libya, the aerial bombing campaign operation that helped depose longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi ended here Monday at midnight. ""I think what has happened in Libya sends a very clear signal to autocratic regimes all over the world,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters earlier in the day after arriving in Tripoli from Brussels, Belgium. ""We have been mandated by the United Nations Security Council to protect civilians and that mission has been a great success,"" he told CNN during the flight. ""We have prevented a massacre. We have saved countless lives. We have fully implemented the United Nations mandate. That was our mission and we have done what we promised to do."" But the Pentagon said Monday that the United States will continue monitoring Libya from the skies even after the end of formal NATO military operations. ""There will be some kind of overwatch role for a little while after the actual end,"" Pentagon spokesman, Capt. John Kirby said. ""We are still working with our NATO allies on that."" U.S. manned and unmanned aircraft played a key reconnaissance role in the Libya operation even after U.S. forces stopped taking the lead combat role. And National Transitional Council spokesman Ahmed Bani told CNN that he was expecting the mission would be suspended rather than canceled. ""To cancel it, in these circumstances, I don't think was the right decision, especially at this time,"" he said, citing the continued presence of pro-Gadhafi elements. Interim prime minister chosen . NATO's move comes after the United Nations Security Council last week rescinded its March mandate for military intervention to protect civilians targeted during anti-regime protests. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said NATO's mission puts Libya on a path to freedom. But she tempered her remarks with a word of caution. ""We're very concerned that, as we move forward, that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of Libyan society, and in which the rights of all Libyan people are fully and thoroughly respected, regardless of their gender, their religion, their region of origin,"" Rice said after the Security Council vote last Thursday. ""But for the United States, and, I think, for the United Nations Security Council, this closes what I think history will judge to be a proud chapter in the Security Council's history."" As of Monday, Operation Unified Protector had flown 7,943 total sorties, 1,851 strike sorties and 398 total strikes in which ordnance was dropped. Momentum to end the campaign began building after Gadhafi was killed following his capture near his hometown of Sirte on October 20. Many British military personnel who had been stationed at an Italian airfield for the campaign already are returning home. Meanwhile, Gadhafi's relatives said they plan to file a war crimes complaint. ""All of the events that have taken place since February 2011 and the murder of Gadhafi, all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the International Criminal Court,"" Marcel Ceccaldi, a lawyer representing the family, said last week. Questions have been raised about how Gadhafi was killed. Amateur videos showed him alive when captured by the opposition. He died from a shot in the head, officials said, but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear. NATO's Libya campaign began in March, after the Security Council adopted Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone in the country's airspace and authorized member states to take measures to protect civilians.

"(CNN) -- Who's to blame for the mine collapse that trapped 33 workers underground for months in Chile? No one, according to prosecutors, who closed the case Thursday after a lengthy investigation. Nearly three years after the collapse at the San Jose mine in Copiapo, Chile, prosecutors said, there's not enough evidence to file criminal charges. The 2010 mining accident drew global attention as word spread that the workers had survived and rescuers worked for weeks to free them. For 17 days after the collapse, nobody knew if they were alive. The miners spent 69 days underground before they were rescued. ""This was a complicated case, which is why it took us so long to make this determination,"" regional prosecutor Hector Mella Farias said. ""And I want to be clear in saying that everything to collect evidence that the law allows was done."" Authorities investigated the case for years, he said, compiling expert analysis and testimonies that totaled more than 20,000 pages. Two outraged miners told CNN Chile late Thursday that they plan to appeal the regional prosecutor's decision. The owners of the mine should be held responsible in a criminal case, they said, alleging that the company knew there was a risk of collapse and didn't do enough to protect workers. The miners have also filed a negligence lawsuit against the government, accusing the agency that oversees mining of failing to ensure safety measures. ""Today we heard the decision, as did many of our colleagues, and many of them are extremely shocked,"" said Luis Urzua, the miners' shift boss and the last man rescued from the mine. ""Because this is something that places responsibility upon the mine owners, because they are the entity that must supervise what happens. As supervisors, they should have prevented it. They should have known what sectors were at risk of collapsing."" The miners want future accidents to be prevented, he said, and they want the mine's owners to be held accountable. ""We want for this never to happen again,"" he said. ""What happened to us was not a work of nature. This was done by a man, by the negligence of man."" Attorneys for the mine's owners told CNN Chile on Thursday that the prosecutor's decision indicated that natural causes sparked the accident, and the company's owners are not responsible. ""This decision wasn't made on a whim,"" said attorney Catherine Lathrop. ""It is part of a long investigative process."" Miner Juan Carlos Aguilar said the miners aren't looking for money, but they do want justice. And comments like Lathrop's, he said, show that they haven't gotten that yet. ""She is laughing at what happened to us,"" he said. ""I think any miner is going to feel the same way. If they did nothing for us, when we were trapped for 70 days 700 meters underground, what is going to happen when there's another incident? ... Any person can do anything in Chile, and there is no justice.""

"(CNN) -- Investigators arrested a suspect but were still searching for a motive Wednesday after a West Virginia sheriff known for his tough stance on drug dealers was shot dead in his patrol vehicle. Mingo County Sheriff Walter E. ""Eugene"" Crum was eating lunch just blocks away from a courthouse when he was gunned down, officials said. Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37, is accused in the killing, West Virginia State Police First Sgt. Michael Baylous said. The suspect parked his car close to the sheriff's SUV and shot through the window twice, hitting the sheriff twice in the head, according to a state official who was briefed on the investigation. After a brief chase, Maynard was shot by a sheriff's deputy in Delbarton, West Virginia, after he wrecked the vehicle he was driving and raised his weapon, West Virginia State Police Capt. Dave Nelson told reporters. Maynard remained hospitalized Wednesday night after undergoing surgery to treat multiple gunshot wounds, Baylous said. Investigators were still trying to identify a possible motive. On the way to the hospital, Maynard spoke with police, but Baylous didn't specify what he said. Authorities were hoping to speak more with Maynard now that he's out of surgery. ""He said some things to us, and we're still trying to make sense of it,"" Baylous said. ""It could be interpreted in different ways."" At a news conference Wednesday, officials said Crum had taken office as sheriff in January and quickly earned respect from many in the community. ""He and his deputies and other law enforcement agencies have worked tirelessly to wipe out crime in our county, especially targeting the drug dealers who spread the disease of addiction among our residents,"" said John Mark Hubbard, president of the Mingo County Commission. ""Pray for the residents of Mingo County as we struggle to understand why someone who fought so freely and selflessly on behalf of all of us was taken so tragically,"" he said. Crum also served as a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor's office, Hubbard said. The sheriff's slaying shook the rural county, which normally sees only one or two slayings per year, said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff's Office. ""It's devastating,"" Hatfield said. ""It's a big blow to the community."" The Williamson Daily News reported that Crum was in his vehicle in downtown Williamson when a man drove into the parking lot, approached Crum's sport-utility vehicle and shot him point-blank. A witness saw the shooting, called 911, and gave police a vehicle tag number that led them to the suspect, Hatfield said. Investigators believe a handgun was used. Asked whether officials thought there was any connection between Crum's slaying and the recent killings of a Colorado prison official or the slayings of two Texas prosecutors, Hatfield said, ""I hope not,"" but declined to elaborate further. Crum was married and had children and grandchildren. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin issued a statement, saying in part, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Crum family.""","NEW: Police say Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37, is accused in the killing .

"(CNN) -- Chinua Achebe died, aged 82, almost exactly 23 years to the day a car accident in Nigeria left him paralyzed from the waist down. I wonder what Achebe scholars might make of that. I wonder, too, what Achebe himself might have made of that, in his final moments. I'm trying to imagine what went through his mind in those moments. Would he have pondered, for one last time, on the inauspicious beginnings of his bestselling novel, ""Things Fall Apart?"" (He once said that Heinemann, the publishers of the debut edition ""printed very, very few. It was a risk... It went out of print very quickly."") Would he have mused on the fact that ""Things Fall Apart"" never appeared in Igbo, the Nigerian language that fed its style, and rhythms, and that its characters spoke? Would his mind have been crowded by violent images from Nigeria's civil war of 1967 to 1970, in which he lost friends, his library, and any illusions he may have had about the unity and inherent goodness of Nigeria? Or by violent images from the 1990 accident? Would he have preferred to die in Nigeria, instead of America? Would he have chuckled at the thought of the Nigerian government unleashing a torrent of tributes -- the same government that suggested in 2004 (under another president, it must be said), in response to his criticism of it, that he didn't deserve the country? Would he have tried to imagine how his life might have played out had Biafra and the accident not happened? We will never know. Watch Achebe interview: Africa's man of letters . The war has been written about extensively -- Achebe's final book was a much-awaited memoir of the war. The accident, on the other hand, is the tragedy that is not much talked about -- perhaps because Nigeria is an accident-factory. The title of Nigerian author Ben Okri's 1991 Booker-winning novel ""The Famished Road"" comes from a Wole Soyinka poem, ""Death in the Dawn,"" a 1967 lament for the victim of an accident on a Nigerian road: ""May you never walkÂ / when theÂ road waits,Â famished."" Achebe's accident happened in Awka, in southeastern Nigeria, not very far from his birthplace. Nigeria's hospitals could not take care of him, and soon after he had to be moved to a hospital in England, where he was told he would never be able to walk again. In the eight years before the war Achebe published four novels, but after the war it took him 17 years to publish another. After the accident he never walked again. And never had the chance to live in Nigeria again. And never again published a novel. ""I have found that I work best when I am at home in Nigeria,"" he told the Paris Review in a 1994 interview. When the magazine asked if he missed Nigeria, he said: ""Yes, very much."" But coming back was not an option: ""One reason why I am quite angry with what is happening in Nigeria today is that everything has collapsed. If I decide to go back now, there will be so many problems -- where will I find the physical therapy and other things that I now require?"" More Achebe: Father of African literature . That anger -- triggered by the Biafra civil war, and crystallized by his accident, and the continued failings of Nigeria's successive governments to bring real change to the country -- defined his relationship with Nigeria. Things were always falling apart between the writer and his country. In 2004, the government chose to offer him a national honor. Not surprisingly, Achebe rejected it. In response the Government described his decision as ""regrettable."" Seven years later, the government -- this time under a new president -- tried again. Again, Achebe said no, arguing that ""the reasons for rejecting the offer when it was first made have not been addressed let alone solved. It is inappropriate to offer it again to me."" And yet again the government described his action as ""regrettable"" and hoped he would ""find time to visit home soon and see the progress being made by the Jonathan Administration for himself."" That same government will now arrogate to itself the position of ""Mourner-in-chief."" Someone ought to let them know that the biggest tribute they can pay to Achebe would be to create the kind of Nigeria he would have been proud to receive a national honor from. And for Nigerians everywhere, the biggest tribute we can pay to Achebe would be to get more familiar with his oeuvre; read his writing with the passion with which we revere his person. Read also: Achebe was a talent and moralist . I must confess I came to his work rather late. Chimamanda Adichie has spoken eloquently of reading Achebe at 10, and having her life transformed from that moment. I came to Achebe much later -- I didn't encounter ""Things Fall Apart"" until I was in my mid-20s. I love his essays and short stories the most -- essays full of wisdom and wit, and without the urge to impress with scholarly intelligence; stories marked by an expertly wielded lightness of touch, and the most compelling characters you will ever meet. And it occurs to me that the novel I'd most love to write would be a 21st-century update of Achebe's final novel, ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (1987). I got an opportunity to see Achebe in person in November 2010, when he went to speak at Cambridge University, England. It was an opportunity to see for myself the sort of reverence Achebe inspired. ""I think all you need to tell the stories that I have told is to live the life that I have lived and keep your eyes and senses open and working,"" he once said. But that was the humble, self-deprecating Achebe, the man who insisted he never taught creative writing because, ""well, I don't know how it's done."" What he did took more than just open eyes. It took vision, a certain way of seeing the world. He was a genius, laden with -- to borrow from his own description of Adichie -- ""the gift of ancient storytellers."" May his soul rest in peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tolu Ogunlesi.","Chinua Achebe was a genius, laden with 'the gift of ancient storytellers,' writes Tolu Ogunlesi .

"(CNN) -- A high-speed passenger train derails as it rounds a curve, killing dozens and injuring scores more. That scene played out Wednesday in Spain, leading U.S. residents to ask, ""Could it happen here?"" The answer: Not likely, not now, if only because there's precious little high-speed rail in the United States. Also, the train that crashed near Santiago de Compostela is an extremely complicated machine, nothing like any train in the United States, said University of Dayton assistant professor Steven Harrod. ""From the U.S. public's point of view, I think it's important for them not to be scared or panicked about this,"" said Harrod, whose research expertise lies in railway operations. ""I could never imagine such a complicated piece of equipment running in North America."" Where the United States, like most of the world, has a standard track width of 4 feet, 8.5 inches, the Spain train was designed to run on both that gauge and on wider tracks that are used in much of Spain and Portugal, Harrod said. ""The wheels on this train actually move, so you can imagine the complexity that adds,"" he said. Spain's high-speed AVE trains run on a different voltage than other trains in the country, so this train's electrical system was outfitted to adapt to multiple voltages and signal systems, and because parts of Northwest Spain have no electric wires, the train was designed with a diesel engine so it can run on both electric and nonelectric tracks. ""It's an enormously complicated train, nothing like the U.S. or North American continent has ever seen,"" Harrod said. In the crash video, he said, ""the train looks like it peels off the track between the diesel engine and the first coach."" This is the weakest juncture in the train, he said, because the coach car is far lighter than the engine. America's slower locomotives . While Harrod said there are routes between Chicago and St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit where trains can top 100 mph (the Spain train was reportedly running about 118 mph), the closest the United States has to high-speed rail is the Acela Express that runs between Washington and Boston at advertised speeds of up to 150 mph. But that's a bit misleading, some say. The trains rarely travel that fast because along many stretches the tracks aren't rated for that kind of speed. Amtrak announced in September it plans to run test trains at 165 mph in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. ""They're operating on tracks and going through tunnels that are 100 years old,"" said Robert Puentes, a transportation expert at the Brookings Institution. While Acela trains could potentially derail, Federal Railroad Administration requirements demand they be heavier than similar trains in Europe, making them less likely to fly off the tracks, according to an excerpt from ""Waiting on a Train: the Embattled Future of Passenger Rail Service,"" posted on the publisher's website. Speed limits enforced by the agency also keep the trains moving slower than their powerful engines allow, further reducing the risk of an accident. Those limits are necessary because of curves, small tunnels and freight traffic along the same tracks, according to the book, written by James McCommons. ""The high-speed corridors in Europe and Japan are straight, level, sealed from intrusion, and set aside solely for fast passenger trains,"" McCommons writes. ""To create such a corridor in the Northeast with its dense population would cost tens of billions of dollars and require the purchase or condemnation of more land and neighborhoods."" The curves, traffics and tight tunnels may actually make U.S. trains safer, Harrod said, because engineers have to pay more attention, especially since there's far less automation in American trains than in European ones. ""Human factors play a big role, including the risk of oversight due to boredom. The Northeast Corridor is curvy with frequent speed changes, so engineers there never have a chance to get complacent or bored. They are constantly braking and accelerating,"" he said. ""We don't have this level of computer control. In most places in the U.S., the engineer's in the cab. He's watching visual signals outside the cab."" American trains also have an auto-stop feature, so if an engineer misses a stop or caution signal, either inside or outside the cab, the brakes are applied automatically. Slow progress for high-speed rail . High costs and political opposition have led to limited success for efforts to bring widespread European- and Asian-style high-speed rail to the United States. President Barack Obama used the 2009 economic stimulus package to dole out $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, and in 2011 proposed spending $53 billion over six years to promote construction of high-speed lines around the nation. More than two years later, there's been little progress. While the federal government offered money to spearhead high-speed rail efforts in states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida and California, Republican governors in Wisconsin and Florida killed the projects. In California, voters in 2008 approved a 520-mile high-speed rail project that would have carried riders between San Diego and San Francisco at nearly 200 mph. Since then, the cost estimate has gone up, speeds have come down and the route has been limited to a roughly 200-mile stretch between Fresno and Burbank. Now, the attention appears to be turning to state and local initiatives. A private company has proposed a line in Texas, while another private proposal would bring high-speed rail linking Miami and Orlando, Florida. But for high-speed rail to make significant inroads into the United States, the nation would first have to make significant improvements to basic infrastructure, such as tracks and bridges to allow freight and passenger traffic to coexist, said Brookings' Puentes. ""We've got a long way to go,"" he said. CNN's Thom Patterson contributed to this report.","High-speed trains are not widely available in the U.S., though some can top 100 mph .

"Beirut (CNN) -- Syria carried out an airstrike on a refugee camp in northern Lebanon Saturday, killing nine Syrians and wounding nine more, a Lebanese state-run news agency reported. The strike centered on a Syrian refugee camp located near the Syrian border between the towns of Baalbeck and Arsal in the Bekaa Valley, the National News Agency said. The Red Cross took the casualties to Universal Hospital in Baalbek. Saturday's strike was not the first by the Syrian government, which has accused rebels of smuggling arms and supplies across the border. On March 18, two Syrian jets fired three rockets that hit empty buildings near Arsal. At the time, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman called the use of fighter jets to fire rockets into Lebanon a ""significant escalation."" U.N. commissioner wants to probe into whether Syrian rebels executed soldiers . Also in March, the U.N. Security Council voiced ""grave concern over repeated incidents of cross-border fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abductions and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border, as well as other border violations."" The declaration followed a briefing by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. More than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a country of about 4 million people, according to a U.N. estimate. But the Lebanese government puts the total at more than 1 million. Whatever the true figure, there is no dispute that the influx has destabilized the area and heightened tensions. The attack comes as the Syrian conflict is mired in a third year of unrest, which started in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protesters. Since then, it has evolved into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 and transformed more than 1 million others into refugees, according to the Red Cross.

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- In 2013, the greatest risk of conflict doesn't lie in the halls of the U.S. Congress, on the battlefield in Syria nor the rising rhetoric between Iran and the international community, according to Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group. ""China-Japan is by far the most important and consequential geopolitical conflict on our screen for the entire year of 2013,"" Bremmer told CNN's John Defterios at the World Economic Forum in Davos. A territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea boiled over into often violent anti-Japanese demonstration in China last September has led to tensions between the world's second and third largest economies. Last week, new Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned from a trip to Southeast Asia to shore up support of nations also at odds with China over disputed land claims in the South China Sea. ""The Chinese don't feel like they need the Japanese in the way they used to -- they don't need the technology, they don't need the investment dollars; and furthermore unlike places like Vietnam and the Philippines where the Chinese have a large Diaspora population that really controls the local business so over time the Chinese feel they win no matter what; in Japan ... there's no influence there,"" Bremmer said. Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? After opening to economic reforms in 1979, the economy of the world's most populated country sprinted ahead at an average of 10% growth each year, overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in late 2010. While China is still in many ways a developing nation -- it's GDP per capita was 94th in the world in 2011 -- most economists expect it will jump ahead of the U.S. as the world's largest economy by 2030. The December report by the U.S. National Intelligence Council, ""Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds,"" forecast that U.S. economic and international influence will decline in the next two decades as a shift of global power moves from the West to the East -- with the rise of China as one of the greatest forces . Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos 2013 . ""China is slated to pass the threshold of US$15,000 per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) in the next five years or soâ€”a level that is often a trigger for democratization,"" the report notes. ""Chinese `soft' power could be dramatically boosted, setting off a wave of democratic movements. Alternatively, many experts believe a democratic China could also become more nationalistic. An economically collapsed China would trigger political unrest and shock the global economy."" Bremmer thinks the odds of that are long, but a China moving on its current path will still be a primary player of world events in the next two decades. Europe's decade: A tale of boom and bust . ""Of course the rise of China has enormous implications for both economic conflict and political conflict precisely because this is a poor country, it's an authoritarian country, it's a state capitalist country -- and by the time China becomes the world's largest economy, surpassing the United States, those fundamental qualities of China will not particularly change,"" he said. ""Here you have a situation for many decades where Americans felt that China's rise was in their interest -- already Japan understands that China's rise is not in its interest, it's a bad thing,"" Bremmer said.

The woman was found dead in a home in Venus, located in the middle of the state roughly between Port St. Lucie and Sarasota, Rybinski said. In addition, a child in one of the affected homes was injured and transported to a hospital for treatment. Packing 60 mph winds, Debby's eye was still 115 miles south-southwest of Apalachiocola, Florida (and 195 miles east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana) according to the National Hurricane Center's 7 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) Sunday update. Even so, it's already made a big impact -- and is likely to cause damage, flooding and worse for days to come. In fact, the heart of the storm was churning but not moving in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday evening, and forecasters still don't know where it will end up. ""Little movement is expected during the next couple of days, but this forecast remains uncertain due to weak steering currents,"" the Miami-based center said. ""Some gradual strengthening is possible during the next 48 hours."" Follow Bay News 9's live blog . Offshoot tornadoes, like the ones that seemed to hit Highland County, are one major concern. The National Weather Service had tornado warnings out, indicating a high likelihood of a twister strike, in spots off-and-on throughout the day Sunday, and a less severe tornado watch is in effect for much of western Florida through 5 a.m. Monday. And even if tornadoes don't occur, the combination of relentless rains and strong winds has proven enough to cause big problems. The sprawling system's tropical storm force winds of 39 mph or stronger extend out 200 miles from its center. Such sustained winds were recorded early Sunday evening in several spots on the Florida Panhandle, west of Apalachicola. Debbie Ponceti said wind was pushing run underneath the door to her home in Madeira Beach, about 10 miles east of St. Petersburg, while her front lawn has been reduced to mush and waters in a lagoon near her house are steadily rising. There was been no let up in the powerful rain, which is forecast to continue through Tuesday. ""Typically when a thunderstorm happens, it is over in 20 minutes,"" Ponceti told CNN iReport. ""But this has been going on all day."" In nearby Redington Beach, fellow iReporter Keri Ann Eversole said winds appeared to be blowing between 40 to 50 miles per hour. ""The rain was coming down sideways,"" Eversole said. ""(It) felt like glass."" Fire and rescue personnel in nearby Clearwater responded to 30 calls in an hour, as of 6 p.m. Sunday, to help people stranded in their cars due to the flooding or needing urgent medical help, the city's public safety spokeswoman Elizabeth Watts said. Beach areas were ""basically underwater,"" as were many side streets and at least two major thoroughfares -- U.S. Highway 19 and Gulf to Bay Boulevard. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for Alligator Point. St. George Island and other low-lying areas in Franklin County on the Florida Panhandle, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a Sunday night news release. Just to the east and also on the Gulf coast, voluntary evacuations are being encouraged in parts of Taylor and Wakulla counties. And high winds have prompted authorities to shut down the Sunshine Skyway bridge on Interstate 275 connecting St. Petersburg and Bradenton, Florida, said Elizabeth LaRotonda with St. Petersburg police. The hurricane center said tropical storm conditions will extend for the entire area from the Mississippi-Alabama line eastward to the Suwannee River, Florida, by night's end. Beyond that, the new forecast track showed Debby remaining a tropical storm as it moves northward and makes landfall, possibly Thursday, on the Florida Panhandle. However, forecasters warned Debby's track remained uncertain and said the ""new official track remains a low-confidence forecast."" Debby should dump 10 to 15 inches of rain in the Florida Panhandle and elsewhere in northern Florida before it's done, the hurricane center said, with as much as 25 inches possible in spots. Central Florida and southeast Georgia will likely be drenched with 5 to 10 inches, with smaller but still significant precipitation amounts in parts of coastal Alabama, southeastern Louisiana and south Florida. ""Given the recent heavy rainfall and wet soil conditions, these additional amounts will exacerbate the threat of flooding across portions of the central and eastern Gulf coast,"" the weather service said. The combination of a storm surge and the high tide could cause 4 to 6 feet of flooding at Florida's Apalachee Bay to Waccasassa Bay, forecasters said. Parts of Florida's west coast and coastal Mississippi could see 2 to 4 feet deep waters. The storm has raised concerns for those working on 596 manned oil and gas production platforms throughout the Gulf, run by various companies. One of them, Shell, said in a statement Sunday morning that it had evacuated 360 staff the previous day and was planning further evacuations. ExxonMobil said it has ""evacuated nonessential personnel"" from its offshore facilities and is preparing to evacuate the rest. And BP spokesman Brett Clanton said early Sunday evening that ""we've evacuated the majority of our offshore personnel in the Gulf of Mexico"" due to Tropical Storm Debby. ""Those unable to be evacuated will shelter in place for the storm,"" he said. Even though it was far from clear it would hit Louisiana, officials in that state weren't taking any chances -- with Terrebonne Parish and Lafourche Parish among those issuing precautionary states of emergency, after the governor did the same. In Plaquemines Parish, the state's southernmost parish, authorities were using baskets and tubes to keep Highway 23 -- the parish's main evacuation and emergency route -- free of water should the 4-foot levees be topped, said Billy Nungesser, parish president. The levees were being sandbagged as an additional precaution . ""We want to be ahead of that as a precautionary measure,"" Nungesser said. The area is forecast to get a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet, he said -- ""with a direct hit, if it goes up a little bit more, we'll have those levees topped.""

"(CNN) -- Para-gliders soar above the snowy peaks and broad pistes where hundreds of youngsters are taking their first lessons at Europe's biggest ski school. Nestled within the Engadine Valley beneath the Swiss Alps, St Moritz has earned a reputation as one of the world's greatest winter playgrounds. The resort will host the World Alpine Skiing Championships for the fifth time in 2017 and is bidding to stage the Winter Olympics for a record third time in 2022. At the foot of the mountains the world Bobsleigh Championship is taking place, giving motorists a momentary glimpse of the action as the bob hurtles above the ice wall. Amateur daredevils on the nearby Cresta Run can almost match the bobsleigh speeds of up to 140 kilometers per hour. The private club was established by British visitors as a winter tourist destination towards the end of the 19th Century. On the valley floor stands the frozen lake of St Moritz -- home to an unlikely event of similar vintage -- ""White Turf"" -- horse racing on snow and ice. ""White Turf is an exceptional event,"" said the event's president, Silvio Staub. ""It's a meeting dating back from 1907, so it's the 106th anniversary this year. It's run on three Sundays in February and usually we have about 30,000 people attending."" Watching paint dry is a mere instance compared to watching ice form, but each year the organizers have to wait patiently for a solid layer of at least 30 centimeters before declaring the event safe. Then an army of helpers is needed to prepare the temporary land mass. A race track is marked out, while piste-bashers compact snow on top of the ice, affording the horses a modicum of grip. Mobile starting gates are rolled in along with grandstands and a row of tents containing jockey changing and weighing rooms and the all-important corporate lounges. The race card at each meeting features flat racing, winter-style trotting and the local speciality, skijoring -- an awkward combination of horse, human and skis which is a clear crowd favorite. Horses for White Turf are brought to St Moritz from all over the world, including Hungary, Italy, France, Germany and the UK. Before they set hoof onto the snow they have to undergo a change of shoes, a feat made possible by farrier Christian Lampert, who replaces regular shoes with a set containing winter grips and a unique layer of silicone to prevent snow sticking to hooves. ""This has been invented and patented here in St Moritz. Without this, a pack of snow would form underneath and the horse would slip. It keeps the snow away,"" he said. Instead of adhering to hooves, the trampled snow forms a perilous kickback cloud fired into the path of the jockeys, who also need protection. ""It's like snowballs being thrown at you by a half tonne man, so it can be quite sore at times,"" said jockey Robert Havlin. To counter this, he sports a mask used by motocross riders in muddy conditions. En masse it produces the effect of a cavalry of Star Wars Clone Troopers riding into battle. Another addition to the jockey wardrobe at White Turf is an oversized pair of fleecy slippers which would look less out of place on a circus clown -- vital footwear to cover riding boots while hanging around on a frozen lake before the race. Even at this high altitude, the horses are physically able to handle the strain. ""The altitude for the heart and lungs is not a problem for the horses,"" said vet Annina Widmer. ""It's not dangerous to them. Maybe skijoring is dangerous because the horses are not really under control, but otherwise there is no risk."" Franco Moro is a six-time skijoring champion -- and winner of sixteen races. As leader of the St Moritz ski school he can often be found handing out prizes to young skiers. But when White Turf comes to town, he's aiming for a prize of his own - ""King of Engadine"" -- for the skijoring competitor who scores the most points over the three weekends. Skijoring requires expert skiing skills as the jockey is pulled behind a rider-less horse. ""We have not got that much control"" said Moro. ""Around 20% is the driver's responsibility and 80% is the horse."" One of the hazards is the first bend, where all horses are aiming for the inside track and the curve sends skiers wide. Jockeys often find themselves in the terrifying position of skiing alongside the sprinting horse of the team behind him. Franco uses his elbows to nudge horses aside -- if a hoof steps on a ski it's enough to end their chances of winning. In the first race Franco finishes well down the field. But with two more weekends to go, he still has a chance to regain the title he lost last year. His pedigree in this unusual event is unmatched and only the brave would bet against the former ""King of Engadine"" regaining his crown.","Horses race on ice at the annual White Turf competition .

"(CNN) -- Purebred Arabian stallions dominate the world of endurance horse events, but it is increasingly likely that the rider guiding them to glory will be a young woman. The United Arab Emirates is the hotbed of equestrian's fastest growing discipline, and new entrants to the top level of the sport such as 18-year-old Fatima Al-Marri are already upsetting the established order. ""We love to challenge the men,"" she told CNN's Winning Post, while fellow competitor Mariam Mothana has another take. ""The best thing is when you see the look on their faces when they pass the finish line,"" Mothana said. ""It's nice to see that they understand that the women here can challenge the men -- they can be as strong as men."" Some 40% of registered endurance riders are now women, and the bar has certainly been set high for the likes of Fatima and Mariam. Back in 2010, Spanish rider Maria Mercedes Alvarez Ponton won her second world title just seven weeks after giving birth to her first child. Remarkable feat . Then 34, she held off an all-powerful squad from the UAE to take the endurance championship at the World Equestrian Games in Kentucky. Riding her Arabian wonder horse Nobby, Ponton successfully defended the title she won two years previously in Malaysia and added to her European title of 2009, becoming the first rider to achieve that triple. Ponton could soon be facing challenges from young Emirati women from the UAE, where traditional cultural barriers are being eroded. Shamsa Al Shamsi is typical of the emerging riders who are pushing for acceptance. ""There might be some people who are sticking to the tradition that a woman can't be a rider, but nowadays so many of us are riding here in the UAE and the Gulf region,"" the 28-year-old told CNN. She is one of 15 women being trained at the stables owned by Sheikh Hamdan, the brother of Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum -- so recent developments truly have royal consent. Sheikh Mohammed is the backer of one of the highlights of the region's endurance racing season, the Al Maktoum Endurance Cup. The field of top international riders for the 2013 edition had a strong contingent of women entrants. Champion's views . ""Women are getting more and more interested in this race,"" Sheikh Mohammed told CNN. And can they compete at the same level? ""Yes, yes definitely!"" came the reply. As the reigning world endurance champion, Sheikh Mohammed is certainly well placed to make that judgment. He rode the 11-year-old Intissar -- trained by Ponton's husband Jaume Punti-Dachs -- to victory at Euston Park in Britain last August. Ponton, riding the evergreen Nobby, was relegated to fourth place as the Sheikh covered the 160-kilometer course in treacherous and wet conditions at an average speed of 22.82 kph. According to Ali Al-Muhairi, the racing manager at Sheikh Hamdan's stables, women have riding skills ideally sorted to endurance riding. ""Men and women are different,"" he told CNN. ""The girl is softer, she pulls the horse, she pulls gently and the horse will understand, 'Oh she will not hurt me.' ""He will slow down for her, but the man when he hits the horse, pulls the horse back and horse will pull him back hard, if you pull the horse hard, you will lose energy and the horse will lose energy."" Perfect partnership . Ponton knows the importance of forming the perfect partnership between rider and horse, in this case her beloved Nobby. ""He's a winner, I think he was born as a winner. He's a champion. Even if he's tired, when another horse challenges him, he will go until the end,"" she told CNN. Her last big success at the European championships in 2011 was a particular highlight. ""There was a lot of pressure and a lot of people said that he couldn't do it, that he wasn't good enough for the mountains or something like this,"" Ponton said. ""I don't know why but I enjoyed it a lot when I crossed the line. I was really really happy to win."" She and her trainer husband are already searching for the new breed of champion horses and have a growing stable of contenders. ""Flat races last minutes but top endurance races can last all day. The key is stamina and Arabians are genetically built for it,"" Punti-Dachs said. Royal family . Ponton and Nobby had been trying to match the record of American Becky Hart, who claimed the first three stagings of the world endurance championships in 1988, 1990 and 1992 riding the legendary RO Grand Sultan. But it may well be that a young Emirati will be the next woman to impress at the highest level. Sheikh Mohammed's daughter Futtaim won the Ladies' Endurance Challenge race in Dubai last month, beating 63 rivals. Her brother Sheikh Ahmed won the world endurance championship in 2002 aged just 16. Fatima Al-Marri has also been a dominant figure in the women-only events and her mentor Al-Muhairi believes she has the ability to go all the way. ""She's tough, strong, she pushes herself over the limit, and that's what you need in endurance,"" he said. ""Fatima braved a sandstorm to win gold at last year's Ladies' Endurance Cup and has placed second and third key races against men."" It is perhaps only a matter of time before she joins the likes of Ponton on the top step of the podium at the highest level.","UAE riders dominate world endurance equestrian events .

"(CNN) -- In 1937, Life magazine launched the career of an up-and-coming starlet with a photo spread that, overnight, made ""Cynthia"" a household name. She became an A-list celebrity, top fashion houses sent jewels and dresses, and she was briefly engaged to one of radio's biggest stars. There was just one minor catch: Cynthia wasn't human, she was a mannequin -- a plaster, dead-eyed dummy. Pretty, in a vacant kind of way, but a dummy. Her creator, Lester Gaba, was a Missouri shopkeeper's son with dreams of a grand life in the big city. He achieved it through his uncanny skill at one of the Great Depression's quirkier national crazes -- soap sculpting. Buoyed by the fame he earned as a soap sculptor, Gaba moved to New York in 1932, where he went into fashion and retail and pioneered the design of mannequins that combined style with realism.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- What happened to 12 youths who were kidnapped in broad daylight from a bar in Mexico? The mystery, which has jolted the country's capital for months, appeared to be one step closer to resolution Monday: . The victims were killed shortly after the kidnapping, Mexico City Prosecutor Rodolfo Rios Garza told reporters on Monday. And the motive was revenge, he said. The crime occurred in retaliation for another killing at a bar in the city's upscale Condesa neighborhood, he said. The prosecutor's revelation comes a day after an attorney representing victims' families said authorities had found that at least 10 of the bodies discovered last week in a shallow grave near Mexico City corresponded to the group kidnapped from the Heaven after-hours club. The mysterious mass kidnapping in Mexico's capital in May drew international attention after furious family members protested, claiming authorities weren't taking the case seriously. The allegations have sparked concerns about whether violence has surged into Mexico's capital, where residents largely have been spared from drug war casualties seen in other parts of the country. Prosecutor: 'We are not talking about any cartel' Rios said Monday that the group behind the kidnapping was La Union de Insurgentes, which has been tied to drug distribution in the capital. But he dismissed concerns about larger forces at work. ""We are not talking about any cartel,"" he said. But even with the new information released by authorities, victims' family members said their outrage over the case hasn't dimmed. One stood in the doorway of Monday's press conference, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with all 12 victims' faces. As officials tried to get her to move, Julieta Gonzalez told them, ""I am not moving from here. I am not going to do anything. I only want to hear."" Gonzalez -- whose daughter, Jennifer Robles, was among those taken from the bar -- said she wanted to listen because authorities have consistently given reporters details about the case before telling family members. Seven suspects arrested . Mexico's Attorney General's Office said Sunday that at least 10 of the remains found correspond to the kidnapped youths, attorney Ricardo Martinez told CNNMexico. Officials have not provided details about three other bodies found in the grave. Authorities found the grave last week in the town of Tlalmanalco, in the state of Mexico, about 30 miles east of Mexico City, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Investigators haven't said what led them to the grave. Authorities have arrested seven suspects in connection with the crime, Rios said Monday. The owner of the bar, a co-owner and two bar employees are among those who have been arrested in the case. A suspect detained at a hotel in Mexico City last week told authorities he and others had taken the victims to Tlalmanalco, Rios said. ""We will not stop until we have achieved the detention of the rest of the participants in these events,"" he said, describing what he said had been an exhaustive investigation. Families call for independent investigation . But the mother of at least one of the victims said she was far from satisfied with the investigation so far, and wants more proof about what investigators exhumed from the grave last week. ""No one is sure of what is there. We have not seen clothes. They have not shown us bodies. They have not shown us anything,"" mother Leticia Ponce told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Monday. Victims' family members have said they don't trust Mexican authorities and have called for an independent international investigation of the case. ""I have always distrusted them. ... They have not shown me a hair or a nail from my daughter. I am not taking anything until they prove to me that it is my daughter,"" Gonzalez said. ""They are staging it.""

"(CNN) -- The leadership of North Korea appeared to pass to a third generation of the Kim family Monday after the weekend death of Kim Jong Il, who ruled the reclusive Stalinist state since 1994. The man known as the ""dear leader"" died of a heart attack Saturday at age 69, state news outlets announced Monday. The ruling Worker's Party declared the youngest of his three sons, Kim Jong Un, the ""great successor"" to his father's mantle. Kim Jong Il had led North Korea since his father -- the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung -- died at age 82. During his 17 years in power, the country suffered a devastating famine even as it built up its million-strong army, expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world's eighth declared nuclear power. News of his death spurred South Korea, which remains technically at war with the North more than five decades after their 1950-53 conflict, to put its military on high alert. But across one of the world's most heavily fortified borders, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told his citizens ""to go about their lives"" in the meantime. ""For the sake of the future of the Republic of Korea, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is more important than anything else. It should not be threatened by what has happened,"" he said. And Kim Young-mok, the South Korean consul in New York, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that Seoul's top priority is to avoid ""anything troublesome."" ""I don't think that North Korea can afford some provocation at this point, but we must make sure that everything is OK,"" he said. North Korea tested nuclear weapons in 2006 and 2009. Monday, it fired a short-range missile over the East Sea -- but Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN that U.S. officials have seen no sign of any movement of North Korean forces across the Demilitarized Zone that separates the North and South. North Korean officers had reported plans for its missile test to the commission that monitors the 1953 armistice, Dempsey said during a trip to Germany. He said no heightened alert has been issued for the nearly 30,000 American troops in South Korea, which has a mutual-defense pact with the United States. In Washington, the White House said it was monitoring developments and hoped to see the North ""take steps to assure the peace and prosperity of its people,"" as White House spokesman Jay Carney put it. ""Our focus is on coordinating closely with our allies and partners,"" he said. ""We have reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our allies, South Korea and Japan."" And after a meeting with Japan's Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that Washington has been in ""close touch"" with the other countries involved in the six-party North Korean nuclear talks, including Russia and China. ""We reiterate our hope for improved relations with the people of North Korea, and remain deeply concerned about their well being,"" she said. A look back at the life of Kim Jong Il . Carney said President Barack Obama was notified of Kim's death by his chief of staff about 10:30 p.m. Sunday. ""I believe it was established in news reports that the North Koreans made that announcement,"" Carney said. On North Korea's state television network, a tearful anchor broke the news Monday morning. The news was followed by scenes of similarly emotional residents of the capital Pyongyang. ""My leader, what will we do? It's too much! It's too much!"" one person sobbed. ""Leader, please come back. ... You cannot leave us. We will always wait for you, leader."" The network said Kim died of ""overwork"" while ""dedicating his life to the people."" And the official news agency KCNA said Kim suffered ""great mental and physical strain"" while on a train. Kim enjoyed a cult-like status in the nation, with millions schooled to accept him as a divine and benevolent father figure. Laura Ling, one of two American journalists arrested after entering North Korea in March 2009 and sentenced to 12 years hard labor before being released in August 2009 following intervention by former President Bill Clinton, told CNN's ""AC360"" Monday that she was allowed to watch television while in custody. Nearly every broadcast featured images of Kim as an ""otherwordly figure,"" she said, recalling her guards were ""moved to tears watching their 'Dear Leader,' and they talked about how much he was doing (for the people.)"" The guards said Kim's health was failing because he worked so hard for North Koreans, she said. Her sister, Lisa Ling, filmed a documentary in North Korea while posing as part of a medical team that performed eye surgeries. In a clip from the documentary, a young girl's bandages are removed and she could see for the first time. ""It's all because of the Great General,"" her jubilant father exclaims. ""We must bow to our Great General for this."" There was no independent confirmation of the circumstances reported by the government, which routinely touted the military, technological and artistic genius of the ""dear leader"" -- even claiming he shot 11 holes in one in his first golf outing. But he had appeared frail in his last public appearances, and speculation about his health had persisted for some time. KCNA acknowledged that Kim had been treated for ""cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for a long period."" He suffered a heart attack on Saturday and couldn't be saved despite the use of ""every possible first-aid measure,"" according to the agency. In Washington, the White House said Obama spoke with Lee on Monday morning. The two leaders agreed to stay in ""close touch as the situation develops,"" it said. Several of North Korea's neighbors, including Japan, the Philippines and leading ally China, offered condolences to the North Korean people on Kim's death. Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the North Korean embassy in Beijing Tuesday to offer condolences, according to the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua. Monday night, Secretary of State Clinton issued a statement acknowledging the ""period of national mourning"" in North Korea. ""We are deeply concerned with the well being of the North Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with them during these difficult times,"" the statement said. ""It is our hope that the new leadership of the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) will choose to guide their nation onto the path of peace by honoring North Korea's commitments, improving relations with its neighbors and respecting the rights of its people,"" Clinton said. ""The United States stands ready to help the North Korean people and urges the new leadership to work with the international community to usher in a new era of peace, prosperity and lasting security on the Korean Peninsula."" Earlier, Christopher Hill, a former U.S. diplomat who led U.S. delegation in nuclear talks with North Korea, said any American statement would require a certain finesse. ""I'd be very careful about issuing condolences on the death of someone who's really been part and parcel of one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world,"" Hill told CNN. ""On the other hand, I think something can be done that will show some sympathy to the North Koreans."" This Just In: Up-to-the minute news on the death of Kim Jong Il . The deceased leader's body will remain for a week at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang, where his father is also interred. Memorial services will follow on December 28 and 29. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has visited North Korea eight times, said his initial reaction to Kim's death was ""extreme concern."" He said he is more concerned about stability in the region now than before Kim's death. ""The peninsula is a tinderbox,"" said Richardson, who has brokered diplomatic deals in the North. ""The issue is, will there be stability in the North Korean leadership? Will they continue their recent efforts of engaging South Korea and the United States over food aid, over nuclear talks?"" Richardson said South Korea was right to go on alert -- ""but I think now's the time to just lie low, watch things as they develop."" iReport: Send us your reaction . During Kim's tenure, the North was largely closed off to outside influences and fearful of threats from its neighbors. At the same time, it also sought international aid after extensive famines contributed to the deaths of at least 250,000 people, according to the North Korean government. Outside analysts suggested the toll could have been 10 times higher. Both North Korea and South Korea have shown signs of concession in recent years. But relations between the two rival nations soured yet again when the South accused the North of launching an attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. And South Korea says a North Korean torpedo attack was to blame for the 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, which left 46 Southern sailors dead. The North has denied the accusation. Now the question is what path his untested son, believed to be either 27 or 28, will take the country. He was educated in Switzerland as a boy, and named a four-star general in 2010. ""We really don't know substantively where he stands on anything,"" said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute. Kim Young-mok said the North has built up its military and pursued a nuclear bomb ""while children are starving."" ""This causes a lot of human disasters,"" he said. ""So what worries me is not this Kim Jong Un's personality, but the priority of the North Korean leadership."" After the Cheonan incident, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he feared the younger Kim may have needed to ""earn his stripes"" with Pyongyang's military establishment by launching further provocations. And Hill said while the ""great successor"" is ""definitely not ready for prime time,"" he is unlikely to take major steps before consolidating his power. ""I think we're kind of shifting, at least for the time being, to a sort of military junta,"" he said, adding, ""I would expect that they will try to show a maximum of stability as they go through what's obviously going to be a very difficult and dicey time for them.""

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee juror's laudatory Facebook message to a medical examiner during a murder trial could nullify the jury's conviction of William Darelle Smith, the state's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court did not immediately throw out the first-degree murder conviction of Smith, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2010. But in concluding the trial judge erred upon learning of the juror's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness, state justices unanimously decided a new trial may be necessary unless the state proves the juror shouldn't have been disqualified. ""If, for any reason, the trial court is unable to conduct a full and fair hearing with regard to juror (Glenn Scott) Mitchell's improper extrajudicial communication with Dr. Lewis, then the trial court shall grant Mr. Smith a new trial,"" the Supreme Court ruled, referring to the juror by name, as well as Dr. Adele Lewis, the medical examiner who testified. The Davidson County, Tennessee, District Attorney's Office did not have an immediate reaction Wednesday to the ruling. Smith's public defender declined to comment. A county grand jury indicted Smith in the death of Zurisaday Villanueva, whose body was found June 4, 2007, off a Nashville road along with two .9 millimeter shell casings. The two had been living together, according to court documents. Smith went on trial in March 2010. After the jury was set, jurors were told by the judge they ""should not talk with any witnesses, defendants or attorneys involved in this case."" Testimony followed, including from Smith's cousin, who said the defendant told her a pistol ""went off"" while he and Villanueva were arguing and again when Smith was trying to move Villanueva's body. The prosecution also presented evidence indicating Villanueva's blood was in an automobile driven by Smith and owned by his father. The second-to-last person to testify for the prosecution was Lewis, a Vanderbilt-trained assistant medical examiner. She conducted an autopsy on Villanueva and classified her death as a homicide, saying Villanueva was shot in the chest and the back of the head. The next day, about an hour after the jury began deliberating on Smith's fate, Lewis e-mailed presiding Judge Seth Norman that she had been contacted via Facebook by a juror who was an acquaintance. ""A-dele!!"" the juror wrote, according to the e-mail included in the state Supreme Court ruling. ""I thought you did a great job today on the witness stand. ... I was in the jury ... not sure if you recognized me or not!! You really explained things so great!!"" Lewis responded by saying she thought she recognized the juror, then warned of ""a risk of a mistrial if that gets out."" The juror wrote back that he was aware of the risk, saying he hadn't mentioned he knew Lewis. The first time the juror-witness communication came up in official court proceedings was after the verdict was delivered, but before sentencing. That's when public defender Mike Engle asked if the court asked the juror about the exchange, to which the judge replied, ""No, I'm satisfied with the communication that I have gotten with Dr. Lewis with regard to this matter."" Smith later asked for a new trial, in part because the defense wasn't allowed to question the juror. The trial court ruled against him, as did a state appeals court that characterized the Facebook communication as ""mere interactions"" and noted it is up to the court to decide if a juror is impartial. The state Supreme Court's ruling on Wednesday overruled those decisions. Stressing that ""the public's confidence in the fairness of the system"" requires that all jurors be held ""accountable to the highest standards of conduct,"" the justices said the trial court should have taken ""steps to assure that the juror has not been exposed to extraneous information or has not been improperly influenced."" In Smith's trial, this could have been addressed at a hearing at that time or a ""full-scale investigation,"" the court said. Neither occurred, leading the state Supreme Court to send the case back to the trial court for a hearing on the Facebook communication and the jurors' impartiality. Conversations between jurors and people involved in a case have long been forbidden in state law. But the court admits that technology -- including the Internet, which allows jurors to conduct research and more readily communicate -- has complicated matters. ""Even though technology has made it easier for jurors to communicate with third parties and has made these communications more difficult to detect, our pre-Internet precedents provide appropriate (guidelines),"" the ruling states. The state court also said trial courts need to ""give jurors specific, understandable instructions that prohibit extrajudicial communications with third parties and the use of technology to obtain facts that have not been presented as evidence."" ""Trial courts should clearly prohibit jurors' use of devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to access social media websites or applications to discuss, communicate, or research anything about the trial,"" the court said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","William Darelle Smith went on trial in 2010 for first-degree murder .

"(CNN) -- A large turkey unexpectedly arrived at a New Jersey home one morning in August, but the homeowner wasn't giving any thanks. Huddled in her bedroom, Marie Manco, 70, was instead calling the police about the live intruder, which had entered her home by flying through a second-floor window. ""A wild turkey came through my skylight and it's flying around my house right now, destroying everything! I'm in my bedroom, but I'm afraid to come out,"" a frightened Manco told the 911 operator. ""I just hear a banging, and it's just destroying my whole house!"" Police arrived at her Kinnelon home shortly after and observed that a large window had been broken above the front door. When officers went in with a blanket to catch the turkey, it ran off into the kitchen and smashed through a 5-by-5-foot picture window, according to Sgt. David Crouthamel of the Kinnelon Police Department. Police said that the turkey was ""one of the biggest birds"" they've ever seen. When one officer, who is nearly 6 feet tall, attempted to grab it, it came up to his hip, Crouthamel said. The giant gobbler proved to be no chicken when it trashed Manco's home, leaving an estimated $6,000 to $7,000 in damages before trotting away. Three large windows were shattered, walls were cracked, and the floor was littered with feces, broken glass and feathers, according to police. Manco was home alone at the time of the incident and remains shaken up. ""Violated. I felt violated. And frightened. And I'm still frightened,"" Manco told CNN affiliate WCBS. Police believe that the bird saw its reflection in the window glass and became aggressive. Turkeys are not able to recognize their own image and will respond to a reflection as they would to an intruding or competing turkey, according to the New Jersey Wildlife Control Operators Association. ""It's mating season for turkeys, and we're attributing the aggression to that,"" Lt. John Schwartz told WCBS. Manco has been having difficulty getting her insurance to cover the damage to her home, police say. While police took photos of some turkeys in the surrounding area, the ""suspect"" is still at large.","A wild turkey busted a window in a New Jersey house and wreaked havoc .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Additional police officers were patrolling Los Angeles International Airport and two other airports Wednesday after a former Transportation Security Administration employee was accused of making a false threat against LAX, authorities said. The beefed-up patrols were also a precaution on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, police said. The two other airports are LA/Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, and Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles, police said. ""In light of recent events at Los Angeles International Airport involving a disgruntled former airport worker and the 9/11 anniversary tragedy, Los Angeles Airport police has enhanced the deployment of uniformed officers in and around LAX, Ontario and Van Nuys airports. ""Officers will be highly visible on foot, bikes, motors, in patrol vehicles and managing traffic,"" Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick M. Gannon said in a statement provided by his spokeswoman. ""The safety and security of the traveling public, employees and visitors is our priority and we encourage the traveling public to report all suspicious activity. If you see something say something, security is everybody's business,"" Gannon said. Nna Alpha Onuoha, a former Transportation Security Administration employee, made his initial appearance in a federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon to face a count of making a false threat and a count of making threats against interstate commerce, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. At the request of Deputy Federal Public Defender Samuel Josephs, the detention hearing was continued until Monday at noon PT, Mrozek said. The two charges together carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, he said. Onuoha, 29, of Inglewood, California, is a former screener with the TSA at LAX, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. On Tuesday afternoon, the FBI received information from the TSA confirming that Onuoha had resigned from his position with the agency, which he had held since 2006, Eimiller said. He was suspended between July 21 and July 27 after he reportedly told a 15-year-old girl that she should ""cover up,"" according to an FBI affidavit filed in court. After his resignation Tuesday, Onuoha allegedly left a package at TSA's LAX headquarters addressed to a TSA employee, the FBI said. A bomb squad with Los Angeles Police inspected the package, Eimiller said. It didn't hold explosives, but it did contain an eight-page letter in which Onuoha expressed his thoughts about the incident that led to his suspension and disdain for the United States, among other opinions, Eimiller said. Later in the day, a man believed to be Onuoha contacted the TSA by telephone, instructing an employee to ""begin evacuating certain terminals at the airport,"" Eimiller said in a statement. The caller told the employee that he would ""be watching"" to see if TSA was evacuating the terminals as he instructed, the FBI said. A second phone call was received by TSA from a male caller, also believed to have been Onuoha, who again advised the TSA employee that specific terminals at LAX should be evacuated, the FBI said. Police cleared the terminals, but no threats were found, the FBI said. At Onuoha's apartment, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force found a note taped inside a closet containing an unspecified threat citing the 9/11 anniversary. The handwritten message said: ""09/11/2013 THERE WILL BE FIRE! FEAR! FEAR! FEAR!"" according to the FBI affidavit filed in court. After waiving his Miranda rights, Onuoha told the FBI that the note referred to how he intended to start preaching in the streets on September 11, 2013, court papers said. He also told the FBI that he didn't intend for the statements in the phone calls to LAX to be threats. Onuoha was arrested outside Los Angeles, in Riverside, California, by task force members assisted by Riverside police, authorities said.","NEW: Ex-TSA employee leaves note: ""09/11/2013 THERE WILL BE FIRE!

"(CNN) -- Wearing a floppy hat, 3-year-old Thor does his best rendition of a rocket launch countdown, ""three, two, one, zero -- blast off"" and jumps up in the air next to a Florida launchpad where NASA rockets have blasted off for more than 50 years. Apollo missions took the first men to the moon, space shuttles carried the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station into space -- all on rockets taking off from two launchpads at Kennedy Space Center, an hour east of Orlando. Thor, his twin brother, Espen, and his mother, Diane, are on a tour inside launchpad 39A's security fence at Kennedy -- something that has never been allowed in the history of the space center -- until now. The Launch Pad Tour, introduced in July, is one of three new rare-access tours being offered this year to celebrate Kennedy Space Center's 50th anniversary. In addition to getting an up-close look at the launchpad, visitors can also tour the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Launch Control Center with a space expert guide. ""Are you a space nut or were you forced to accompany one?"" a tour guide asks laughing guests on a bus taking them to the space center recently for one of the new tours. Photos: Earth's otherworldy landscapes . Space nut or not, you'll be amazed by the size of the Vehicle Assembly Building -- or VAB, if you want to sound like a NASA aficionado. The rocket hanger is one of the largest enclosed spaces in the world. The 525-foot-tall building with the huge NASA logo and American flag painted on the side can be seen for miles on the ground and in the air -- look for it while flying over central Florida. Built in the 1960s, the hanger was designed to handle the assembling of huge Saturn V rocket segments during the Apollo missions. Later the space shuttle program used the assembly building to attach the shuttles to a large orange external fuel tank and two white rockets used during launch. Once inside the large cavernous building, look up to the ceiling where shuttle mission banners filled with the signatures of the personnel who worked on those missions hang from support beams. As an added bonus, the shuttle Atlantis is parked inside the Vehicle Assembly Building just behind a fence only 25 feet away -- for now. The retired Atlantis is waiting to receive final preparations for public display. ""It's awesome to see it in real life,"" said Chris Finlay, 30, from New Castle, England, who was on vacation in Florida for three weeks. ""It's not something you get to see every day."" Mars landing went 'flawlessly,' scientists say . NASA says Atlantis will be moved to a shuttle hanger on August 16 -- switching places with shuttle Endeavour, which will remain inside the assembly building until mid-September when it will be transported to the California Science Center in Los Angeles for permanent public display. Atlantis will be back in the VAB briefly before it moves to its new permanent home at the visitor complex. Still under construction, the new facility is expected to open to the public in July 2013. Next to the tall Vehicle Assembly Building is the much smaller Launch Control Center with large windows looking to the east toward the launchpad. The control center is open to visitors for the first in more than 30 years. Control center tours visit Firing Room 4, where Apollo and shuttle managers directed launches. ""There's a lot of responsibility in this room. It's not just one person who launches a space shuttle,"" said tour guide Rob English, pointing to a photo of the launch room that describes how the team works together. ""You'll feel the energy when you walk in this room,"" said English as the security officer opened the door. Mars images from NASA's ""Curiosity"" Rover . Inside, workstations line the room with labels for each position's area of responsibility on top -- from Main Engines to Electrical Systems. At the front, overlooking the room, is the workspace labeled Launch Director. Don't expect to see a launch button. Computers have launched rockets for years, though managers can override them. Next to work spaces for the launch director and the public affairs officer are large windows overlooking the launchpad. ""This is the window on mankind's future right here,"" says English, the guide, as we look out toward the launchpads, which appear much closer than three miles from the control center. During the Launch Pad Tour, guests step out of a bus inside the last high barbwire fence surrounding the launchpad. The massive jumble of metal service structures used during the shuttle program sit on top of a white concrete mound. Bill Jackson, a middle school science teacher who just moved to Florida from St. Louis, was glad for the opportunity to see the space center up close. ""Finally getting to see all the things that I told the kids about and my own children about for 50 years ... it's amazing,"" said Jackson. Searching for life on the moons of Jupiter . His friend Lila Steinhoff recalls watching launches as a girl on small black and white televisions. ""I'm seeing it in person. It's wonderful,"" said Steinhoff. Jackson agreed, ""It's better, you saw those grainy black and white pictures and something over Walter Cronkite's shoulder and now it's real."" The new tours are expected to run through the end of December 2012 and possibly into 2013. Each of the three tours costs an additional $25 for adults and $19 for children ages 3 to 11 beyond the entrance fee to the Kennedy Space Visitor Center, which is $45 for adults and $35 for children.","Up-close tours mark 50th anniversary of Kennedy Space Center .

"(CNN) -- Annie Leibovitz on Monday defended her provocative photograph for Vanity Fair magazine of teen heartthrob Miley Cyrus -- aka Hannah Montana -- who has expressed embarrassment about the pose. ""I'm sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted,"" the celebrity photographer said in a written statement. ""Miley and I looked at fashion photographs together and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it. The photograph is a simple, classic portrait, shot with very little makeup, and I think it is very beautiful."" The statement came a day after the 15-year-old apologized to her fans for her participation in the photo shoot, which took place February 9 in Calabasas, California. ""My goal in my music and my acting is always to make people happy,"" Cyrus said in a written statement. ""For Vanity Fair, I was so honored and thrilled to work with Annie. ""I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. The pictures of me on the Internet were silly, inappropriate shots. ""I appreciate all the support of my fans and hope they understand that along the way I am going to make mistakes and I am not perfect. ""I never intended for any of this to happen and I am truly sorry if I have disappointed anyone. Most of all, I have let myself down. I will learn from my mistakes and trust my support team. My family and my faith will guide me through my life's journey."" Vanity Fair spokeswoman Beth Kseniak also defended the pictures, which are posted on the magazine's Web site and are being published in the June issue. ""Miley's parents and/or minders were on the set all day,"" Kseniak said in a written statement. ""Since the photo was taken digitally, they saw it on the shoot and everyone thought it was a beautiful and natural portrait of Miley. In fact, when [Vanity Fair writer] Bruce Handy interviewed Miley, he asked her about the photo and she was very cheerful about it and thought it was perfectly fine."" But the publicist for Cyrus said her parents departed at the end of the day, prior to the pictures being taken and did not see any digital pictures. Cyrus stars as an ordinary teenager with a double life as a rock star on the Disney Channel's ""Hannah Montana."" The channel says ""Hannah Montana"" is the top-rated cable television show for children ages 6 to 14, reaching more than 164 million viewers around the world. One of Leibovitz's pictures shows a topless Cyrus clutching a blanket to her chest, her back exposed, looking toward the camera over one shoulder. A caption reads: ""Um, was Cyrus -- or Disney -- at all anxious about this shot?"" It then quotes Cyrus as saying: ""No, I mean I had a blanket on. And I thought, 'This looks pretty, and really natural.' I think it's really artsy."" The magazine refers to the ""topless but demure portrait"" as Leibovitz's idea and quotes Cyrus as saying, ""It wasn't in a skanky way. ... And you can't say no to Annie. She's so cute. She gets this puppy dog look and you're like, 'O.K.' "" A Disney Channel spokesman, Patti McTeague, said in a statement released Sunday that the photos were meant to sell magazines. ""Unfortunately, as the article suggests, a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines,"" she said. The incident underscores the polarities that exist in society about how to view sexuality among girls -- repress it or exploit it, said Gigi Durham, author of ""The Lolita Effect."" ""Neither is healthy,"" she said. Though the photographs are ""artistically very beautiful,"" the magazine is ""exploiting her body for profit,"" she said. ""I have certain qualms about exploiting girls' sexuality in this way,"" she said. ""She's young and ought to be able to explore her sexual self without a commercial emphasis being put on it."" That is not to say that nudity or sex is bad, she said. Even teens ought to be able to express themselves sexually, she added. But, ""within the commercial context, it becomes sexuality for profit, which is an entirely different issue."" Cyrus completed a 70-date tour this year that sold out venues nationwide, starred in a movie that ranked number one in February and saw two albums rocket toward the top of the charts. This is not the first time Leibovitz's work has raised eyebrows. She shot a 1980 photograph of a nude John Lennon hugging his clothed wife, Yoko Ono, that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and two cover shots for Vanity Fair of actress Demi Moore, one showing the nude actress seven months pregnant, the other showing the nude actress with a suit painted on her body.

"(CNN) -- It says it all when Europe turns to China for a bailout. That was what happened last week when the man in charge of the European Financial Stability Fund flew to Beijing to see if he could interest Chinese investors in propping up the finances of the eurozone. How the mighty are fallen. Thirty-five years ago the average German was roughly 15 times richer than the average Chinese. Today the ratio is less than 3-to-1. Back in 1980 the Chinese economy accounted for just 2.2% of global economic output, one third the size of Germany's share. By 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund, the Chinese share will be 18%, six times larger than Germany's. We are living through an extraordinary reversal of economic fortunes after 500 years when the big story was what historians call ""the great divergence."" Beginning in 1500, Europeans and European settlers in North America began to get richer than Asians (and everyone else, too). The gap between the ""West and the Rest"" widened at an accelerating rate until the later 1970s. But then -- on our watch -- that trend went into high-speed reverse. Watch Niall Ferguson's TED talk . So what has been going on? The West first surged ahead of the rest thanks to a series of institutional innovations that I call the ""killer applications"": . 1. Competition. Europe was politically fragmented into multiple monarchies and republics, which were in turn internally divided into competing corporate entities, among them the ancestors of modern business corporations. 2. The Scientific Revolution. All the major 17th-century breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry and biology happened in Western Europe. 3. The rule of law and representative government. An optimal system of social and political order emerged in the English-speaking world, based on private-property rights and the representation of property owners in elected legislatures. 4. Modern medicine. Nearly all the major 19th- and 20th-century breakthroughs in health care were made by Western Europeans and North Americans. 5. The consumer society. The Industrial Revolution took place where there was both a supply of productivity-enhancing technologies and a demand for more, better and cheaper goods, beginning with cotton garments. 6. The work ethic. Westerners were the first people in the world to combine more extensive and intensive labor with higher savings rates, permitting sustained capital accumulation. For hundreds of years, these killer apps were essentially monopolized by Europeans and their overseas cousins in North America and Australasia. Westerners not only grew richer than ""Resterners."" They grew taller, healthier and longer-lived. They also grew more powerful. By the early 20th century, just a dozen Western empires -- including the United States -- controlled 58% of the world's land surface and population, and a staggering 74% of the global economy. TED.com: Does democracy stifle economic growth? Beginning with Japan, however, one non-Western society after another has worked out that these apps can be downloaded and installed in non-Western operating systems. That explains about half the catching up that we have witnessed in our lifetimes, especially since the onset of economic reforms in China in 1978. The other half is explained by our tendency to delete the secrets of our own success. Ask yourself: Who's got the work ethic now? The average South Korean works about 39% more hours per week than the average American. The school year in South Korea is 220 days long, compared with 180 days here. The consumer society? Did you know that 26 of the 30 biggest shopping malls in the world are now in emerging markets, mostly in Asia? Only three are in the United States. Modern medicine? Well, we certainly outspend everyone else. But the results in terms of public health are pretty miserable. The rule of law? For a real eye-opener, take a look at the latest World Economic Forum Executive Opinion Survey. On no fewer than 15 of 16 different issues relating to property rights and governance, the United States fares worse than Hong Kong. TED.com: Joseph Nye on global power shifts . What about science? Statistics from the World Intellectual Property Organization show that already more patents originate in Japan than in the United States, that South Korea overtook Germany to take third place in 2005, and that China is poised to overtake Germany, too. Finally, there's competition, the original killer app that sent the fragmented West down a completely different path from monolithic imperial China. Well, the World Economic Forum has conducted a comprehensive global competitiveness survey every year since 1979. Since the current methodology was adopted in 2004, the U.S. average competitiveness score has fallen from 5.82 to 5.43, one of the steepest declines among developed economies. China's score, meanwhile, has leapt up from 4.29 to 4.9. Hands up readers who thought the future would, like an iPhone, be designed in California and only assembled in China? You were wrong. Western predominance is ending on our watch. And it's ending not just because the rest of the world finally figured out how to download our killer apps. It's ending because we deleted them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Niall Ferguson.","Niall Ferguson: For 500 years, the West had enormous economic advantage .

"(CNN) -- He's the strongman behind the strongman: Maher al-Assad. The younger brother of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Maher al-Assad is described by analysts as someone even more ruthless than Bashar. ""Maher is the kneecapper. He is in charge of keeping the regime in power,"" said Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma. It's a role he seemingly relishes. One analyst who has been in meetings with Maher described him as wearing a dark suit, sunglasses and slicked-back hair: a ""Mafia wanna-be."" ""This fellow thinks of himself as the family enforcer,"" said Ted Kattouf, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria. Officially, Maher is in charge of two of Syria's most elite military units: The army's Fourth Armored Division and the Republican Guard. But he is also a leader of the Shabiha militia, a group of regime enforcers made up of mostly of minority Alawite Muslims, the same sect the Assads belong to. The Shabiha, Syrian analysts say, has not only become a key part of the regime's fight against the uprising, but has also been responsible for massacres of Syrian civilians. ""Maher has been at the forefront of the most brutal fighting,"" Landis said. Man of mystery . Maher is as shadowy as he is allegedly brutal. ""We know precious little about him,"" said Landis. He is rarely seen in public. He moves around regularly and avoids speaking on the phone. Very few photographs of him exist, and most of those were taken when he had to appear in 2000 at the funeral of his father, Hafez al-Assad. Some of that mystery may be an effort to keep him alive, according to Landis. He is Bashar's last surviving brother. Even his current physical condition is unclear. Many believe he was injured, maybe even losing a leg, during an attack on a Syrian national security meeting in 2012. Others believe the attack may have paralyzed his arm. He hasn't been seen publicly since. With secrecy comes legend. One of the most widely circulated stories about Maher involves his sister, Bushra, who wanted to marry a man who had children from a previous marriage. While the entire family was scandalized by the marriage, it was Maher who reportedly shot his future brother-in-law in the stomach during an argument. The story, widely reported but never confirmed, is indicative of his overall character, Kattouf said. ""What the story does tell us is that he's impulsive, impetuous and brutal."" They are qualities that seem to have only improved his reputation. While Bashar seeks to portray a positive image with the Syrian public, ""everyone sees (Maher) as one of the major powers behind the throne who can do the dirty work,"" Landis said . 'An ""Entertainment Tonight"" kind of guy' But Maher also has more mundane interests beyond keeping his brother in power, according to Kattouf. In meetings with Arab officials, Maher has been described as quiet and uninterested in politics and current affairs. ""No matter what they brought up, he showed no interest, it was only when they started talking about gossip about Arab actresses and singers and who was sleeping with who, that's then he was into it. He's an 'Entertainment Tonight' kind of guy,"" Kattouf said. That might be just fine with his brother Bashar, who seems to value family loyalty above an interest in world affairs. Bashar has intentionally installed relatives in key positions in an attempt to ""coup-proof"" his regime, according to Landis. Bashar has apparently found the perfect family member to do just that. ""Maher sees himself as the protector of the regime,"" said Kattouf. ""He's an ugly, ugly guy.","Maher al-Assad is younger brother of the Syrian president .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's the biggest storyline heading into next year's midterm elections: Will Republicans succeed in taking control of the U.S. Senate? Republicans argue that an announcement over the weekend vastly improves their chances. Democrats vehemently disagree. The news from Montana's former Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer. The man known for his signature bolo tie said he would not run for Senate next year, as many Democrats had expected. Schweitzer captured nearly two-thirds of the vote in his 2008 re-election as governor of the red state and was seen by many as the best chance for the party to keep the seat of retiring Sen. Max Baucus blue. Schweitzer has recently faced potentially damaging stories about his ties to a political nonprofit group and its disclosure practices. But sources said that may have just been the tip of the iceberg when it came to opposition research Schweitzer may have faced had he decided to launch a Senate bid. But Schweitzer denied that impacted his decision. ""This isn't my first rodeo,"" he told The Associated Press. Schweitzer won't run for Senate in 2014 . A Republican source said Schweitzer's decision is a ""sea change in the 2014 atmosphere."" ""Winning the majority is something we've always thought not only possible, but our mission and bar for success, yet many others remained skeptical -- particularly donors and the pundit class,"" said the source, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. ""This development starts to break through that wall and crumple the belief that a Republican majority is out of reach."" Next year, the Democrats will try to maintain their majority in the Senate, where they currently hold a 54-46 edge (including two Independents who caucus with the party) over the GOP. They hope to expand that to 55-45 following October's special Senate election in New Jersey, which they are favored to win. But they most likely will be defending 21 of 35 seats up for grabs in November 2014. Besides Montana, Republicans are also optimistic about capturing seats in two other states that vote red in presidential elections: neighboring South Dakota, where Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson is not running for re-election; and West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller is retiring. If the GOP captures Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, it only needs three more seats to reach the magic number of 51. Republican eyes are focused on four Democrats facing tough battles next year: Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, and Mark Begich of Alaska. Take three of those four races and the Republicans will do what they couldn't do in 2010 and 2012: Win back the majority. ""We are in a strong position not only to win in Montana, but national pundits are now beginning to recognize something that we've been saying since February: Republicans are positioned to win the Senate majority in 2014,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring said in an e-mail on Monday. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee deputy executive director Matt Cantor disagrees. ""Republicans have been feeling good about their chances in the U.S. Senate for six years and they're still in the minority,"" Cantor told CNN. ""The math still strongly favors Democrats and so does history. Democratic incumbent senators are very tough to beat. Only three Democratic incumbents have lost re-election in a decade."" Sources say that recent stories about Schweitzer were just the tip of the iceberg when it came to opposition research he might have faced if he had launched a Senate bid. ""Democrats and Republicans agree on Schweitzer: There was a treasure trove of opposition research. It's highly unlikely that his candidacy would have been successful,"" said a Democratic source who asked for anonymity in order to speak more candidly. ""Now we have a list of prospects, and while there's no question that they begin as underdogs in a red state, Democrats are better off with a candidate that can win rather than a candidate that would self-combust before the 2014 elections."" But Schweitzer had statewide name recognition that no other Democrat may be able to match, said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""Republicans have a narrow path to the Senate majority in 2014, but it got a little wider when Schweitzer decided not to run,"" Gonzales said. ""We still don't know who the candidates will be, but Schweitzer was a proven vote-getter with nearly universal name identification. No Democrat will start from the same place he would have. Democrats can win in Republican-leaning states, but it takes someone with proven independence from the national party. We'll see if Democrats can find that candidate."" Democrats are also defending retirements in Iowa, where Sen. Tom Harkin is not running for a sixth term, and Michigan, where Sen. Carl Levin is not bidding for a seventh term. As of now, both of those seats appear to be safer for the Democrats. The two Republican retirements are in states that appear to be safe for the GOP: Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, although Democrats think an ugly primary in Georgia could lead to a very conservative nominee who would be beatable in the general election. The only other seat Democrats hope to put in play is in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's running for a sixth-term, is facing a challenge from Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.","Former Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer decides he won't run for Senate .
Schweitzer was a favorite because of name recognition and electoral success in red state .
Recent reports have tied Schweitzer to nonprofit group with questions about practices .

"(CNN) -- China warned the United States Thursday that a multi-billion dollar arms sales to Taiwan will create ""severe obstacles"" between Beijing and Washington, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. ""The wrongdoing by the U.S. side will inevitably undermine bilateral relations as well as exchanges and cooperation in military and security areas,"" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said, according to Xinhua. Zhang summoned U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke to lodge a protest. The $5.3 billion arms package includes upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet, a five year extension of F-16 pilot training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and spare parts for the upkeep of three different planes currently in use by the Taiwanese, according to State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. The deal is part of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. ""We firmly believe that our arms sales to Taiwan contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" she said. Chinese officials asked the U.S. to end military relations with Taiwan and work with the Chinese to safeguard Sino-U.S. relations, Xinhua reported. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province. Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a communist uprising proved victorious in 1949. The Taiwan Strait separates the mainland from the island. ""China strongly urges the United States to be fully aware of the high sensitivity and serious harm of the issue, seriously treat the solemn stance of China, honor its commitment and immediately cancel the wrong decision,"" Zhang said. In 1979, the United States carried out its ""one China"" policy by switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. But the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the United States to help defend the island if needed. The United States also is Taiwan's main arms supplier. Beijing broke off military contacts with Washington last year to protest another arms sale to Taiwan. The sale included more than $6 billion in Patriot missiles, Black Hawk helicopters and communications equipment, which Taiwan said it needed for self defense.","The United States is selling $5.3 billion worth of arms to Taiwan .

"(CNN) -- Dreaming of Africa is one way that Prince William escapes from the stresses he faces as the future king of Britain. ""I regularly daydream,"" The Duke of Cambridge reveals in the documentary ""Prince William's Passion: New Hope, New Father."" ""Africa is definitely one of the places I go to ... I have hundreds of animals on my iPhone. So if I am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket,"" he says. This may sound like a small, even trivial, detail but it's a thought that may one day help define the British monarchy. ""It takes you back instantly to the (African) bush. And it does completely settle me down."" Prince William will one day be king, and he's acutely aware of the responsibility that comes with that; it weighs heavily on his thoughts. And even before he takes on that mantle, he's grappling with the often unwelcome attentions of the world media. Everything he does, or is rumored to do, makes a headline, somewhere. His fame has only been compounded by his choice of wife and the birth of his heir, Prince George. Catherine makes first public appearance since royal baby was born . There's no suggestion that Prince William would ever drop out of public life, but he does crave normality. He needs a dose of it every now and then to cope with the maelstrom that surrounds him. The prince gets some of that normality from his role in the military where he's treated as ""one of the guys,"" but he also gets it from Africa. For William, Africa provides an escape that helps with his royal work back home: ""Its escaping to a kind of different world where I am just who I normally am anyway, and I can let that side, that sort of slightly immature, silly person come out a bit more than I normally do."" He enjoys the lack of airs and graces: ""There's not sycophants or anything like that. You're very much treated as one of the team, and if you're not pulling your weight, you're told to man-up and get on with it."" Prince William told me Africa first got under his skin during a trip to Kenya when he was 17. He saw an elephant that had been darted: ""It just blew my mind really. It was being that close to something so huge, something so majestic and part of nature's great wonders, and again its vulnerability, it was lying in the middle of the road just breathing away with its ears flapped over its eyes to shut it from the sun."" That experience, he says, made him realize how powerful we are as humans, and ever since he's wanted to do what he can to protect Africa and its wildlife. This drive has culminated in his support for the Tusk Conservation Awards which were set up to recognize outstanding achievement in conservation on the continent. Soon after his first visit to Africa, William heard about Tusk and became its patron in 2005. He supports the charity by visiting its conservation projects in Africa and by attending fundraising events on their behalf. The charity was one of the first patronages he took on. If you're in any doubt about his connection to the cause, watch as he comes close to tears talking about Edwin Kinyanjui, who risks his life every day in the fight against elephant poachers. Fatherhood has strengthened William's resolve: ""Suddenly you start thinking of like, wow, there is stuff you want to safeguard for the future. I've always believed it, but to actually really feel it as well, it's coming through powerfully now as well."" For William, Africa is a very emotional place. He told me he likes to watch the sun set with a rum, reminiscing. His mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, is never far from his thoughts. ""What I am doing in Africa is probably not as obviously, visually if you like, related to what she did. But helping communities, and helping Africans, as she has done, and did with communities over in the UK, and around the world ... it's about helping the needy and the vulnerable."" His personal connection with Africa was sealed when he got engaged to Kate Middleton in Kenya in 2010. He told me it felt appropriate: ""I didn't really plan it that far in advance, like I just knew I wanted it to feel comfortable where I did it and I wanted it to mean something, other than just the act of getting engaged."" William says it just happened on that particular holiday: ""She understands what it means to me being in Africa, and my love of conservation."" The prince is already planning his next trip, once things settle down at home: ""I think as soon as George grows up a little bit more. I will be hung if I go now ... It's definitely a plan of mine to go back to Africa. I will always have Africa as a special place that I love to go back to.""","Dreaming of Africa is one way Prince William escapes from stresses he faces as future King of Britain .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong (CNN) -- Angel Lau adjusts her iridescent blue goggles over her cherubic face, steps to the edge of the pool and dives in head first. The 7-year-old is one of the lucky ones: Her mother enrolled her in private swim lessons since the age of 3. Many other young Hong Kongers are on lengthy wait lists as demand for public swimming lessons outstrips supply in a city that's surrounded by coastline -- yet a majority of residents can't swim, according to local water safety experts. ""It's really hard to get placed,"" says Candy Kwok, Angel's stay-at-home mother. ""I've got several friends who put their names in every year but they haven't been lucky."" ""And even if they get admitted, the classes are usually at the hottest time of the year. Public swimming pools are very crowded,"" adds Kwok, who send her daughter to Stanford Swim School. With an estimated 12,000 students across 21 pools, it's Hong Kong's largest private swimming institution. Hong Kong holds a lottery, what it calls a ballot system, for government-subsidized swimming lessons. Nearly 60,000 people applied for 47,000 swim spots in the most recent 2011-2012 year, according to the city's Leisure and Cultural Services Department. A one-hour session at Stanford costs about $15 for one hour, comparable to the cost for dance or piano lessons in this city. But publicly-backed lessons are a bargain -- a series of 10 one-hour sessions runs just $12 dollars. Hong Kong's failure to satisfy demand for public classes sets the stage for a private business opportunity. ""I would say about 40% of all parents who cannot enroll in the government's programs choose Stanford,"" says Howard Fung, Director of Stanford Swim School. ""And even if you are lucky and you get a chance to participate in the government program, you're not guaranteed to be allocated (a spot) in the next term."" A majority of Hong Kong's citizens can't swim, says Alex Kwok, General Secretary of the Hong Kong Kowloon Lifeguards Union. Founded in 1968, it's the city's oldest and largest such organization. ""I feel shocked,"" he says, ""because Hong Kong is surrounded by water and it's a big city."" This Chinese territory is made of more than 200 islands with 700 kilometers of coastline - more than the distance from London to Paris and double the distance from New York to Washington, D.C. Kwok, a lifeguard of a dozen years is well-known in Hong Kong's swim community and a vocal critic of the government. He estimates if the city's entire population of 7 million residents were thrown in the sea ""less than 20% can survive"". Howard Fung of Stanford Swim School thinks it is more nuanced than that. He believes 20% of Hong Kong's elderly can swim while that number jumps to between 40% and 50% for the city's youth. The Hong Kong government does not conduct surveys on the number of citizens who can swim. Regardless of numbers, Kwok blames Hong Kong society's emphasis on academics. ""Most Chinese, especially Hong Kongers, are not as focused on swimming or sports because they think it's useless. But I think this isn't right because children have to learn more things. You have to teach them how to survive in the water."" ""Stupid thinking."" he adds. ""I hope more parents can open their minds."" And the recent ferry collision - Hong Kong's most fatal water disaster in four decades - still hangs fresh on many minds. On October 1, amid fireworks for China's National Day holiday celebrating the founding of the People's Republic, 39 people died when two ferries collided. More than 100 passengers had been thrown into the sea. Watching the accident unfold, Angel's mother - who can't swim herself - had no doubt her daughter's time in the pool is well spent. ""Since Angel can swim, she won't panic and can save herself. I think her odds of surviving a water-related accident are double."" The Hong Kong government has since announced a nearly 7% expansion of public swim classes. But the Lifeguard Union's Alex Kwok is still critical. ""I don't think this is enough. Even if they increase (public classes by) 700% it is not enough for Hong Kong's children."" So for now, parents like Candy will go where the supply is -- at private schools -- if they can afford it. Those who cannot will have to hope their names will finally be chosen next year. CNN's Vivien Kam and Judy Zhu contributed to this report.","Waiting lists are long to get into public swimming lessons in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- The Tour de France remains one of the few prestigious events where spectators can almost reach out and touch the riders -- or throw urine on them as Mark Cavendish found out Wednesday. The British rider, who was absolved of any wrongdoing following a collision with Tom Veelers just 24 hours earlier, was the target of an angry fan as he rode through the 33 kilometer individual time trial between Avranches and Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy. Cycling fans are very much split over Cavendish -- with some unimpressed by his perceived arrogance and large ego, while others love his insatiable desire to win. Cavendish refused to speak about the incident after being doused with urine by an irate spectator during an afternoon which he will quickly want to forget. His Omega Pharm teammate Tony Martin won the 11th stage with Chris Froome retaining the yellow jersey, but it was Cavendish who was again in the limelight. ""It is disappointing to hear about one individual like that,"" Froome told reporters of the incident after extending his lead to three minutes and 25 seconds. ""That's one of the beauties of our sport. Anyone can come and watch at the side of the road and enjoy the excitement and really get close to the top riders in the world. ""Mark is one of the big characters in the sport, and some people love him, some people hate him. ""But to do something disrespectful like that, that's really sad. It ruins the whole atmosphere."" While it is thought to be the first time a cyclist has been assaulted in such a way during the Tour, there have been other instances where riders have been abused. In 1975, Eddy Merckx was punched in the kidneys during his quest to claim a sixth Tour victory, while Lance Armstrong was given bodyguards in 2004 after being subjected to death threats. Cavendish has endured a couple of miserable days, missing out on a 25th stage win on Tuesday, while slipping 103 points adrift of green jersey leader Peter Sagan. Meanwhile, Omega Pharm team manager Patrick Lefevere revealed that Cavendish was feeling 'sad' following the incident. ""I regret this, I always felt that cycling fans were gentlemen, enthusiastic people,"" he told reporters . ""Mark is sad, he's not upset, just sad. I cannot blame anyone, there are 100,000 or 200,000 people on the road, and one person decided to do this."" On the road, Martin claimed an expected victory in the time trial after finishing 12 seconds ahead of Froome. Martin, who had won his previous nine time trials in all competitions, finished the course with the third fastest time ever recorded on the Tour. But the German revealed he began to worry when Froome appeared to be challenging for victory. ""To be honest, I'd almost given up hope of the stage win,"" he told reporters. ""It was starting to look very disappointing when I saw Chris beat my times at the intermediate check. ""I nearly started to cry. I couldn't believe it. I expected that Froome might get to within 30 seconds or something like that but not beating me at the intermediates. ""Now I'm really happy and maybe it's nicer to win this way.""","Mark Cavendish has urine thrown at him during 11th stage of the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Frustrated that you can't share files the size of your entire music collection via e-mail? Google wants to help. Gmail users can now send files of up to 10 GB using Google Drive, the Web giant's cloud-storage service. That's 400 times bigger than files that can be shared in a regular e-mail, according to a blog post by Google's Gmail team. And because the files are stored in the cloud, all recipients will always have the latest version of the file -- in the case of a document that's being amended over time, for example. How a fake Google news story spread online . ""So whether it's photos from your recent camping trip, video footage from your brother's wedding, or a presentation to your boss, all your stuff is easy to find and easy to share with Drive and Gmail,"" the post reads. Drive, and before that Google Docs, already allowed users to share large files. But the new feature is more streamlined, letting them do so without leaving Gmail. Launched in April, Google Drive offers users 5 GB of free storage, with each additional 25 GB going for $2.49. The move is part of an ongoing effort by Google to synchronize its various services, from Gmail to social network Google Plus to the Android mobile operating system. The ability to sync with Gmail offers Google a built-in edge over standalone cloud storage tools like Dropbox. ""Should services like Dropbox be concerned? Sort of,"" wrote Ricardo Bilton of VentureBeat. ""As the move shows, Google's core strength is in its ability to connect and integrate its various services -- even the unpopular ones -- into one cohesive product. This gives Drive a clear edge over competing standalone cloud services, so expect Google to leverage it as much as possible."" The file-sharing feature will be rolled out over the next few days, according to Google. Users must have opted in to Gmail's ""Compose"" tool in order to use it. Google announced this year that Gmail has more than 425 million active users.","New Gmail tool allows sharing of files up to 10 GB .

"(CNN) -- A buzz ripples through the packed stadium as word quickly spreads: ""He's here."" The jostling crowd surges forward, camera phones held high to catch a glimpse of the superstar flanked by a dense entourage. But it's not an A-list actor or musician throwing the fans into a frenzy. Instead, a four-year-old horse called Frankel is about to make history by winning his 14th -- and final -- consecutive race. A sold-out crowd of 32,500 people watched Frankel win Champions Day at Ascot in October -- the highest number for an autumn flat racing event in Britain. It's a testament to the popularity of the celebrity colt who, much like Madonna, Prince or Beyonce, needs no last name. But it's also an indication of just how far horse racing has come in 2012. Changing perceptions . It's the second biggest spectator sport in Britain after football, with around 6 million people heading to the track every year. But the pomp and pageantry of racing -- think silly hats, freeflowing champagne and manicured gardens -- means that the general public has long viewed it as a fun day out, rather than a competitive sport. This year however, racing attracted a new audience who knew the names of horses, recognized industry heavyweights and understood the importance of big competitions. ""Probably the most amazing moment of the year was Frankel winning the Champion Stakes. You had 32,000 people all on their feet, cheering him on, it was just the most emotional moment,"" Simon Bazalgette, chief executive of The Jockey Club, said of the horse's last race. ""It's a bit of an eccentric world, horse racing. But once you understand the theater of it, once you know the big names, it becomes so much more enjoyable."" Rise of the celebrity horse . A lot of the hype was due to celebrity horses such as Frankel and Australia's Black Caviar, who remains unbeaten in 22 consecutive races and even appeared on the front cover of Vogue. These were champions of a caliber rarely seen in one generation, let alone competing at the peaks of their careers in the same year. In a new digital age, their fame was carefully cultivated. Marketing teams set up Twitter accounts, Facebook profiles, and pedaled merchandise online. And it seemed to work. Attendance at races starring Frankel were up 20% on last year. Similarly, a small army of Black Caviar fans -- draped in the horse's native Australian flag or salmon pink silks -- cheered on the mare to victory at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. However, the overall figure of 280,000 for all five days was down 14,000 from last year. Meanwhile, a record 130,000 punters attended the prestigious Epsom Derby in July, which launched Queen Elizabeth's official jubilee celebrations, making it the largest sports crowd in Britain in 2012. More people were also watching horse racing on TV, with 11 million tuning in to Britain's biggest competition, The Grand National -- up 2 million on last year. Dettori's shame . However, it wasn't a flawless year for racing. The sport's poster boy, Italian jockey Frankie Dettori, was given a six-month ban earlier this month after failing a drugs test in France. The three-time champion, who earlier announced the end of his long tenure with the Godolphin stable, said it was not a performance-enhancing substance. ""He's admitted it was a moment of madness,"" Bazalgette said. ""It's a shame. He's an important face in horse racing."" ""When it comes to talking to the media, jockeys are a bit of a challenge. These guys are living and breathing the sport, putting in a huge number of hours. They can be difficult to pin down."" Far better recognized were celebrity owners such as TV entertainers Ant and Dec, actress Judi Dench and Britain's Queen Elizabeth. Frankel's trainer Henry Cecil, who is battling cancer, was also ""hugely loved,"" Bazalgette added. Ladies' Day . One jockey not shying away from the camera this year was Canadian Chantal Sutherland. The 36-year-old made history after becoming the first woman to compete in the world's richest horse race, the $10 million Dubai World Cup, in March. But the model perhaps garnered more attention off the track for her naked photoshoot on a horse in Vanity Fair in June. Sutherland, who did much to raise the profile of female jockeys in a traditionally male-dominated sport, retired in October. Not just a pretty face, she had more than 900 wins in a career spanning 12 years. A weighty issue . Sutherland said she was now looking forward to ""cutting loose and having a cheeseburger or some pizza."" ""Those types of indulgences are not allowed when you constantly have to monitor your weight,"" she added. Jockeys are put under enormous pressure to meet miniature weight requirements, with sweat suits, saunas, hot baths and starvation are some of the methods used to keep trim. But some relief is in sight -- albeit slight -- after the British Horseracing Authority last month raised the minimum weight by two pounds to 8 stone (50 kg), from January next year. International highlights . Across the Atlantic, the winner of the United States' premier race, the Kentucky Derby, was denied the chance of a Triple Crown after being forced to retire ahead of the Belmont Stakes. I'll Have Another developed a foreleg injury that trainer Doug O'Neill described as ""freakish."" The three-year-old had been seeking to be the first horse in 34 years to win the treble, having triumphed at the 138th Kentucky showpiece in May and then the Preakness Stakes. Racing authorities also confirmed that the legendary Secretariat set a record time in winning the 1973 Preakness event, ending a controversy that had lasted almost four decades. In Australia, the Melbourne Cup was won by a home horse for the first time since 2009 as Green Moon headed off a strong field of ""international invaders."" France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was won by four-year-old filly Solemia, who denied Japan's Orfevre in his bid to become the first non-European trained victor. Danedream was unable to defend her title due to an outbreak of equine infectious anaemia at the racing yard in the German city of Cologne where she is trained. Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed celebrated as Mikael Barzalona rode Monterosso to victory in the the emirate's World Cup in April, but the result was somewhat overshadowed by the death of another Godolphin horse, Fox Hunt, in the inaugural Gold Cup held earlier in the meeting. Weathering the storm . The biggest challenge for the UK racing industry this year? The great British weather -- which forced the cancellation of 119 races up to the start of December. ""After the Diamond Jubilee weekend it didn't stop raining until the end of July,"" Bazalgette said. ""There was a good six weeks when we lost meetings."" Whatever the weather, the outlook looks bright for horse racing in 2013.","2012 is a big year in horse racing as 6 million people head to the track .

"New York (CNN) -- India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came away from talks at the White House reassured about U.S. policy in Asia, according to foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria. Singh and President Obama capped their talks with an elaborate state dinner in a tent at the White House Tuesday night, the first such occasion in Obama's presidency. Zakaria, who attended the formal event, told CNN the dinner was a success: ""My sense is there was a very warm feeling. The Indian prime minister was gushing and he's not a man who gushes."" U.S. and Indian officials spoke about the war in Afghanistan, just as Obama is expected to announce -- on Tuesday -- increased U.S. troop levels in the region. ""The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated,"" Singh said. ""President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism."" Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria: GPS"" spoke to CNN Wednesday about U.S.-India relations. CNN: What was India hoping to achieve in the talks? Fareed Zakaria: I think there are probably three things going on from India's point of view. One was to generally get a sense of whether Obama shares Bush's reorientation of American strategy in Asia to place a much greater importance on India and to place India at the center of the U.S. view of Asia. My feeling is that what they heard out of the Obama administration was very positive. And they had two specific goals in mind as well. They wanted to get the implementation of the U.S.-India nuclear deal started, so there could be a transfer of civilian nuclear technology to India. They heard some good things. But my sense is that the Obama administration is doing a broader review of the whole policy of technology transfer and is not going to do a special deal for India. CNN: Why is that so important for the Indian government? Zakaria: The Indians look at their [economic] growth rate and the single biggest problem for them ... is energy. They're a huge importer of oil. They're in a race to find cheap energy through nuclear power, and for that they need access to western technology. And finally there is the whole set of ""Afpak"" [Afghanistan and Pakistan] issues and they just wanted to get a sense from Obama that he's not going to withdraw from Afghanistan and that the Obama administration does not take on a Pakistani view of Afghanistan. On all fronts, my feeling is they were basically reassured. CNN: What's their fear about Afghanistan? Zakaria: Their fear is that the United States is desperate to get Pakistan to cooperate and in doing that is almost adopting Pakistan's concerns as their own concerns, accepting the Pakistani view that it's very difficult for Pakistan to go after the Afghan Taliban or LET [Lashkar-e-Taiba] which started the Mumbai attack. India's view is that it's not a question of capacity, it's a question of will. Secondly there's the Kashmir issue, which they want to maintain as a bilateral issue without intervention by any outside party. They have a legitimate concern about the Pakistanis not being willing to go after these forces. The Indians are concerned that the Americans not easily fall into trap that if only Kashmir were solved, then Pakistan will turn on all these militias that it created and has sustained for three decades. CNN: Why doesn't India want a third party involved in the Kashmir dispute? Zakaria: Basically there is no third party who the Indians trust enough. They feel China has always been pro-Pakistan. For the last 70 years, the U.S. has been mostly pro-Pakistan and sided against India in the last war. It sent the Seventh Fleet into the Bay of of Bengal. The Indians feel they are the dominant power on the ground, so why should they accept international mediation? They feel they are likely to get a better deal if they stick to their guns. India sees itself very strongly as a secular nation which accepts all religions, including Islam. It has the second largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia. For them to accept that because Kashmir has a majority of Muslims, it cannot be a part of India ... is antithetical to the national identity of the country. There's a lot of opposition in the government to letting Kashmir be bartered away. CNN: What were the goals on the American side? Zakaria: What the U.S. has been trying to do since the Clinton administration is to strategically reorient itself in Asia so it has much stronger relations with India and that it become India's closest ally among the major powers. The rise of China is altering the strategic balance in Asia, and by allying with India, the United States can in a very subtle way place some sort of check on the potential for Chinese expansion. There is also a powerful idealistic interest here, in seeing that the world's leading democracy and the world's largest democracy pair up. ... Clinton began this process, Bush powerfully accelerated it by taking off the table sanctions that were in place because India had nuclear weapons. So Obama is the third president continuing a strategic partnership with India. ...

"London, England (CNN) -- The London sun is high when the bare-chested young men step onto the carefully manicured pitch, draped in flowing red cloaks and several layers of colorful beads. A few years ago they hadn't even held a cricket ball, let alone played in a competitive match, yet here they are today, entering the game's most famous venue to a flurry of cheers. From a remote corner in Kenya to Lord's cricket ground in the UK, known as the spiritual home of cricket, it's been a long journey for the Maasai Cricket Warriors, a team of young tribesmen attending ""Last Man Stands,"" a global championship event for amateur squads from around the world. It all started six years ago thanks to the efforts of Aliya Bauer, a South African woman who'd gone to Kenya's Laikipia region to work on a primate research program. Whilst studying the behavior of baboons, Bauer was finding it hard to live without her big love: cricket. ""I was missing my passion and I just wanted to share it with others,"" says Bauer, who is now the team's coach. ""Cricket is a fabulous medium to build friendships and to engage people in a positive way."" 'Love for the game' Bauer then decided to introduce cricket to the local community. She brought some basic cricket equipment from South Africa and held a trial session outside the Il Polei village chief's office. ""I just invited anybody who wanted to come,"" she remembers. ""A few kids came along and then I approached the head teacher of the local school and asked him if it was possible to go twice a week and train the kids."" Read this: Maasai boy scares off lions with flashy invention . But along with the school children's attention, these initial sessions also captured the imagination of some of the young Maasai warriors living nearby. Every time they'd pass the training ground they would stop and watch curiously until one day some of them decided, just for the fun of it, to have a go at this novel game themselves. ""It was the first time to see this kind of a game because in Kenya cricket is not famous,"" says team captain Sonyanga Weblen Ole Ngais. ""At that time it was more like just fun, but when we went on playing and training, we found out that we were starting to love the game."" 'Just like throwing a spear' Ngais, 24, says that cricket came naturally to him and his fellow Maasai warriors. ""Bowling, it wasn't hard for us,"" explains the formidably built captain. ""I can relate it to the cultural way, the Maasai way, the way we throw the spear,"" he adds. ""We are pastoralists, we keep animals and sometimes you encounter a wild animal, so if you throw the spear trying to protect yourself from the wild animal, then that's just (like) bowling."" Despite the lack of proper playing facilities, the shortage of funding and the absence of regular competition, the team went from strength to strength and today it includes 24 players, all coming from Il Polei and the neighboring Endana village. Last year the team managed to raise funds to travel to Cape Town and take part in Last Man Stands, where they didn't win any of their games. This year, however, they managed to win two of their games, reaching the semi-finals of their group during the event, held from August 26 to September 4. ""I enjoyed the tournament,"" says Ngais. ""It was our first time here in England and it was fun."" Positive change . But for the Warriors, cricket is more than just fun. More importantly, the team uses sport as a tool to tackle social problems and spread health messages in their community. Read this: Tribal elder modernizing the Maasai . Some members of the team are trained as volunteer coaches, visiting local schools to teach the game to young pupils. During these coaching sessions they also raise awareness about the dangers of HIV/AIDS through drama, songs and discussions. They also campaign against female genital mutilation, child marriage and animal poaching and try to improve relationships between rival communities. ""So far, we've introduced this to about 24 primary schools and around five secondary schools,"" says 31-year-old Francis Meshame, the oldest member of the team. ""We want to expand the game within the area and put it in the school curriculum."" Local stars . Bauer says that all this social engagement, along with the team's rising profile, has turned the Warriors into ambassadors for positive change within their communities. ""Our parents, they're helping us because they are seeing what we are doing is something very important to the community,"" says Ngais. ""Also, most of the Warriors are not working, so it creates some opportunity we get from this."" Some of the team's social initiatives are captured in ""Warriors,"" a documentary expected to be released next year with the aim of sharing a message of hope with the rest of the world, according to Bauer. Looking ahead, she says the goal is to introduce cricket development to more schools in order to bring success on and off the field. ""It would be amazing if we could get one of the guys playing for the Kenyan national side,"" says Bauer. ""There's definitely talent; what we just need now is the support to get these talented boys to play enough cricket, on proper facilities, get them proper coaching, and who knows? Nothing is impossible.""","A group of young Maasai men have formed a cricket team .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- One year after a gunman killed 12 people in an Aurora movie theater, the city is marking its losses with solemn moments and a continuing debate over the place of guns in society. Tom Sullivan was part of an observance at a state park Friday, where volunteers read aloud thousands of names of victims of gun violence. His son, 27-year-old Alex Sullivan, died in the Century 16 theater on July 20, 2012. Pay tribute to the victims . ""A guy walked into a movie theater with a 100-round drum, and one second my son was watching a movie and the next second he was dead,"" Sullivan said. The ceremonial reading, which lasted more than 10 hours, ended at 12:28 a.m. Saturday, the moment when the shooting began one year earlier. The event was part of the ""No More Names"" bus tour, sponsored by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. On Saturday, the group announced a new TV ad featuring Stephen Barton, a recent college graduate and Fulbright scholar, who was shot in the face and neck during the cinema shooting. In the ad, Barton urges Washington to reform gun laws he calls ""dangerously lax and loophole-ridden,"" the group said. In April, however, the U.S. Senate defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales and a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons. On Friday, Carlee Soto came to mark the Aurora killings, although she lost her sister five months later. First-grade teacher Victoria Soto, 27, was killed in the elementary school massacre in Newton, Connecticut. ""Every situation is different,"" Carlee Soto said. ""From a movie theater to an elementary school to a church, it's all different. But we all carry the same grief, and we all share the wanting to change our gun laws."" A handful of gun rights advocates peacefully protested the event Friday. One of them, Rob Blancken, said all Coloradans should remember the tragedy. ""It's also a tragedy that a firearm was not allowed to be used inside that theater that may have prevented that tragedy,"" Blancken said. The Colorado gunman sprayed bullets into a packed midnight screening of the Batman film, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The rampage a year today left 70 people injured. Colorado Theater Shooting: Fast Facts . The city of Aurora scheduled a series of events Saturday, including ""healing activities"" such as meditation, music, counseling and yoga. Some activities were scheduled for the newly-opened Aurora Strong Community Resilience Center, which is designed to teach trauma coping skills.

"(CNN) -- As the United States shutters some diplomatic sites around the globe over concerns about a possible attack, at least two major U.S. cities have stepped up their security. In New York, officials are beefing up police presence, particularly around transportation hubs and religious sites, New York Police Department spokesman James Duffy told CNN. And in San Francisco, police increased patrols at key locations, including mass transit, popular landmarks and embassies, said spokesman Gordon Shyy. Officials in both cities emphasized that there was no specific threat leading to the decision. Rather, the moves were made in an abundance of caution. In Washington, the Metro Transit Police Department sent an e-mail to employees Friday night. ""I want to let you know that at this time, there is no specific or credible threat against Metro, nor any other transportation system in the U.S. However, this worldwide alert serves as an important reminder for us to remain vigilant at all times,"" police Chief Ron Pavlik wrote. U.S. Park Police spokesman Paul Brooks said security has not been increased at national monuments in Washington, and there are no new directives to officers. In Los Angeles, police and the county sheriff's department said they had no new formal directives, but were told to be a little more vigilant than usual. Miami police told CNN it was ""business as usual,"" and that the department is constantly monitoring for potential threats. Houston police said they do not comment on ""tactical operations.""

"(CNN) -- French ministers grappled Wednesday with the issue of same-sex marriage and adoption rights as the Cabinet approved a draft bill in the face of fierce resistance from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning this year. The bill is expected to go before the National Assembly and Senate in January, and is likely to be voted on in February or March. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. Read more: U.S. voters approve same-sex marriage for the first time . The office of Dominique Bertinotti, minister for family affairs in Hollande's Socialist government, confirmed the bill had been presented to and approved by ministers Wednesday morning. An opinion poll released Wednesday by polling group Ifop and Le Monde newspaper found 65% of those surveyed support equal marriage rights for same-sex couples -- a clear majority of the population. However, opinion on the question of adoption rights for same-sex couples is split almost down the middle, with 52% in favor, according to the Ifop-Le Monde survey conducted October 29-31. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition to the proposed legislation at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes over the weekend. Opening up marriage to same-sex couples ""would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone,"" he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a ""deceit"" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups in France, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and more than 100 lawmakers are against the legislation, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Hundreds of mayors around the country have also voiced their opposition to the bill. However, it has won wide backing from gay rights advocates. Read more: Malawi suspends anti-gay laws . The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT said the law, if passed, ""would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights."" Lawmakers have a ""unique opportunity"" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in an online statement. ""The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity,"" it said. The group has called for supporters to rally in front of the National Assembly in Paris on Wednesday evening. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said the proposed changes are a matter of justice and equality that reflect the evolving nature of society. Other divisive questions such as whether same-sex couples should have the right to free reproductive assistance, and the rights of same-sex couples who aren't married to adopt will be tackled in a ""complementary law"" on the family, he said, allowing further debate on the issue. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS (pacte civil de solidarite), the civil union agreement can be entered into by gay or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage. In elections in the United States on Tuesday, the states of Maine and Maryland became the first to approve same-sex marriage through a popular vote in referendums on the question. Thirty-eight U.S. states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same gender, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. In those states where same-sex couples had previously won the right to marry, it was because of action by legislators or judges. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam contributed to this report.","The proposed bill would give same-sex couples new marriage and adoption rights .

"(CNN) -- Pablo Neruda wooed readers with his romantic poetry, but the latest lines in his story could be ripped from a murder mystery. The Chilean poet's 1973 death certificate says prostate cancer killed him. But his former chauffeur has another theory involving an unknown assassin, a lethal injection and the South American country's notorious military coup. On Monday, authorities started putting that theory to the test, exhuming the poet's remains as part of a high-profile investigation that could take months to complete. Manuel Araya, the chauffeur, said he's received threats for making the controversial claim, which has riled some of Neruda's supporters. That won't stop him from speaking his mind, Araya told CNN Chile. ""I am not afraid of anyone,"" he said. Chauffeur: 'They silenced him' Neruda died on September 23, 1973, just 12 days after a right-wing military coup ousted socialist President Salvador Allende and brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power. The poet, a Communist Party member, had criticized the coup and Pinochet. Less than two weeks later, he was dead. He had been planning to go into exile the next day -- and the timing of his death was no coincidence, according to Araya. Neruda was a well known political and public figure, having served as a lawmaker and diplomat in addition to his literary career, which earned him a Nobel Prize in 1971. ""I believe that Pablo Neruda was murdered, because Pablo Neruda was a very relevant figure in history, as much in this country as in the world,"" Araya told CNN Chile. ""He was going to go into exile on September 24 and they silenced him before then."" Thousands of people disappeared or died during Pinochet's rule, and many have accused his government of using death squads to wipe out political opponents. Araya alleges that Neruda was poisoned in a clinic where he was undergoing treatment. That claim and several other alleged discrepancies surrounding the poet's death drew the attention of Chile's Communist Party, which called for Neruda to be exhumed in 2011. Evidence suggests that a third party was involved in Neruda's death, said Communist Party attorney Eduardo Contreras. Chilean Judge Mario Carroza ordered the exhumation in February. Nephew: 'This is a circus' But not everyone shares the Communist Party's concerns. After the exhumation request, the head of the Pablo Neruda Foundation -- founded by the poet's widow to promote and preserve his legacy -- said he didn't want authorities to dig up Neruda's remains. ""We are against an exhumation of his cadaver because it would seem to us a true act of desecration,"" Juan Agustin Figueroa told Chile's Radio Bio-Bio in 2011. The organization has since adopted a more welcoming tone. ""In this year that marks four decades since the death of Pablo Neruda, we hope also that the investigation of Judge Carroza will help clarify the doubts that might exist regarding the poet's death,"" the foundation said in a statement last week. Others aren't convinced. ""This is a circus that I do not want to be part of,"" Bernardo Reyes, Neruda's nephew and biographer, said last week. Reyes said party officials never contacted him to discuss their desire to have Neruda's remains exhumed, and he told CNN Chile that he remains suspicious of their motives. As debate surges, Reyes said he plans to update a biography of Neruda and publish photographs taken of the poet after his death, which show Neruda's physical state and the clothes he was wearing in his coffin. ""It seems that when someone wants to find the truth but ignores all the sides of the story, that is notable,"" he said. Expert: Time 'erases evidence' The investigation into Neruda's death follows another high-profile exhumation. As part of a massive probe of 726 reported human rights violations during Pinochet's rule, Chilean authorities exhumed Allende's body in 2011. Official accounts ruled the leftist leader's death a suicide, saying that he shot himself -- with a gun that was reportedly a gift from Fidel Castro -- as Pinochet's troops closed in on the presidential palace. In July 2011, Chile's Legal Medical Service confirmed that suicide was the cause of Allende's death . For decades, Neruda has been buried alongside his wife, Matilde Urrutia, in Isla Negra, a coastal area in central Chile. Excavation crews began work there on Sunday and completed the exhumation on Monday, CNN Chile reported. Determining what really happened will be a difficult task, since so much time has passed since the poet's death, one pathologist told CNN Chile. ""Time is a destructive factor,"" said Dr. Luis Ravanal, an investigator for the office of Chile's government ombudsman. ""It is an element that erases evidence."" Tissues will have decomposed, he said, and even if some sort of poison were used, there may no longer be any traces remaining. ""Science has enormous limitations in this case,"" he said.","Investigators exhume poet Pablo Neruda's remains .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge who came under criticism for forwarding a racist e-mail aimed at President Barack Obama earlier this spring will be taking partial retirement, according to a U.S. court website. Montana Chief U.S. District Court Judge Richard Cebull had apologized and offered regrets for the incident, telling the Billings Gazette at the time it was ""a hard lesson to learn."" Cebull will take ""senior status,"" next March, according the judiciary's main administrative office, meaning he will vacate his seat but will be available to hear a reduced caseload. Obama will name the judge's replacement. Civil rights groups had demanded Cebull's immediate resignation after the e-mail was revealed seven months ago. He is currently the subject of an internal misconduct review by a panel of fellow judges, the Judicial Council of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. That review has not been completed. Judge asks for probe after sending racist Obama e-mail . Cebull did not write the offensive material, but admitted forwarding the message on February 20 to a few friends after it was sent to him by his brother. The Great Falls Tribune was given a copy and reported that the message said: . ""Normally I don't send or forward a lot of these, but even by my standards, it was a bit touching. I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine. ""A little boy said to his mother, 'Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white?' His mother replied, 'Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!'"" Obama is of mixed race. ""To say it's inappropriate and stupid is an extreme understatement,"" Cebull said according to the Billings newspaper. ""There is no doubt it's racist. It wasn't forwarded for that purpose. If anything, it was political."" The Billings-based judge was named to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2001. He has been chief judge since 2008, overseeing two other full-time district judges, three senior or part-time judges and five magistrates. His chambers did not return a call from CNN for comment. Cebull said in the interview his conduct in court over many years has shown he is not a racist, but he admitted the public got that impression from the e-mail. ""And I don't blame them,"" he added. The judge also separately told the Great Falls Tribune, ""The only reason I can explain it to you is I am not a fan of our president, but this goes beyond not being a fan. I didn't send it as racist, although that's what it is. I sent it out because it's anti-Obama."" Judge apologizes for forwarding a racist e-mail aimed at Obama . Some advocacy organizations said the 68-year-old Cebull should have fully retired, and should have done so months ago. ""Americans expect the courts to be fair, impartial, and open to all,"" said Michael Keegan of the liberal People for the American Way. ""Cebull clearly demonstrated that he does not have the temperament to serve as a federal judge, period."" Standards warranting removal are not clear, beyond a violation of civil or criminal law. Congress would have to initiate impeachment proceedings, but the few judges to face that have usually resigned before those proceedings went far. There is no indication the judge in Montana would be subjected to either option. Senior status is a common option for federal judges who have earned enough seniority to qualify for a full government salary while working only part time. A judge must be at least 65 and have served for 15 years. Courts with especially crowded dockets rely heavily on senior judges to help pick up the caseload. According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, senior judges essentially provide volunteer service to the courts, and typically handle about 15% of the federal courts' workload annually. Retired Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, and John Paul Stevens are all on senior status. But unlike their lower court counterparts, retired justices cannot sit on any Supreme Court cases.

"(CNN) -- The New York Times Co. will sell The Boston Globe to sports magnate John W. Henry for $70 million, a fraction of the price it paid for the paper two decades ago. The company paid $1.1 billion for the properties. The impending sale to the owner of the Boston Red Sox is for 6.3% of the price it paid. Both The Times and The Globe reported the deal Saturday.

"(CNN) -- ""C'mon Dover! Move yer bloomin' arse!"" And with that, the exquisitely dressed Audrey Hepburn -- playing common Cockney girl Eliza Doolittle -- smashes her genteel demeanor to smithereens, horrifying the lords and ladies gathered at Britain's most prestigious race meeting. So scandalous is Hepburn's legendary outburst in the Oscar-winning 1964 film, My Fair Lady, one nearby aristocrat actually faints in shock. It may seem like an overblown reaction -- by today's standards, Hepburn isn't even swearing -- but the famous scene at Royal Ascot, which kicked off on Tuesday, points to the strict protocol still permeating the historic 300-year-old horse race. This, after all, is the same five-day racing festival which opens with Queen Elizabeth II parading around the track in an elegant horse-drawn carriage. And where does Her Majesty watch the famous competition? None other than the very same stand where Hepburn bellowed her outrageous obscenities -- the Royal Enclosure. A class above . As the name suggests, the Royal Enclosure isn't just for any old riff-raff. This is the exclusive viewing area for royals, lords, and of course, fair ladies. Of the 280,000 people who attend Ascot each year, just 12,000 can be found hobnobbing in the plush Royal Enclosure each day. To enter the luxury area, you must be sponsored by someone who has attended at least four times. Once inside, expect to rub shoulders with British high society's crÃ¨me de le crÃ¨me -- everyone from the royal family to business magnates and film stars. ""It's a private club,"" Nick Smith, Royal Ascot head of communications, told CNN. ""But getting into the Royal Enclosure is not a class divide,"" Smith insisted. ""In fact, we're trying to encourage more people, especially young people, to join."" Others, however, see Ascot as the very embodiment of the British class system -- from the cheapest tickets in the Silver Ring Enclosure, to the standard Grandstand, and finally the best seats in the house, the Royal Enclosure. ""Arriving at Royal Ascot is a very much like boarding an aeroplane,"" wrote British journalist Andrew Baker. ""You turn left for the expensive end of things -- the Royal Enclosure and the grandstands' snootier reaches -- or right for economy class, which is epitomized by the Silver Ring."" Behind the velvet rope . So what exactly does a $560 five-day ticket to the Royal Enclosure get you? Apart from obvious bragging rights, the exclusive area features seating on the Grandstand's fourth floor, offering the best views of the course. Then there are the glamorous garden marquees adorned with chandeliers and paintings as well as five-course lunches including such delicacies as peeled quail eggs in pink salt and lobster vinaigrette. However, calling them ""marquees"" is a bit of an understatement -- these sleek white structures are so huge they even include escalators and industrial kitchens. For the first time this year, Royal Enclosure ticket-holders can also lounge in one of 25 trackside gazebos, with room for 12 people and offering waiter service plus prized car parking spaces immediately next door -- all for the princely sum of $780. Dressed to impress . All eyes will be on the Queen's horse Estimate on Thursday. The filly won a Group Three race at last year's royal meeting but her outing in the Gold Cup represents a big step up in class. The Queen has not tasted Group One success in Britain since Dunfermline captured the St. Leger Stakes in 1977 -- her Silver Jubilee year. Gold Cup Day is synonymous with ""Ladies' Day"" -- when the designer dresses and millinery masterpieces are just as much a focus as the horse racing. And much like Hepburn's iconic white lace dress and swooping feathered hat, Royal Enclosure guests must follow strict fashion protocol or risk being turned away. The plush enclosure has the strictest dress rules on the race course: women must wear hats, or failing that, a headpiece with a 10-centimeter base. Fascinators -- small ornaments attached to a headband -- are a no-no. As are strapless, off-the-shoulder and halter neck tops. All straps must also be at least one inch thick. Likewise, men are required to wear waistcoats, ties and top hats. In comparison, the Silver Ring Enclosure, which offers $45 daily tickets, simply requires its racegoers to wear smart clothes, with a reminder that ""bare chests are not permitted at any time."" Grand tradition . Dating back to the 1820s, the Royal Enclosure was originally a two-story stand commissioned by King George IV, with only those receiving a personal invitation from His Highness getting a look-in. Such was the exclusivity of the enclosure, it was only in 1955 that divorcees were allowed to enter. ""Its charm is that it's so steeped in history,"" said Smith. ""It started as a very private affair for the royal family -- basically an individual stand with a viewing garden."" ""Today it's much more than a single entity -- there are the grandstands, marquees, private boxes. You will probably see the Queen there -- Her Majesty has her own official guest pen (enclosure)."" So what would the Queen have made of Hepburn's outburst? One can only guess Her Highness would not have been amused.","Britain's most prestigious race meeting, Royal Ascot, is held over five days every June .

"(CNN) -- Willis Edwards, longtime president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch of the NAACP and key to launching the NAACP Image Awards on national television, died Friday in Mission Hills, California, according to a spokeswoman for Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. Edwards, born in Texas and raised in Palm Springs, California, was 66. The cause of the civil rights pioneer's death was not immediately available. Edwards became active in politics while attending California State University, Los Angeles, according to TheHistoryMakers.com, which preserves the life stories of thousands of African-Americans. Edwards served on the Social Services Commission after Tom Bradley was elected Los Angeles mayor, according to Lauren Tobin, a spokeswoman for the Edwards family. NAACP backs same-sex marriage . Four years after an unsuccessful run for the California General Assembly, Edwards was elected president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood Branch of the NAACP in 1982, according to the website. More recently, he served as the chapter's first vice president. Edwards, who was vice president of development and planning for the Rosa & Raymond Parks Institute, also led the campaign to get Rosa Parks on a U.S. postage stamp in 2006. Edwards was also close to many in the entertainment, civil rights and political worlds. ""Willis Edwards was a national leader for the NAACP and a partner with the City of Los Angeles in the struggle for equality and justice for all people,"" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa said in a statement. ""I was proud to call him a personal friend for over 20 years in the struggle for civil liberties."" Others echoed that sentiment. ""Willis was that guy who really found the joy and beauty of people. But in hindsight, he had probably been the only one like him in many rooms,"" California Attorney General Kamala Harris told CNN. ""He was always exuberant in his infectious belief that being present and involved in the electoral process makes a difference. He was a dear friend."" Edwards, who was HIV-positive, was a strong advocate for AIDS-related issues. ""I remember having dinner with Willis Edwards in Philadelphia at the NABJ (National Association of Black Journalists) Convention in 2011. He was never ashamed of his HIV-positive status and proudly proclaimed, 'I fought AIDS to a standstill,'"" said CNN assignment editor Greg Morrison.

"San Jose, California (CNN) -- After three weeks, the closely watched Apple versus Samsung patent trial wound down Tuesday with four hours of closing arguments. Apple is accusing Samsung of copying the design of the iPhone and iPad, suing Samsung for $2.5 billion. Samsung denies any wrongdoing and is counter suing Apple for $519 million, also for patent infringement. Tuesday's closing arguments capped off weeks of testimony that included highs -- colorful stories from Apple executives about the iPhone's origin -- and lows -- jurors nodding off during drier discussions of software patents. The final battle for the jury's favor had a little bit of both. Judge Lucy Koh urged the two sides to try one last time to reach a settlement Friday. Apple chief executive Tim Cook spoke Monday to former Samsung CEO Choi Gee-Sung but they couldn't reach an agreement. Now the decision rests with the jury, which must determine exactly what devices violated which patents, as well as how much money, if any, is owed in damages. While its decision could go either way, what's certain is that the outcome will have a far-reaching impact on the technology industry. Closing arguments . Throughout the trial, the two sides presented their cases with distinctly different styles, which were represented in the closing statements. Apple generally went more for emotional impact by keeping its narrative simple and engaging, showing the jury easy-to-understand images of devices. Samsung argued that Apple's approach didn't go deep enough to prove that individual devices infringed on patents, and dove into more technical detail. Apple urged jurors to judge based on ""historical documents"" and to look at the evidence in chronological order. ""That's where you'll find the truth,"" said Apple counsel Harold McElhinny. Samsung put the emphasis on chunks of transcribed text of testimony from the trial that it said supported its case. Both sides injected a mix of anger, passion and hyperbole into their closing arguments. ""Apple took five years to bring this revolution to U.S; Samsung took three months to copy it. That's the truth and that's simple, clear, and not disputed."" said McElhinny, referring to the the three months Samsung spent developing the Galaxy S smartphone. Samsung didn't spend much time denying the similarities between the product lines, but rather claiming that form followed function. ""It's not against the law to be inspired by your competition,"" said Samsung counsel Charles Verhoeven, going on to argue that Apple can't patent ""a rectangle with rounded corners."" He compared current smartphone design to TVs, which changed across brands from thick heavy boxes to black, flat rectangles. Samsung claimed that Apple was being anti-competitive, and ""seeking a competitive edge through the courtroom."" Any decision in Apple's favor, Samsung warned, would lead to a country made up of ""giant conglomerates, armed with patent arsenals, that block competition."" Apple also painted its side as best for America, saying a decision for Apple would be reaffirming the American patent system, allowing companies to continue hiring people and investing in technology companies. Just finding for Apple wouldn't be enough, it claimed, as a slap on the wrist wouldn't stop Samsung from doing the same thing again. A main point of contention throughout the trial was customer confusion -- if a casual shopper could confuse a similar-looking Samsung product for an iPhone or iPad. Apple insisted that the jury did not need to believe people had actually been fooled into buying the wrong product, just that the overall visual resemblance between Samsung and Apple products is deceptive. Samsung said no analysis was presented on whether or not any customers were confused at the point of sale, and contended that there was no deception or confusion. ""Customers make choices, not mistakes,"" said Verhoeven. What's ahead for the jury . The jury has to reach a unanimous verdict, a task complicated by the amount of variables in the decision. Jurors must fill out a daunting 20-page verdict form, marking on worksheets exactly which Samsung products infringe on Apple patents and vice versa. Judge Koh has expressed concern in recent days that members of the jury could be ""seriously confused."" There are 84 jury instructions totaling 102 pages, including recaps of accusations, key terminology, and directions on how to operate the smartphones and tablets. ""I need everyone to stay conscious during the reading of instructions, including myself"" said Koh, who read the entire document to the jury on Tuesday morning, being sure to throw in periodic standing breaks to keep the jury alert. The thick document will serve as a guide for jurors when they begin deliberations at 9 a.m. Wednesday. They'll also have access to the full line of contested smartphones and tablets so they can examine the hardware and software up close. Larger implications . Apple is asking for $2.5 billion in damages. The amount, if awarded in full, would be almost three times the amount of the largest patent verdict ever, according to Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University. But the amount isn't what would have the biggest impact on the smartphone industry. ""Even more important than the money is the risk of an injunction,"" said Lemley. Samsung could be forced to pull its products from the market and redesign them, a costly and time-consuming process that would give Apple an advantage in the smartphone and tablet market, especially if consumers prefer to stick with Apple's familiar designs. The ramifications wouldn't stop with Samsung. A verdict for Apple would serve as a warning to all Android handset manufacturers. ""Apple's real target in this suit is the Android ecosystem, not just Samsung,"" said Lemley. There's some debate over whether forcing these companies back to the drawing board would have long term benefits. Lemley says it could promote more diversity, but not necessarily innovation. A new report from investment research firm UBS says that in the long run, forcing competitors to experiment with new designs could result in new products that are an even greater risk to Apple. ""It could hurt Apple because the real threat is not a competitor beating Apple at its own game but instead changing the game,"" the report says. If Samsung wins, it's possible Android smartphone and tablet makers would continue to make products similar to Apple's, leading to more unified design across the industry and a dearth of innovative new products. A split decision is also a possibility. Peter Lee, a law professor at UC Davis School of Law, says a decision that finds both companies liable for patent infringement would confirm the importance of smartphone and tablet patents. ""It may also accelerate the trend of companies amassing enormous patent portfolios to protect their freedom to operate and provide 'insurance"" if they are sued for patent infringement,' said Lee. One thing everyone can agree on is that a jury decision isn't likely to end the Apple versus Samsung drama. ""One can expect appeals and perhaps, ultimately, a settlement."" said Lee.","The Apple versus Samsung patent trial had its closing arguments Tuesday .
Jurors will now decide if any Samsung products copied the iPad and iPhone .

"(EW.com) -- National Geographic Channel's new film ""Killing Lincoln"" explores a key part of the 16th president's story that Steven Spielberg's big screen hit largely passed over. Based on Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's bestselling book, Killing Lincoln chronicles the final days of President Lincoln (Billy Campbell) and the plot by his assassin John Wilkes Booth (Jesse Johnson). Below is the first trailer for the movie, which debuts next month. ""Killing Lincoln"" spends time portraying both men as it builds toward, as narrator Tom Hanks puts it, ""the most resonant crime in the history of the nation,"" and then chronicles the extensive manhunt to bring Booth to justice. The show's auspices are quite impressive. In addition to Hanks, Killing Lincoln is produced by Ridley and Tony Scott (the latter having joined the production before his death last year) and is directed by Adrian Moat (Gettysburg). ""This is really the Lincoln story you've never seen before,"" Ridley Scott says. ""Killing Lincoln"" marks Nat Geo's first scripted drama. Here's the debut preview. There's a couple brief interview snippets with the actors and producers, but the home stretch of the two-minute video is a theatrical-style trailer. Below, some previously released quotes from Johnson and Campbell about their performances: . ""The prevailing image of Booth is one of a two-dimensional, mustache-twirling villain,"" Johnson says. ""My job was to dig deeper. Show that he was as complex as a Shakespearean character he portrayed on the stage. Demonstrate the artistry, obsession and Southern rigor as well as the virulent disdain for an 'inferior' president that culminated into his own bloody, one-act play."" Adds Campbell: ""Lincoln is so adored, so universally revered today that it's easy to forget he was a controversial president â€” one with many enemies â€” in fact he repeatedly dreamt of his own assassination. We felt it important to convey this hidden side of Lincoln, this sense of his almost wasting away with premonitions of death, even as he was outwardly so poised and steadfast through the closing of the war.""

"(CNN) -- It has to be difficult to outfit a fishing expedition when you're in jail. A pair of incarcerated anglers in Florida had to find a line they could cast six stories down, plus an accomplice outside to put marijuana and tobacco on their hook. It may have been the alleged accomplice's fault that they had to try to reel in the goodies in a flimsy plastic grocery bag. But all three of them got into trouble when the bag and the contraband were discovered hanging outside the fourth floor of the Pinellas County jail. The sheriff's office said it charged three men this week with introducing contraband into the jail. The plan, a sheriff's statement said, was for inmates Mark Matthew Keating, 45, and Phillip William Henderson, 38, to drop a nylon rope from the jail's sixth-floor recreation yard. Outside the jail, the alleged accomplice attached 29 grams of marijuana worth $1,500, tobacco products and lighters, the sheriff's office said. Authorities arrested Eric Scott Snook, 41, on charges that he was the accomplice. After the bag was discovered Monday night, authorities erected a six-foot fence in the area on the ground where the bag was attached. Pals of suburban mom help her make bail in pot case .

"(CNN) -- It's becoming an annual tradition: Samsung will unveil the next generation of its Galaxy Note smartphone in advance of the IFA technology conference in Berlin. The company sent invitations to the press on Monday for an event on Sept. 4, two days before the first day of the conference. Like previous device unveilings, Samsung is calling the event ""Samsung Unpacked 2013."" The event will be live streamed via the web, and Samsung will host a press event at the same time in New York City's Times Square for people to watch and get hands-on time with the devices. SEE ALSO: 10 Free Android Apps You'll Use Every Day . Samsung isn't officially revealing information about the devices. However, the invitation and subsequent tweet include the phrase, ""Note the Date"" (emphasis added). Plus, at the two previous IFA events, Samsung released the first and second generations of its Galaxy Note smartphone, which have extremely large screens relative to other phones. Thus, it's a foregone conclusion that Samsung will unveil the Galaxy Note 3 (or III) at its September event. It's been almost a year since the company released the Galaxy Note 10.1. The question on everyone's mind this time: Just how big will Samsung go? Competitors have responded to the Galaxy Note's success (now at 5.6 inches with the Note II) with large screen sizes as well, including the 5.5-inch LG Optimus G Pro and 5-inch Droid Ultra. Samsung itself debuted the 6.3-inch Galaxy Mega earlier this year. Samsung's other plans for Sept. 4 also remain unknown. Last year, it took the wraps off several new devices, including its ATIV line of Windows 8 PCs, the first phone to run Windows Phone 8, and the Android-powered Galaxy Camera point-and-shoot. We'll likely see more focus this year, but Samsung could still surprise â€” perhaps with an entry into wearable computing. Its rumored smart watch is called ""Gear.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder, a longtime target of Republicans who have tried to force him out of office, now faces the prospect of angering liberal supporters when the Justice Department decides whether to file federal charges in the Trayvon Martin killing. Civil rights groups are planning nationwide vigils, and more than a million people support an online petition drive calling for admitted shooter George Zimmerman to face federal charges in the February 2012 killing. Holder confronted that political pressure Tuesday in a speech to the NAACP, which is conducting the petition drive. He repeated his pledge for a full investigation of Martin's death in the aftermath of Zimmerman's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges by a Florida court, saying the Justice Department ""will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid."" But he was careful to avoid any promise or hint of federal charges. Instead, Holder took aim at ""stand your ground"" laws like the one in Florida that have expanded the right to respond with deadly force if attacked outside the home. Those laws ""try to fix something that was never broken"" and ""senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,"" he said. ""By allowing -- and perhaps encouraging -- violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,"" Holder said in his first public comment on legislation that more than 30 states have passed in some form. Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in Zimmerman case . ""We must stand our ground to ensure that our laws reduce violence and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent,"" he added. Zimmerman's lawyers didn't invoke Florida's ""stand your ground"" law in court, but it was included in the instructions to the jury that acquitted him. Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office reaffirmed his support for the law Tuesday afternoon, saying a task force set up by his office reviewed the statute after Martin's death. ""The task force recommended that the law should not be overturned, and Governor Scott agrees,"" Scott spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said in a written statement. Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, similarly disagreed with Holder. ""The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it's a fundamental human right,"" he said in a statement. ""To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable, and demonstrates once again that this administration will exploit tragedies to push their political agenda."" Stevie Wonder says he'll boycott 'stand your ground' states . Holder's focus Tuesday on a broader legal issue avoided the difficult decision he faces over whether to bring federal criminal charges. Legal experts say federal charges against Zimmerman are unlikely. Because Zimmerman is a private citizen, he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who now is in private practice. To successfully prosecute Zimmerman, the Justice Department would have to show that Zimmerman ""caused the death of Trayvon Martin solely motivated by/because of his race or color,"" Weinstein told CNN in an e-mail. ""This element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn't exist."" Verdict doesn't end debate in Trayvon Martin death . CNN Legal analyst Paul Callan agreed Monday that federal prosecutors are ""in sort of a tough spot."" The hate crimes statute is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents, Callan said, adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is ""very, very rare and I think in this case, it's going to be very hard to prove."" Sources told CNN Monday that Justice Department officials were reviewing trial evidence to determine if such a case was winnable. The sources made clear that Holder's department would only file charges if officials believe they can secure a conviction. If Holder decides not to bring a federal case against Zimmerman, he will disappoint liberal supporters who contend the Martin killing was a civil rights violation. The nation's first African-American attorney general has been popular with the political left for his support of gay marriage and challenges to GOP efforts to change voting laws. At the same time, his policies have made him a political lightning rod for conservatives. Holder was censured last year by the Republican-led House over complaints that he failed to fully cooperate with a congressional investigation of the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun-walking operation. He called the episode a politically motivated effort to discredit him. 5 things about the controversy surrounding Eric Holder . Last year, Holder himself raised questions about possible federal charges against Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, who killed Martin during an altercation as the unarmed teenager was walking in the community. ""For a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law,"" Holder said in April 2012, 45 days after Zimmerman shot Martin in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing. In words that now sound prescient, Holder described to reporters that day how ""something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard."" ""We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind,"" he said. Zimmerman's acquittal on Saturday showed the Florida jury rejected that he intended to kill Martin for any reason, including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin's civil rights. In a speech in Washington on Monday, Holder said the Justice Department would ""continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law"" in examining what he called ""the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" ""Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,"" Holder said. ""We must not -- as we have too often in the past -- let this opportunity pass."" Zimmerman was 'justified' in shooting Martin, juror says . Separately, the White House said President Barack Obama would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed. ""Cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. The president on Sunday called Martin's killing a tragedy for America, but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken. He acknowledged the case had ""elicited strong passions,"" but urged ""calm reflection"" in its aftermath. Still, political pressure for a federal case is mounting. On Tuesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton and other civil rights leaders gathered outside the Department of Justice to announce scores of ""Justice for Trayvon"" vigils outside of federal buildings across the country this weekend. ""People all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit,"" Sharpton said. ""This is a social movement for justice."" He also called for a full federal investigation of the Martin killing, saying mere remarks by Obama and others weren't enough. ""The president has made a statement of consolation,"" Sharpton said. ""We don't need consolation. We need legislation and we need some federal prosecution."" Watch Holder's speech . Those seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated, arguing that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, targeted Martin for special scrutiny because the teenager was an African-American. Regardless of how the shooting occurred, they say, the fight occurred because of Martin's race. ""The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" says the petition on the NAACP website. Five Reasons for acquittal . Rep. Marcia Fudge, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said racial profiling like what Zimmerman did to Martin ""continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them."" ""Men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed, stopped, or questioned,"" Fudge said in a statement Monday. ""This practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end."" Petition to White House . Such political pressure evokes memories of the Rodney King case in 1991, when videotape of white Los Angeles police officers clubbing an African-American man after a car chase prompted race-tinged national furor. When a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination. The Justice Department then filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging ""deprivations of federal rights under color of law,"" and two of them were convicted in 1993. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison. Weinstein said the Justice Department can't file similar charges against Zimmerman because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind. ""There are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him"" other than the hate crime statute, which covers ""offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin,"" Weinstein added. A federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges, it would not be double jeopardy for Zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity. Martin's family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman to seek penalties and damages. Such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time.

"(CNN) -- Ah, the confirmed bachelor. Think George Clooney, Gerard Butler or even old Hollywood's Clark Gable. We anticipate whom they'll turn up with on the red carpet at the next Hollywood premiere or which starlet will be photographed hanging from their arm as they slip out of the hottest, newest restaurant or nightclub. Though it wasn't celebrated by larger society, it used to be that gay men once enjoyed that same freedom to play the field. But thanks to our freedom-fighting brethren, not anymore. Don't get me wrong; it's not that I long for the good old days when gay men and women had to hide and lie about themselves and their partners by calling them ""friend"" or ""roommate."" Not at all! But as same-sex marriage is becoming legalized in places like New York and beyond, many of us suddenly have to face the reality and the question that many of our straight friends have always faced: ""When are you going to settle down and get married?"" More and more these days, I hear gay couples lamenting over it in restaurants, at work and at dinner parties. My friends call me with their own similar accounts. Lucky for them, they don't get called on the carpet over it in public. But I did, literally on a red carpet. And it lives in print and on the Internet for all to see. It was my first red carpet experience earlier this summer after coming out publicly in my book ""Transparent."" It didn't go well when a New York Magazine reporter inquired about my own marriage intentions. Here's the exchange: . So there we were, chatting with newly out CNN anchor Don Lemon at Monday's Trevor Live event, and just like annoying Aunt Sadie, we asked if he and his partner of four years are planning on tying the knot. After a long, awkward pause, Lemon laughed and said, ""Listen, I am not planning on getting married. I'm not planning on not getting married."" Another pause. ""You mean, you're asking me if I'm planning on getting married in the near future?"" Yes, that's what we're asking, we pressed. ""Since I was a kid I've always wanted to get married. And I think that now that, you know, there is a possibility for me to get married, I think that, yeah, one day I would like to get married, and maybe soon,"" Lemon said. ""I have no immediate plans, but I say why not? I am in a very happy, very solid relationship, so sure, one day I'd like to get married, and I might do it."" Obviously Lemon was not comfortable talking about this, but just like Aunt Sadie never takes the hint, we blustered on with questions about this hypothetical wedding. When our conversation ended and Lemon was walking away, we overheard him say to his rep, ""Did I dance around that enough?"" I warned you it didn't go well. I wasn't ready for that question from a persistent reporter. Nor am I ready for it from family members, friends, neighbors or random people who approach me in public. Honestly, I hadn't pondered marriage since I came to terms with my sexuality almost two decades ago. But it really hit home for me when to my and my boyfriend's surprise The New York Observer named me a 2011 media power bachelor and I got the news in an e-mail that my colleague Joy Behar had tied the knot with her long-time boyfriend, Steve Janowitz. While the power bachelor thing was fun, the Joy thing got me thinking. I haven't had the opportunity to ask her directly why she decided to get married after 29 years of unwedded bliss. Maybe it had something to do with her new grandson and her public support of gay marriage. Perhaps New York's new marriage law had greased the skids for Ms. Behar-Janowitz. Whatever her reasons, Joy's last tweet before running off with Steve was a sign for me. It simply reads, ""gone fishing."" So just as I did when I came out publicly this summer, I'll get ahead of all those ""fishing"" for an answer about my marriage plans. While I respect the gay couples who have or are planning on tying the knot soon, the truth is, just like straight people, not all gay people want to or should get married. But perhaps the best answer and the one closest to my own comes from a personal quote on the website IMDB from another confirmed bachelor, Leonardo DiCaprio. ""People always like to make up stories. I am not planning on getting married. Then again, I might wake up tomorrow and decide to get married!"" Thanks Leo.","As same-sex marriage is legalized, many are asked, ""When are you getting married?""

"Zurich, Switzerland (CNN) -- ""Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."" -- John Adams, 'Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials', December 1770. At the heart of the maelstrom that has gripped Pakistan during the past eight weeks since I authored an opinion piece on the nuclear-armed nation's alleged intelligence sector malfeasance against U.S. regional interests lies nothing less than the struggle to define Pakistan's modern statehood. It is a fight between the feudal politics of Pakistan's barons, President Asif Ali Zardari being chief among them, and the military's dominance of its industry, security and strategic sectors. Stuck in the middle is a largely uneducated, underemployed and malnourished population that yearns for leadership -- any kind of leadership -- to guide the country forward. That struggle, hidden from the world's view through the many years of dictatorship and moribund civilian rule, has now come out in the open as a result of my column's disclosure of a confidential memorandum that Pakistan's then ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, directed me to draft and deliver to Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. [Editor's note: Haqqani has denied any involvement in the memo.] . Inadvertent as my purpose was in disclosing the memorandum, the debate it has touched off is real and the issues being debated are finally the ones that need illumination in a country that survives on a rich diet of conspiracy theories and the adolescent antics of its political leaders. The memorandum called on Mullen to dissuade his friend, Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, from moving against the civilian government in the tense days that followed Operation Neptune Spear -- the U.S. Special Forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In return, it offered a commitment by a reconstituted civilian government, which would have added national security muscle previously belonging to the army and intelligence sectors, to do a lot of what America and its allies in the region, India and Afghanistan, have long been calling on Pakistan to do. To some in Pakistan, the memo was the product of an honorable civil servant (Haqqani) attempting to save his boss's government from imminent demise at the hands of military men he had come to despise. To others, the memorandum's contents were nothing short of high treason, the product of a ruthless operator's (Zardari) directive and his cunning collaborator's (Haqqani) compliance. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Yet far from harming the democratic institutions Haqqani claimed to be defending when he first contacted me on that beautiful May morning, the debate over the memorandum's who, what, when and why has had the remarkable effect of stimulating forces that make democracy real in a civilized society, not the mirage that was being peddled around the halls of Congress, Washington's think-tank lecture circuit or the Sunday talk shows by the able ambassador. Today, nearly two months after the memorandum's contents became known, the army remains in its barracks. The intelligence services continue to play their Patriot Games in Afghanistan while minding the store at home with an invisible hand. Zardari, who said he would address a special joint session of Parliament on ""memogate"" sometime next week, had his heart condition resurface on Tuesday, sending him scurrying off to Dubai (Pakistani doctors and hospitals wouldn't do) for a stay of undetermined length outside the country. The Supreme Court has taken on the challenge addressed to it by a leader of an opposition political party who felt he couldn't get the ""memogate"" truth out of a biased Parliamentary committee. An Inquiry Commission has been formed as a result. A former cricket hero turned politician now routinely attracts tens of thousands of supporters at gathering points around the country as he tries to coerce the Arab Spring's winds to blow further east. And the chivalrous prime minister, Yousef Raza Gilani, tells his party loyalists that he is prepared to resign if my facts are proven right and Haqqani, or worse, Zardari, are found to be the minds behind the memo. Pakistan's press is also doing its job well -- the hacks who support Zardari, Inc. are throwing knives at me hourly while those who want to see Zardari get his comeuppance will simply not let the story go and are eagerly digging at and reporting on every facet of it. All of which means everyone -- finally -- has a stake in the outcome of an issue that could have brought serious repercussions to the country's method of accountability and governance if the doctrine outlined in the memo had been enacted. Hmmm...... seems to me that democracy is doing exactly what it should: Self-corrective actions with heated debate about principled issues, all within the constitutional framework and rule of law as it exists today. David Frum can call me all the names he wants -- it won't change the facts. It certainly will not deter me. And it won't help to fix what ails Pakistan. Peter Bergen can ridicule my three or four claims that turned out to be inaccurate over a five year period of being interviewed nearly four or five times a week -- it won't change the facts, or the accuracy with which I recorded them in this instance. The think-tank crowd and my detractors at the State Department, never ones to like private US citizens running off and doing what they only talk about or dream of being able to do, have always pilloried my efforts -- but their frustrations and jealousies won't change the facts. Even the White House didn't have all the facts when it issued a denial of my opinion that Pakistani officials knew about the bin Laden raid before it happened. Its fact checkers could not readily find the May 2, 2011 story from CNN reporter Nick Paton Walsh which reported that Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK had said -- when asked about the bin Laden raid -- that Pakistan was ""in the know of certain things"" and ""what happened happened with our consent."" [Editor's note: Haqqani has been quoted as saying the allegation that he was informed of the raid in advance are ""reckless, baseless and false.""] . I have largely ignored the attacks emanating from Haqqani's supporters in Washington because the former ambassador can't speak for himself since being put on ice by Zardari in a safe house. But enough is enough. Haqqani should be offered immunity from prosecution in Pakistan and simply tell the Pakistani people the truth about what he -- and his boss -- did. He will be seen as a hero for having the guts to call a spade a spade. Rogue operations inside governments have no place in our world today. The people of Pakistan deserve better. They deserve to know the truth. And it is alone for the Pakistani people to decide whether their political leaders deserve their faith and trust after learning the truth of what has been done in their names. I did not ask to be involved in the events that gave rise to this firestorm. I too face threats and haranguing from Zardari's supporters on a daily basis. But I had the courage to speak truth to power -- as I have done all my life -- and now I'm going to make sure the facts of what the ambassador and those behind him asked me to do in the name of democracy are put squarely on the table for the people of Pakistan to see, judge and decide. Facts, after all, are still stubborn things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mansoor Ijaz.","Mansoor Ijaz: My disclosure of confidential memo touched off debate in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- A New York man accused of stalking and threatening to kill two nationally known TV anchorwomen has been arrested, authorities said Monday. David Lee Simpson, 48, was arrested in Bath, New York. He has waived extradition and will be taken to the Maricopa County Jail in Arizona this week, according to a statement from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. He was indicted by a grand jury in Phoenix last week on charges of stalking and computer tampering, it said. It was not immediately clear whether he had retained representation. The statement did not identify the two TV personalities, who were allegedly targeted because of their coverage of the Jodi Arias trial. When asked who they were, spokesman Joaquin Enriquez said: ""The sheriff said he would not release the names per Turner."" CNN, a division of Turner Broadcasting System, is not commenting on the case. Arias was convicted in May of first-degree murder for killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander. A jury deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to death. Simpson purportedly made threats on Twitter before and after the trial. He threatened to tie the anchorwomen to a ""tree naked and leave them to suffer all night"" and then ""slit their throats,"" according to the Sheriff's Office statement. He also allegedly threatened a Phoenix woman who defended the anchorwomen on Twitter. ""Threats against anyone have to be taken seriously,"" said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. ""Media personalities are frequent targets and because of their high visibility, they are particularly vulnerable. A few in the past have been stalked and murdered. ""The suspect was on his way south with enough weapons in his car to do serious harm to someone. Fortunately, we acted quickly and in so doing, were able to stop him before anything could transpire."" A search of Simpson's car turned up several guns, shotgun ammunition, handcuffs, zip-ties, binoculars, a knife and a police radio, the Sheriff's Office said. A receipt to a recently purchased shotgun was also found but the shotgun itself was not. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","David Lee Simpson, 48, was arrested in New York; he will be taken to Arizona .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli military on Monday rejected allegations that its soldiers committed atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel says the majority of Palestinians killed during ""Operation Cast Lead"" were ""terror operatives."" The conclusion follows a military police investigation into claims made at a conference that the army had intentionally killed civilians and damaged property during Israel's incursion into Gaza in December and January. Israeli military advocate general Brig. Gen. Avichai Mendelblit concluded ""the stories told were purposely exaggerated and made extreme, in order to make a point with the participants of the conference."" The allegations were ""based on hearsay "" and were ""not supported by the facts as determined by the investigation,"" Mendelblit said in a statement. Israeli human rights organizations condemned the speed with which military police reached their conclusion. ""The speedy closing of the investigation immediately raises suspicions that the very opening of this investigation was merely the army's attempt to wipe its hands of all blame for illegal activity during Operation Cast Lead,"" as the Gaza operation was called, nine human rights groups said in a joint statement. They reiterated their call for a civilian investigation, which Attorney General Menachem Mazuz has rejected. ""The closing of the Army's own investigation only strengthens the need for the attorney general to allow for an independent non-partisan investigative body to be established in order to look into all Israeli Army activity during Operation Cast Lead,"" said the organizations. The groups -- The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, The Public Committee Against Torture, Yesh Din, Physicians for Human Rights, and Adalah -- said accounts by Palestinians raise the possibility that acts by the military were worse than previously suspected. Israeli soldiers said earlier this month Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper. About 1,300 Palestinians died during ""Operation Cast Lead,"" which aimed to stop militants from firing rockets into Israel from Gaza. The accounts in Haaretz were from Israeli soldiers who graduated from a pre-military course at an Israeli college. In them, Israeli soldiers complain that the rules of engagement often defied logic and left the impression with Israeli troops that ""inside Gaza you are allowed to do anything you want."" None of the soldiers who alleged the wrongdoing admitted taking part in those acts themselves. The country's top general had already dismissed the claims. ""I don't believe that soldiers serving in the IDF hurt civilians in cold blood, but we shall wait for the results of the investigation,"" Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi said last week. He blamed Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which runs Gaza, for choosing ""to fight in heavily populated areas. ""It (was) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent,"" he said, according to an IDF statement. There have been numerous allegations of Israeli atrocities during the three-week campaign, including the charge that Israel fired white phosphorus shells ""repeatedly over densely populated areas."" Human Rights Watch made the accusation in a report last week. White phosphorus burns on contact with oxygen. It is legal to use as an illuminant, but the human rights organization alleges that Israel used it as a weapon. Israel has rejected those claims as well. Other Israeli investigations into the conduct of its troops in Gaza continue. A United Nations report released last week also criticized the Israeli military's actions during the offensive in Gaza. It said that Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm's way during their 22-day offensive. The report said investigators had documented and verified reports of violations ""too numerous to list."" A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the report another example of the ""one-sided and unfair"" attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which requested it.","Israeli rights groups angry at speed of military probe into abuse claims .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Members of an anti-government movement that doesn't believe banks can own property are increasingly moving into foreclosed homes in the Atlanta area, according to the FBI. Although he couldn't give exact numbers, Special Agent Stephen Emmett told CNN that the number of ""sovereign citizens"" taking over homes by fraudulent means has grown by the dozens. The skyrocketing increase in foreclosures in Atlanta has provided opportunities for such groups, Emmett said, including the use of fake quit-claim deeds. According to the FBI, sovereign citizens don't believe they need to adhere to federal law. ""As a result, they believe they don't have to answer to any government authority, including courts, taxing entities, motor vehicle departments or law enforcement,"" the agency says. ""They are one step away from becoming domestic terrorists,"" Emmett said. Sovereign citizens have served fraudulent paperwork at banks and courthouses, the agent added. ""It's interesting to note that the homes that sovereign citizens chose to occupy are often high-dollar homes, often in the million-dollar range,"" said Emmett. ""We find (it) very hypocritical that they seek out these nice homes in nice neighborhoods to occupy."" On March 3, a sheriff's department in an Atlanta suburb evicted a couple who had filed invalid papers claiming ownership and stayed in a foreclosed home for months, authorities said. Fearing the pair had guns, the department used a SWAT team. The man was cooperative during the eviction, but had previously made threats to shoot anyone who came on his property, authorities said. ""This threat was made to a representative of the mortgage company and reported to our office,"" said Major Jeff Mitchell of the Clayton County Sheriff's Department . The male resident, who claimed to be associated with the Black Hebrew Israelites, had first gone to court, arguing, ""It would be unfortunate that the people are subject to Sheriff as the peace breaker and promoter of unhappiness, and the people have to protect themselves from the ones employed to protect the people,"" Mitchell said. ""We are working with the FBI to identify possible sovereign citizens living within Clayton County,"" Mitchell said. The man was not arrested because he made no specific threat, according to CNN affiliate WSB. No weapons were found. ""We're definitely seeing an increase in the sovereign citizen movement,"" Sheriff Kemuel Kimbrough Sr. told WSB. ""But this is the first one where we've had significant amount of threats of violence."" The FBI said sovereign citizens are responsible for many crimes, including impersonating police officers, threatening judges and using fake currency and documents. The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, has warned about the movement's growing popularity and calls it a magnet for far-right extremists. ""The sovereign movement is growing fast, and its partisans are clogging up the courts with their indecipherable filings,"" the center said in a report last year. ""When cornered, many of them lash out in rage, frustration and, in the most extreme cases, acts of deadly violence.""","FBI says ""sovereign citizens"" don't recognize most government authority .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- School teachers should be held accountable for the performance of their students, the Conference of Mayors said Tuesday, according to the group's leader. ""The Conference of Mayors unanimously supports student growth over time as a measurement in teachers,"" said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who presides over the conference as president. ""That should be at least one of the elements of their evaluation, and if you ask mayors across the country, they will agree."" The 59-year-old Democrat told reporters that the issues in New York and Los Angeles, the largest and second-largest public school districts in the nation, are similar to those in Chicago, the third-largest, where thousands of teachers have been on strike since Monday. ""These aren't radical notions, and my hope is the parties will sit down and figure it out. The public wants to see more accountability,"" he said. Chicago teachers strike into its third day . The Los Angeles Unified School District has been reviewing a system of teacher and administrator evaluations that, for the first time, includes student test scores, said spokeswoman Ellen Morgan. Several California unions have objected to the Obama administration's $4.3-billion Race To the Top program, which offers federal grants to help states improve failing schools but requires that teacher evaluations factor in student test scores. The 325,000-member California Teachers Association recently supported a California bill that would have included evaluations of teacher performance, but the measure was pulled after 11th-hour attempts to move it forward failed in the legislature. In response to the Obama administration's initiative, CTA spokesman Mike Myslinski said, ""We agree, as long as multiple measures are used beyond just test scores, and the right remains for using test scores to be negotiated locally to meet local student needs."" United Teachers Los Angeles, a union that represents 45,000 public school teachers and health and human services professionals, has been engaged in a legal battle with the Los Angeles Unified School district involving the use of standardized test scores in contract negotiations. Chicago strike could influence teacher accountability debate . Such practices have been shown to be ""very unreliable and often inaccurate at the individual teacher level because there are many home and school influences on learning other than an individual teacher that cannot be addressed,"" according to a study released by the California Department of Education. ""Teachers who have many new immigrant students also suffer low ratings when their students are tested before they have had a chance to learn English,"" it added. UTLA President Warren Fletcher said his union has developed a plan that uses trained evaluators to assess the performance of teachers. ""The plan incorporates data on student outcomes to identify areas of student need and to improve instruction, but test scores are not used for punitive measures,"" he said in a statement. While Villaraigosa has no jurisdiction over the Los Angeles Unified School District, he has focused on changing the education process. ""We've got to engage in the reforms to get more success in our schools, to increase the graduation rate and make sure that more of our kids can read and write when they graduate,"" he said.

"London, England (CNN) -- Airports in Ireland prepared to close overnight Saturday as a drifting ash cloud from an erupting volcano in Iceland prompted the United Kingdom's air traffic authority to close airspace over parts of Northern Ireland. Belfast International, Dublin, Donegal, Sligo and Ireland West (Knock) airports were set to close at 7 a.m. local time, the air traffic authority said. The ash may force more airports to close again next week, the country's Department of Transport said Saturday. If the volcano in Iceland continues to erupt at current levels and if current weather conditions prevail, air travel in Britain could be disrupted between Sunday and Tuesday. ""The government is carefully monitoring this situation and the safety of passengers will remain our paramount concern,"" said Transport Secretary Philip Hammond. The department said predictions remain fluid, urging passengers to check with airlines before taking any action. British Airways said it would notify passengers of potential disruptions on its Web site. ""There is a distinct possibility of some disruption from the ash cloud over the southeast of England but it is too early to tell if this will extend as far as Heathrow or Gatwick yet,"" a BA spokesman told CNN. Volcanic ash had forced the closing of Iceland's main airport Friday but it reopened at midnight and was operating normally on Saturday. Earlier in the week, traffic was shut down in airports from central Spain to the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa. The problems began in mid-April, when the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland erupted and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere, disrupting international travel for several days. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. British ministers agreed Saturday that five-day ash-prediction charts -- the first of which will come out later Saturday -- would now be made available to airlines, other transport providers and the public on the Met Office website. Previously only 18-hour forecasts had been available.

"(CNN) -- Honduras' president ordered troops to take control of a prison on Saturday, a day after a report claimed that inmates have ""internal control"" over all of the country's prisons. President Porfirio Lobo said the military would go into the PenitenciarÃ­a Nacional, or National Penitentiary, following a confrontation there. The Ser Honduras news service reported that three died and 15 were wounded in clashes earlier Saturday. The news came after the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in a report Friday, said that all control at Honduras' 24 prisons ""has been ceded into the hands of the prisoners themselves."" In 2012: At least 13 dead in Honduran prison fire . Due in part to limited staffing, inmates practice ""self-government"" or ""shared government"" at the detention facilities -- a system that includes administering punishment, resolving conflicts and distributing and setting food prices, according to the report. An officer in command at one prison, San Pedro Sula, said that prison authorities ""have no power to change anything,"" according to the multinational organization. Honduran prisons have been criticized for being overcrowded places with poor conditions. The International Centre for Prison Studies, citing February 2010 figures, has said that the country's prisons were operating at 137.9% of capacity.

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- They walked into the office Wednesday, led by Amon Gabriel, 9, and asked to speak to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. He wasn't in the office, the receptionist replied, apologizing. ""Thank you. We'll wait,"" said one of the protesters. The Dream Defenders, like many groups and individuals appalled by Stand Your Ground laws around the nation, aren't seeking a casual sit-down with their elected official; rather, they want to take him to task for defending the self-defense provision. About 30 of them came early Wednesday, and more were expected later in the day. ""I'm upset but I'm not using it in, like, a physical punching way,"" Amon explained. ""I'm using it in a talking and calmly way."" The governor was on business in Pensacola and Panama City, and it wasn't clear when he might return to Tallahassee. The Dream Defenders said they'd stand vigil inside the Capitol, outside the governor's office, 24-7 until Scott agreed to meet. ""We'd like the repeal of stand your ground or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects, where we don't have 17-year-olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families,"" the group's legal and policy director, Ahmad Abuznaid, said. Stevie Wonder says he'll boycott 'stand your ground' states . Though George Zimmerman's defense never cited Stand Your Ground laws in their case, the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations. The jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old. The Florida version of the law states, ""A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" Eight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating residents have no ""duty"" to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations. Stevie Wonder is refusing to perform in any state with such a law. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws ""try to fix something that was never broken"" and now encourage ""violent situations to escalate in public."" But just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measure it helped many states adopt. ""The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it's a fundamental human right,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action. ""To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable."" As for those Dream Defenders hoping to speak with the Florida governor, their protest may be futile. Scott's office noted that a gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place, though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watch to observing and reporting. Daniel Webster, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubts the protests will change anything. Overturning laws isn't incredibly common already, and with Stand Your Ground, there are complicating factors. The NRA is strong in the 22 states that have the laws, and ""I think there is some popular appeal to the notion, the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn't have to, in essence, run from crime."" Also, the laws are relatively new, most of them enacted in the past eight years, and it's unlikely the same legislators who put Stand Your Ground laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong. ""The more common response is they're going to dig their heels,"" he said. As a parallel, Webster offered the ""Draconian"" drug-sentencing laws of the 1980s, which hugely expanded incarceration rates, were outrageously expensive and did little in the way of improving public safety. Yet, the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal. ""I assume, in part, that's because the people who passed them are no longer there,"" Webster said. The trickiest factor, however, is that proponents and opponents of Stand Your Ground can find in the Zimmerman case facts to support their beliefs, he said. One side believes Trayvon attacked Zimmerman, and ZImmerman had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself. The other side believes Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon, followed him against a dispatcher's order, then shot a teen who was only reacting, perhaps out of fear, to being followed. ""You can find whatever you want to back your assumptions,"" Webster said. Putting on his gun policy expert hat, Webster said he felt the laws are a ""very bad idea,"" and they don't do what they were intended to do: deter criminals and protect the citizenry. After Florida expanded its so-called ""Castle Doctrine"" laws to a Stand Your Ground provision in 2005, the National District Attorneys Association released a report. It said a ""diminished sense of public safety"" after 9/11, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to protect victims, a perception that due process trumps victims' rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of Stand Your Ground laws. The study cited concerns from law enforcement officials, including doubts that it would deter criminals. ""There must be appreciation among the would-be criminals that deadly force can be used against them, leading to a change in criminal behavior,"" the study said. ""Unfortunately, attendees at the NDAA symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the Castle Doctrine into consideration before committing a crime."" Webster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed Castle Doctrine or Stand Your Ground laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter. ""The data are pretty compelling, showing that it increased justifiable homicides and it increased homicides overall,"" Webster said. ""In all likelihood, it really led to more altercations similar to the Zimmerman-Martin exchange.""

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- North Korea launched a scathing personal attack on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday after she likened the leadership in Pyongyang to ""small children and unruly teenagers and people who are demanding attention."" Hillary Clinton says N. Korea's refusal to discuss nuclear program could provoke arms race. At a meeting of southeast Asian nations in Phuket, Thailand, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman blasted Clinton for what he called a ""spate of vulgar remarks unbecoming for her position everywhere she went since she was sworn in,"" according to the state-run KCNA news agency. The spokesman called Clinton ""by no means intelligent"" and a ""funny lady."" ""Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,"" the statement said. Read other colorful insults by N. Korea . The verbal tussle between the two countries culminated with the reclusive communist state making it clear that six-party nuclear talks, stalled for over a year, were effectively finished. Clinton had earlier warned that North Korea's refusal to discuss its nuclear program could escalate tensions and provoke an arms race in northeast Asia.  Watch as North Korea insults Clinton » . ""I was gratified by how many countries from throughout the region spoke up and expressed directly to the North Korea delegation their concerns over the provocative behavior we have seen over the last few months,"" Clinton said at a meeting of southeast Asian nations in Phuket, Thailand. ""Unfortunately, the North Korean delegation offered only an insistent refusal to recognize that North Korea has been on the wrong course,"" she said. ""They expressed no willingness to pursue the path of denuclearization. In their presentation today, they evinced no willingness to pursue the path of denuclearization, and that was troubling not only to the United States, but to the region and the international community."" Her remarks came after the North Koreans issued their blunt statement in response to Clinton's interview earlier in the week with ABC News. Before Clinton's remarks in Phuket on Thursday, the North Korean delegation attempted to take the podium to speak to the media. But it was turned away by security guards. North Korea tested a nuclear device in May and fired seven ballistic missiles earlier this month in defiance of a U.N. resolution. At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting, Clinton said she had unanimous support for U.N. Resolution 1874, passed by the Security Council in June. It tightened sanctions on North Korea, imposing an embargo on the shipment of arms from that nation. The North protested the resolution by saying it would enrich uranium and weaponize plutonium, according to KCNA. When enriched to a high degree, uranium can be used as weapons-grade material. Plutonium can be used in atomic bombs. Clinton said the United States will continue to push North Korea to come to the table. She said a ""full normalization of relationships"" was possible if North Korea agreed to a verifiable dismantling of its nuclear program. ""The United States and its allies and partners cannot accept a North Korea that tries to maintain nuclear weapons, to launch ballistic missiles or to proliferate nuclear materials,"" Clinton said. ""We are committed to the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner."" The United States has also expressed concern that military cooperation between North Korea and Myanmar could destabilize the region. CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report from Bangkok, Thailand.","N. Korea launches personal attack on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent drop in third-quarter profits, as the company announced its results Thursday. Customers check Sony's Bravia brand LCD TVs at an electronics shop in Tokyo, Japan. Profits for the quarter, which ended December 31, fell from nearly 200 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in 2007 to about 10 billion yen ($110 million) in 2008. Across the company, sales were down 25 percent, but electronics and games sales were especially hard hit. Sales of games, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent over the year. Sales of electronics decreased by nearly 30 percent. The appreciation of the yen also cut into profits. A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to lower their profit margins to keep prices the same. Last week, Sony warned that it will close out the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with an operating loss of 260 billion yen ($2.9 billion), its first in 14 years.

"Moscow (CNN) -- A friend of mine who grew up in a small Soviet town realized he was gay by age 15. He did not know the word but he could no longer deny that he was sexually attracted to boys, not girls. He had no idea what it meant and felt rather lost. So, he went to see a kind, elderly doctor and hesitantly asked the question. After a stretch of uncomfortable silence, the doctor said quietly, ""Take a lot of vitamin C and hopefully it'll get better with time. ... But most importantly, don't ever mention this to anyone."" Homosexuality was a criminal offense under the Soviets, and the doctor was trying to protect his stammering teenage patient. When my friend told me this story many years later, we had a good laugh, agreeing that though things weren't easy for gay people in Russia, you did not have to stay shut in that closet for life. This was before disgraceful homophobic legislation was adopted in June. The new law bans dissemination among minors of information promoting the ""attractiveness of nontraditional sexual relationships"" and providing a ""distorted notion of social equivalence of traditional and nontraditional sexual relationships."" It does not define ""nontraditional"" but it is widely understood to mean ""homosexual."" And it basically means that you cannot publicly say anything positive about being gay or tell a child that there is nothing wrong with being gay or being raised by gay parents. It seems that the Kremlin underestimated the prominence of the international LGBT rights movement and the damage the law would do to Russia's image, especially with the Sochi Olympics just months away, the host country being so much in the spotlight. Russia's failure to honor the Olympic Charter's requirement of nondiscrimination came under scrutiny as the International Olympic Committee continued to seek assurances that enforcement of the law would not affect the games. Russian officials at the highest level have been trying to smooth over the scandal. President Vladamir Putin himself said in a recent interview that in Russia ""people of nontraditional sexual orientation are not discriminated against"" and that they are valued and equal citizens of the Russian Federation. Putin even noted that he was open to a discussion with LGBT organizations. That's welcome, but is he to be trusted? As is often the case here, it's one step forward and two steps backward. So far no meeting with LGBT activists has been convened and there have been no efforts to have the heinous law repealed. Worse, several legislators have just introduced a bill to deny parental rights to one or both parents of ""nontraditional sexual orientation."" The main author of the bill and a member of the ruling party's faction in the State Duma, Alexei Zhuravlev, explained that the bill aims to ""protect"" children from psychological trauma and pertains to those parents who ""do not conceal their same-sex sexual relationships."" The message sent to LGBT people is clear: If you don't want your kids taken away from you you'd better keep your mouth shut. And it is particularly ironic that just days later in his much discussed New York Times op-ed on Syria, Vladimir Putin urged the Americans not to forget that ""God created us all equal."" People in Russia would've laughed if only things weren't getting bad enough to cry.

"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition forces may have executed as many as 30 people, most of them government soldiers, in rural Aleppo, according to the United Nations, which cited videos of the killings posted on the Internet in July. U.N High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called the allegations ""deeply shocking"" and called Friday for an independent investigation into the incident, which appears to have taken place in Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. ""There needs to be a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed, and those responsible for such crimes should be brought to justice,"" Pillay said in a statement. The videos, posted to the Internet between July 22 and 26, show government soldiers being ordered to lie on the ground, bodies being collected by doctors, corpses strewn along a wall and bodies in Khan al-Assal bearing gunshot wounds to the head. Pillay's office also has information that Syrian rebels are still holding government officers and soldiers prisoner, the statement said. Reminding opposition forces that all captured or wounded soldiers must be treated in accordance with international law, Pillay said, ""Opposition forces should not think they are immune from prosecution. They must adhere to their responsibilities under international law."" The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic has previously said both rebel groups and government forces and their affiliated militias are demonstrating ""emerging patterns of summary execution and murder."" News of the killings came as the Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella group for the opposition, said 19 of its loyalists had been killed, including two children. Most of the deaths came in Damascus, the LCC said. In a speech to government forces Thursday -- Army Foundation Day -- President Bashar al-Assad said he was confident the government would triumph over the opposition, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. ''Had we in Syria not been confident of victory, we would not have been able to remain steadfast and resist the aggression for over two years,'' the president said, according to SANA, . The U.N. human rights office also said Friday that investigators have been allowed to visit rebel-controlled Khan al-Assal as part of a separate investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons. The rebels announced Friday they had written U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, requesting an investigation and demanding ""that any individuals found to be involved in the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria be held accountable for these crimes."" According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began. Almost 2 million have fled the country, and 4 million more have been internally displaced.

"(CNN) -- The most impressive feature of the new iPhone 5S may be its ability to turn your finger into a password. Touch ID is Apple's name for a new fingerprint scanner that would act as a security tool for log-ins and for making purchases from iTunes and other Apple stores. ""Your fingerprint is one of the best passwords in the world,"" said Dan Riccio, a senior vice president for hardware design at Apple, in a promotional video. ""It's always with you and no two are exactly alike."" Apple unveiled the iPhone 5S, along with a cheaper, simpler iPhone 5C, at an event Tuesday at the company's California headquarters. On the new 5S, the Home button will be made of sapphire crystal and act as a reader. According to Apple a fingerprint -- up to five prints from different users, depending on who else shares your phone -- can be read by the sensor from any angle to give access the same way a password does currently. The fingerprint data is encrypted, Riccio said, and stored internally on the phone. ""It's never available to other software and it's never stored on Apple's servers or backed up to iCloud,"" he said. The iPhone isn't the first phone to have a fingerprint sensor. In 2011, the Motorola ATRIX 4G included one, though adoption among users wasn't particularly high and the company eventually discontinued the feature. And at least one Android phone to be released this year also will have the technology, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Some laptops and PCs have had fingerprint readers for several years now. But the technology has never really caught on, with users often complaining about them being balky and unreliable. Maybe Apple can change that. ""Fingerprint sensors have come a long way,"" said Michael Barrett, president of the Fast Identity Online Alliance, an industry group advocating for universal security authentication tools. ""They are by and large much better quality now and very readily able to detect 'Is this just an image of a finger or a real-life finger?'"" But while he called Touch ID ""an exciting announcement,"" Barrett still sees some problems. First, he said, fingerprint scanning still isn't perfect. He mentioned his wife, an artist, who has trouble accessing her PC with a fingerprint scanner when she's been working with plaster, which dries out her hands. ""Like many biometrics, it falls slightly into 'your mileage may vary,'"" he said. ""If it works for you, great. But it may not work for you all the time."" The former chief information security officer at PayPal, Barrett also sees limitations to using the system for online purchases. While it may work fine on iTunes or in the App Store, it's not likely other Web retailers are going to spend millions of dollars to make their systems accommodate an Apple feature used on fewer than 17 percent of the world's smartphones. That means iPhone 5S owners who used Touch ID for purchases inside Apple's ""walled garden"" would still need to use other security tools to shop elsewhere with the same phone. David Rogers, director of the Columbia Business School's Digital Marketing program and executive director of its Center for Global Brand Leadership, called Touch ID one of several ""nice,"" but ultimately underwhelming, features on the iPhone 5S. ""Touch ID ... could have been that killer app. But so far, it's just a feature that saves you a couple seconds logging in,"" he said. ""If they can manage to link it to multiple profiles on a device, like the new Google Nexus tablets, or make it a password to controlling smart devices in the home -- your stereo, thermostat, etc. -- that could make for a truly killer feature. But they just didn't get there today."" Paco Hope, principal consultant at software security firm Cigital, said that, if nothing else, Apple will widely expand the public's understanding of the use of biometrics in the digital world. ""People's ideas about biometrics were as informed by Hollywood as they were by real products and experiences,"" he said. ""Now, when someone asks the value of a fingerprint scanner, we can point to the iPhone and use it as a reference, for better or worse. ""Esoteric and academic theories of usability, reliability, false positives, false negatives, and so on will suddenly be tested by millions of real users in real situations.""","On the iPhone 5S, Touch ID uses your fingerprint for security .

The area is a fertile fishing ground and is believed to hold large oil and gas reserves under its seabed. Tensions between China and the Philippines soared last year during a naval standoff over a remote rocky outcrop in a disputed part of the sea.

"(CNN) -- Severe weather's assault on middle America continued Tuesday, as tornadoes and thunderstorms pulverized communities and claimed at least six lives in Oklahoma and Kansas. Twisters also brewed in Dallas and several northern Texas counties, according to the National Weather Service, with at least one tornado reported on the ground. There was no rest for the weary and grieving. Joplin, Missouri, where 124 died in a tornado Sunday, was briefly under a tornado warning late Tuesday, but it was later lifted. Still, the city braced for high winds. Two motorists died when an uprooted tree slammed into their van in Stafford County, Kansas, according to the state adjutant general's office. The deadly string of tornadoes that rampaged through central Oklahoma killed at least four people, injured dozens and destroyed homes and vehicles, officials said. Canadian County, Oklahoma, Sheriff Randall Edwards told CNN a large tornado that crossed I-40 near El Reno destroyed residences and caused a gas leak at an energy plant west of the state capital. Four people died in the county, said Cherokee Ballard, spokesperson for the state medical examiner. The twister injured motorists on I-40 and U.S. 81, Canadian County Emergency Management Director Jerry Smith said. There were reports of property damage in the area. El Reno city spokesman Terry Floyd said 20 workers were injured at a drilling rig. Police and fire crews are searching for a missing 3-year-old old child in Piedmont, northwest of Oklahoma City, according to an emergency services worker who asked not to be named because she was not authorized to speak to the media. ""Our town is totally leveled,"" she said. ""All you can find now is debris and foundations,"" said the emergency services worker, her voice cracking with emotion. ""We're still searching for survivors. We'll be here all night."" Another tornado was seen at Chickasha, about 40 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. It later reached Newcastle, before pushing through Moore and Norman, suburbs of Oklahoma City. The National Weather Service warned residents and I-44 drivers to take precautionary action. About 1,200 people packed a shelter in Newcastle, a bedroom community near Oklahoma City, during the storm, said City Manager Nick Nazar. ""That saved lives."" ""We have been extremely lucky,"" he said. ""Minor injuries so far."" About 100 people were displaced, and 50 homes were rendered uninhabitable, Nazar told CNN. Two or three businesses were damaged, as was an elementary school. Statewide, at least 60 people were hurt and nearly 58,000 homes lost power, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. The tornado that passed through Chickasha also damaged several other communities, including Newcastle. ""It came right past the store,"" said Chickasha AutoZone employee Nathaniel Charlton. ""They had a little debris thrown across the parking lot. It was on the ground, but it wasn't bad."" Sirens went off about 20 minutes before the storm pushed through, Charlton told CNN. State officials received reports of damaged businesses in Chickasha. ""This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,"" the National Weather Service said during the storms. No tornado damage was immediately reported within Oklahoma City's borders. Some employees at the weather agency's Storm Prediction Center in Norman briefly took shelter as a tornado approached, a spokesman told CNN. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin cited the storms' intensity. ""We're still not out of the woods yet,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper as strong storms moved across her state Tuesday evening. First responders were heading toward communities that have reported damage to homes, Fallin said. Randy McCown, administrator at First Baptist Church of Piedmont, said the church was operating as a shelter for residents. CNN Oklahoma City affiliates broadcast images of funnel clouds that dumped rain as they moved into more populated areas. KWTV broadcast images of destroyed and damaged homes in El Reno. The University of Oklahoma, based in Norman, on Tuesday afternoon suspended classes at its three campuses. At Norman's Tarahumara Restaurant, which specializes in Mexican food, all 20 employees showed up for work, though none of the customers did for nearly two hours preceding the storm's arrival, said manager Juan de Leon. As the storm struck at about 5:45 p.m., he and the wait staff watched news programs on the restaurant's 10 television sets in fear, he said. But when it hit, they were unimpressed. ""Just rain,"" said de Leon in a telephone interview. ""It looked like normal rain."" Hail was mixed in, but the bits of ice were nothing special, ""little bitty ones,"" he said. Two hours later, he said, the restaurant had filled up and it was business as usual. Tornado watches were in effect Tuesday evening in Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas. In anticipation of the severe weather, American Airlines canceled 126 arriving and departing flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, spokesman Ed Martelle told CNN. Operations were suspended late Tuesday afternoon at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City. A tornado was reported Tuesday in the Texas community of Bedford. The tornado that struck Joplin on Sunday killed at least 124 people, authorities said Tuesday, making it the deadliest single U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began more than 60 years ago.

"(CNN) -- A cat and mouse game is being played out in Russia involving Alexei Navalny, Russia's best known anti-corruption campaigner. Its consequences could cast a shadow over the future of the Putin regime. Navalny, who has announced his candidacy for mayor of Moscow, achieved prominence by producing a blog that provided detailed reports on the corruption of Russian state-run companies, including the theft of $4 billion by executives from Transneft, the state-owned pipeline company. What's behind Navalny's conviction? When massive protests broke out after the falsified December 4, 2011, parliamentary elections, Navalny emerged as one of its leaders and in the eyes of many, a future Russian presidential candidate. All this seemingly came to an end when Navalny was sentenced to five years in a labor camp on July 18 after being convicted of misappropriating roughly $500,000 worth of state-owned timber while he served as an adviser to the governor of the Kirov region. Before the trial, Navalny predicted his conviction. ""They didn't fabricate this case in order to allow an (acquittal),"" he said. The day after the conviction, however, the state prosecutor stunned observers by requesting that Navalny be freed on bail so he could continue to campaign for mayor of Moscow. Navalny is now free to campaign against Sergei Sobianin, the Kremlin-backed candidate, who has 73% of support in the opinion polls. Opinion: Putin, a hypocrite on Snowden, Navalny . This seeming act of generosity, however, may have a hidden motive. Elections in Russia do not resemble elections in the West. The core of a victorious candidate's support is generally passive voters who are threatened at their place of work, bribed with small gifts or favors or bussed to the polling places where they can vote under the watchful eyes of their supervisors. It is this system that accounts for the electoral ""success"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the 2012 elections and that of the United Russia Party (described by Navalny as the ""party of swindlers and crooks"") in the last parliamentary elections. The system suffers from one defect: The results lack legitimacy. For this reason, the authorities may actually want Navalny to campaign against Sobanian. His principal accusation against the regime is that it is corrupt. But it will be more difficult to make that argument now that he himself has been convicted of corruption, however unfairly. If, despite all calculations, Navalny begins to pose an electoral threat, a higher court can uphold Navalny's conviction at any time and he can be jailed and his candidacy terminated. Almost from the beginning of the Putin era, the regime has responded to opposition by accusing its opponents of corruption. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the Yukos oil company, was convicted of tax evasion and fraud after he used his wealth to finance opposition political parties. Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who exposed the theft of $230 million in a tax fraud scheme by high officials, was tortured to death in prison and then, in an almost unprecedented move, was found guilty of tax evasion posthumously. The cat and mouse game with Navalny is part of this tradition. But it may not be enough to save the regime from the anger of the people. In Russia, the corruption market is valued by the Indem think tank at more than $300 billion annually, or more than a quarter of the GDP. Russians pay bribes to obtain contracts, to get licenses and permissions, to avoid inspections, to get medical treatment or get their children into universities. Moreover, the chain of corruption rises to the very top. It has been credibly reported that Putin has a personal fortune of more than $40 billion and that he and his closest cronies control 10% to 15% of the Russian gross national product. Under these circumstances, the regime may be sitting on a time bomb. According to a report cited by the Russian Academy of Sciences, 34% of Russians ""always"" wish they could shoot bribe takers. Another 38% ""sometimes"" wish they could do so. In Moscow, the number of people who are disgusted with bribe takers is even higher. Two-thirds of Muscovites would gun them down. The Russian leaders periodically announce drives against corruption and may even arrest a few of their own officials in order to convince the population that they are taking action. The reality, however, is that corruption is integral to the Putin system in which loyalty is rewarded with the freedom to steal, ostensibly private businesses prosper only because they have connections to officials and are therefore, in effect, state-protected monopolies and the system of justice is totally subordinate to the economic interests of the highest ranking state officials. . Independent reformers like Navalny pose a serious threat to this system, which is why they have to be persecuted. But the failure to reform the system means its inner contradictions will only grow, setting the stage for a deeper crisis in the years ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Satter.","David Satter: A cat and mouse game is being played out in Russia on Alexei Navalny .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Chicago public schoolchildren will spend a seventh day out of classes Tuesday as their striking teachers weigh a tentative proposal to end their walkout. School officials went to court Monday to ask a judge to declare the strike illegal and order the teachers back to work. A Cook County judge will hold a hearing on that request Wednesday. In the meantime, Chicago Teachers Union delegates are scheduled to convene again Tuesday afternoon to discuss a proposed settlement. And parents and city officials scrambled to keep about 350,000 children busy and out of trouble as the strike stretched into its second week. ""It is frustrating for me that the kids are not in school, and I have to find other ways to continue their education,"" said parent Will White, who said he's sympathetic to both sides in the dispute. ""Hopefully, it won't last too much longer ... after this week, something's going to have to change."" Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest U.S. school system, and the union struck a tentative bargain Friday afternoon. But Sunday, union members decided to continue the walkout while its they reviewed the proposal. ""We have 26,000 teachers, and they're all able to to read this document and take some time to discuss its merits or its deficiencies, and that's going to happen today,"" union spokesman Jackson Potter told CNN. ""We're just asking people to be patient and let the process run its course."" Q&A: What's behind the Chicago teachers' strike? But Mayor Rahm Emanuel vowed Sunday night to force the teachers back into the classroom, calling the teachers' move ""a delay of choice that is wrong for our children."" The school system went to court Monday morning, arguing that the walkout violates Illinois labor laws. ""State law expressly prohibits the CTU from striking over non-economic issues, such as layoff and recall policies, teacher evaluations, class sizes and the length of the school day and year,"" the district said in a statement. ""The CTU's repeated statements and recent advertising campaign have made clear that these are exactly the subjects over which the CTU is striking."" The strike also prevents ""critical educational and social services, including meals for students who otherwise may not receive proper nutrition, a safe environment during school hours and critical services for students who have special needs,"" the district continued. Cook County Circuit Judge Peter Flynn has scheduled a hearing on the district's request for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday. The system isn't asking the judge to settle the dispute that led to the walkout, just to order the teachers back to work. The union responded to the filing Monday by saying it ""appears to be a vindictive act instigated by the mayor."" ""This attempt to thwart our democratic process is consistent with Mayor Emanuel's bullying behavior toward public school educators,"" the union said. Teachers walked off the job September 10, objecting to a longer school day, evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings. Parents have juggled their families' schedules for more than a week to make sure their children are attended to while schools are closed. ""Besides the daycare issue, they just need to be in school,"" said Rich Lenkov, a parent who took part in a protest outside the school district's headquarters on Monday. ""Their competitors in charter schools and private schools are learning, while our kids are not."" Interview with a parent on the impact of the strike . With the strike continuing, the school system planned to open 147 ""Children First"" sites citywide Monday for students to go to, in addition to programs run by the city's park department and neighborhood organizations, Chicago Board of Education President David Vitale said. Vitale said that he, like the mayor, is ""extremely disappointed"" that such programs are necessary. ""There is no reason why our kids cannot be in school while the union reviews the agreement,"" he said. But Nancy Davis Winfield, the mother of another student, said she stood behind the teachers and the union. ""I think its going to be settled this week, but I understand what the teachers are doing and they've got to read that fine print,"" Winfield said as she picked up her daughter at a Children First program in the South Loop district. ""I feel that the whole nation needs to understand that this is a fight for the middle class,"" Winfield said. ""Democrats are talking about supporting the middle class. This is the fight that has to be waged."" Union members reconvene Tuesday afternoon following a break on Monday for the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah. They could decide to end the strike at that point, which could mean classes coming back Wednesday. But the rank and file would still have the opportunity to accept or reject the proposed contract, and CTU President Karen Lewis said a ""clear majority"" of their delegates did not want to suspend the strike. ""They are not happy with the agreement,"" she said. Why they teach despite it all . Negotiations have taken place behind closed doors while the public debate has been marked by sometimes biting remarks and vocal picketing around the schools. Lewis said one problem is that ""there's no trust"" of school board members, with job security the chief issue. ""The big elephant in the room is the closing of 200 schools,"" she said. The teacher ""are concerned about this city's decision on some level to close schools."" It was not immediately clear where Lewis got the 200 figure or when she believes such school closures might happen. But Chicago Public Schools spokeswoman Marielle Sainvilus called Lewis' claim ""false,"" asserting that union leaders said a few days ago that 100 schools would close, and ""I'm sure it'll be another number tomorrow."" ""All Ms. Lewis is trying to do is distract away from the fact that she and her leadership are using our kids as pawns in this process,"" Sainvilus wrote in an e-mail. Another point of contention involves the teacher evaluation system, Lewis said. The tentative contract would change it for the first time since 1967, taking into account ""student growth (for the) first time,"" according to the school system. And teachers who are rated as ""unsatisfactory and developing"" could potentially be laid off. Principals would keep ""full authority"" to hire teachers, and the school system will now have hiring standards for those with credentials beyond a teacher certification. In addition, ""highly rated teachers"" who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can ""follow their students to the consolidated school,"" according to a summary of the proposed contract from Chicago Public Schools. This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more ""instructional days"" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school. The pay structure would change with a 3% pay hike for the first year of the contract, 2% for the second year and 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, teachers will get a 3% pay increase. Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates would be frozen, and the ""enhanced pension program"" would be eliminated. As is, the median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $67,974, according to the system's annual financial report. For high school athletes, strike could put scholarships on the line . CNN's Kyung Lah reported from Chicago and Greg Botelho from Atlanta.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Floods resulting from monsoon rains have killed 422 people and left nearly 3,000 injured across Pakistan, a disaster agency spokesman said Saturday. Some 350,000 people have been forced from their homes and another 4.7 million people affected by the flooding since August 22, Ahmed Kamal of the National Disaster Management Authority said. More than 15,000 villages have been affected and many houses destroyed or damaged in the past five weeks, he said. Pakistan has suffered a series of devastating inundations, affecting millions of people, in recent years. Pakistan, India hit by deadly flooding . Flooding last year killed 470 people and impacted 9.1 million others, Kamal said. In the worst-affected area of Sindh province, in southeastern Pakistan, the waters submerged more than 4.5 million acres of farming land, damaging an estimated 80% of cash crops. Many in the country were at that point barely recovering from massive and deadly flooding in August 2010, which left a fifth of the country submerged by water, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. Those floods lasted for weeks, affecting more than 20 million people and leaving 1,985 people dead, Kamal said. Much of the land inundated in 2010 was in Punjab province, Pakistan's breadbasket, where many people live off the soil and their livestock. Great hardship followed for millions in the wake of the flooding.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court in Washington Thursday struck down the Texas voter ID law requiring photos for voters at the polls, calling it racially discriminatory. The decision is a major victory for the Obama administration and its Democratic allies, which had challenged the law. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Republican Gov. Rick Perry signed the voter ID measure into law last year, but it had yet not gone into effect because the federal Voting Rights Act requires changes in Texas voting laws to be pre-cleared by the U.S. Justice Department. Attorney General Eric Holder denied the pre-clearance of the measure in March, concluding that Texas failed to show the law will not have ""the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race."" The three-judge panel agreed. Although the law provides for approved voter registration certificates with no photo as acceptable for voting in certain circumstances, the court said the law imposes ""strict unforgiving burdens on the poor."" The court noted the requirements will fall heavily on African-Americans and Hispanics, who make up a disproportionate percentage of the poor in Texas. The panel of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also said it was ruling only on the Texas law, and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws. It noted the Justice Department had approved a Georgia voter ID law in which the state promised to provide free photo ID cards to citizens who request them. Eric Holder defends opposition to proposed Texas voter ID law . Holder praised the court's decision Thursday. ""Under the proposed law, many of those without the required voter identification would be forced to travel great distances to get one -- and some would have to pay for the documents they might need to do so,"" said a statement from the attorney general. Holder also repeated his assertion that the law would discriminate against minorities. Abbott, meanwhile, said Texas will immediately take the case to the nation's highest court, where ""we are confident we will prevail."" He said the Supreme Court had already approved similar ballot integrity safeguards passed in Georgia and Indiana. The ruling comes as another three-judge panel in Washington is hearing arguments this week on a similar law passed in South Carolina. Republican-dominated legislatures say such laws are designed to eliminate voter fraud. Democrats claim there is no voter fraud issue, and that the laws are designed to reduce voting by poor minorities. ""Chalk up another victory for fraud,"" said Gov. Perry, in a statement on his website. ""Federal judges subverted the will of the people of Texas and undermined our effort to ensure fair and accurate elections. The Obama administration's claim that it's a burden to present a photo ID to vote simply defies common sense. I will continue to work with Attorney General Abbott to fight for the same right that other states already have to protect their elections."" The Texas law said those who are 65 or older, disabled or expect to be absent on Election Day may vote by mail without presenting identification. Earlier this month, a state court in Pennsylvania approved a voter ID law requiring photo identification at the polls.

"(CNN) -- For hours at a time, Ronaldo Marcelo Wanderlei da Silva pedals on a stationary bike for a cause. But it is not an ordinary bike, nor an ordinary cause. Da Silva is an inmate at the prison in Santa Rita do Sapucai,Brazil, near Sao Paulo. He is among a small group of inmates who have been given the chance to lower their sentences by exercising on customized stationary bikes attached to car batteries that charge as they pedal. The batteries are in turn used to power street lights in the local plaza. The program exists only at this one prison, but is not the only recent effort at out-of-the-box thinking in Brazil's penal system. Jose Henrique Mallmann, a judge in Santa Rita do Sapucai, came up with the idea for the pedaling program while doing internet searches for cost-free, clean energy sources. It was a personal curiosity, he said, and it led him to a story about an American gym that is partly powered by its patrons' bicycle workouts. In his small city, it was easy to adapt the idea and put it in practice with the local prison, he said. The program provides a type of poetic justice, he said. Most inmates at some point deprived a sense of security from their victims. Now, by providing clean energy that powers the city's plaza at night, they are providing a sense of security. ""This has been very well received. We are very satisfied with the public reaction,"" Mallmann said. Brazil's prisons, by and large, are overcrowded and unpleasant places. According to the ministry of justice, Brazil's prisons are at 167% of capacity, as of December 2011. The prison population has more than doubled since 2001. But new initiatives are finding creative ways to address these issues while helping inmates and society at the same time. Another recent program -- this one at the federal level -- allows inmates to reduce their sentence for reading books. The idea is to help inmates be better prepared for success when they reintegrate with the outside world. Inmates can shave four days off their sentence through each book they read, up to 48 days per year, the new law states. The ""Redemption Through Reading"" program, as it's known, requires the inmates to write a book report. The law goes as far as to specify that these reports must be written neatly and must not stray from the topic of the book. The books available to inmates will include literary classics and scientific and philosophical tomes, among others. ""There is very alarming crisis in the penal system,"" said Leonardo Schmitt de Bem, a Brazilian professor and expert on criminal law. ""Proposals like this, which reduce sentences and give a social and cultural foundation to people are very interesting."" The reading program addresses the overcrowding problem and gives inmates a cultural foundation, he said. Reading is an important tool because a large percentage of Brazilian prisoners come from poor backgrounds and have little education. Nearly half of Brazilian inmates -- 46% -- have not completed more than nine years of basic education, according to the ministry of justice. More than 26,000 prisoners (5%) are illiterate. The new law gives inmates something to do, and better prepares them for then they reintegrate with society, de Bem said. ""It is a necessary measure given the prison crisis in Brazil,"" he said. The program has existed for several years, but was codified into the law just last month. It is a ""pioneering"" initiative, de Bem said, but would have much greater impact if it were imposed on all prisons, not just the federal ones, which hold just a fraction of the country's inmates. In Santa Rita do Sapucai, Mallmann says he has bigger dreams than having inmates powering street lamps. He envisions a system where the battery power is converted into electricity that can be used to power houses. In the short term, the goal is to power the city's entire plaza with clean energy produced by the prisoners. Currently, there are four bicycles that require 10 hours of pedaling to fully charge one battery. The energy is enough to power 10 street lamps, out of 34 lamps that provide light for the plaza. Authorities hope to expand the number of bikes to 10 in the near future, Mallmann said. For every 16 hours of pedaling, inmates have their sentences reduced by one day, with no maximum on how much they can bike, he said. Da Silva, the inmate at the Santa Rita do Sapucai prison, said at first the prison population didn't know what to make of the stationary bicycles, but estimates that now, some 80% of prisoners want to participate. ""I started to learn more about the project and only then I understood how important it is for the city,"" he said. For now, there are two teams of four inmates who were chosen to participate, based on their good behavior. ""The project is very good for the prisoners, it shows the good they can do,"" he said. Da Silva is serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for assault, and has erased 20 days off his punishment since he began pedaling two months ago, he said. The 36-year-old said that the time on the bike also gives him time to reflect on his situation. While he's pedaling, ""I think about my imprisonment, about my freedom, my wife, my kids,"" he said.","New alternatives to reduce prison sentences in Brazil have emerged .
In one city, inmates can pedal bikes that produce clean energy .
At federal level, prisoners can read books to shorten jail time .
Programs address prison overcrowding and help inmates ."
"(CNN) -- A vulture captured by Sudanese authorities is actually an Israeli spy on a secret reconnaissance mission, a pro-government newspaper in the east African nation has claimed. Government sources say the vulture, found in western Sudan, was tagged with a GPS-equipped camera to take and send pictures back to Israel, according to a December 8 story in the Alintibaha newspaper. The bird also wore an ankle label reading ""Hebrew University Jerusalem,"" ""Israel Nature Service"" and the contact details of an Israeli avian ecologist. The ecologist, Ohad Hatzofe of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, has rejected the Sudanese government claims -- saying the vulture, which can fly up to 600 kilometers in a single day, was tagged with GPS equipment to study its migration pattern. ""The Sudanese accusations are untrue,"" Hatzofe told CNN. ""The GPS gear on these vultures can only tell us where the birds are, nothing else."" He said: ""This is ordinary equipment that is used around the world to detect movement of wildlife. There are hundreds of studies using this technology on everything from butterflies and sea turtles to sharks and whales."" Hatzofe also cast doubt on the practicality of using vultures as secret agents: ""I'm not an intelligence expert, but what would be learned from putting a camera onto a vulture? You cannot control it. It's not a drone that you can send where you want. What would be the benefit of watching a vulture eat the insides of a dead camel?"" The Griffon vulture is an endangered species in the Middle East, according to Hebrew University Jerusalem professor Ran Nathan. His students, Roi Harel and Orr Spiegel, tagged more than 100 vultures -- 25 of them with GPS trackers -- as part of a project to observe the behavior and movement of younger vultures. Hatzofe says the data from the tagged GPS vultures isn't transmitted solely back to Israel, but to the animal-tracking website Movebank, where other scientists can analyze the data. The Israeli scientists first knew something was amiss in early December, when the GPS system (pictured above) indicated the vulture was on the ground and was moving along a road in western Sudan. The Griffon vulture is not a migratory bird, but it isn't uncommon for them to make their way into northern Africa, according to Hatzofe, who says the vulture's wing tag included a message asking anyone who found the bird to contact him or the university. ""My email address is on the vulture,"" he told CNN, ""but I never got a message."" The Israeli government declined to comment on this story, and repeated calls to Sudanese officials went unanswered. Hatzofe says that the real danger of claiming that GPS-tagged birds are spies is that it could prompt government officials to kill animals they capture. ""There is nothing new about birds tagged for studies, and if governments will not reject these types of rumors, then others will grab their weapons and hunt down wildlife -- the exact opposite of what conservationists want."" CNN's Dominique van Heerden contributed to this report.","Sudan: Israeli vulture with GPS-equipped camera caught by officials in western Sudan .

"New York (CNN) -- A Manhattan mother returned home early Thursday evening to find two of her young children stabbed to death in a bathtub, as their nanny lay bleeding nearby, police said. The mother, 38, had just returned around 5:30 p.m. to the family apartment on Manhattan's West Side with her 3-year-old daughter, who she had just taken to swimming lessons, police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. All the lights were out in the residence, so she went downstairs to ask the doorman whether her two other children and their nanny had gone outside. After the doorman said they had not, the mother went back upstairs and started looking around, Kelly said. Peering into a bathroom, she let out a scream upon finding her 1-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter stabbed to death in the bathtub, according to Kelly. The children's 50-year-old nanny was on the bathroom floor unconscious and bleeding from what appeared to be self-inflicted stab wounds to her neck, Kelly said. A kitchen knife sat next to her, according to police spokesman Paul Browne. A neighbor, Sandy Marcus, told CNN that she called 911 after hearing the mother's screams. Another neighbor recalled it was hard to ascertain what was going on since ""everybody was screaming."" The children were taken to Roosevelt Hospital and pronounced dead. The father of the children is Kevin Krim, an executive with CNBC , several officials familiar with the investigation said. The nanny is at St. Luke's Hospital, also in New York, in critical but stable condition, according to Kelly. No charges have been filed yet in the case, he added. Klein described the family at the center of the horror as ""all-American"" and ""lovely."" ""It's like something you read about in the papers, in some distant country, but never on your floor,"" she said.

"Montreal, Canada (CNN) -- Canadians expressed outrage Thursday after the release of Guy Turcotte, a cardiologist who in 2009 confessed to killing his children as they slept in their beds. What many wanted to know was how a father who stabbed his children dozens of times could be free after 46 months of confinement. Those voices echo the grief of Turcotte's ex-wife, Dr. Isabelle Gaston, the mother of 5-year-old Olivier and 3-year-old Anne-Sophie. As Gaston pored over her children's autopsy reports, she wished she had no idea what they meant. But as a physician and a coroner, she knows it's true: Her children suffered a long, gruesome death. ""I knew it was not a short death. You know, my little boy received 20 stabs of a knife, he had seven marks of defense,"" she told CNN in an interview at her home before Turcotte's full release. ""He had no wound that was the one that gave him death,"" she added, trying to hold back tears. ""My little girl, she had 19 wounds, maybe she was luckier? Because she had one that was more mortal than the other. But she felt 19 shots, that's for sure,"" Gaston said. Turcotte confessed to killing his children in February 2009 but a year later a Canadian jury failed to convict him of the murders, finding him not criminally responsible due to mental illness. At trial, Turcotte testified that he was distraught over his crumbling marriage and snapped, insisting he blacked out and doesn't remember killing his children. The jury believed the testimony of two psychiatrists paid for by his defense. They testified that Turcotte could not have known what he was doing when he repeatedly stabbed his children. ""Why don't I accept that he is mentally ill is when I look at the facts,"" Gaston said. ""We have a person that is a cardiologist that never had a psychiatric incident, not at all. I have trouble to understand how someone in five hours or six hours will do an interview of someone and have a conclusion that he is not a danger to society or is mentally insane."" Even the Canadian government has weighed in, calling Turcotte's release ""unacceptable."" ""We believe that Isabelle Gaston does not deserve to live in fear of her children's killer and neither do victims of similar crimes across Canada,"" said James Moore, a federal cabinet minister. The Conservative government of Prime Minster Stephen Harper is drafting legislation to make it more difficult for mentally ill offenders to be released from psychiatric facilities, but the pending legislation is not expected to influence Turcotte's case. In fact, Turcotte told the psychiatric review board that released him that he is looking forward to leading a normal life in the future and hopes to practice medicine and have children again. ""To know that my children faced the person that they should have trusted the most and they were left by themselves to die. No one holding their hand,"" Gaston said. ""I struggle, OK, I struggle all the days, every day of my life and I think till I die I will struggle.""","Canadian doctor who stabbed his children freed from mental hospital .

"(CNN) -- Africa has the second largest population of any continent but only accounts for 3% of global air traffic. The reasons for taking such a small share of the aviation market have been the same for decades: poor infrastructure, stalled liberalization, high taxes and fuel charges. It also struggles with a lack of routes linking cities, a lack of regular flights flying them and a lack of profitable airlines competing. However with the GDP of sub-Saharan countries expected to grow almost 6% this year, according to the World Bank, there is still the belief that aviation can really take-off. ""The infrastructuure is improving, which was one of the key issues,"" says Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of Air France. ""Airports, air traffic control, civil aviation regulations everywhere, they are improving, there are many programs coming from international organizations and there is an enormous need for air traffic coming directly from the economic growth."" Read more: Are airline loyalty schemes worth it? The need for improved air travel across the continent is clear to many in the industry, where there are glaring gaps between growing economic centers. A flight between Cape Town in South Africa and Lagos, Nigeria, the second fastest growing city in Africa, should take six hours. Yet with no direct flights, the cheapest option via the Middle East takes up to 25 hours while the faster, yet more expensive routes within Africa still take ten hours. Often governments have been blamed for protecting their national carriers and refusing to deregulate the industry and open up the skies to greater competition. While South Africa has a number of liberalization agreements, its government agrees that more needs to be done . ""There is a number of constraints in different countries, with regard to policies, with regards to the regulatory environment... but in terms of the decisions themselves, we have taken the right ones,"" says Malusi Gigaba, South Africa's minister for public enterprise. ""Of course, you already have more foreign airlines flying in Africa than African airlines.... but we would like to see even greater cooperation between these African airlines."" Kenyan Airways is one airline that is taking note. It recently suggested a merger with other local aviation big-hitters, South African Airways and Ethiopian Airways. Read more: Thefts on planes on the rise . ""We can't go on the way we have, we have got to start consolidating,"" says Titus Naikuni. ""We've all been talking to each other. I don't know if you call it a merger or whatever, (but it is) to avoid a situation where we're running two aircraft side by side at 50% capacity."" If there's a criticism, it is that it is creating less competition on a continent that is crying out for more. The real winners so far have been international carriers, particularly from the Middle East, that now make up almost 60% of intercontinental traffic to and from Africa. Etihad Airways has routes from Abu Dhabi to major cities in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and North African countries and then partners with domestic airlines to reach second and third tier cities. ""What we are doing is complementing each others networks...they can take us into 26 points in Africa they we'll never touch,"" says James Hogan, CEO of Etihad Airways. The greatest test to come then is if the quality of the air links outside the major hubs match the international routes. That will prove if African aviation can ever truly live up to its potential.","African airlines looking to code-share agreements to improve network .
Only 3% of global air travel is from Africa .

"(CNN) -- Ray Dolby, the American inventor who changed the way people listen to sound in their homes, on their phones and in cinemas, died Thursday in San Francisco. Dolby was 80. The founder of Dolby Laboratories had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for a number of years, and in July was diagnosed with acute leukemia. ""Today we lost a friend, mentor and true visionary,"" said Kevin Yeaman, the company's president and CEO. Dolby founded the company in London in 1965, and in the following decades it built on his pioneering work in surround sound and noise reduction, which removed the annoying ""hiss"" from audio recordings. Dolby holds more than 50 U.S. patents for many state-of-the-art technologies. Now based in San Francisco, the company has earned dozens of industry plaudits including 19 Academy and 13 Emmy Awards. Dolby's work earned so much admiration from the film industry that last year the Hollywood landmark known as the ""home of the Academy Awards"" was renamed Dolby Theatre. After each annual star-studded ceremony, the world's leading actors and actresses toast the occasion in the Ray Dolby Ballroom. ""With Dolby Laboratories, his passion for sound led to innovations that have changed the way we listen to music and movies for nearly 50 years,"" said Neil Portnow, President and CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. ""His technologies have become an essential part of the creative process for recording artists and filmmakers, ensuring his remarkable legacy for generations to come."" Mix tape, anyone? The cassette turns 50 . While his work earned him fame and fortune, Dolby considered himself an adventurer at heart. ""I wanted the experience of traveling to many parts of the world. Inventions were part of my life, but they didn't overtake everything that I was doing,"" he said in quotes released by the company. His wife of 47 years, Dagmar, described him as ""generous, patient, intellectually honest"" and a fantastic role model for their two sons, Tom and David. ""I think he was the happiest when we would be on the boat, and the waves got really high and the weather forecast was really bad -- that was all the more challenge for him,"" she said. Tom Dolby, a filmmaker and novelist, said: ""Though he was an engineer at heart, my father's achievements in technology grew out of a love of music and the arts. He brought his appreciation of the artistic process to all of his work in film and audio recording."" Dolby was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1933 and started his career at Ampex Corp., where he led the development of the electronic aspects of the Ampex videotape recording system. He earned his first degree in electrical engineering at Stanford University, before moving to Cambridge in the UK to study physics. While there, he became the first American to be named a fellow at Pembroke College. After graduating, Dolby moved to India for a two-year stint as a United Nations adviser before returning to London to set up his company. In 2004, Dolby was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in the U.S. and the Royal Academy of Engineers in the UK.","Pioneer in surround sound, noise reduction dies at 80 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- From earthly orbit to the deepest reaches of the Pacific Ocean, China has notched up two more firsts for the country's ambitious sea and space exploration programs. On Sunday, the three Chinese astronauts on board the Shenzhou-9 manually docked their spacecraft to the Tiangong 1, an orbiting space lab. On the same day, a Chinese manned submersible vehicle set a deep-diving record when it descended 7,020 meters into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. The three men on board the sub -- dubbed oceanauts in China -- sent greetings to the three astronauts on the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft. ""We wish for a great success of the manual docking and brilliant achievements in China's manned space and manned deep-sea dive causes,"" Xinhua quoted Ye Cong, Li Kaizhou and Yang Bo as saying. China sends first woman into space . Both endeavors have been a source of pride for China and could help bolster support for the Chinese Communist Party as it undergoes a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year and handles the fall-out from the demise of former politician Bo Xilai. ""Scientific achievements like this allow the Party to again remind the population of what has been achieved under their leadership,"" said Dean Cheng, a research follow at The Heritage Foundation in Washington. ""It buys credibility and justification for their continued rule, even as scandals like Bo Xilai eat away at their authority. ""I would expect additional such displays in the coming months, especially if reports of a troubled succession are correct."" Mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is also seen as an essential step toward China's goal of building a space station in 2020. Until now, the docking had been done by remote control from the ground. Local media reported that China also plans to start building a deep-sea station to accompany its march into space. The three-man sub Jiaolong, named after a mythical sea dragon, worked for three hours on the sea floor, collecting water samples, sediments and placing markers at the bottom of the sea. Xinhua said the 11-hour dive ""enabled China to join the ranks of deep-sea faring countries"" like the US, Japan, France and Russia. Cheng said that the ability to undertake such deep-sea dives also had commercial applications and would help China drill for oil and undertake deep-sea mining. Will China overtake America in space? China has been funding oceanographic research for more than a decade after it was added to the country's 9th Five Year Plan in 1996, he added. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for China's manned space missions said the program, which began in 1992, would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan (US$6.27 billion). ""These programs are emblematic of sustained Chinese investments in the human capital and infrastructure of science,"" said Cheng. ""This should be a warning call to the U.S. and Western Europe that their traditional dominance in science is in jeopardy."" But some Chinese internet users, while lauding the achievements, questioned whether these exploits were the wisest use of China's new-found wealth. ""Diving into the sea and flying out to space. China now can do them both,"" said one user of the Twitter-like portal Sina Weibo. ""It marks the development of technology and we are proud of it. But can the government care more about its people's well-being too?"" Corinna Liu in Hong Kong contributed to this report .","Chinese spacecraft makes first manual docking .

"(CNN) -- Leeland Eisenberg is missing yet again. The 52-year-old New Hampshire man, who took hostages six years ago at one of Hillary Clinton's campaign offices, was not in his Manchester halfway house when he was supposed to be Sunday afternoon, according to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections. Authorities say they are considering it an escape because Eisenberg did not let anyone know he was leaving, as he is required to do. They said he is not considered armed or dangerous. This is at least the second time Eisenberg has left authorities wondering about his whereabouts. He was released in 2009 after serving two thirds of a three-year sentence. But in February 2010, he violated his probation by cutting off his GPS tracking bracelet. He was arrested about a day later and eventually received a new sentence of 3 1/2 to 7 years. He is eligible for parole in August. Eisenberg has a history of mental illness and substance-abuse problems, authorities say. In 2007, he entered Clinton's campaign office in Rochester, New Hampshire, with road flares strapped to his chest. He claimed he had a bomb, and he held several hostages for five hours. Clinton was in Washington at the time. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Eisenberg said he took the hostages to raise awareness about mental health issues. ""I wanted to sacrifice myself for mental illness and bring about the discussion about mental illness,"" Eisenberg said. Furthermore, he said, ""I wanted the police to kill me."" He was convicted of multiple counts of kidnapping, criminal threatening and false reports of explosives.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Hundreds of militants attacked American and Afghan troops in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday, opening fire on an outpost from multiple locations with rockets, mortars and heavy-caliber machine guns, according to an initial U.S. military report on the battle. U.S. troops walk past a group of armored vehicles on Saturday at a military base in Afghanistan. At least eight American troops and two members of the Afghan National Security Force died -- the largest number of Americans killed by hostile action in a single day in more than a year, according to CNN records. At least 13 Afghan police officers were captured in the attack, according to Haji Abdul Halim, the deputy governor of Nuristan province, where the battle took place. The fighting lasted about 12 hours, with the militants firing down on the joint U.S.-Afghan outpost from ridgelines above the base, a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the first reports told CNN. The official said the report was preliminary and subject to change as more information came in. The official said portions of the outpost burst into flame and burned down, but was not able to say if the blaze caused injuries or deaths.  Watch how attack involved hundreds of militants » . The militants also fired from a local mosque, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. The Afghan Ministry of Defense said hundreds of militant fighters surrounded two outposts in the attack. The terrain and the weather worked against U.S. troops, the U.S. military source said. The attackers' firing positions in the mountains made it tough for U.S. troops to fight back, and bad weather made it hard for troops to fire back effectively, the source said. Coalition forces repelled the attack, inflicting ""heavy enemy casualties,"" and calling in airstrikes, the alliance said. The military source said air support arrived within 30 minutes, and that the attackers did not succeed in getting inside the outpost. The official asked not to be identified because the incident is under investigation and the Pentagon is trying to ensure families of the deceased are informed before the military says more. ""My heart goes out to the families of those we have lost and to their fellow soldiers who remained to finish this fight,"" said Col. Randy George, commander of Task Force Mountain Warrior. ""This was a complex attack in a difficult area. Both the U.S. and Afghan soldiers fought bravely together; I am extremely proud of their professionalism and bravery."" ISAF withheld the identities of the deceased until family members were notified. The U.S. does not have any indication that the death toll will rise, a U.S. military representative in Afghanistan told CNN. Before Saturday's incident, the U.S. had announced plans to leave the post that came under attack. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, has said he wants to focus more on protecting Afghan civilians rather than holding remote outposts like the one that was attacked Saturday. The last time American troops suffered so many casualties in a single day was July 13, 2008, when Afghan militants attempted to overrun a base in the village of Wanat, also in eastern Afghanistan. At least nine Americans died that day, and the base was abandoned days later. Militants ""attempted to break into that base,"" said Mark Laity, a NATO spokesman, a day after the attack last summer. They did make some penetration, he said, ""but overall they were repelled and they took very heavy casualties themselves."" Two days later, the base was ""disestablished,"" ISAF said. The Wanat attack was the deadliest attack on U.S. troops in three years, and prompted a Pentagon investigation. The U.S. Army unit that came under attack didn't get enough intelligence that 200 insurgents were in the area and poised to attack, two officials told CNN in the wake of the battle. However, the failure of intelligence is only one angle the Pentagon investigated. The report has not yet been released. The U.S. military in Afghanistan declined to comment on comparisons between the Wanat attack and the one on Saturday. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and CNN's Atia Abawi and journalist Matiullah Mati in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.","NEW: Battle lasted 12 hours as hundreds of militants fired on outpost, official says .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a future in which planes run on a mixture of batteries, body heat and cow manure. Or perhaps noise pollution would cease to exist (thanks to a shape-shifting engine, that is). Luggage could arrive at the baggage carousel quicker, because it would float on and off aircraft like pucks on an air hockey table. These sci-fi-sounding concepts have been drafted by a handful of engineering students at the behest of Airbus, who has partnered with UNESCO to sponsor the third consecutive Fly Your Ideas competition. According to Dale King, Airbus' senior manager for research and technology, the goal is to engage tomorrow's innovators, and perhaps nudge their eco-conscience in the process. ""We're trying to encourage the next generation of leaders to think about ways in which the aviation industry could be made more eco-efficient, and to be sympathetic to its environmental impact,"" he says. The competition is in keeping with the company's goal of halving CO2 emissions by 2050, and many of the solutions could mean the future of flight is zero-emission. ""Even if you replaced (jet fuel) with liquid natural gas, you could cut CO2 emissions 20%,"" says Luke Spiteri, a finalist in the competition. Read more: 3-D printer makes jet engine . Spiteri is leading the team from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, which has designed supercooled pods on the plane's wings to deliver sustainable fuel to the engine. He envisions bio-LNG -- a combo of bio-methane (a by-product of organic composed waste) and liquid natural gas -- replacing traditional jet fuel. Overall, says Spiteri, the blend could reduce CO2 emissions by 97%. University Putra Malaysia has presented another novel energy-saving technology involving converting passengers' body heat into electrical voltage. Tan Kai Jun, the team leader, envisions cabin seats upholstered with a thermoelectric fabric that can convert a person's energy into 100 nanowatts of voltage. Alas, that amounts to about one-millionth of what your iPhone needs to stay on standby. Still, Jun maintains that it does ultimately add up. ""It's a small amount, but imagine this collected from 550 seats throughout 10 hours of flight. A plane has a lifespan of a few hundred flights -- over time that's a big reduction,"" he says. Read more: Are flying cars the future of travel? While King says the technology isn't quite mature enough to roll out just yet, he says he's keeping his eye on it. ""Currently, the difficulty is that these devices do weigh something, and weight has a direct impact on fuel. The trade-off doesn't work just yet, but there is potential there in the future."" Bertrand Piccard, co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse, the solar powered currently flying across the USA, believes that wild ideas are what inspires innovation. ""The world of aviation loves pioneers, because they're responsible for its existence,"" says Piccard. ""Of course, they don't believe that what we're doing can be done with commercial flight and they are correct; today it can't be done. But when the Wright Brothers first flew in 1903, and Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic in 1927, no one would have imagined then that a plane carrying 300 passengers could make the same trip."" Industry experts are taking a keen interest in the project. Virgin Atlantic's Sir Richard Branson is a sponsor, and according to Piccard, he is thinking of using solar power to tow aircraft onto the runway -- a process that could save up to two tons of fuel per flight. ""Our goal is not to make a revolution in air transport, because it would be arrogance for us to try and do this,"" he says. ""Really, we want to make a revolution in the mindset of the people.""","Airbus and UNESCO invited aeronautics and engineering students to come up with ideas for a futuristic aircraft .

"London, England (CNN) -- A widespread shortage of organs for transplantation means surgeons are forced to use ""less than ideal"" organs -- a practice that can have deadly consequences. In October 2009, the inquest into the death of British soldier Corporal Matthew Millington revealed he had received a double lung transplant from a donor who may have smoked up to 50 cigarettes a day. Less than a year after the transplant, Millington died after doctors found a tumor in his lungs. The case highlighted the fact that with a desperate shortage of donors, surgeons are often forced to transplant imperfect organs. Chris Watson, vice-president of the British Transplantation Society (BTS), told CNN that 49 percent of last year's lung donors in the UK were smokers. ""We're not in the luxurious position in transplantation to turn down organs because they're not absolutely perfect -- there are very few perfect organs,"" he said. Watson told CNN that around 7,000 people in the UK are currently waiting for a transplant; according to BTS figures, almost 1,000 people died last year while waiting. In the U.S., about 105,000 people are currently waiting for an organ transplant, and approximately 19 people die every day while waiting for a transplant, according to according to official figures. Spain leads the world in organ donation, with 33 deceased donors per million people, compared with 12 donors per million in the UK, according to Watson. Spain has a ""presumed consent"" law, where individuals are automatically considered an organ donor unless they opt out, but Watson said that is not the only factor that explains the country's high level of organ donation. He told CNN that Spain has a well-developed infrastructure for managing patients in intensive care and dedicated donor coordinators who are able to counsel the families of the deceased and discuss their consent to organ donation. It's a system that has been trialled in the UK for the last two years, and one that Watson hopes will improve donation rates. But with current levels of donation, Watson is happy to use the organs that are available. He told CNN that data shows that transplants using smokers' lungs are just as effective in the long term as those using lungs from non-smokers. ""In the case of Corporal Millington, the donor had a chest X-ray, broncoscopy and a careful inspection of the lungs once they were removed,"" Watson told CNN. ""When they found the tumor in Corporal Millington it was seven millimeters across and it was likely to have been two or three millimeters when it was transplanted. To find something that small you'd need to chop the lungs up into fine pieces, and then you can't transplant."" Watson told CNN that organs are thoroughly tested for suitability before they are transplanted. He said that once a patient has been diagnosed as brain-dead and donation is a possibility, a donor coordinator will approach their family to learn more about the patient's history. Medics ask about the donor's medical history and lifestyle. They also take a blood test and may contact the donor's doctor for more information. But Watson stresses that medics only have a few hours between diagnosis of brain death and organ removal. Those time constraints mean medics have to make quick judgments about the suitability of donated organs. ""We're happy to use the organs available knowing they're not ideal and we'll make the best use of them and keep them functioning as well as we can,"" said Watson. ""The alternative for recipients is to die, so there's really not much choice for them.""","British surgeon says shortage of donors means he must use imperfect organs .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years after the hit single ""West End Girls,"" can the Pet Shop Boys pull off songs that make you want to dance like it's 1984, but still reflect a social consciousness of 2009? Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, shown at the BRIT Awards in February, are releasing their 10th studio album. The answer is the title of their latest album: ""Yes."" The British duo will release their 10th studio album on April 21 in the United States through Astralwerks. ""Yes"" has been out in the United Kingdom through Parlophone/EMI since March 23, and entered the Billboard UK albums chart at No. 4. ""We thought that 'Yes' just kind of summed up the theme of the album. It's a positive, upbeat, euphoric pop album,"" keyboardist Chris Lowe said. ""It's almost an answer to the question, 'Is that the Pet Shop Boys?' 'Yes!' "" Given how many different projects the duo has been involved with, it's a valid question. In addition to the studio albums, they've written a musical, ""Closer to Heaven,"" and a soundtrack to Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film classic, ""The Battleship Potemkin."" For ""Yes,"" the Pet Shop Boys worked with Xenomania, a production group known for collaborating with Cher and other pop stars. Xenomania co-wrote three of the tracks on ""Yes"" with Lowe and vocalist Neil Tennant, who write most of their own songs. Watch the official video for ""Love, etc."" on YouTube . The Pet Shop Boys, who recently won an award for outstanding contribution to music at the 2009 BRIT Awards, ""felt very much at home"" at the house outside London, England, that Xenomania has devoted entirely to music, Tennant said. Every bedroom has a studio, and bands hang around downstairs waiting to record amid the sounds of instruments, record mixing and talking. ""You can hear this cacophony of music all day long,"" he said. Like a vinyl record, ""Yes"" is divided into two distinct halves: the happy pop introduction and the more ""weird"" experimental conclusion, Tennant said. The album also features guitar performances by Johnny Marr. ""Love, etc."", the album's first track and currently No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart, is a social statement about how money, shopping and celebrity don't necessarily bring happiness, while the third track, ""Beautiful People,"" imagines that it must be great to have wealth and fame, Tennant said. ""At the end of the day, it's an old-fashioned sentiment, but love is more important, really,"" Lowe said of ""Love, etc."" ""Pandemonium,"" a love song inspired by the relationship between actress Kate Moss and singer Pete Doherty, was originally written for Kylie Minogue to sing, but she didn't use it, Tennant said. Media reports that they'll never work together again are incorrect, however, he said. ""I think they exaggerated that,"" Tennant said. ""Yeah, so that's not true."" (In a BBC story, Tennant and Lowe said they, like many songwriters, hadn't heard back from Minogue after submitting their material. ""We won't be doing it again,"" Lowe told the BBC.) Perhaps the most out-of-character song stylistically is the finale, ""Legacy,"" a meditation on politicians leaving office (""You'll get over it"" is the main message). Tennant identified it as his favorite because of the poetry and the mystery in the music -- ""it continues to fascinate me,"" he said. ""The Way It Used to Be,"" a favorite track for both Boys, charts a relationship from its romantic beginning to its melancholic end, wondering ""what is left of love"" and longing to ""leave our promises behind / rewind and try again."" With all this talk of love, Tennant is private about his own love life. As far as love in the album goes, though, ""Some of it's real, and some imagination; some of it's memory,"" he said. The duo did not meet in a pet shop, but in an an electronics shop in London in 1981. Tennant needed a piece of equipment for his synthesizer and, when he and Lowe started talking about music, the two hit it off. ""I'm always struck since then by the sort of amazing look of our meeting,"" Tennant said. ""We happened to be in the same place at the same time, and it changed the rest of our lives. I always think it was an extraordinary thing."" They started making music as a hobby with an acoustic guitar and a synthesizer, and played drums by banging on the table, Lowe said. ""It's all been a gradual process really. We never sat down really and said, 'Let's become pop stars,' "" Lowe said. When they first recorded ""West End Girls"" together, the musical group did not have a name, Tennant said. They took the name Pet Shop Boys because they had friends who worked at a pet shop in West London known as the ""pet shop boys."" They thought the name fit with popular rap groups such as the Beastie Boys. ""It has actually no meaning whatsoever. Chris used to be embarrassed by it,"" Tennant said. While influenced by hip-hop, electronic disco, and other genres from the beginning, the Pet Shop Boys have always emphasized the songs themselves, Lowe said, and they're not ""purist"" about what kinds of instruments get used. In the beginning, they sampled everything from animal noises to broken glass for their songs. They even recorded the sound of a woman walking down a street in high heels for ""West End Girls,"" and the ambience of a cathedral for the 1987 single ""It's a Sin,"" Lowe said. Their songwriting has perhaps gotten more sophisticated and experimental over time, Tennant said. ""In the '80s I never sang any harmonies on records. Now I do loads of harmonies. I'm turning into Brian Wilson!"" Tennant said. ""Yes"" continues the Pet Shop Boys' tradition of having one-word titles for albums, such as ""Please,"" ""Bilingual,"" and the more recent ""Fundamental."" The convention  just developed and became a style that the duo decided to keep, Tennant said. ""It's like e.e. cummings not having any capital letters -- it's a signature thing,"" Tennant said. The duo is determined to branch into new areas. Lowe and Tennant's next project is a ballet slated for 2011 based on a story by Hans Christian Anderson. Tennant said it is instrumental, and includes a mixture of electronic music and strings. ""The challenge of telling a story through music and dance is something that we're interested in,"" Lowe said. Plans to tour the United States in the fall are under discussion, the duo said.","The Pet Shop Boys' new album comes out in the United States on April 21 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A senior U.S. lawmaker says China is ordering foreign-owned hotels there to install government software and hardware that would let authorities spy on  guests' Internet activities during the Beijing Olympics. Sen. Sam Brownback says tourists could be subjected to Internet spying during the Olympics. Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, released a translated document Wednesday from China's Public Security Bureau that he said orders hotels to use the monitoring programs. CNN was not able to independently verify the original document, and calls to the Chinese Embassy in Washington went unanswered. CNN will continue to try to reach Beijing for a response to Brownback's allegations. The senator said journalists, athletes, tourists, activists and others would be subjected to invasive intelligence gathering by the Public Security Bureau. Several international hotel chains have confirmed the order, Brownback said, but he wouldn't disclose which ones, saying they fear retaliation from the Chinese government. He said the hotels are warning guests that their Internet activities are not private.  Learn more how China monitors the Internet » . The translated document offered by Brownback's staff states that ""refusing the installment or stopping operation of the system after installment will be subject to punishment. ... In case of serious violation, access to the Internet will be suspended or the business license will be canceled."" CNN reached one hotel manager who said authorities met with the staff to discuss Internet security. However, he said, the officials didn't provide any documentation. The manager said on condition of anonymity that the Chinese government is capable of monitoring Internet traffic without involving or telling the hotels that it is doing so. Stanley Marcuss, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of commerce, advised business travelers to leave their laptops at home. ""They are required by the U.S. government not to permit unauthorized access to information stored in their computers,"" he said, ""and if the Chinese say, 'We're going to get access to what's in your computer if you use your computer in China,' that's a real problem.""

"(CNN) -- A whistle-blowing Russian lawyer whose death in custody strained U.S.-Russia relations was posthumously convicted in a tax case in a Moscow district court Thursday, state-run legal news agency RAPSI reported. Sergei Magnitsky was convicted of tax evasion -- a verdict that comes after he died in 2009 in a Moscow detention center. The United States alleges Magnitsky was beaten to death in detention, a claim that Russian authorities reject. Magnitsky's 2008 arrest and tax charges came after he uncovered Russia's largest known tax fraud in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. The U.S. State Department believes Magnitsky was persecuted because he ""was blowing the whistle of confiscation of private assets and misuse of private assets,"" a State Department official said in a background briefing with reporters earlier this year. U.S. lawmakers responded to Magnitsky's death by passing the December 2012 Magnitsky Act, a law that imposes visa bans on and freezes the assets of 16 Russian officials that U.S. officials allege were connected to his death, abuse or detention. Thursday's verdict prompted more criticism from U.S. officials. ""The trial was a discredit to the efforts of those who continue to seek justice in his case,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""Despite widely publicized, credible evidence of criminal conduct resulting in Magnitsky's death, authorities have failed to prosecute those responsible. ""We continue to call for full accountability for all those responsible for Magnitsky's wrongful death, and we'll continue to support the efforts of those in Russia who seek to hold those individuals accountable."" Sen. Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Thursday that Magnitsky's posthumous conviction ""is nothing short of a message to Russia's activist community of the repercussions of opposing the state."" Russia's lawmakers responded to the Magnitsky Act with their own list, slapping similar sanctions on 18 Americans it called rights violators. Russian President Vladimir Putin last year called the Magnitsky Act ""another anti-Russian law"" and an ""imperialist approach to foreign policy."" In December, Putin signed into law a measure that would ban the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families starting in 2014 -- a move also widely seen as retaliation for the Magnitsky Act. CNN's Elise Labott, Jason Hanna, Alla Eshchenko, Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: The verdict draws criticism from U.S. officials .

"Shanghai (Financial Times) -- Capital markets have funded wars for centuries. Now the People's Liberation Army is also turning to the stock market to help propel China's ambitious naval expansion plans. Beijing's military spend, at $166bn last year, is second only to the US. The country has been ramping up its naval prowess amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea and other surrounding waters. But with its largest defence contractors still predominantly state-owned, China wants to push them closer to the private sector and on to public markets to foster their growth. Launching what it described as the start of a push to use capital markets to fund China's defence industry, state-controlled China Shipbuilding Industry Co, the country's biggest shipbuilder, said it would raise Rmb8.5bn ($1.4bn) through a private placement of shares to buy production facilities and equipment to make warships. Chinese investors cheered the prospect of being able to invest in the country's military-industrial complex, driving the Shanghai-listed shares of China Shipbuilding up by the daily limit of 10 per cent. Shares of other companies expected to benefit, such as Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries, a maker of large steel structures, also surged. The company itself was quick to tout the lucrative nature of military assets to investors. ""This will expand the range of investable assets in our capital market and will allow investors to enjoy the returns generated by high-end military products,"" it said in a statement to the stock exchange. China has ramped up its military spending since the 1980s, with its official defence budget increasing at a double-digit pace in every year but one over the past two decades. Its spending is still less than a quarter of the US which spent $682bn in 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In recent years, China has placed extra emphasis on building up its blue-water navy -- a force capable of operating far from the country's shores. Mired in territorial disputes in the East China Sea with Japan and in the South China Sea with countries including the Philippines and Vietnam, China has started to deploy naval ships more regularly to patrol what it defines as its sovereign waters. In 2011, it launched its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, though it was built on an unfinished hull acquired from Ukraine. Analysts believe it is only a matter of time before China produces its first indigenous carrier. The China Securities Journal, a leading government-run financial newspaper, said the stock market penetration by companies in China's military industry was very low. While about 80 per cent of the assets of the world's top 100 military companies are publicly listed, only 30 per cent of the assets of China's top 10 military companies have been listed, it said. For China's beleaguered shipbuilding industry, hit hard by overcapacity and slowing economic growth, the start of more military projects offers some consolation. ""Military spending is classic counter-cyclical support in a downturn,"" said Jon Windham, head of Asia transport research at Barclays. ""It's simply a more stable part of the business and one they want to talk about more because the commercial side is in free fall."" China Shipbuilding's private placement structure is complex. It is issuing shares to two sibling companies, Wuchang Shipbuilding and Dalian Shipbuilding, to raise the funds, and is then using that money to acquire some of those two company's military assets. Initially, these assets had been stripped out of the listed company when China Shipbuilding went public. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","China opens national defense industry to public market investors .

"(CNN) -- A 20-year-old Florida woman was in critical condition Friday after she shot and killed her 6-month-old son and then turned the gun on herself, police said. Authorities found Melanie Reyes and her baby after performing a welfare check at the request of Reyes' family, who called 911 to report a statement on her Facebook page in which she ""indicated she was going to shoot her child and herself,"" according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office. Both were transported to a hospital, where the infant was pronounced dead. Police recovered the handgun believed used in the shootings from the home. The incident comes roughly two weeks after Reyes was arrested for aggravated domestic battery after her boyfriend said she struck him with a baseball bat, according to a police report. Her next court date had been scheduled for January 22. Read more: What drives a mom to kill? CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","The mother is in critical condition .

"(CNN) -- They've lost their homes, their businesses and many are still stranded, but residents in the battered Northeast are overcoming the aftereffects of Superstorm Sandy with a gritty resolve. ""It's sort of like the transit strike a few years ago,"" said Elizabeth Gorman, 40, a Queens resident, who walked across the Queensboro Bridge on Wednesday. Gorman was part of a steady stream of commuters forced to walk or bike into Manhattan after Sandy roared ashore barely two days ago, wiping out roads, bridges and mass transit systems across the region. Commuters, homeowners and businesses struggled with the loss of power and waterlogged or burned homes. Seven ways to manage stress in a disaster . New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a ""transportation emergency"" Wednesday night, saying New York City subways, buses and commuter rails would be free of charge Thursday and Friday as a way to encourage people to use mass transit. Gridlock on Wednesday was ""dangerous,"" he said. But not all of the city's transit was operating. Fourteen of the city's 23 subway lines are opening Thursday, with buses helping to cover the unserved areas, Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Joe Lhota said. But there will be no subway service to lower Manhattan, which is still dealing with flooding and power outages, he said. And bus service, which resumed Thursday, was stopped below 23rd Street because the area is still dark and too dangerous, Lhota said. The three major New York-area airports will all be open Thursday, albeit with limited service, authorities said. John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty reopened Wednesday with limited service, and LaGuardia -- where floodwaters covered runways and taxiways -- will reopen Thursday. Many people across the region are still in need of basic supplies. President Barack Obama visited a shelter Wednesday in the hard-hit town of Brigantine, New Jersey, where he said he met a woman with an 8-month-old who has run out of diapers and formula. ""Those are the kinds of basic supplies and help that we can provide,"" he said. Obama promised the federal government ""will not quit"" until communities are cleaned up. ""We are not going to tolerate red tape, we are not going to tolerate bureaucracy,"" Obama said. ""And I've instituted a 15-minute rule, essentially, on my team. You return everybody's phone calls in 15 minutes, whether it's the mayor's, the governor's, county officials. ""If they need something, we figure out a way to say yes."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie asked for patience as crews worked to turn the power back on for more than 2 million people still in the dark. He toured Brigantine with Obama, who said utilities from across the country have pledged to send crews to New Jersey as soon as possible. Sandy came ashore late Monday in southern New Jersey, wiping out houses, pushing sand four blocks inland in places and leaving people stranded. Seventy people were rescued Wednesday from the barrier island in Toms River, New Jersey -- people who ignored orders to evacuate, Police Chief Mike Mastronardy said. ""Everyone that we've encountered during evacuations today wish they'd left prior to the storm,"" he said. Authorities are still working to extinguish 11 of 30 gas fires that broke out in the storm, he said. Flooding was still a problem in many areas. Over its entire path, the storm killed at least 124 people -- 67 in the Caribbean, 56 in the United States and one in Canada. The fire that broke out in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Breezy Point during the storm destroyed 110 homes, Assistant Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer said. Search and rescue teams were going through each home to check for victims. ""The number of homes lost in Breezy Point by fire is just tragic,"" Cuomo said Wednesday. ""That no one lost their life in Breezy Point is a miracle."" Staten Island saw no such miracle. Half of the state's 28 deaths were on Staten Island, and two boys were missing. Borough President James Molinaro said the waters have mostly receded, but the damage is severe. Post-Sandy water safety tips . In Seaside Heights, New Jersey, Mayor Bill Akers said his hard-hit town will tough it out. ""We're going to just do the best we can and give the support,"" he said. ""When it's tougher, we're the best community."" On Wednesday, the storm sputtered over the Great Lakes region, where its strong winds are expected to trigger some lakeside flooding as well as additional snowfall in parts of West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. More than 5.3 million customers across the eastern United States were still in the dark Wednesday, down from the nearly 8 million who lost power shortly after the storm hit. Christie described the damage along the Jersey Shore as ""unthinkable."" Akers said crews are trying to get each and every person to shelters from his battered community, which he called he the storm's ""ground zero."" Speaking to CNN, Akers' voice cracked a bit as he described the enormity of the destruction and the resolve to rebuild. ""I just want to try to keep the emotion out of it,"" he said. ""For everybody, it's -- this is a loss for everybody ... not just Seaside Heights. ""If there's any good news,"" he added, ""the water (has) receded, the roadways are accessible. But we still have downed power lines. We are not letting anybody in at that particular time."" Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . Some 10,000 Army and Air National Guard forces were on duty in the 13 states affected by the storm. The Army Corps of Engineers was also helping, deploying water pumps and generators to New York and New Jersey, the U.S. Defense Department said. They're also going to send 80 truckloads of water to West Virginia, where snow generated by the storm has left some areas inaccessible. Other military branches have also been deployed to help in the storm's aftermath. The U.S. Coast Guard sent airboats normally used for ice rescues in the Great Lakes, and the U.S. Navy was moving three landing ships to the affected coastlines. Some 730,000 New Yorkers were still in the dark Wednesday night, with utility Con Edison estimating another three days before it can restore power to Manhattan and Brooklyn, and as many as 10 days for other boroughs and the suburb of Westchester. Keep your food safe in a natural disaster . Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan evacuated its 700 patients because the pumps that supply oil to the generators are in the basement under 8 feet of water, a source familiar with the evacuation plan said. New York University Langone Medical Center had to evacuate more than 200 patients because of a generator problem a day earlier. The Lincoln Tunnel was open, but the Holland Tunnel, the other tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, was still full of water. The Port Authority said it can't start pumping out the water until power is restored. Still, there were hints amid the aftermath Wednesday that New York City was slowly getting back to normal. The New York Stock Exchange reopened after a two-day closure, Broadway's trade association said all shows would be curtains up on Thursday and Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday's New York Marathon would go on as scheduled. ""For cooped-up New Yorkers and out-of-town visitors who are staying in hotels and can't get home, now is a great time to see a show!"" said Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of The Broadway League. That said, Thursday's game between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn was postponed. And while traffic gridlock returned, for some it was a welcome sign that New Yorkers were at least trying to move forward. How you can help .

"(CNN) -- To get through the long, tedious hours sitting in the fossil archives at the University of California-Berkeley, Jason Head would listen to the hypnotic sounds of The Doors. So when he happened upon one of the biggest lizards that ever walked on land, he found it fitting to name it after the band's frontman, Jim Morrison -- the original Lizard King. But that's not what makes this find interesting. It's what the existence of the ""Bearded King Morrison"" tells us about the effects of climate change that's intriguing. The climate connection . Lizards, like snakes and turtles, are cold-blooded animals. They depend on warmth from their surroundings to heat their bodies. And when the environment warms up, they become more active, get hungrier, eat more and grow. For six years, Head sifted through fossils of animals that lived 40 million years ago, looking for clues on climate change. Then it jumped out at him: The Bearded King Morrison, as Head named his now-extinct lizard. Head and his team introduced it in a study to be published Wednesday by research journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. ""It struck me that we had something here that was quite large and quite unique,"" he said. The find was striking, because when it comes to climate trends, bigger reptiles point to a warmer climate, Head said. ""One of the things you can actually do is estimate past temperatures by looking at the body size of fossil reptiles,"" said Head, a paleontologist who studies the Earth and its atmosphere at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The lizard's hefty size helped confirm the elevated global temperature during a period known as the Paleocene greenhouse. ""This would be a globally warmed time in Earth's history, where there's no ice at the poles,"" Head said. There was a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere back then. Sound familiar? Man-made global warming in the 21st century is pushing temperatures back up in that direction, he said. Current average temperatures are only about 2.5 degrees Celsius shy of where they were 40 million years ago, Head said, when the Bearded King Morrison grazed in the forests of what is now Myanmar. The Doors connection . The lizard's proper scientific name is Barbarurex morrisioni, and there is a backstory to how Head arrived at it. The Doors is Head's favorite 60's rock band. The Doors' founder Ray Manzarek dies at 74 . ""I had their albums going on kind of endless loop while we were writing and doing the analysis on the lizard,"" he said. The size of the lizard took him by surprise. It reminded him of the nickname of now deceased Doors singer Morrison, also known as the Lizard King. Morrison also had a reputation for standing up for the environment. The king-size lizard, the ecological connection. For Head, the name fit. The Bearded King Morrison was no dinosaur. It was smaller than today's crocodiles and Komodo dragons. But those are carnivorous reptiles. This was an herbivore. It ate plants. It was six feet long and weighed as much as a German shepherd, pretty sizable for a lizard. Head says he hasn't found fossil records that show why the creature eventually went extinct. The big deal . The evolution of such a large reptile shows what a huge effect a slight warming bump can have, Head said. With the ice caps gone, Earth's climate became warm and muggy, and forest covered the planet. There was plenty of greenery for the chubby lizard to munch through. As man-made climate change progresses, existing reptiles will spread out into new territory, Head predicts. So can we see another spurt of such giant lizards? Unlikely. For them to evolve to the size of the Bearded King Morrison, they would require global temperatures to slowly rise a few degrees and then remain stable for a very long time. Today's climate is warming so rapidly that ""we'll basically block off their ability to respond to the temperature increase,"" Head said. Instead of evolution, he said, we'll see extinction. Or, as Morrison sang, ""This is the end, my only friend."" More space and science news from CNN Light Years .

"New York (CNN) -- Since the 1960s, Sesame Street's puppets have been running, singing and dancing their way across our TV screens as if possessed of a life of their own. But behind Sesame Street's Muppet puppets is a world almost as surreal -- where ""Muppeteers"" and Muppet makers create the comedic illusions that have bewitched generations of children, and earned the show over 100 Emmy Awards. The life of a Sesame Street Muppeteer . If you thought the job of the Muppeteer -- putting your hand in a puppet and putting on a funny voice -- was child's play, think again. From hiding inside Oscar's trashcan to lip-syncing Kermit singing ""It's Not Easy Bein' Green,"" Sesame Street's puppeteers must be prepared to stretch their bodies -- and imaginations -- to the limit. ""We get into all sorts of crazy positions,"" says Muppeteer Eric Jacobson. Most of his time is spent with at least one arm above his head. ""Sometimes we'll be lying on the ground. Sometimes we'll be inside a piece of furniture with our arms sticking through a hole in a seat,"" he says. Read this: 10 greatest movie puppets . Indeed, it's not uncommon for long-time puppeteers to undergo shoulder and hip operations after years of straining skyward. What makes it all worthwhile, says Jacobson, is making the human connection. ""Normally I'm looking at a monitor and making sure that you at home can see the puppet's eyes, because they just don't have a soul without their eyes,"" he says. ""When you can see their eyes you can tell where they're looking, you can tell that they're engaged, that they're thinking, that they're listening."" Henson's legacy . When Jim Henson started work on Sesame Street 44 years ago, he never could have known that it would become one of America's most influential children's television shows. The father-of-five tragically died from pneumonia in 1990, at the age of 53. But his legacy lives on in the new generation of puppeteers, like Jacobson, who bring Sesame Street's fantastical creatures to life. ""I was in my freshman year at film school, thinking I was going to be a director, writer, producer,"" explains Jacobson. ""When Jim Henson passed away I suddenly realized how much this man meant to me growing up and I felt like I had to do something to continue his legacy. ""I was a part of that first generation of kids who grew up watching Sesame Street, so those characters were like family to me."" Watch this: 'War Horse' puppet comes to life . Today, Jacobson is the puppeteer behind legendary Sesame Street residents Grover and Bert. Bringing to life the unique personalities and voices of these creations demands huge coordination and quick-fire comic timing to keep the viewers engaged with the characters. First and foremost, says Jacobson, the puppet must look like a creature from the real world. ""You're conscious of the puppet's posture and making sure that it looks as though it has a believable skeleton -- you want to make sure it doesn't have a broken neck,"" he says. Material world . If bringing Muppets to life is an art form, so is creating them. Step inside New York's Muppet Workshop and it's a bit like stumbling into Frankenstein's laboratory, with drawers full of spare eyeballs, noses and mouths. Watch this: Master puppeteer Basil Twist . The puppets are made from foam and rubber with the seams hand stitched to allow for greater flexibility. The big gaping mouths are created with the same gasket rubber found in cars, with each character usually taking around two-and-a-half weeks to create from scratch. ""We'd like to think they last forever but they don't,"" explains Rollie Krewson, who has been making Muppets for Sesame Street and other Jim Henson productions for almost 40 years. Years of singing and dancing their way along Sesame Street inevitably take their toll and, sadly, every Muppet has its expiry date. ""Over the years it just deteriorates, and after 15 to 18 years you have to totally replace it -- it just goes to little toast crumbs."" The Muppets of Sesame Street might not last forever, but after more than four decades bewitching audiences, it seems their appeal is as strong as ever.","Sesame Street has enchanted adults and children alike for over 40 years .

"(CNN) -- Apps have changed the way we travel. From helping us pack to checking-in, and from coping with jetlag to booking a hotel once we've landed -- these handy tools can be used every step of the way. With relaxing visions of mobile convenience in mind, I thought traveling from London to Rome using only apps would be stress-free and easy, but it didn't quite work out that way. See also: The future of flight is shape-shifting engines . I began my journey by using the private car service, Uber, to take me to Paddington Station where I was to catch the Heathrow Express. Uber is free to download and all you need to do is pre-register your credit card details. It will then tell you how far away the closest car is to you, along with a photo of the driver. So far, so good. All-aboard . Next up was the Heathrow Express app. This turned out to be the easiest facility I used. Again with pre-registered credit card details it only took a couple of minutes to book my ticket. The QR code turned my phone into my ticket which saved me scrambling at the ticket machine on the platform. Feeling quite pleased with the journey so far, my bubble was truly burst when I attempted to check-in with the BA app. This was the first time I used it as I usually check-in online the night before. To continue in the spirit of booking on the move, I tried to check-in whilst on the Heathrow Express, which was unsuccessful due to patchy signal going underground. Once at Heathrow's Terminal 5, the app still didn't work. Every time I tried to check-in, I had to fill out my additional passenger information which took a lot of time tapping in the same information. After eight attempts, I tried the self-check-in kiosk which said I had already checked in! See also: The $1 trillion business travel industry . The problem was it didn't give me an option to print my boarding pass. Great, I thought -- I haven't even made it onto the plane and I've failed. Then, just as my passport was going to be swiped at a check-in desk, the screen on my phone started refreshing and then suddenly -- my boarding pass appeared. The app challenge continues! Rome-ward bound . Coming out of arrivals at Rome FCO, I didn't even have to look at my phone as I recognized Fabio, my Uber driver from the photo provided. No name boards, no phone calls -- I just waved and said ""You must be Fabio?"" I started looking for a hotel to stay once we reached the Spanish Steps in central Rome -- I had downloaded Hotel Tonight, Priceline and Booking.com to help with the task. As I perused with patience, looking at the photos and the room features, I suddenly began to get text messages informing me how much I had spent on data roaming. $5...$10...$30...$50 ""Ahhh it keeps going up and up and I haven't found anything yet!"" I had failed to book a room at not one but two hotels. The rooms had gone after I tried to process my payment and there was no-one to complain to. I successfully booked the third hotel I tried -- and just when I thought it was too good to be true. It was! The hotel had oversold the rooms and they had moved me to their sister hotel up the road which they said was better. Unfortunately it wasn't and in the less desirable area of Termini station. Out and about . By the time I had checked in it was too late to go hunting for food and try out some restaurant apps suggestions via Twitter. I wish there had also been more time to try out some of the city guide apps as well as the Rome MVR app -- which allows you to see monuments like the Coliseum in their former glory. See also: Apps and scanners ease travel expense pain . Augmented Reality apps are still in their infancy so I will definitely be keeping an eye on how these develop and try them out. Overall, my apps experience wasn't quite what I expected it to be. Some were simple to use whilst others were more time-consuming and fiddly. To avoid disappoint and expensive data roaming charges -- in the end I had spent $160 -- I would use apps that are quick and easy. That way you'll have more chance of staying travel appy!","Smartphone and tablet apps have simplified the travel process .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia is asking pilgrims to cover their mouths with a mask while in crowded places -- or risk spreading a deadly disease. In four months, the holy city of Mecca opens its doors to millions of Muslim pilgrims for the annual Hajj, with multitudes congregating at the same holy places at the same time. Others visit during the holy month of Ramadan, which started this week. It's a perfect scenario for catching and spreading the relatively new Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has befallen Saudi Arabia almost exclusively, state-run SPA news agency reports. What is the Hajj? The ailment, caused by the coronavirus, wreaks havoc on the respiratory systems of those who contract it. More than half of those known to have caught it have died. Of 81 infected worldwide, 45 have died, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Of the total cases, 66 were in Saudi Arabia, where 38 people succumbed to it. It mainly affects older men, the CDC says. So far, there is little to indicate that it could become the kind of deadly pandemic SARS was, though it is caused by a related virus. All Muslims must undertake the journey at least once in their lifetime, and the government is telling them to add some preventative health requirements to their spiritual rituals. Mecca redevelopment sparks heritage concerns . Most of them are common sense recipes for stopping the spread of the common cold: .

People with challenged immune systems should avoid travel to the birthplace of Islam for now, the ministry said.

"Doha (CNN) -- After two weeks of climate negotiations in Doha, bleary-eyed ministers, negotiators, and advocates are headed back home to the various regions around the world. Few, if any, are leaving entirely satisfied. The pace of progress on climate change is still too slow and the political will for greater ambition remains elusive. That said, these talks did achieve the basic goal of extending the Kyoto Protocol and moving countries onto a single negotiating track toward a new climate agreement by 2015. This leaves the door for more progress ahead. This year's talks took place against the backdrop of two disturbing trends. On the one hand, there are multiple signs that climate change is here and its impacts are already being felt around the world. On the other hand, the world remains tied to the consumption of fossil fuels that drive more and more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. With each passing day that we don't shift directions, we are increasingly locking ourselves into more unstable climate future. The real question is: Can the international talks have a real impact on climate change? But before we get to that question, let's look more closely at the two trends: . First, in recent years, we've seen a surge in climate and extreme weather events, along with analysis and other evidence that the world is on an unsustainable course. The most recent and tragic example was Super Typhoon Bopha that swept across the Philippines this week, killing at least 500 people and leaving tens of thousands displaced. Typhoons aren't unusual in the Philippines, but this one is the most southern on record and it arrived particularly late in the year. The storm, of course, comes on the heels of Hurricane Sandy, which swept through the Caribbean and up the East Coast of the United States, leaving hundreds dead, and thousands without power or property. These are the kind of extreme weather events that are becoming more common in a warming world. On top of these examples are a series of powerful new reports that reinforce the dangerous direction the world is headed. For instance, the World Bank just released a report, ""Turning Down the Heat,"" which explores a world with four degrees Celsius of global temperature growth. The picture is not pretty. Four degrees would bring more intense wildfires, heat waves, and droughts. Ocean life would die off, while pests and disease would increase, the report says. Already we are seeing that polar ice is melting faster than expected and sea levels are rising beyond many projections. For instance, NOAA just released a study showing that sea levels could rise as much as 6.6 feet by the end of the century. Furthermore, temperature records continue to fall. The United States is on course to have it hottest year on record, as withering drought spreads across two-thirds of the country. That brings us to the second major trend, which is the world's ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. WRI recently released an analysis showing that there are nearly 1,200 new proposed coal plants worldwide. While not all of these will be developed, even a fraction of them would drive up global emissions. Oil, likewise, remains a dominant fuel source. And, despite the enormous profits, the International Energy Agency has reported that government subsidies for fossil fuels were six times those for renewable energy in 2011. This dependence on fossil fuels keeps pushing up the global emissions. (2011 also broke the record for greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.) That's why what happens in the global climate agreements is so crucial. The UN is the only venue that brings all countries together and gives each a chance to have a voice. It provides a common arena that enhances transparency and accountability among countries. But, the UN is only as effective as the political will of its members. Right now, when it comes to climate change, we are simply not seeing nearly enough commitment nor ambition from national leaders. Greater domestic action can instill confidence and help build momentum. With more national leadership, the UN can move faster and take a bigger bite out of global emissions. Of course, the international system cannot solve the problem on its own. We need business leaders, government officials, and the public to step up as well. We need more of their voices in the debate. Fortunately, public understanding of climate change is on the rise, as is support for action. Turning again to the Doha meeting, it's certainly clear that the meeting alone won't do enough to address this issue. But it does put countries on a track and provides them with the opportunity to raise their ambition. The time we have to cut emissions to avoid the worst consequences of climate change is running short. The stakes are high. It's time for world leaders, negotiators and the public to increase their intensity, to develop more specific strategies, and deliver more emission reductions. We need to build on Doha and get on a path to a strong, fair and ambitious climate agreement. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- In the wise words of Joshua Ferris, ""Then We Came to the End."" We're rapidly approaching the close of 2012 and the technical end of autumn. And of course, according to (pseudo-scholars of) the Mayan calendar, we're a mere week away from The End of the World. All that finality got us thinking about how folks really manage to lose their netiquette heads when they scramble, legs flailing and akimbo, toward the denouement of events and life chapters. So here is the ultimate (get it?) guide to a polite big finish. If you're leaving your job ... Generally, it's wise to wait until your last day or so to let the LOLcat out of the bag (which is to say, to tweet or blog or otherwise post about your new gig). Why? Because until the ink has dried on your contract, you don't want to run your mouth and risk sharing an update your new company wanted to announce itself. Plus, your current employer might not want to be hit with a torrent of resumes. Remember to give your professional contacts your new e-mail address before your account is shut down. Then social-media up a storm on your first day or after your first week gushing about how much you love your new gig. Just don't do it during business hours. Obviously. If you're leaving a city ... The most heartfelt farewells will happen in person, but you do need to let your more casual acquaintances know about the relocation. A mass e-mail is wise, as are a few Paul Revere-esque ""Moving day is coming! Moving day is coming!"" updates on your social networking site of choice. But brace yourself: You'll likely continue to receive mass digital invites to events and debauchery in your former city from well-meaning but clueless contacts. Calmly write back to the inviter, explain that you won't be attending because you're flipping 2,000 miles away, and ask to be taken off the attendant chain of e-mails/texts/Facebook messages. If your company goes kaput ... The unemployment rate may have ticked down, but bankruptcies and shut-downs are still rampant (co-columnist Andi's magazine, ""Martha Stewart's Whole Living,"" was shuttered on Friday, in fact). Stay classy to aid your job search and keep the bridges behind you unburned. Wait until the employer has made official statements to the press (don't blow the lid off the thing sooner), and then use whatever outlets you have to spread the word that you're back on the market. (Hi there!) (Hey, we couldn't very well call ourselves Netiquette experts if we weren't big on the Art of Self-Promotion, right?) If you're leaving your wife ... Digital missives should not, we repeat, should not be involved in the actual dumping. It's an obvious warning that more than a third of adults bewilderingly ignore. Suck it up and place a phone call or discuss it in person. Then let your close friends or parents or whomever know about the break-up (we recommend using e-mail or the phone) before you go switching up your relationship status on Facebook (or worse, creating an online dating profile). You don't want your loved ones to call you in alarm after a stalk-y friend alerts them to your new Single status, do you? If you're hanging up your hat as Netiquette columnists ... You take a bow and move on. These last 2.5+ years (and 130+ columns) have been real, and we're legit grateful to the readers and fans who responded with balanced criticism, intelligent questions and positive feedback. We've enjoyed mouthing off and calling out netiquette breaches as we saw 'em, and hope you've picked up a pointer or two.

"Rome (CNN) -- A Vatican official, a financial broker and a former secret service police officer were arrested Friday on suspicion of corruption over an alleged attempt to smuggle a huge sum of cash into Italy, Rome's prosecutor said. The official, Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, works as a financial analyst in the Vatican office that administers Vatican-owned property. The archdiocese of Salerno, in southern Italy, issued a statement saying media reports identifying him as a bishop there were incorrect. Prosecutor Nello Rossi told reporters the three suspects could face corruption charges, with Scarano also facing a possible count of defamation. He stressed that the investigation is ongoing and that money laundering is not among the possible charges based on what investigators have uncovered so far. The suspects were identified as a result of a larger investigation into the Vatican bank, also known as the Institute for the Works of Religion, Rossi said, but Friday's arrests are not directly linked to the bank. The alleged offenses took place while the suspects were ""attempting to illegally import from Switzerland large amounts of money in cash, to be considered the result of tax evasion,"" he said. The alleged attempt took place in July 2012 but it was never carried out in full, he said, as the money never left Switzerland and never reached Rome. Scarano and the two other suspects were trying at first to bring in â‚¬40 million ($52.1 million) in cash using a private plane, then the reduced sum of â‚¬20 million, he said. Scarano is suspected of being the intermediary between the broker and former secret service policeman and the people who wanted the cash, he said. The operation put in place to bring in the money was ""extremely sophisticated,"" he said, in part because of the secret service officer's role in the plan. Investigators are looking at transactions from two accounts Scarano held at the Vatican bank, one a personal account and the other used for donations, he added. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Scarano had been suspended from his work at the Vatican more than a month ago, as soon as his superiors had been informed that he was under investigation. The Vatican is ready and willing to cooperate with Italian authorities on the investigation when they get in touch, he said. Rossi has been investigating the Vatican bank's role and relationship with Italian banks for some years. Papal commission . The arrests come in the same week that Pope Francis established a papal commission tasked with investigating the activities of the Vatican bank. The commission, made up of four clerics and a Harvard law professor, will report to the pope with its findings ""in view of possible reform,"" Lombardi said, according to Vatican Radio. The Vatican has been plagued by internal power struggles over its murky finances for decades. On Wednesday, a financial watchdog agency established in 2010 issued its first report on money laundering, in a move to improve financial transparency in the city-state. The document from the Financial Intelligence Authority shows six reports of ""suspicious activity"" in the past year, up from just one in 2011. It says the Vatican's prosecutors are investigating two of those reports for possible criminal activity. It wouldn't elaborate further. The Vatican bank is also working to improve transparency, announcing earlier this month that it will launch a website to publish an annual report of its activities. The bank serves thousands of Catholic charities, religious orders and dioceses around the world, in addition to roughly 500 people living in the tiny city-state. It has some 33,400 accounts and about $8 billion in assets. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Alanna Petroff contributed to this report.","NEW: Prosecutor: The alleged attempt to bring cash into Italy was ""extremely sophisticated""

"(CNN) -- Family members of Christian ""Chucho"" Benitez are still awaiting medical and autopsy reports to find out what killed the soccer star, his father said. ""We are hoping the documents tell us what happened,"" Ermen Benitez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Tuesday. They are also awaiting documents from the Qatari government so that his son's remains can be transported from Doha to Quito, Ecuador, he said. Jose Chamorro, the player's agent, told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez, 27, had suffered a heart attack and died Monday in a Qatari hospital where he was taken after complaining of abdominal pains. Ermen Benitez said his son never had any cardiac problems, and before he jointed Qatar's El Jaish club, he had a clean bill of health. ""When a football player is signed, they always do tests,"" he said. ""And he passed."" Asked about a report that Benitez's wife had claimed the soccer star did not receive immediate medical attention at the hospital, Ermen Benitez said he didn't want to speculate until he had the medical report. With many unanswered questions, one thing is clear: his family and fans are devastated. Prayers and condolences pouring in from around the world have helped, said his father -- who is himself a former soccer star and remains the top league scorer in Ecuadorian football history. ""It fills me with a bit of calmness,"" he said, ""but I am never going to see him again. Now the joy I had when I watched him playing is over."" Having played at the 2006 World Cup as a youngster, Benitez had developed into an important component of an Ecuadorian side bidding to reach next year's finals in Brazil. His 24 international goals make him the third-highest scorer overall for Ecuador's national team. In a statement on its website, El Jaish described Benitez's death as ""a great loss for the team"" and said the Ecuadorian player had ""high morals."" The Ecuadorian Football Association said on its website that Benitez's remains were expected to arrive in Ecuador by Thursday morning. Benitez made his name at El Nacional, a club where his father played with great success throughout the 1980s. After leaving the Quito side, who posted a tribute on their website to Christian on Monday, the South American plied his trade with such success for Mexico's Santos Laguna that he alerted the interest of the English Premier League. Joining Birmingham City on loan in 2009, the Ecuadorian made his debut at Manchester United and scored his first goal at Liverpool. Despite a bright start, his impact faded over the season, prompting Birmingham manager Alex McLeish to return Benitez to Santos Laguna in 2010. After leading the scoring charts, he joined rivals America in 2011 and helped the club win this year's Clausura title -- finishing as top scorer along the way. He died on Monday, one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish. People we've lost in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Two fifth-grade boys armed with a stolen semi-automatic gun, ammunition clip and knife plotted to kill a classmate in Washington state but were thwarted when another student informed a school employee, authorities said Thursday. The two boys, who told police they considered the girl rude and annoying, won't be tried as adults and will be in court next Wednesday for a capacity hearing, said Tim Rasmussen, the Stevens County prosecuting attorney. The two boys, ages 10 and 11, told authorities that they were also going to kill, or ""get,"" six more students at Fort Colville Elementary School in Colville, Washington, and even identified them from a class list provided by school employees, according to court documents. The boys' plan called for the older to stab the girl off-campus with a 3.25-inch knife last week, and the younger boy would scare off any responders with a .45-caliber Remington 1911 semi-automatic handgun, court documents said. The younger boy had been in ""a short dating relationship"" with the girl, but he told authorities that ""she's rude and always made fun of me and my friends,"" court papers said. ""Yes, I just want her dead,"" the younger boy told authorities. He brought the gun and knife to school, documents said. The older boy had been friends with the girl for several months, but he wanted to kill her because she picked on and annoyed him, court papers said. ""Yes, and I wanted to kill her alone at first,"" the older boy told a police officer. The officer noticed in his interview with the older boy that he ""did not display any emotion or remorse during the interview,"" court papers said. The younger boy took the gun from his older brother by finding a hidden key to the gun case kept in the brother's bedroom, and the older brother told authorities that he stole the firearm from their dead grandfather's home, court papers said. The older brother is also a juvenile, Rasmussen said. The two boys told another student two weeks earlier about the plot to kill the girl and were going to pay him $80 to keep it secret, the court filings said. The two boys were going to kill the other six students by luring them away from school one at a time, court papers said. When authorities were transporting the arrested boys to the Stevens County Courthouse, the juvenile probation department staff told a detective that they overheard the older boy telling the younger: ""If I find out who told them about our weapons, I'm going to kill them. I don't care; when I get out of jail I'm going to come back and kill them,"" according to court papers. Under Washington state law, children between the ages of 8 and 12 are presumed to not have a capacity to commit a crime, prosecutor Rasmussen told CNN. ""What this hearing will determine is they will look at certain factors and try to get these children under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,"" Rasmussen said about next week's proceedings.","Two boys plot to kill a girl outside their Washington state school unravels .
