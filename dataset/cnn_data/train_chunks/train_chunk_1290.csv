"With the recent influx of foreign footballers plying their trade in the Premier League, English clubs have been subject to heavy criticism for not fielding enough homegrown players. The days of a full starting XI of Englishmen are well and truly gone at the top of the table, as on average only 3.5 make it into their respective strongest first teams. Leading the way with the most Englishmen in their starting XI are Liverpool - who have six England players making the strongest team. Manchester City however, only have one regular English starter in goalkeeper Joe Hart, and his only compatriot in the squad, James Milner, is often overlooked in favour of foreign team-mates. VIDEO Scroll down to see Jack Wilshere's cheeky dummy in England training . Three Lions: Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere at England's London Colney base on Monday . Liverpool: 6 . Formation: 4-2-3-1. Mignolet; Johnson, Sakho/Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Lallana, Sturridge; Balotelli. Brendan Rodgers' philosophy of buying and nurturing English players has paid dividends to the club's recent success with six players making the starting XI. Raheem Sterling was sensational for Liverpool last season, a product of Melwood training academy which has also produced the likes of ex-England captain Steven Gerrard who is still a regular starter for the Merseyside club. Duo: Steven Gerrard (left) and Daniel Sturridge (right) are both English and make the likely Liverpool XI . Top dogs: Liverpool have the most likely English starters with six, including Raheem Sterling (pictured) Southampton: 5 . Formation: 4-3-3. Forster; Clyne, Fonte, Yoshida, Bertrand; Ward-Prowse, Schneiderlin, Davis; Tadic, Pelle, Rodriguez. Boasting a highly successful training academy, Southampton have earned a reputation for churning out impressive young English players such as Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Ward-Prowse to name a few. Although only the latter is still at the club, Saints have replaced academy players that have left with English players such as Nathaniel Clyne, Jay Rodriguez and Fraser Forster. Riding high: Fraser Forster (right) is one of five English players likely to start for Southampton this season . Arsenal: 5 . Formation: 4-2-3-1. Szczesny; Chambers/Debuchy, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Wilshere, Ramsey; Walcott, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud/Welbeck. Four English players: Calum Chambers, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere and new signing Danny Welbeck make the Arsenal strongest XI when fully fit. Arsene Wenger’s recent £12m capture of versatile defender Chambers from Southampton has proved a shrewd acquisition, as the young Englishman has settled in to the team well with inspiring performances at both full back and centre back this season. New man: Danny Welbeck has signed for Arsenal for £16million from former club Manchester United . Changing their ways: Arsenal now have five likely starters who are English, including Calum Chambers (right) Formation: 4-2-3-1. Howard; Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Baines; Barry, McCarthy; Mirallas, Barkley, McGeady; Lukaku. Everton: 4 . Leighton Baines, Gareth Barry and hot prospect Ross Barkley all make the starting XI of Roberto Martinez. Barkley is widely regarded as a potential England starter for Euro 2016 due to the 20-year-old's assured performances in the Premier League at a young age. Nationality: When he returns from injury, Ross Barkley is one of four likely English starters for Everton . Tottenham: 3 . Formation: 4-2-3-1. Lloris; Dier, Vertonghen, Kaboul, Rose; Capoue, Bentaleb; Lamela, Eriksen, Townsend; Adebayor. Mauricio Pochettino’s purchase of Erik Dier from Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon takes the total number of Englishmen who make the starting XI to three. Although Andros Townsend was left out of Roy Hodgson’s squad for the qualifier against Norway, Danny Rose’s inclusion follows an impressive start to his Premier League campaign, keeping new signing Ben Davies out of the team despite coming to the club this summer. Arms aloft: Eric Dier, pictured celebrating a goal against QPR, is one of three likely starters for Tottenham . Manchester United: 3 . Formation: 3-5-2. De Gea; Jones, Evans, Rojo; Valencia, Shaw/Blind, Herrera, Di Maria, Rooney/Mata; Van Persie, Falcao. Although boasting the new Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney, this Manchester United side under Louis Van Gaal only boasts three starting Englishmen. A far cry from the class of ’92, with only Phil Jones, Luke Shaw and Rooney making the XI assuming every player is fit. Captain fantastic: New England skipper Wayne Rooney is one of just three likely English starters for Man United . Chelsea: 2 . Formation: 4-3-3. Courtois; Azpilicueta, Cahill, Terry, Ivanovic; Matic, Ramires, Fabregas; Willian, Hazard, Costa. The only two English players which make Chelsea’s starting XI are centre-back pairing Gary Cahill and John Terry. Apart from the defensive duo, Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea don’t have a single other English player in their full squad, meaning they have the second fewest in the top eight. Defensive duo: Centre-backs Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry (right) are just two English starters for Chelsea . Manchester City: 1 . Formation: 4-4-2. Hart; Zabaleta, Mangala/Demichelis, Kompany, Kolarov; Yaya Toure, Fernandinho, Navas, Silva; Aguero, Jovetic. Man City’s sole English inclusion in their best starting XI is No 1 Joe Hart. Hart bucks the trend of Englishmen being replaced by foreign players by holding the City No 1 jersey for the last four seasons, making 190 appearances. All alone: Manchester City goalkeeper is the only Englishman likely to start for Manuel Pellegrini's side .","Top eight Premier League clubs average 3.5 Englishmen per starting team .

"A family recently moved out of a Utah home where a woman mysteriously disappeared six years ago, claiming the house is haunted. The home in West Valley City has been the backdrop of one of Utah's most notorious missing persons cases. Susan Powell lived in the home with her husband Josh and their two young sons when she disappeared without a trace in  December 2009. Her husband Josh later moved out of the home, and committed suicide in February 2012, killing their two young sons as well in a house fire.

"Call: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered a review of a controversial court that has the power to make decisions in secret . Chris Grayling has ordered an urgent review of a controversial court that has the power to make life-or-death decisions – and even send people to jail – in secret. The Justice Secretary last night asked one of the country’s most senior judges to consider steps to increase the transparency of the shadowy Court of Protection. Set up in 2007 under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act, it gave the state draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look after their own affairs. Controversy increased when the Daily Mail revealed last month that a woman had been jailed in secret after trying to remove her father from a care home where his family thought he was in danger of dying. A judge ruled Wanda Maddocks, 50, should go to prison for five months for contempt of court even though she was not present or represented by a lawyer. She is the first person known to have been imprisoned by the Court of Protection. Several senior MPs expressed alarm at the case and suggested the Government should review its procedures. Now the Justice Secretary has written to Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court of England and Wales, asking him to expand an existing review of the family courts to consider the use of secret hearings in the Court of Protection. ‘We have already agreed there is a need for greater openness in the family courts, with the intention that we make progress on this as soon as possible in order to ensure public confidence . . .’ he wrote in a letter seen by the Daily Mail. ‘As you will be aware, the issue of transparency in the Court of Protection has also recently attracted media attention. Set up in 2007 under Labour¿s Mental Capacity Act, the Court of Protection gave the state draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look after their own affairs . 'While we want to ensure that we balance the interests of safeguarding vulnerable adults with those of increasing the transparency of proceedings, I would welcome your views on how we might best achieve this. ‘Therefore I would like to invite you to consider if you might extend the scope of your work on transparency in the family courts to include arrangements for the Court of Protection.’ Ministers are expected to hold a meeting in the next few weeks with Sir James on how the review will proceed. Concern: Controversy increased when the Mail revealed last month that Wanda Maddocks had been jailed in secret after trying trying to remove her father from a care home . A Ministry of Justice source said Mr Grayling had been ‘deeply concerned’ by the idea of people being jailed in their absence and without any public scrutiny and believed reforms must be considered. MP John Hemming, chairman of the all-party Parliamentary Group on Family Law and the Court of Protection, said: ‘At last the Government has stopped being complacent and pretending there is no problem. ‘They have been ignoring this issue for years. The Wanda Maddocks case was one where she was imprisoned for taking her father to a solicitor to get legal advice to prove that the courts were wrong. 'That can’t be right. There is a general problem of secrecy right across the family courts. If the legal system won’t stand up to public scrutiny there is something wrong with the legal system – not with public scrutiny.’ Former Liberal Democrat care minister Paul Burstow, who has been critical of the court, welcomed the move. ‘I think a review is timely and should allow us to ensure justice is being seen to be done. We need to bring this more into the light so people understand how this court does its job. ‘It’s also vital that where decisions are being made that have a very direct and considerable impact on families’ lives, that every effort is made to ensure that they actually know what is going on.’ Miss Maddocks was jailed for taking her father John out of his care home against the instructions of a court order that he should not be moved. She served six weeks of her sentence. A judge ruled Miss Maddocks was causing her father ‘very considerable grief’ and ‘it seems to be only right she should go to prison’. Pleased: MP John Hemming, left, is glad that the Government has stopped being complacent on the issue, while former Lib Dem care minister Paul Burstow, right, also welcomed the move . The Court of Protection, which handles 24,540 cases a year of which 2,700 involve the Official Solicitor, is increasingly being asked to sanction key medical decisions that will either prolong a patient’s life or allow death to take its course. It also intervenes in other business involving property, financial affairs, divorce and other civil disputes when a person is deemed unable to make decisions. Set up by the last government, the court was given powers to sit in secret. In practice, it has never opened to the public and only its final judgments are occasionally made available beyond the courtroom. Niri Shan, a contempt expert with the law firm Taylor Wessing, said: ‘This is in every practical way a secret court. This is troubling. Five months is a long sentence. It is rare that a court will sentence someone to five months for contempt.’","The Court was set up under Labour's Mental Capacity Act in 2007 .

"The man who inspired the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the viral sensation which is raising money to fight Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), has become a new dad. Pete Frates announced on Sunday that his wife, Julie, had given birth to Lucy Fitzgerald Frates, a healthy baby girl who weighed 7 pounds 8 ounces. ‘Little Lucy Frates has arrived and Mom, Dad and Lucy are perfect,’ Frates wrote on his Facebook page. Pete Frates pictured taking the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge: His wife Julie, in the black dress, gave birth on Sunday to a baby girl they are calling Lucy . Frates, 29, who lives in Beverly, Massachusetts is a former captain of Boston College Baseball. In 2012 he was diagnosed with ALS – also known as Lou Gehrig's disease – a degenerative disease that hits the nerves and the brain and can lead to paralysis and death. There is no cure, though a treatment now available can extend the life expectancy for its sufferers. Since his diagnosis, Frates has devoted much of his time to raising awareness about the condition and along with his family and friends he came up with the ice bucket challenge as a creative way to get people excited about raising money for ALS research. Before Pete Frates was diagnosed with ALS in 2012, he had been captain of Boston College Baseball . The social media craze sees people getting drenched in a chilly mixture of freezing cold water and ice cubes and a host of star have taken part including Oprah Winfrey and Matt Damon. After gaining incredible momentum through social media during July and August, more than 3 million people around the world have joined in the challenge and raised more than $100 million for the ALS Association. By comparison, the ALS Association raised $2.8 million during the same time period last year. Pete Frates’ father John Frates told WCVB that the birth was 'the perfect ending to the miracle month of August.' Frates wrote that baby Lucy's arrival was an ‘amazing blessing as the exclamation point to the miraculous month of August 2014!’","Pete Frates was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2012 .

"With players banned from wearing anything but white and visitors exhorted to dress smartly, Wimbledon's dress codes are almost as famous as its tennis. But two fans decided to put neat dresses and tidy chinos to one side, and turned up wearing unusual bikini tops made from tennis balls instead. Completing their unusual ensembles were novelty sunglasses, one pair topped with a model Big Ben and the other with a tropical palm tree. Are you sure that's allowed? A pair of tennis fans brave the  weather at Wimbledon in tennis ball bikini tops . Despite the chilly weather - and the occasional shower that left other Wimbledon fans running for cover - the patriotic pair looked cheerful, perhaps helped along by their glasses of Pimms. Although Wimbledon has no formal dress code, the official guide to the tennis tournament warns that 'the removal of shirts or [wearing] any clothing likely to cause offence' could result in ejection from the south London venue. Members of the All England Lawn Tennis Club do, however, have to adhere to a strict set of rules about what they can wear, with distressed denim, midriff baring tops and leggings all outlawed. Instead, the club asks guests to wear a 'lounge suit or tailored jacket, shirt, tie, trousers and dress shoes. Ladies are expected to dress to a similar standard.' Brrr! Fans arriving at Wimbledon were forced to unfurl umbrellas and don their rain macs this morning . Chilly: A patriotic fan sits down to watch the tennis on Murray Mount safely beneath a huge umbrella . Although anything goes on Murray Mount, . those watching from the Member's Enclosure are warned that rigid . standards of dress will be 'strictly enforced'. Players too have strict rules to follow, with many introduced following years of colourful, bottom-scraping tennis dresses and equally wacky men's shorts. According to the latest set of rules, players must wear outfits that are 'almost entirely white', with large manufacturers’ logos 'not encouraged'. Underwear must also be white, while caps, headbands, wristbands and socks must also be white, although coloured trims no wider than a centimetre are allowed. Strict: The rules for players such as Caroline Wozniaki specify 'almost entirely white' garments . Nice to meet you: Carole Middleton beams at Terry Wogan as she takes her seat in the Royal Box .

Today sees Andy Murray back on court for the third time, with Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut providing the opposition. Also on court today are Novac Djokovic and Venus Williams, while Danish star Caroline Wozniacki has already beaten Croatian challenger Ana Konjuh in straight sets. Despite the big-hitters on the court, the crowds of tennis fans have garnered almost as much attention this time around - thanks in no small part to the celebrity quotient.

"David Cameron is delaying a controversial appointment by Speaker John Bercow over fears it could ‘embarrass the Queen’. Government sources said the Prime Minister was effectively sitting on Mr Bercow’s decision to appoint Australian catering manager Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year post of Clerk of the Commons, in charge of running Parliament. Mr Bercow’s selection has been criticised by MPs on all sides, warning that Miss Mills lacks the knowledge to advise Parliament on constitutional matters. Scroll down for video . Commons Speaker John Bercow is under pressure to let MPs grill the Australian Parliamentary aide Carol Mills, who is the front runner to become the new House of Commons clerk . No 10 yesterday confirmed the Prime Minister had not forwarded the nomination to the Queen for approval, despite having had it for at least ten days. A spokesman said: ‘It is an important role and for the individual to be able to carry it out successfully, they need support from MPs across the Commons.’ The comments come after senior MPs raised concerns over Ms Mills's lack of knowledge about Westminster procedures. The prestigious £200,000-a-year post combines the clerk's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of Commons chief executive. In an effort to defuse the row, Mr Bercow has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs as soon as possible. The suggestion has failed to appease critics who are planning a potentially damaging showdown with the Speaker when the Commons returns from its summer break next week. There have been calls for a confirmation hearing before a committee, and a motion could be tabled in the House to force the issue. Ms Mills, currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by Mr Bercow. He is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than promoting deputy clerk David Natzler. The Prime Minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the Queen to be finalised. The text of a motion that could potentially be tabled by Tory backbencher Jesse Norman next week has been circulated. Reports suggest up to 50 MPs have already pledged to support it. It would apparently stop short of demanding Ms Mills appointment be abandoned, merely insisting there should be a confirmation hearing. The mooted text reads: ‘That this House believes that the recommendation of Ms Carol Mills to be Clerk of this House should be subject to, and contingent upon, a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee.’ Mr Bercow has been under mounting pressure to delay the appointment. Former foreign secretaries Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett last week added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let MPs grill Mr Bercow’s top choice to become the next House of Commons clerk. It came after Ms Mills finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment. Former Foreign Secretaries Margaret Beckett and Jack Straw have called for Ms Mills to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to scrutinise her appointment . Ms Mills, a senior aide in the Australian Parliament in Canberra, said she was ‘disappointed’ that colleagues in Australia had declared that she had ‘no parliamentary knowledge or experience’. It came after an email was leaked from the Australian clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, to the Commons authorities which warned against her appointment. Responding to the memo Ms Mills said: ‘It would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time,’ she said. ‘As a senior parliamentary officer, I take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the Commonwealth of Australia Parliamentary Service Act 1999.’ Ms Laing apparently cited an incident in which CCTV cameras were used in the Australian Parliament to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator's office late at night. The episode is being investigated, as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity. But Ms Mills said her Department of Parliamentary Services ‘looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the CCTV footage was in fact authorised, and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege’.","Carol Mills, a top aide in Australian Parliament, set to be next Commons clerk .

"A New Orleans woman was laid to rest earlier this month - but only after one final party, during which her body was displayed sitting at a table that is fully stocked with beer, whiskey and menthol cigarettes. But no party is complete without a flashing disco ball, and 53-year-old Miriam Burbank's funeral service was complete with one of those, as well. Burbank died on June 1. When the funeral home directors at Charbonnet Funeral Home asked Burbank's two daughters what their mother liked, the two women decided they wanted her funeral to reflect that she was full of life. Scroll down for video . 'Full of life': Miriam Burbank's daughters wanted their mother's funeral be representative of how full of life she was - and this is what they came up with . Party animal: Burbank's funeral was complete with her dead body propped up at a table with a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey . Menthols: Burbank's daughters also included a pack of menthol cigarettes . So the daughters came up with the interesting concept of having their mother's body displayed as though she were at a party - where, presumably, she sat and smoked menthol cigarettes while drinking beer and whiskey as a disco ball lit up the room. To honor Burbank's love of the New Orleans Saints football team, her fingernails were painted black and gold - the color of the team's uniforms. According to WGNO, Burbank's daughters said that other family members liked the idea, and thought it was a very fitting goodbye for their mother. This is the second time this year when New Orleans has played host to a rather taboo funeral service. In April, well-known New Orleans philanthropist Mickey Easterling was sent off in a similar fashion. Trend: In April, New Orleans socialite Mickey Easterling had a similar funeral service . Smokers: Like Burbank, Easterling's funeral service included a cigarette and alcohol . Planned: Unlike Burbank, Easterling planned her entire funeral service, from the champagne to the elaborate hat . More than a thousand people attended the popular, 83-year-old socialite's funeral - at which her body was propped up on an iron bench with a glass of champagne in one hand and a cigarette holder in the other. 'She`s in a Leonardo outfit,' Sammy Steele, who did Mickey’s hair . and make-up, told WGNO at the time. 'And I actually dressed her tonight for the occasion.' Easterling was known for being a bit on the fabulous side, so for her funeral she also was wearing and ornate hate and a fancy outfit. 'It’s like something out a department store window in New York. On 5th . Ave.,' says Steele, referring to how Mickey’s memorial service was . planned by her ahead of time, 'This is what she requested.  She`s . sitting in a garden scenery to depict her back yard.

"Fans of a mixed-martial arts fighter who allegedly brutally beat his porn star ex-girlfriend have shared a picture of her out and about in an attempt to discredit her claims. A supporter of Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, the fighter accused of savagely beating Christina Mackinday in her apartment on August 8, shared the image on Twitter on Sunday. The Twitter user, @Grenade_112, wrote that the picture revealed that Mack was 'good enough to go parting a couple nights ago' and claimed the image showed her outside a club. The image was originally taken in Las Vegas and shared by another Twitter user, who is not part of the 'Free War Machine' group. Mackinday, who is also known as Christy Mack, responded to @Grenade_112 to confirm that the picture was her, adding: 'I'm not sure that picking up food in our sweat pants is ""a night on the town"".' Scroll down for video . Spotted: Christina Mackinday, who was allegedly beaten by her ex-boyfriend, MMA fighter War Machine, was pictured out and about a few days ago. War Machine's supporters said it showed she was a liar . The adult movie star, who previously shared images showing her swelled and bruised face following the attack, told the Twitter user that she had gone out to get ice cream. 'You can see the damage to my face even in the dark. And I can't drive myself,' she wrote. 'I get out about once a day for a little bit. It's depressing staying in 1 room sleeping all day.' The supporters of War Machine have turned on Mack on social media, accusing the alleged victim of lying about her extensive injuries and posting images of her home, Fox8 reported. Police had issued a warrant for Koppenhaver's arrest and, after a week on the run, he was caught at a hotel in the Simi Valley in California. He remains in jail, awaiting extradition to Nevada. Together: Mackinday, 23, is pictured with War Machine, whose real name is Jonathan  Koppenhaver . Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' showed up unannounced at her home and let himself in with a key. There, he found her and a friend, Corey Thomas, sleeping. She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her and wanted to rape her. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Ms Mack, an adult film actor, said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. Injuries: After the alleged attack at her apartment on August 8, Mack posted pictures of her horrific injuries online; after she shared the images, police put out a warrant for War Machine's arrest . She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. Caught: War Machine was eventually tracked down to a hotel in Simi Valley after a week on the run . 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She added: 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly.' Her supporters have raised more than $85,000 for her care and a dentist offered to give her free dentures until her teeth can be fixed. After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for War Machine and he became the subject of a manhunt. He was eventually tracked down to the hotel. The pair had dated on and off again for 15 months and War Machine accused her of cheating on him, police documents state. Prosecutors in Las Vegas filed multiple felony, battery, assault and coercion charges against Koppenhaver. If convicted, it could land him in prison for more than 25 years. Claims: War Machine took to Twitter to insist that he had intended to propose to Mack but ended up 'fighting for my life'. On August 8 (the message seen bottom), the day of the alleged attack, he wrote he must be cursed . But Koppenhaver, who legally changed his name to War Machine, and his supporters insist that he was defending himself in the August 8 incident. 'I'm not a bad guy,' he wrote on Twitter on August 10. 'I went to surprise my gf, help her set up her show and to give her an engagement ring and ended up fighting for my life.' He added: 'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would be happily engaged. I don't know y I'm so cursed. One day truth with come out.' He is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Superior Court on September 2.","The picture shared on Twitter shows Christina Mackinday, who was allegedly beaten by Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, standing in the street .

"A Spanish state research vessel carried out 'irresponsible' and 'dangerous' manoeuvring in British Gibraltar territorial waters, potentially risking the lives of Royal Navy personnel, the Foreign Office said. Europe minister David Lidington called Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs Gonzalo de Benito to express 'grave concerns' about the incident, which occurred yesterday. It is the latest in a series of rows between the UK and Spain over Gibraltar, and Mr Lidington stressed that the waters around the territory are 'indisputably British'. Scroll down for video .

'Under no circumstances should Spanish vessels be provoking a situation that could result in serious injury or a fatality. 'The waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British. We will continue to take whatever action we consider necessary to uphold British sovereignty and the interests of Gibraltar, its people, its security and economy.' The incident yesterday involved the two-year-old, 951-ton research vessel Angeles Alvarino, which the Foreign Office said deployed equipment to survey two locations within British Gibraltar territorial waters.

"An angry University of Queensland student has written a hilarious petition after she was snubbed for a meeting with US President Barack Obama. Ashley Chandler posted a lengthy letter to the university, which hosted a speech by Obama on Saturday, on Change.org. She called their decision not to invite her to the talk ‘a scandal that would rank somewhere between Watergate and the 2011 Greenfield incident’. The 21-year-old explained to Daily Mail Australia that while her letter was a work of satire she is genuinely angry about how UQ allocated the tickets to students. ‘The letter that I wrote is satire but it is being ridiculous as it points out how ridiculous their conduct has been,’ she said. Scroll down for video . University of Queensland Student Ashley Chandler wrote a petition after she wasn't invited to hear Obama speak . President Barack Obama at  at the University of Queensland in Brisbane . The fifth year law and political science student wrote: ‘I am, naturally, upset/outraged/hurt/offended/aggrieved by UQ’s decision not to invite me.’ Listing the reasons she believes she should have been invited, Ms Chandler said: 'I hold a leadership position in the university, I am a scholarship student, I have represented UQ internationally, was once on Millionaire Hot Seat, have seen all seven seasons of the West Wing, and hell, I even went to College.' Ms Chandler said she was not the only student who was disappointed not to receive an invite. 'There are many, many students who have contributed much to the UQ community who should have been offered the opportunity to attend, some even more deserving than me (maybe),' she wrote. Ms Chandler hinted that she thought the university didn't invite her because she is a woman. And added: 'Perhaps the worst thing about this entire process is that it seems to fly in the face of everything Barack Obama stands for. He was the one who told us all that ""Yes, we can"", but, literally, we can’t.' Ashley Chandler said the university had upset a lot of students by not inviting them to Obama's speech . Mrs Chandler hinted that she thought the university didn't invite her because she is a woman . Ms Chandler said the decision flies in the face of what Barack Obama stands for . She highlighted that the other two Brisbane universities that handed out invites – Griffiths Uni and QUT – had a much better system than QU. ‘400 tickets were given to one small portion of the student body… some of whom aren’t even interested in politics and are just going for the hype of it,’ Ms Chandler said. She argued that there was a lack of transparency in the way the tickets were handed out. ‘There was a message from vice chancellor; he said tight timeframes meant the tickets were given away to students that live on campus. Hundreds of students from Brisbane's three main unis were invited to the speech . ‘But I don’t think that really stacks up when students from other unis came to the speech,’ she reasoned. After watching Obama’s speech from her living room she said: ‘I thought it was OK but he was telling people what they wanted to hear. To be honest it wasn’t groundbreaking.’ Ms Chandler said students are in the middle of their final block of exams and have not been told if they can even access the library this weekend while Obama is in town. One student told her he was turned away by security when he tried to hand in his work and told ‘sorry it’s going to have to be handed in late’.

"A nanny who worked next door to actor Stephen Collins and Faye Grant in the late 1990s has come out to describe the couple's 'odd' behavior . A Massachusetts woman who worked as a nanny in New York in the 1990s, in the same building as accused child molester Stephen Collins, has come out to tell of his strange daily visits in pajamas and reading his 'semi-pornographic novel'. The woman named Ilene called into Boston radio station  Mix 104.1 Wednesday morning, just after it was revealed that the  actor famous for his role on 7th Heaven had sexually abused at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13. Ilene says she worked as a nanny for a family who lived next door to Collins and his estranged wife Faye Grant, when they lived in a 'beautiful' and 'affluent' Upper East Side Building in the late 1990s. 'He used to come over for breakfast every morning, and have breakfast next door with us. Not too sure why, but he would show up in his striped pajamas.' While Collins and his wife always seemed to be having problems, Ilene says they appeared to be loving and protective parents of their daughter Kate. 'I knew things weren't great between him and Faye... they were always in therapy and always threatening to leave each other. 'But for their daughter - they were always there for her.' When she read about Collins taped confession, released by TMZ yesterday, Ilene found it 'creepy' since she knew him as a father and family man. Scroll down for video . The nanny named Ilene, who now lives in Massachusetts, worked for a family who lived next to the Collins in this apartment building just a block from Central Park . 'It was weird to me that he did that to other little girls as well and he was so close with his own daughter,' Ilene said. Ilene describes Collins and Grant as 'very nice parents' but 'very odd'. However, she says he never displayed any inappropriate behavior while she was around. 'Your would never have known anything was going on,' she said. One thing that struck her as strange about Collins was the sexual nature of his two novels, which were quite a departure from the image he created playing Rev Eric Camden on 7th Heaven for more than a decade. Ilene says she was given the opportunity to read his book Eye Contact before it was published and she found the writing to be 'semi pornographic'. I always thought it was weird that he wrote a pretty graphic novel. I thought that was a little odd because he didn't seem like that type of person when you knew him, but when you read the book you were like ""wow this is pretty dirty,""' she said. Collins has written two mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact (left) and Double Exposure (right). Both appear to have a sexual nature, according to summaries online . Collins has penned two mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact and Double Exposure. Eye Contact is about a New York actress 'whose best performances are off-screen, in her dangerous relations with men' Meanwhile, Double Exposure brands itself as a novel about the private life of a TV critic who  has a 'five-year-old daughter, an angry ex-wife, and a very-soon-to-be-ex-fiancie, not to mention a come-hither co-anchor, and a beautiful brand-new neighbor who's alluring, available . . . and much, much more than meets the eye'. Collins is currently under investigation by the NYPD in response to tapes released yesterday, in which he confesses to exposing himself and even touching at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13 in both New York and Los Angeles. The LAPD is collaborating with New York authorities, but they initially closed their own investigation into Collins two years ago after receiving the tapes themselves and finding 'no verified victim'.

Mr Zimmerman was watching football and waiting for his wife to return home with dinner, which they were to share with one of their sons, 13, and his friend. After 30 minutes, he called her to no answer, and 15 minutes later, he decided to go and find her. But as he was leaving his driveway, police arrived and told him his wife was in the hospital.

"Winston Churchill’s unshakeable belief in victory made him one of history’s most celebrated wartime leaders. But a remarkable discovery shows Churchill worried he had pushed his allies too far and feared he had started a war with France. In one of the most controversial decisions ever taken by a Prime Minister, he ordered the bombing of the French fleet in North Africa sending 1,300 French sailors to their deaths. History remembers Sir Winston Churchill for his determination and . unshakeable belief in victory, but a telegram reveals he feared he'd pushed his allies too far . The top secret telegram reveals Churchill's fears Britain could end up at war with France as well as Germany after the Royal Navy bombed . ally's ships. The Prime Minister ordered the attack after France surrendered to . Germany in 1940 . Churchill was worried the Gallic fleet would fall into Hitler’s hands and they could then be used to invade Britain. He gave the French an ultimatum: scuttle the ships or send them across the English Channel. When the French failed to respond he took matters into his own hands and ordered the navy to launch a devastating bombardment of their ships in Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria. The massacre sparked a diplomatic crisis and has been described as the French Pearl Harbour. Many across the Channel have never forgiven him. But while Churchill was widely lauded in the House of Commons for his courage in sending out the message that Britain would fight the Nazis – alone if necessary – a top secret telegram reveals he had his doubts. A copy of which is now going under the hammer reads ‘British Naval forces...asked the French Naval authorities to take certain steps to prevent a number of important French Naval units at this port from falling into German hands undamaged. ‘The French declined to take these steps. Heavy action ensued between British and French Naval forces with great and much regretted loss to the French. HMS Hood, one of the Royal Navy ships involved in the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir . British captain and naval attache in France, Nicolas Butler (R), salutes, in the French city of Brest to commemorate the Battle of Mers-el-Kebir . ‘We cannot tell what the consequences may be, but every precaution should be taken in case the French declare war against us. Further particulars later.’ The telegram was sent by the War Office just hours after the bombing, effectively telling them to prepare for a French declaration of war on Britain. It is believed this message, that is stamped ‘Secret Cipher Telegram’ and is headed ‘Secret’, was for Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, as there is a red tick next to his name. It is a relative of his who is now selling at International Autograph Auctions in London. The attack on the French came a month after 338,000 British troops were evacuated from Dunkirk and on the eve of the Battle of Britain. General Charles De Gaulle told the French people the bombing was regrettable but rathered the ships and men were killed than they become part of a German force . When Churchill announced the news to the House of Commons he was cheered by all parties as it proved to the world, especially the US, that Britain was still up for the fight. The French responded by launching a demonstration bombing of Gibraltar harbour. The prominent French politician, Pierre Laval, also offered the Germans 500 French pilots for the Battle of Britain which was turned down by Hitler. After the liberation of France in 1944, Laval was arrested, convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad. Some French people understood the reason for the attack and the bereaved family of one sailor killed in it was buried with the French tricolour and the Union Jack. Terry Charman, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: “It was an extremely controversial and unnatural thing to do as the French were our allies. 'But we just didn’t trust the word of their admiral who told Britain that rather than let his ships fall into German hands he would scuttle them. 'We couldn’t take the risk of them not doing it and Churchill ordered the attack. Churchill feared the French fleet in Algeria could fall in to Nazi hands . 'It was a calculated risk based Britain thinking the French was so demorilised they wouldn’t do anything. 'There was talk of the French wanting to declare war on us but all they did was a demonstration bombing of Gibralter harbour. 'The newly formed French State cut off diplomatic relations with Britain. 'General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French in England, made a very dignified statement over the radio to the French people stating that he absolutely regretted what had happened but he rather the ships and men were killed than they become part of a German force. The French 'Pearl Harbour': Battleship Bretagne is struck in battle at Mers El Kebir . Battleship Dunkerque under fire during Operation Catapult otherwise known as the Battle of Mers-el-Kabir . 'Winston Churchill announced the news of the attack in the House of Commons and he was applauded and cheered. 'It sent off signals to the US that Britain was still very determined to carry on the fight.'

"Islamic State terrorists last night released a fourth propaganda video featuring British hostage John Cantlie, in which he blamed the UK government for beheadings by jihadis in Syria. In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist told how the terror group ‘eagerly awaited’ a ground war with America and its allies. He also accuses western governments of spending millions of pounds on ‘Hollywood-style’ military action instead of paying ransoms to his captors. In the chilling 6min 53sec film, Mr Cantlie said he expected to be executed, adding ‘I await my turn.’ In a further development, in a long article apparently written by Mr Cantlie for IS’s Dabiq magazine, he insists he writes the scripts to the videos in which he appears. Scroll down for video . Captive: A still from the newly-released video of British Hostage John Cantlie. The photojournalist has been a captive of IS for two years . In last night’s professionally-produced video, the 43-year-old captive – wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit – said a battle against the fanatics where no one ‘gets their hands dirty’ was impossible. So far, a 40-nation coalition led by the US and including Britain as well as Arab nations have carried out air strikes while ruling out combat troops. Mr Cantlie, who appeared to be delivering the message under duress, added that the beheading videos were a ‘win-win’ for the militant group. However, it appears the film was shot before the murder of Alan Henning. Delivering scripted lines, Mr Cantlie said the decapitation of ‘three previous cellmates’ by Islamic State fanatics had shocked the public. But taxi driver Mr Henning was the fourth Western hostage to be executed, after US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, has featured in several propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists in recent weeks . Hostage: An article allegedly written by British hostage John Cantlie, pictured in an online video has been published by Islamic State militants . It includes a photograph of Mr Cantlie, 43, appearing to wear the now-familiar orange outfit worn by other IS hostages, and it is not clear how much the hostage was acting under duress when, or even if, he wrote it. It is slickly put together, in a propaganda magazine designed to inflame the feelings of IS followers. Describing Mr Cantlie as 'nobody going nowhere', the article says he is sleeping on a matress on the floor of a 'clean and comfortable' room, which 'for a man in my position, it is enough'. It states: 'Four of my cellmates have already been executed by the Islamic State in the most visceral way possible after the British and American governments apparently made a joint decision not to discuss terms for our release with our captors. Familiar: The article includes a photograph of Mr Cantlie appearing to wear the now-familiar orange outfit worn by him in previous videos and by other IS hostages . Mr Cantlie said: ‘If these executions force public outcry or a policy change, that is a huge victory. And if they only goad our governments into dropping more bombs and spending millions more dollars, making our countries weaker in the process, that is a victory too.’ Magazine: The article appeared in propaganda magazine Dabiq . Mr Cantlie – kidnapped two years ago – said IS would ‘passionately and violently’ outlast any action ordered by Barack Obama: ‘Anyone hoping for a nice neat surgical operation without getting their hands dirty is in for a horrible surprise once it gets under way.’ He added: ‘One month ago Obama pressed the button on air strikes. Now we have to wonder how long his policy of no boots on the ground has left to live. As for IS, they eagerly await to see those boots.’ Mr Cantlie said on the video – introduced with the title Lend Me Your Ears – that it was conceivable foreign jihadis could return to their home countries to carry out attacks. He also says David Cameron chose not to enter negotiations with Islamic State that might have got the hostages out, and is now using the beheadings as an excuse to ‘beat the drums’ for military action against Muslims. He added: ‘I deeply resent it, Prime Minister. Thanks a lot.’ In the article published online in Dabiq magazine, Mr Cantlie calls on the Government to negotiate his release. A Foreign Office spokesman said it was analysing the article and video. Earlier this month Mr Cantlie's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son’s release. In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him. He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them. Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die. ‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.’ Addressing his son’s captors, he said: ‘To those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’ Smoke rises after a strike on the Syrian town of Ain al-Arab, known as Kobane by the Kurds, as seen from the Turkish-Syrian border. IS are now poised to take the town, despite desperate fighting from Kurdish resistance . Flying high: The black flag of ISIS flies over the Kurdish Syrian Town of Kobane.

"Gambling companies who operate offshore are to be hit with a £300 million tax bill under plans unveiled today. The Treasury will force bookmakers to be taxed on their profits from British customers, wherever the companies are based in the world. And those who try to dodge tax will face up to seven years in jail and unlimited fines. High street bookies like Ladbrokes and Corals have all located the online parts of their business offshore in tax havens . Target: Coral and William Hill will also be affected by the law change which will force them to pay tax on profits from UK punters . High street bookies like William Hill, Ladbrokes and Corals have all located the online parts of their business offshore in tax havens like Gibraltar in order to reduce costs. But from next year betting firms who take money from punters in the UK, online or on the telephone, will be liable to pay gambling taxes on the profits from those customers even if they are based overseas. Depending on the type of gambling offered, remote gambling operators with UK customers will be liable to pay either remote gaming duty, general betting duty or pool betting duty, all of which are currently taxed at 15 per cent. The Gambling Commission estimates that the UK remote gambling market is worth over £2bn per year. Treasury officials calculate that the new rules will bring in approximately £300m per year in additional tax revenues. The new rules will be supported by tough enforcement measures, including the creation of new criminal offences. Failure to comply with them could result in prison sentences of up to seven years, unlimited fines, or the loss of a remote gambling operator’s licence to operate. Bill: The Treasury expects the law change to raise £300million a year . The changes, which are due to come into force on 1 December 2014, will be included in the Government’s next Finance Bill. The new rules have been drawn up following a three month consultation on plans to change move to taxing gambling on a ‘place of consumption’, rather than on a ‘place of supply’ basis. The Mail revealed last week that Culture Secretary Maria Miller will introduce legislation when MPs return to Westminster next month to ensure that every gambling website which has UK customers has to have a British betting licence. Government officials say that requiring all online operators which work or advertise in the UK to have a British licence will ensure they participate in tackling corruption in sports, provide funding to combat problem gambling and ensure adequate protection of children and vulnerable adults. A review of the stakes and prizes available through fixed odds betting terminals in betting shops has concluded that they should not rise. But campaigners are still pressing for them to be cut. Sajid Javid, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, told the Mail: ‘It is unacceptable that gambling companies can avoid UK taxes by moving offshore, and the Government is taking decisive action to ensure this can no longer happen in the future. ‘These reforms will ensure that remote gambling operators who have UK customers make a fair contribution to the public finances.’","Gambling firms operate websites offshore in tax havens .

"More than 70 years after they fell on a foreign field, the remains of two World War II heroes have been found by amateur enthusiasts in Italy. The two unidentified Grenadier Guards died during Operation Avalanche during the Allied landings at Salerno, south west Italy in 1943. The discovery was made by four World War II part-time historians from the 'Salerno 1943' association who were carrying out a reconnaissance tour of the hilltop. The soldiers were found buried near one another on land between the villages of Capezzano and Coperchia, a few miles from the beach . Clue: Munitions were found near the skeletal remains . British and American troops landed on . the beaches at Salerno before beginning a bitter campaign in which the . ferocity of the German resistance destroyed Churchill’s notion of Italy . as ‘the soft underbelly’ of the European campaign. Naples . eventually fell on 30 September, three weeks after the landing, and the . campaign diverted German troops from other fronts, bringing D-Day . closer. The soldiers, who . were identified as British from the munitions close by, were found . buried near one another on land between the villages of Capezzano and . Coperchia, a few miles from the beach. The . two are thought to have died in a Nazi attack, before being hurriedly . and provisionally buried by the victors as they took control of the . area. They will . probably have been listed as missing in action but it is hoped that . their relatives can now be traced with DNA testing. Battle site: Salerno 1943 members (left to right) Luigi Fortunato, Gigino Vitolo and Angelo Martuccielo study the grave, which they believe was hurriedly made by the Nazis after they attacked . The mayor of Pellezzano Carmine Citro said: ‘Every new discovery needs to be studied carefully in order to be validated properly. ‘But we know our region is rich in historic remains from the second World War. Furthermore, the area of the hill in Picchiocca, has been cited many time in historic documents in Salerno as a place where the entrenched Germans observed the movements of the Allied troops who landed at Salerno. The events also live on in the historic memory of our elder citizens who today will be reminded of those times.’ The military position in question was denominated as ‘Hill 270’ by U.K. military forces, and features in the published memoirs of British soldier Christopher Bulteel. As told by Bulteel, the hill was easily occupied the day September 22, 1943 by British Grenadiers but not having had the opportunity to entrench themselves and being few in number they were driven back by a counterattack losing many men. On the 24th the Coldstream Guards, including Bulteel, attacked the enemy position. As they advanced along the slope of the hill, he recalled that the ground was strewn with the bodies of his fallen comrades two days earlier. The battle was hard and there were many casualties on both sides. Historians will use DNA testing to find relatives of two British World War Two soldiers whose remains were found in Italy . Matteo Pierro, one of the four who found the skeletons, said: 'We are in a club of amateur historians so we often go around the battlefield sites with metal detectors. 'In one of these searches on Thursday we came across the two British soldiers. 'The metal detectors started going off when they sensed the munitions, so we started digging. One was in a trench about 30cm below the surface and one was just beneath the top soil. The group thought at first they could be animal bones but when they realised they were human they called the police. Antique bookseller Mr Pierro added: 'You know immediately which side they were on. The uniforms had completely decayed but the buttons and buckles were British.' He said the group had previously found two Nazi soldiers one of whom had been identified. The tags worn by the Nazi troops were metal, rather than the leather of the British, making them easier to identify. He added: 'The research could be quite simple though as there are only a limited number of people that are still missing from the battle over two days on this hilltop.'","Bones belonging to two soldiers who died in 1943 have been discovered .

"A mother-of-three is lucky to be alive after doctors failed to diagnose that the clear liquid streaming from her nose was a brain fluid leak. Aundrea Aragon, 35, made several trips to her doctor over a four-month period but was sent home with nasal sprays after being told it was simply allergies. Mrs Aragon finally discovered something was seriously wrong last month after being forced to go to the emergency room with liquid pouring from her nose. She was diagnosed with a cerebrospinal fluid leak from two cracks in the back of her sphenoid sinus, a potentially fatal condition. Rare condition: Aundrea Aragon, 35, almost died after having brain fluid leak from her nose for four months . Support network: Mrs Aragon, pictured with her husband Anthony and three children Art, 16, Marc, 10, and nine-year-old Reina is expected to recover fully from her surgery . She had surgery at the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson to correct the condition which is extremely rare - affecting only one in 100,000 people. The condition can be fatal due to the high risk of infections like meningitis rather than from the loss of brain fluid which the body constantly produces. Mrs Aragon told ABC: 'If I looked down or bent over, it would literally pour out of the left side of my nose. I had no control at all.' The 35-year-old said that she was forced to walk around with paper towels shoved up her nose to stop the stream of liquid. She said that she would wake up at night choking on fluid. However she did not question the doctor's diagnosis because she also suffers from fibromyalgia and was too busy caring for her three children. Mrs Aragon has two sons Art, 16, ten-year-old Marc and a daughter Reina, nine, who has autism. Support: Mrs Aragon, pictured with her husband, is lucky to be alive after undergoing a new procedure to stop her leaking brain fluid . Life-saving: The 35-year-old mother of three underwent surgery at the University of Arizona Medical Center to correct the cracks in her sinus . When the nasal spray did not work on Mrs Aragon, she went to the emergency room last month. She said doctors were shocked by the volume of liquid that was coming out of her nose. A spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome causes the colorless and odorless substance to stream from the nose for no apparent reason. It is caused by a hole in the dura mater (pictured below) - tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms can include, headaches and blurry vision, feeling dizzy, nausea, extreme tiredness and a metallic taste in the mouth. Tinnitus, tingling in arms and legs and weakness of facial muscles are other signs. The condition is rare - affecting one in every 100,000 people. It is most common around the age of 42 and women are twice as susceptible. She was referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist who diagnosed the condition. A cerebrospinal fluid leak is more common in . overweight patients with high cranial pressure or those who have . suffered head trauma from an accident. The surgeons at Arizona Medical Center have developed a new procedure to repair cracks which cause the brain leak by going up the patient's nose instead of opening their skull, which is highly risky. Firstly, dye is injected into the patient which shows up where exactly the cracks are by turning the colorless brain fluid green. A team of surgeons use an endoscopic method to reach the sinus via the nostril and graft skin, taken from belly fat, over the cracks. The two-hour surgery has a 95-99 per cent success rate and should protect Mrs Aragon for the rest of her life. However she will be tested several times a year to make sure she does not have another leak. Mrs Aragon said she was grateful to the surgeons and that the procedure did not interfere with her religion as a Jehovah's Witness as no blood products were used. Family: Mrs Aragon said she was too busy to question doctors' opinions that she had allergies because she had to take care of her three children .","Aundrea Aragon was sent home with nasal sprays in Tucson, Arizona .

"The Perth man who shocked onlookers on Saturday afternoon by jumping off a boat and climbing on top of a dead whale carcass has said that his parents have labeled him an 'idiot' for his actions. On Saturday afternoon at approximately 1.30pm, Harrison Williams, from Quinns Rocks, near Perth in Western Australia, swam to the body of the deceased humpback whale and sitting on it. Despite several tiger sharks and at least one white shark circling the whale's bloated carcass, Mr Williams, an extreme sport lover, made the perilous swim over. Scroll down for video .

The 26-year-old said that it was a spur of the moment decision, and he didn't think through the consequences of his actions before he climbed on top of the whale. ‘At first I couldn’t get a grip and I ended up using my chin to drag myself up,' Mr Williams told 7 News. ‘I was out on a boat with the boys and one of them said it would be pretty funny if I surfed a whale so I just did it,' he explained. Footage shows Mr Williams on top of the rotting whale carcass while his friends on the boat call out to him in a panic to tell him that there were sharks in the water around the dead animal. He said that he was aware of the sharks, but didn't realise how dangerous his actions were until after he had climbed up. ‘He [the shark] was too busy chomping on the whale so it wasn’t too bad,' he said. Despite this, Mr Williams said he would not do it again if given the chance. 'I’ve done it, I don’t need to do it again,' he said. ‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn’t mean any disrespect to anyone. Mum thinks I'm an idiot, and Dad isn’t too proud either.' Maritime authorities have said that Mr Williams won't be fined as the whale was already dead and he didn’t remove any part of the animal. On Sunday fisheries officers were monitoring the whale to ensure that it was not interfered with again, and the carcass drifted towards Scarborough, just off the coast of Perth. Mr Williams had earlier told Daily Mail Australia that he had climbed on top of the whale because the animal looked like it was in trouble. 'Basically the whale looked in distress and I tried to help it. But clearly I was too late [sic],' he said. ‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn’t mean any disrespect to anyone.

"Five members of the same family ran a 'crash for cash' insurance scam worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, a court heard today. The Yandell family, who run their own car repair business, claimed that they were involved in 15 different road accidents in less than two years. Cardiff Crown court heard they would have been the 'unluckiest family in South Wales' – if the crashes were genuine. Peter Yandell, 51 (left), who claimed for three accidents in 18 months; his pregnant daughter-in-law Rachel, 29, claims she was with her husband in one crash and involved in two other accidents herself . Byron Yandell, 30, is accused of inventing four collisions and his pregnant wife Rachel, 29, claims she was with him in one crash and involved in two other accidents herself. Byron's father, Peter, 51, and brother, Gavin, 28, claimed for three accidents in 18 months while Peter's wife Michelle, 50, said she had been with him in two crashes. Prosecutor Christopher Clee QC told Cardiff Crown Court: 'Between them they claimed they were involved in 15 alleged collisions in less than two years. 'If they were genuine they may have qualified as the unluckiest family in South Wales.' The Yandell family and their friend Jennifer Cosh, 47, are accused of a total of 28 charges of fraud by claiming for non-existent car damage, write-offs and personal injuries. Byron Yandell, 30 (left), is accused of inventing four collisions and his brother, Gavin, 28, claimed for three accidents in 18 months . The court heard that many of the alleged collisions happened on the same stretches of road near their Easifix car repair centre in Blackwood, South Wales. Mr Clee told the court: 'A clear pattern emerged where the same people, family members and friends, were involved in collisions. 'When their car repair premises were searched by police they found a well-established and well-co-ordinated thoroughly dishonest scheme. 'CCTV cameras at the premises showed vehicles had been deliberately damaged. 'This was a case of insurance fraud on a significant scale. 'It was a ""cash for crash"" scheme' at the heart of which were members of the Yandell family.' Byron, Rachel and Peter Yandell, were said to be the 'driving force' behind the scam. The court heard insurance company Aviva paid out £38,000 after a fake collision between a LandRover and Mitsubishi. Direct Line paid out £30,000 and Equity Insurance £21,500 for other staged collisions. Peter Yandell pocketed nearly £5,000 from two separate personal injury claims, the court heard.

"Home hunters spend less time deciding to buy a property than they do watching one episode of Coronation Street, a new study reveals. Research released today indicates we spend just 25 minutes and 30 seconds viewing a property before making a decision. This is almost five minutes less than it takes to watch one episode of the popular soap, including the advertisements. A lovely looking living room but almost three in ten homeowners (28 per cent) would be quick to buy the house it is in because they 'did not want to put off the vendor by spending too much time there' And this hasty decision could prove to be costly with the average UK home selling for £250,000 - meaning each minute we decide to part with £9,804. What's more, some of us are so eager to get the keys to a new home that we buy it before even seeing it for real, the study found. The new research, carried out by Barratt Homes, quizzed 2,000 Britons about how long it takes us to decide whether to buy a home or not. More than a quarter (27 per cent) of potential buyers felt 'pressure' from estate agents and 25 per cent were not sure how to arrange a second viewing . It found one in eight (13 per cent) purchased a property without even seeing it. Meanwhile, one in five house hunters (17 per cent) decided to buy within ten minutes or less. The study suggests we spend just seven and a half minutes more deciding on a new home than we do on a new pair of jeans. And it seems we allocate more time choosing which car to buy as it takes us 31 minutes to make that decision. The research comes as Barratt Homes released a new 21st Century Living: Heads, Hearts and Homes Report. It reveals the reasons why we are so quick to purchase a new property. Almost three in ten homeowners (28 per cent) were quick to buy because they 'did not want to put off the vendor by spending too much time there'. Home hunters spend less time deciding to buy a property than they do watching one episode of Coronation Street - with the adverts - (above), a new study reveals. More than a quarter (27 per cent) felt 'pressure' from estate agents and 25 per cent were not sure how to arrange a second viewing. One in ten (10 per cent) said they had a 'lack of time' and wanted to purchase the home there and then. The process leaves people feeling 'stressed' (five per cent) and 'worried' (four per cent). Mark Clare, the CEO of Barratt Developments, said: 'Purchasing a property, whether for the first time or the tenth time, is a major life investment. 'It is really important for the buyer to be 100 per cent happy and confident in their decision. 'But rushing this decision can and should be avoided. 'Considering a new build home is one way to do this - new build homes offer customers the opportunity to view a new property they're interested in as many times as they like, without feeling pressured or rushed.' Barratt Homes teamed up with the Social Issues Research Centre to gain further insight into the emotional factors affecting property buying. Kate Fox, the author of Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour, said: 'Given the deep emotional importance of the house in society, there is something very interesting about the disproportionately short amount of time - if any at all - that prospective buyers spend in a house before making the decision to buy. 'When we enter a person's home with the intention of buying it, it can seem strange and uncomfortable - like an imposition or invasion of privacy.'

"It was a not-so-balmy 30 degrees fahrenheit in Walpole, Massachusetts, on Monday morning, and, like many residents of the Boston suburb, a 44-year-old high school teacher donned his winter hat to combat the inclement weather. Only problem is, the only other article of clothing forestry teacher Marc Mertz was wearing Monday morning as he sauntered up and down his driveway were swimming goggles and a towel - and he eventually ditched the towel. Mertz - a teacher at Norfolk County Agricultural High School - was arrested Wednesday after several witnesses watched him walking around his driveway wearing only a ski hat. History: Authorities say teacher Marc Mertz has been accused of exposing himself in public on more than one occasion . Brrrr: This is the driveway where multiple witnesses saw Mertz walking around naked on Monday . The first witness to call 9-1-1 was absolutely shocked when she saw Mertz walking around in the snow in the buff. 'There was just a nude man walking down his driveway. He’s got a ski cap . on and no clothes. I don’t know if he’s still there or not but I just . saw him, very weird. I don’t know who he is or if he lives there or what . he does, but all I know is this guy was stark naked,' the witness is heard saying on a 9-1-1 tape obtained by WHDH. Another witness told authorities that Mertz did more than just walk around while 'stark naked.' 'He was naked and he began to gyrate toward his mailbox as the victim drove by,' Walpole Deputy Police Chief John Carmichael said. Object of his affection: At one point, Mertz was seen thrusting his hips into the mailbox at the end of his driveway . This isn't Mertz' first brush with the law - in 2012, he also was accused of exposing himself in public. 'He had apparently exposed himself to some boaters at a lake in Natick, I don’t know if he was arrested,' Carmichael said. When he has his clothes on, parents describe Mertz as a good teacher. 'He was a good teacher, my daughter had him for a couple classes. I met . him a once or twice, seemed like a nice guy to me,' one man told the station. Regardless, Mertz now faces some serious criminal charges - and his teaching job could potentially be in jeopardy. Hi praise: Parents of children taught by Mertz describe his as an excellent teacher . 'We charged him with open and gross lewdness. Part of the elements of that crime are the victim must have been shocked and alarmed by the behavior that was exhibited. In this case both victims were shocked and alarmed,” Carmichael said. Mertz has been placed on administrative leave from Norfolk County Agricultural High School as an investigation into the alleged incident continues.","Marc Mertz is a forestry teacher at Norfolk County Agricultural High School .

"Allegations: Actor Stephen Collins is  under investigation for accusations of child molestation . The actor who played Reverend Eric Camden, the virtuous father on long-running family drama 7th Heaven, is  under investigation for child molestation. In a recorded marriage therapy session, actor Stephen Collins admits  that he exposed himself to several young girls between the ages of 10 and 13 in both Los Angeles and New York. Following the tapes release by TMZ on Tuesday, Collins life and career started falling apart as he resigned from his position on the Screen Actors Guild board and was fired from Ted 2. An NYPD official confirmed to MailOnline that they  received a complaint and the Special Victims Squad is investigating. A law enforcement source told TMZ that Collins is suspected of having 'inappropriate sexual contact' with 'at least three' minor victims. The LAPD is also re-opening their own investigation into Collins, and will be collaborating with New York authorities. Law enforcement in California received the therapy session recordings two years ago but closed their case after finding 'no verified victim'. The 67-year-old actor allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the therapy session. Grant secretly recorded the session under the advisement of her lawyer, who told her it was legal in California to record conversations in order to gather evidence on a person who has committed a violent felony. In the recording, a man with Collins' distinct voice admits exposing himself to an 10-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman. Collins and Weinman divorced in 1978. He also confessed to touching the young relative. 'There was one moment of touching where her hand...I put her her hand on my penis,' Collins says. That incident of molestation was actually reported in 2012, and can still be prosecuted since the statute of limitations starts at the date of reporting. Collins is best known for his role as Rev Eric Camden, patriarch of the do-gooder Camden clan, on the long-running drama 7th Heaven. Jessica Biel, top right in left image, was an early star of the decade-long show. Collins' now ex-wife Faye Grant (pictured together on the right in 2011) recorded a marriage therapy session in 2012 in which the actor admits to exposing himself to several underage girls . Collins goes on to admit exposing himself to several others girls. He says he exposed one girl 'a couple of times' when she was 11, 12 and 13. 'When you exposed yourself...did you have an erection?' Grant then asks. 'No, I mean, no. Partial, maybe, I think,' Collins responds. Collins says he also exposed himself to a girl who lived in their Los Angeles neighborhood, who he tried apologizing to years later, and a New York girl who was 12 or 13 at the time. An NYPD source has confirmed to TMZ that they are in possession of the tape, and last Wednesday two members of their Special Victims Unit flew to L.A. to interview Grant. They allegedly questioned her about the tape and other potential witnesses. In one part of the session, Collins confesses to molesting a 11-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman. Pictured above in a still from 7th Heaven with actress Jessica Biel . The woman who triggered the NYPD investigation allegedly told cops that she would sometimes stay with Collins and his first wife at their New York City apartment when she was 10. Since Collins and Weinman were married from 1970 - 1978, that woman is likely around 46 to 54 years old today. She said he would often come into the guest room, where she slept, after taking a shower and only wearing a towel. He then exposed himself to her, and would make the victim put her hand on his penis. She says he also touched and rubbed her. The victim tried to prevent these attacks by pretending to be asleep. It was only when she saw Collins on a TV show in the 90s that the woman first told her husband about the childhood abuse. In 2000, she sent an anonymous letter to Collins' then-wife Faye Grant, telling her he was a child molester. But it wasn't until late 2011 that she ever received a response, after Collins confessed about his past sexual abuse. Grant sent the woman an email saying: 'Stephen lied when confronted 12 years ago. He said he had a hole in his holey jeans, as was the style then, and you ""must have"" seen his genitalia one time.' 'Stephen is not remorseful, shows no guilt, and his shame is demonstrated as extreme self pity. He wails and cries, ""I'm in so much paaaaaain!!!""' Collins was fired from the film Ted 2 on Tuesday, after news of the recordings broke. He excitedly tweeted about getting a small role in the Mark Wahlberg comedy just a few days ago . It's still unclear how TMZ obtained the tapes, as Collins' estranged wife Grant told E! News she did not leak it. 'I woke up today to learn that an extremely private recording I handed over to the authorities in 2012 per their request in connection with a criminal investigation was recently disseminated to the press. I had no involvement whatsoever with the release of the tape to the media,' Grant said. Grant added to TMZ that she is 'sickened by Stephen’s actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek treatment for pedophilia, but he has refused to seek proper help or hospitalization for the predilection toward children.' Collins announced his divorce from Grant in May 2012, issuing a statement saying they were 'moving forward separately in our lives'. 'She has been my dearest friend and a loving mother,' Collins said. 'I know that we'll go through this process in a way that honors our family.' The divorce papers came as a shock to Grant who said she was both surprised and devastated. 'I wish him the very best in whatever path he chooses to take. Twenty-seven years of marriage in Hollywood is the equivalent of 189 dog years. I was exhausted,' she responded. Their seemingly amicable split quickly deteriorated, however, once they started dividing up the assets. The NYPD has a copy of the therapy session recordings and are allegedly investigating the claims. Collins pictured above in more stills from 7th Heaven . In their highly contentious divorce proceedings, Grant argued that she had stayed home during her peak acting years to raise their daughter Kate  and now couldn't book a job to support herself. Meanwhile, Collins was raking in acting job after acting job making nearly $500,000 just in 2013 for appearances on the TV shows Revolution, Devious Maids, Scandal and The Fosters. Grant said she grew used to upper-class living during her nearly three decades married to Collins, when they made between $1 and $3million a year. Collins made an unfortunate reference to Woody Allen in a tweet two years ago. The director has been accused of molestation by his biological daughter . She asked for an unspecified amount of spousal support, half of their $6million bank account and half the value of their two properties in Brentwood, California. Collins next role was in American Repertory Theater's production of O.P.C' alongside Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, but he dropped out two weeks ago due to 'scheduling conflicts' The startling revelation has also led to the actor's firing from the movie Ted 2, just a few days after he excitedly tweeted about getting a small role in the Mark Wahlberg comedy, Entertainment Weekly reports. Collins previously held a position on the National Board of the Screen Actors Guild but resigned today following the news of the investigation, a SAG/AFTRA official told TMZ. Despite the disturbing claims issued today against 7th Heaven actor Stephen Collins, his on-screen wife Catherine Hicks has come out in his defense  - calling him a 'good' guy. Hicks, who played matriarch Annie Camden on the decade-long show about a family with seven children, was filmed Tuesday walking in a Santa Monica hospital parking garage where she was asked about the tapes in which Collins admits to molesting several girls between the the ages of 10 and 13. The actress smiles and she says she's heard of the allegations but that there was never an indication he was an abuser from their years on set where they worked with several underage actors and actresses. 'Stephen is a good guy in my opinion,' she says.","Stephen Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to underage girls in a therapy session secretly recorded by ex-wife Faye Grant .

"A toddler who captured the hearts of the nation when she sparked a worldwide marrow donor appeal as she battled a rare form of cancer died 'peacefully' this morning. Margot Martini was just 14-months-old when she was diagnosed with both Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) in October last year. Her parents Vicki, 39, and Yaser, 43, launched a Swab4Margot campaign on Christmas Eve which was backed by celebrities including Stephen Fry and Gary Barlow. Margot Martini who was just 14-months-old when she was diagnosed with both Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia  in October last year died this morning . The appeal went viral across the world and led to 50,000 people requesting swab kits from the charity Delete Blood Cancer UK in the first six weeks. A match was then discovered and Margot underwent a successful bone marrow transplant from an anonymous  22-year-old German man in February this year. Doctors declared the child was 99 per cent certain to be disease free a month later but tragically, tests in June revealed a small amount of ALL had returned. In February Margot underwent a successful bone marrow transplant from an anonymous  22-year-old German. Doctors declared the child was 99 per cent certain to be disease free a month later but tests in June revealed a small amount of ALL had returned . Her parents then made the heart-breaking decision to stop her treatment in July after doctors told them her chances of being able to live a normal life were slim. And this morning, Vicki and Yaser revealed the two-year-old had passed away 'surrounded by those who love her' at their home in Roehampton, London. Writing on their website, which they have used to keep supporters updated throughout the treatment, Margot's parents said: 'At 10:24 this morning, our dear little daughter, Margot passed away at home. 'She died peacefully and was surrounded by those who love her. 'Thank you for all your love and support. 'Vicki, Yaser, Oscar & Rufus.' Writing on their website, which they have used to keep supporters updated throughout the treatment, Margot's parents said: 'At 10:24 this morning, our dear little daughter, Margot passed away at home' Last Sunday, the parents – originally from Essington, Staffs – posted a statement saying the family were taking things 'hour by hour'. They said: 'Margot's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past couple of days and in particular since yesterday afternoon, she's now in a very poor and fragile state. 'It's an extremely difficult time for Margot and for all the family. 'The only thing we can now do is continue to monitor her constantly changing condition and try and keep her comfortable. 'Margot has been asleep all day and she continues to sleep peacefully. Mercifully, for now at least the drugs appear to be working.' Brave Margot captured the nation's hearts  with her Titian hair and infectious smile throughout her treatment . Her parents also revealed nothing more could be done to save the toddler and said she was 'beyond rescue' earlier this month. In a post on the Team Margot website on October 16, dad Yaser, a real estate investor, said: 'Bottom line is this life threatening pseudomonas bug is gathering momentum and Margot can't seem to clear it. 'We are told that Margot is now beyond rescue and that it's no longer a matter of the place of care, but the place of death. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is an acute form of leukaemia, or cancer of the white blood cells, characterised by the overproduction of cancerous, immature white blood cells. These cause damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells. ALL is most common in childhood with a peak incidence at 2–5 years of age, and another peak in old age, . Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a cancer characterised by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. 'Margot is to remain at home, where we are keeping her as comfortable as possible.' Brave Margot captured the hearts of the nation with her curly ginger hair and infectious smile throughout her treatment. Celebrities including Stephen Hawking, Omid Djalili, Catherine Tate, Boris Becker and Bill Bryson all gave their support to the Swab4Margot campaign. A special video was also recorded by her favourite TV character Peppa Pig – voiced by 12-year-old Harley Bird – which ended with the touching words 'Goodnight Margot, sleep tight.' Hundreds of tributes began flooding in to the Team Margot page on Facebook just minutes after her tragic death was announced. Sarah Cody wrote: 'Heartbreaking but I'm glad her suffering wasn't prolonged. Sleep tight beautiful girl xxxx' Gill McCullen added: 'I've never cried so much for a little girl I never knew. Devastated for you all, she was loved by so many in the end. Love to you all xxx' And Janine Broughton said: 'Margot's legacy will be the many other children that will be helped through all your campaigning. 'So very sad to hear your heartbreaking news.You couldn't have done more and she knew she was so loved by you and Team Margot. Love to you and the family xxxx' Margot battled against an extremely rare form of dual lineage Leukaemia - exhibiting both Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. At the start of her fight, her parents revealed a consultant haematologist told them he had only seen three similar cases in the last 10 years. The brave toddler inspired hundreds to become lifesaving bone marrow donors as part of the 'Just One More' awareness campaign in support of Delete Blood Cancer and Anthony Nolan. As a result of Team Margot's efforts, more than 35,000 people joined the stem cell register in the UK - meaning statistically there will be more than 500 blood cancer patients who will now get the option of a donor who could save their life .","Margot Martini was just 14-months-old when diagnosed with both Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in October last year .

"More than ten new alleged victims of entertainer Rolf Harris have come forward, it has been claimed . More than ten new alleged victims of disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris have come forward to claim he abused them, it has been reported. The claims relate to allegations in Australia, New Zealand and in Britain, a police source has revealed. Many of the victims are understood to have been underage at the time of the alleged abuse, which could mean Harris will face fresh charges. Operation Yewtree will deal with allegations relating to British victims, while those made abroad will be handled by local police, the Sunday Times reports. Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults on June 30 at Southwark Crown Court by Mr Justice Sweeney - one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years. During the trial, Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls. Jurors were told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend ‘haunted’ her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide. Passing sentence, Justice Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.' His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE. The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims. He was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which spanned between 1968 and 1986. The claims relate to allegations of abuse in Australia, New Zealand and in Britain, a police source has revealed .

"Donald Sterling's mistress was not only able to trick him on the phone but new photos reveal that she was able to convince him she was a decade younger as well. Pictures show that V. Stiviano and her octogenarian lover celebrating her '21st' birthday on October 25 even though she is actually 31-years-old. The photos show Sterling standing next to his model girlfriend as she is presented with a cake in the style of a basketball. Scroll Down for Video . Masked: Donald Sterling's former girlfriend Vanessa Stiviano and her entourage arriving at KOI Restaurant in LA for dinner . Donald Sterling's former girlfriend showed off some skin wearing a mesh blouse with a black bra underneath, black leather shorts matching her Chanel tote bag and Gladiator style black leather open toe booties . Personalized cake: V. Stiviano is pictured with Donald Sterling at her birthday celebration last October, and she was presented with a cake saying 'Happy 21st Birthday' even though she is 31-years-old . Playful: Stiviano threatened to put icing on her 80-year-old lover's face at the party which was held in the Staples Center where the LA Clippers play their home games . Birthday girl: Stiviano attended a home game at the stadium that October evening in unusually formal attire . Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, right, and V. Stiviano, left, the woman who recorded his racist rants . Rather than drawing a sporting goods brand name on the cake, the birthday 'girl's' moniker was written across the ball. She is seen playfully threatening to put icing on her beau's face, and he smiles as he turns away in vain. The celebration was held inside the Staples Center where the Clippers play their home games and Stiviano is seen wearing a low-cut floor length teal gown that she was pictured wearing at the basketball game that same day. Stiviano is in a far less celebratory mood lately, and a source close to the self-described 'artist,lover,writer,chef, poet,stylist, philanthropist' has been getting death threats since a recording of a phone call between her and Sterling was leaked. Life of luxury: Stiviano continues to wear her trademark visor hats as she tries to keep the glare of the sun- and cameras- out of her eyes on Thursday . All in the details: She was seen carrying a multi-thousand dollar Hermes bag . Taking her title seriously: A self-proclaimed philanthropist, Stiviano thought it right to tip this homeless man $40 outside the nail salon . Got to look good: She braved the outdoors for a trip to the nail salon . On her way: Friends say Stiviano has started going to counseling as a result of the backlash from the racist recording scandal that led to the ban of Donald Sterling from the NBA . 'V started getting death threats almost immediately after Sterling’s racist rants — which she recorded — were made public,' an unidentified source told Radar. 'Most of the threats were made on social media, and this is one of the reasons why she has scaled back her activity. It has been very scary for V, and she also hired a bodyguard.' She should get used to it though if she decides to seek off. 'One day, I will become President of the United States of America, and I will change the legislation and laws,” Stiviano told one news camera outside her home this week in bizarre comment. 'Modern day history. Civil rights movement.' She reportedly has a number of other recordings involving both her lover, Donald Sterling, and his estranged wife, Shelly, but those tapes are being kept in a 'secure and safe location'. 'V has also been in contact with a counselor to deal with the stress of the fallout of the scandal,' the source said. It's a look: Stiviano has been wearing visor hats popular in Asia ever since the tape was leaked on Saturday . The nature of the tapes where Shelly is heard have not been revealed, but the source says that she is 'extremely candid, unfiltered, and very different' than how she has been portraying herself since her estranged husband's recording was released on Saturday. 'While Shelly doesn’t make any racist comments, it gives the public an inside look into who she really is behind closed doors... She also swears like a sailor. Her tapes will definitely raise eyebrows,' the unidentified source reveals. In addition to earlier court documents which named Shelly as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants, with one African American resident claiming that she called him a 'black motherf*****' during an argument, there is a new damning video. Guarded: The mistress (pictured on Tuesday) has hired security since she has been the subject of death threats via social media . Taking turns: If not her formal bodyguard, this friend accompanied her to a car wash where her red Ferrari was taken care of on Wednesday . She is shown walking into one of her husband's buildings and posing as a health inspector and answering to a fake name. The Radar source also makes claims about the nature of Stiviano's relationship with Sterling that calls into question their motives. The source said that 'V absolutely didn’t have a sexual relationship with Donald' even though that is directly contradicted in the court papers filed against her by Shelly in an effort to get back some of the millions of dollars in gifts she was given during the course of their relationship. 'Donald enjoyed the attention a young woman would give him. Yes, he did give her very extravagant gifts, but it was based on a friendship,' the source claimed. Her lies about her birth date are just the latest in a web of reinvention that she has spun for herself over the years. The 31-year-old lives in an impressive $1.8m condo in an upscale, tree-lined avenue in Los Angeles, close to Beverly Hills. Skating to notoriety: V. Stiviano is pictured outside her LA home on Tuesday. Her rise to fame is all the more startling given her poor Texan childhood marred by tragedy . Mystery woman: Stiviano - or V as she now likes to be known - has changed her name and moved between LA and San Antonio, Texas - where her family lives in Section 8 housing - throughout her 31 years . Reveling in her moment: Stiviano moved to LA to find fame and fortune and allegedly had plastic surgery to improve her 'below average looks'. Now she has found it thanks to the recordings of Donald Sterling's racism . Know my name: Born Maria Pererz, Stiviano changed her name in 2010, for a very disturbing reason adding: 'I haven't yet been fully accepted because of her race' School days: Stiviano, who was born Maria Perez, allegedly attending Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles - the same school Sterling and his wife attended in the 50s . Exterior view of the modest house in Texas, where V. Stiviano is believed to have lived in her earlier life . She owns a bright red Ferrari, two top of the line Bentleys, a sporty Range Rover and a designer wardrobe to match - all of it bought for her by the man she eventually brought down. But a MailOnline investigation can revealed the full story behind Stiviano that gives some insight into why she apparently burned her sugar daddy-sponsored life of luxury for the bigger prize of fame and notoriety - and just why she may have chosen racist Sterling as her springboard. Stiviano turned her back on her dirt-poor upbringing in San Antonio, Texas, where she was raised by a jobless Mexican mother convicted of using her own children to steal from a supermarket - to seek her fame and fortune in Los Angeles. There she got herself noticed through modelling and has even been linked to Jerry Buss, the late owner of the LA Lakers and friend of Sterling. We can also reveal how Stiviano suffered bad skin problems which knocked her self-confidence in her teens, turning to plastic surgery to transform her looks. Most shockingly of all however, MailOnline has discovered why Stiviano, who was born Maria Perez, changed her name in 2010 to wipe out her past. MailOnline has seen the documents, but has chosen not to publish it due to its sensitive nature, but giving a reason for her name change, Stivano claimed in the court papers she hadn't 'yet been fully accepted because of my race'. Stiviano's recordings, in which Sterling is heard telling her not to associate with black people, sparked wide-spread revulsion across America and resulted in the NBA handing Sterling, 81, a lifetime ban preventing him from attending any future NBA basketball games. Scandal: Stiviano has shot to fame after recording LA Clippers boss, Donald Sterling, berating her for hanging around with black people. She has been by his side since 2010 after they met at a Super Bowl game . He has also been slapped with a hefty $2.5million fine and his ownership of the Clippers – a franchise now estimated to be worth a staggering $430 million - now hangs in the balance. Stiviano's lawyer insists that she didn't leak audio recordings of Sterling's vile racist rants. She said she felt 'bad' for him. But Stiviano, up until now a mysterious figure who has been wearing a bizarre visor over her face, certainly seems to be lapping up the attention. Her cat-like face has appeared on hundreds of TV networks, in newspapers and on news websites around the world and at last count her followers on Instagram had jumped to more than 164,000.","Model Vanessa Stiviano, 31, at center of Donald Sterling race hate scandal after recording his rants .

Emily Graslie, 23, who is Chief Curiosity Correspondent at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, regularly receives negative feedback concerning the fact that she is a woman on her show Brain Scoop. In a blisteringly articulate post titled 'Where My Ladies At', she argues that this kind of 'internet bullying' is hampering the advance of female educators in science, technology, engineering and math. Stop the internet bullying: Emily Graslie, 23, who is Chief Curiosity Correspondent at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, regularly receives sexist comments about her YouTube show Brain Scoop . 'There's a pressure to be the whole . package,' she says. 'Not only do you have to be intelligent and articulate, but you . also have to be attractive.' Among the comments that she cites as examples are statements like: 'I'd still totally do her,' and 'perhaps you should consider wearing slightly racier . clothing?' Indeed, many are personal attacks on her appearance. 'I . can't stop looking at her nose. It looks so weird. It kind of makes her . look like a nerdy pig' 'She just needs some sexier glasses,' reads one. 'I . can't stop looking at her nose. it looks so weird. It kind of makes her . look like a nerdy pig.' Another observes: 'She is really cute, but as if she made . herself unattractive on purpose? She could easily keep us focused by . changing her clothes. I would really like to see her again with the . new looks.' Others take aim at the fact that she is a woman in science, assuming that the brains behind the operation are male. Calling for change: Ms Graslie said that there is widespread apathy when it comes to such comments, largely because people don't know what to do about them . 'You'd think this was a man's job, not two . beautiful ladies,' one said. 'Thumbs up for the Skyrim reference. it made me . chortle. I assume that was written by Michael.' [Michael: 'That was not written by me.'] . Ms Graslie points out that 'the overwhelming . majority of comments are positive and encouraging, but there's still a . lot of nastiness that I have to deal with on a daily basis in trying to . make these positive and encouraging videos.' She explains that there are significantly . less female STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) bloggers . than men, and they are experiencing far less success. 'While there are at least 13 STEM channels hosted by men with more than 400,000 subscribers, and seven of . those 13 that have topped a million, there are only four channels hosted by . women that have more than 160,000. None of us have more than a million,' she said. She adds that while this is not a numbers game, and that the male bloggers deserve their success, this sexist reaction could be part of the reason that women don't persevere when faced with it. 'I feel like in general women don't have enough time to do . these things because of the pressure that every episode has to be . flawless in execution,' she said. 'This could be a deterrent for both men and women, . but I feel women are going to give up more easily.' She says women in her field have a fear of the feedback from subscribers and commenters because one becomes concerned that the audience . is more focused on their appearance than the quality of content. 'Even . more than that, we are not convinced that the content has to be good or . factual because we're not convinced that people are watching for the . content in the first place,' she continues. 'That brings on self criticism like, I'm not intelligent or funny or engaging enough on my own.' Ms Graslie said that there is widespread apathy when it comes to such comments, largely because people don't know what to do about them. She called upon viewers to help spark a change and acknowledge that these are serious issues that need to be discussed. 'We can't . idly sit by and tolerate internet bullying in any form,' she said. 'Because that's . what this is - this is internet bullying. . . Help us make it widely-known that this . kind of apathetic attitude is detrimental and unacceptable. 'We need to . make sure that we're making it possible for people of all genders to . feel acknowledged for their contributions and not feel held back by . something as arbitrary as their genetics or their appearance.'","Emily Graslie is Chief Curiosity Correspondent at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History .

"Snared: Wayne Corkhill, 23, was caught by a father posing as his 10-year-old daughter on Facebook . A concerned father posed as his own 10-year-old daughter online to snare a paedophile, a court heard. Cyber predator Wayne Corkhill used Facebook to try and befriend the child and invited her round to his flat for 'cuddles,' telling her she was gorgeous. Unknown to the  23-year-old he was not talking to the little girl, but was actually messaging her father. When the father contacted police, Corkhill who was already on bail waiting to be sentenced for a string of sex offences, claimed his computer had been hacked. He was handed an extended prison sentence of six years and seven months by a judge at Preston Crown Court. Corkhill had admitted five charges of sexual activity with a child, plus two of meeting a child following sexual grooming and one of attempting to meet a child following grooming. Judge Robert Altham was told that the most recent offences took place in June, the same month he pleaded guilty. Sue Carter, prosecuting, said his behaviour with the 13-year-old began with kissing and progressed to touching. He pleaded guilty to the offences, which occurred last year, and was on bail awaiting sentencing when he met up with two girls, aged 11 and 12. Corkhill, from Blackpool, Lancashire., was smoking and he walked with them towards the chip shop where he worked. He met up with them a second time near Central Pier, where he is said to have hugged them both. The court heard he then touched the leg of one of the girls. He contacted one of them online to say that she and her friend should go to his house and have sex, said Miss Carter. Around this time, he made contact with the ten-year-old on Facebook, prompting the girl's dad to exchange messages with Corkhill while pretending to be his daughter. Miss Carter said: 'He made it clear she was ten. 'The defendant said she was gorgeous and asked her to go to his flat for cuddles and gave her his telephone number.' He went on to claim to police that his Facebook account must have been hacked into. Wayne Corkhill, 23, was jailed at Preston Crown Court (pictured) for six years and seven months . Waheed Omran-Baber, defending, said the girls had suffered pain, hurt and anxiety. He said: 'There was a degree of naively and immaturity in his actions. 'There were, however, no threats, violence or intimidation by him. 'The defendant accepts what he has done is wrong. He expresses remorse.' Judge Robert Altham told the defendant he had clearly had the most serious sexual interest towards girls and said an extended sentence was necessary for the protection of the public. He added: 'I have no doubt that had he been left to his own devices these girls would have suffered extremely serious harm at his hands.' Corkhill will be on the sex offenders register for life. A sexual offences prevention order will apply indefinitely. He will serve half his term behind bars before being released on extended licence for eight years.","Wayne Corkhill given extended prison sentence of 6 years and 7 months .

"The husband who shot himself dead at a shooting range after his model wife was pictured cozying up to Leonardo DiCaprio was 'devastated' when his marriage to the 'love of his life' fell apart, a friend has revealed. Katie . Cleary was pictured cuddling up to DiCaprio and Entourage star Adrian . Grenier last month in Cannes, before her husband Andrew Stern killed . himself at a California shooting range on Sunday. Now his loved ones are trying to come to terms with the death of the 40-year-old businessman, who had filed for divorce just weeks before the tragedy. 'Andrew was an amazing man and husband who believed Katie to be the love of his life,' his friend Pace Lattin told MailOnline. 'He . made it clear that he would do anything to make her happy... He saw . that he put all he could into his marriage and his wife, and when she . wanted more, it devastated him.' Together: Stern, who appeared on Millionaire Matchmaker, was the one who petitioned for divorce in April . Tragic: Andrew Stern, who is married to model Katie Cleary, shot himself dead at a shooting range on Sunday . Another friend told MailOnline that he was already on a dark descent when he realized he couldn't hold on to his 'dream girl'. 'Andrew changed at the beginning of the year,' the source told MailOnline. 'He worked more and socialized less. He began investing even more money and more time into his charity and fundraising work... He got sad. Sadder.' The friend explained that something was 'broken' in him and no matter how he tried to fight it - with eating well, exercise or counseling sessions - he couldn't shake it. His struggling married to Cleary was not to blame for his suicide but just added to his pain because of the fantasy he had about their life together, the friend said. 'But the marriage wasn't based on pure, unadulterated, love. Wasn't solely based on the forever do us part love,' the source said. 'He knew what he was getting into when he started even dating Katie. She's too pretty. She's just too pretty. And she's just too charismatic and affable and kind that Andrew knew he couldn't keep her to himself. 'I'm not saying Katie did anything. If she did, I didn't know about it. But he couldn't really have her like he wanted her. Like his fantasy of her. He would talk about her in ideal terms. He idolized her and wanted her to himself, maybe a little too much. He wouldn't show it. He gave her all the freedom she wanted for her career. But he realized he wasn't the only one with eyes for her and wanting her and it deepened his pain.' Spotted: Leonardo DiCaprio was spotted out in NYC Tuesday night attending the Jeff Koons Retrospective at the Whitney Museum . Always going somewhere: The star hit the event after running errands that afternoon . 'I do . remember him sharing that a very famous actor that Katie was working . with was calling her cell and he saw her phone,' the source said. 'So he knew that he was in for a downhill plummet.' Cleary's father, Thomas, who lives just outside Chicago in Illinois, told MailOnline that his daughter was devastated by her husband's death. 'This is a terrible loss for my daughter Katie and obviously she is devastated,' he said. 'We are all grieving for her and for my son-in-law.' Mr Stern . had filed court papers to end the couple's less-than-four-year marriage . just weeks before the images emerged, according to court documents, and . Cleary and Stern were still in the process of dividing up their assets when he took his life. Cleary . and Stern, who had appeared on . Bravo's dating show Millionaire Matchmaker, married the model on July . 31, 2010. The court documents state the pair separated on April 3, 2014.

Getting acquainted: Sources said that Cleary and Stern were going through a divorce, which added to his stress . The rep explained that Cleary and Grenier had been . friends for sometime, while Cleary and Dicaprico had only . met the night they were photographed - but the rep insisted they were innocently . discussing animal conservation and nothing else. However, the celebrity website cites sources as saying Stern felt embarrassed by the pictures and was suffering depression. Interviews . with the couple's friends revealed he was stressed over his marital problems and had a history of depression, TMZ earlier reported, while others said he had financial strains. But . his friend Pace Lattin denied Stern was in serious financial trouble, . saying that the couple's house was paid for and his family was 'well . off'. 'Maybe . he wasn't as rich as some of the Stars his wife was fooling around with . but he was rich with real friends,' Lattin said on Facebook.

Stern had a history of injecting human growth hormones and the male . hormone testosterone in a bid to boost a waning libido. Friends . said the treatment, prescribed by a health and wellness centre in . Beverly Hills, made him irritable and prone to drastic mood swings. Stern was said to have kept it up for a year until stopping using the treatment suddenly. But . after going cold turkey from the drugs, he was said to have sunk into a . deep depression, which was only made worse after the failure of his . business and his marriage problems. On Tuesday it emerged that two other men had taken their lives at the same shooting range in the past five years. Stern shot himself in the head at the Target Range in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, and according to local reports another man killed himself there just 10 weeks ago.

He also featured on Season 2 of the hit TV show 'Millionaire Matchmaker' before marrying Cleary, 'the love of his life', Lattin wrote. 'Andrew kept his original company, never sold out, always was making money and working hard,' he wrote. 'We both started in the industry at the same time, and his passing makes me extremely sad.

He said: 'Rita Ora did a sensational job for me and Antoine Fuqua in Southpaw.

"The first pill to treat a dangerous type of blood clot could be available on the NHS in weeks. Every year in the UK, about 36,000 patients suffer from pulmonary embolism (PE) – a clot on the lungs. The condition is usually treated using injections of the blood-thinning drugs Heparin and Warfarin, which requires constant blood tests to check the drug levels. Clot killer: Rivaroxanab is the first in a new generation of anti-clotting pills that can treat pulmonary embolism . But with Rivaroxaban, the first in a new generation of anti-clotting pills that can treat PE, no injections or blood tests are required. The drug will initially be prescribed for 12 months. It has been given the green light by safety regulators in Scotland and is being assessed for the NHS in England. UK approval: The new drug has been given the green light in Scotland and is being assessed south of the border . PE is caused when part of a clot that has formed in the legs or pelvis becomes dislodged and gets stuck in the main artery of the lung. The pressure this puts on the lung and heart triggers breathing difficulties, chest pain and palpitations and can lead to sudden death. Lifeblood, a charity that campaigns to raise awareness of blood clots, said the new drug would be a great option.","New anti-clotting pill to treat pulmonary embolism .

"Rising numbers of part-time GPs are contributing to a recruitment crisis in the NHS, a report has warned. More than half of family doctors are women and many work only a few days a week, while more male doctors are choosing to go part-time as they juggle managerial roles. In a report published in the BMJ, Professor Veronica Wilkie, who specialises in primary care at the University of Worcester, said the NHS urgently needed to boost GP numbers. Burning out: Many GPs quit the profession well before retirement age, a BMJ report said (posed by models) She said: ‘We have too few GPs, and those we do have are stressed, burning out, and feeling increasingly unable to deliver healthcare safely.’ Earlier this year figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre showed the number of women GPs had overtaken men for the first time. There are now 20,440 females – a rise of 50 per cent in a decade – compared with 19,800 men. Many women work less after having children and eventually leave the profession altogether, often blaming the long hours. Shifting trends: Male GPs are becoming a rarer sight, the report published today found (posed by models) Only last month the Royal College of GPs warned that as many as 500 surgeries could close across England as so many GPs are nearing retirement. Professor Wilkie added: ‘They are not being replaced by younger doctors as it is deemed highly stressful and unrewarding. ‘We need a coherent plan for workforce development in primary care, taking into account undergraduate and postgraduate training and beyond, with a robust funding plan that is flexible enough to reflect the local population’s needs but big enough to prevent further disintegration and a lack of investment.’","Many work a few days a week and quit profession well before retirement .

"Read Matt Lawton on why Whelan is a man stuck in the past on the issue of race . Wigan owner Dave Whelan is the subject of a new FA race investigation after making extraordinarily offensive remarks about Jewish people and the Chinese. Whelan, 77, attempted to defend the appointment of controversial Scot Malky Mackay as his new manager by playing down racist, sexist and homophobic texts sent and received by the 42-year-old while he was manager of Cardiff City. But in doing so, Whelan only managed to whip up a fresh storm by claiming his manager's texts referring to 'Chinks' and Jews pursuing money were merely indicative of general opinion in this country. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dave Whelan apologising on Sky Sports for controversial interview . Dave Whelan risks ostracising himself from football after his outburst about Jews . Malky Mackay was appointed Wigan boss this week, despite the text and email scandal . 'The Jews don't like losing money,' said Whelan. 'Nobody likes losing money. Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do? I think they are very shrewd people. It's telling the truth. Jewish people love money, English people love money; we all love money. 'If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a 'chink' he is lying. There is nothing bad about doing that. It's like calling the British Brits or the Irish paddies.' Whelan's remarks came in an interview published online by the Guardian. Shortly before that, the Wigan owner had learned that one of the club's shirt sponsors — Premier Range — was severing ties with Wigan as a result of the decision to appoint Mackay. A second commercial partner, drinks supplier iPro Sport, also cut its links with the club over the Mackay arrival. Mackay himself is still under investigation by the FA for his part in the text scandal uncovered by Sportsmail in August. This means that Wigan manager and his club owner find themselves in the undignified position of being investigated by the FA for similar alleged offences at the same time. Whelan had claimed at a press conference to unveil Mackay as manager on Wednesday that FA sources had told him there were unlikely to be any charges brought against his new coach. But the FA said: 'We wish to make it clear that the FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by the FA as to the outcome of this case. The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October. 'The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place. This process inevitably takes time.' Premier Range ended their sponsorship deal with Wigan over Mackay's appointment . Mackay, who was sacked by Cardiff's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan last Christmas, took Wigan training for the first time on Thursday as he prepares them for his first game, at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Now, however, there is a fresh storm to weather, even if it was not one of his own making on this occasion. Whelan tried to back down from his comments when contacted by Sportsmail. He said: 'I don't know how it's come across but it's unfair if it's come across like that. What I said is this: Malky criticised somebody and called them a name. We all get called names. We get called Limeys, Brits. The Scots get called Jocks. And we don't take a blind bit of notice. I don't know what all this is about. Whelan's archaic views have been slammed by the Jewish Leadership Council . 'There's a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to. 'I would never even dream of that. That is something that is totally taboo. Everybody on the planet is equal and everybody who plays football is equal and I believe in that. I go to Barbados a lot. I have friends, black people, white people, everybody is the same and everybody should be treated the same on the planet and that's all I have to say on the subject. We are all equal under the sun. OK?' Whelan later appeared on Sky Sports in an attempt to repair some of the damage and apologised for his published comments, saying: 'I would never upset a Jewish person, I hold them in the highest regard. I have loads of Jewish friends. If anyone takes offence to what I've said, please accept my apologies. 'It's either a misquote, or I've done 50 interviews that day. Please accept my sincere apologies if they feel that way. 'I've got loads of Chinese friends too. I would never insult the Chinese. They take that name (chinks) a bit more serious, and they get more upset than the British people do (about the name Brits). I understand the Chinese and I understand their view completely. I apologise on my behalf and on behalf of the club. 'Our reputation, I don't want it tarnished. We're not the biggest club, but we're very, very honest and we're a happy club.' Whelan appeared on Sky Sports News late on Thursday night and apologised for his comments . Whelan's decision to hand Mackay a return to football has been widely criticised . Sponsors Premier Range — who became Wigan's first 'back of the shirt' sponsor in the summer — had explained earlier their decision to withdraw over Mackay's arrival. A spokesman said: 'The texts Mr Mackay has admitted to sending are wholly unacceptable — and the thoughts expressed within them are a shocking reminder of a past we thought football had left behind. A team that would employ a man who expresses views such as these is not the kind of team Premier Range wish to deal with.' Asked about this, Whelan expressed a rather forlorn hope that he had not damaged his club's reputation for ever. 'I hope I've not, because I have no intention of doing that,' he added. 'But I think when it gets to the end of the season there may be a big change in attitude, even after a few games. The man we have appointed, he's a very honest and open man. He's done something wrong. He's made the apology. Let's forgive and forget.' One of the first people to criticise Whelan, before the apology on Sky, was West Ham joint chairman David Gold, who is Jewish. Sportsmail's Matt Lawton exclusively broke the story about Mackay's obscene messages . He said: 'His remarks are offensive. I hope he retracts it because it will damage relationships between him and many other people. I hope Dave will see the hurt this has given many people, retracts it and says he didn't really mean it.' 'If I have upset one person I apologise,' Whelan told BBC Sport. 'All I was trying to say was that Jewish people are very similar to the English people in the desire to work hard and get money. I didn't think that I did anything wrong in that.' Kick It Out, the game's equality and inclusion organisation, also released a statement in response to Whelan's comments, saying: 'The remarks act as another example of the culture which continues to exist within football, and further prove that some in positions of power seem comfortable sharing those views either privately or publicly. 'These comments must not go unchallenged and have to be investigated by the FA.' We wish to make it clear The FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by The FA as to the outcome of this case. In the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, The FA would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation. The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October. This came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information. Iain Moody and Mackay are both the subject of an FA investigation . The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place. This process inevitably takes time. Both Mr Mackay and Mr Moody are fully co-operating with the ongoing process. We fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter. However, it remains a complex investigation and The FA will make no further comment at this time.","Latics chief has already caused a stir after appointing Malky Mackay .

"Doctors are being told to stop giving aspirin to patients who have a common heart condition that carries a high risk of stroke – as the drug doesn’t work. But there are fears many GPs will still prescribe it for the condition, because they will continue to be paid to do so. Doctors are funded for prescribing aspirin to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of irregular heartbeat, until April 2015. AF sufferer Cyril Barnes, 65, a . postmaster from Gloucestershire, has already moved on to warfarin – . though a hospital cardiologist prescribed him aspirin and beta-blockers . after a prolonged attack . Only then will the NHS payment rules change. The decision will mean that 300,000 people currently prescribed aspirin for AF will have to be put on other blood-thinning drugs, including newer more expensive medicines. Cardiologist Professor Martin Cowie, of Imperial College London, said last night: ‘This is a seismic shift in the guidelines and will have a huge impact on practice. ‘There are a great many patients with atrial fibrillation who are taking aspirin to prevent stroke and thinking it is doing a great job. It is not. ‘They need to go and see their doctor to discuss all the effective alternatives available.’ Millions of people across Britain take an aspirin a day believing it will reduce their risk of stroke, heart attack or cancer. The pill has been handed out for years to people with AF, which raises the risk of stroke fivefold. It affects up to 1.2 million in Britain. The decision to restrict its use has been taken by a review panel at the National Institute  for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which publishes guidelines on NHS drugs. The panel said that while aspirin might cut the risk of blood clot-induced strokes a little, that benefit  is all but cancelled out by  the increased risk of intestinal bleeding and ‘brain-bleed’ strokes. The Nice guidance concludes: ‘Do not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to patients with AF.’ Despite the concerns about the continued prescribing of aspirin for AF, Jo Jerrome, the deputy chief executive of the Atrial Fibrillation Association, said that the charity was ‘over the moon’ about the recommendation, set to be published on June 18. She added: ‘This gives clinicians and patients a mandate  to assess patients using the best tools, knowing the options for treatment that will protect them.’ She urged people with AF not to stop taking aspirin before seeing their GP, as they might also have been prescribed it for another valid reason. The recommendation will see more people being put on warfarin, which has been used as a blood thinner for over 50 years and halves the risk of stroke, or more expensive alternatives. While warfarin is an inexpensive drug and proven to work, getting the dose right can be tricky. Patients must go for regular blood tests to ensure they are ‘in range’. Too high a dose can result in dangerous internal bleeds. Under the guidelines, patients must be made aware of newer drugs such as Pradaxa, Xarelto and Eliquis, which are claimed to be at least as effective as warfarin but with fewer side effects. However, they cost about £2 a day compared with pennies for warfarin. AF sufferer Cyril Barnes, 65, a postmaster from Gloucestershire, has already moved on to warfarin – though a hospital cardiologist prescribed him aspirin and beta-blockers after a prolonged attack. He said: ‘I’d read a lot about AF on various websites and knew that aspirin did not protect against stroke. ‘Three weeks later I managed to get an appointment with my GP to try to get my prescription changed. He agreed and said I could go on warfarin straight away. 'I was shocked that the cardiologist had not known that aspirin does not guard against strokes in an AF patient and that I, as the patient, knew more than him.’ According to the Stroke Association, AF is linked to about one in six strokes – or more than 22,500 a year. If all people with AF received the best treatment available, around 7,000 strokes a year and 2,000 deaths would be prevented.","Doctors paid to prescribe aspirin  to patients with atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat, until April 2015 .

"West Ham loanee Paul McCallum will not play for Portsmouth again until March at the earliest after accepting a seven-game suspension following his sending off against Southend. The 21-year-old, who was shown a straight red card for violent conduct, had an extra four matches added to his automatic three-match ban after allegedly making contact with referee Lee Collins. The incident is believed to have taken place just after he was sent off for an off-the-ball incident in the dying moments of Pompey's 2-1 home defeat. Referee Lee Collins shows Portsmouth striker Paul McCallum a red card against Southend United . McCallum, who is on loan from the Hammers until the end of the season, had the opportunity to contest the charge but chose to plead guilty and accept his ban. The length of his suspension means the forward will be unable to play in any games in February after sitting out his side's 0-0 draw with Wycombe on Saturday. The League Two side cannot cut short his loan deal, meaning he will be available again for the trip to Northampton on March 3. Portsmouth are 18th in the table but just two points off the relegation zone following a run of just one win in their last 10 games.

"As Wayne Rooney and Co fell to a 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Saturday afternoon, another Manchester United side were faring rather better elsewhere. Oliver Rathbone's brilliant half-volley from 40 yards secured three points for the Red Devils Under 18 side away at Derby, a result which moved them into third place in the North Group table. Rathbone, an 18-year-old midfielder who joined the club in July 2013, waited until the 90th minute before controlling a high ball  and unleashing an unstoppable lob with his second touch.

The 18-year-old's effort flies over the top of Derby's goalkeeper to give United a 1-0 victory in the last minute . His goal was reminiscent of Wayne Rooney's spectacular goal against West Ham in March last year, an instinctive long-range effort which caught Hammers goalkeeper Adrian cold. Rooney's strike - which won the club's goal of the season award for 2013-14 - was struck from close to the halfway line, about 20 yards further back than Rathbone's similarly audacious hit. Lancashire-born midfielder Rathbone had entered the action as a substitute late on and took just a few minutes to have an impact, showing a neat first touch before his decisive second. This isn't the first time Rathbone has shone for United's Under 18 side this season, having netted a hat-trick against Blackburn back in October.

"Family affair continues, but without Joseph Marcell, who played butler Geoffrey . Janet Hubert and Daphne Reid, who played matriarch Aunt Vivian, are absent too . It is enough to make people want to dig into the closet for their old shell suits. Will Smith has posed for a picture of his old cast-mates from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, the wildly popular sitcom that launched his acting career. The show, which aired from 1990 until 1996, was staple for a generation of teenagers in the US and abroad. Family guy: Will Smith looked delighted to be spending time with his old Fresh Prince chums, from left Tatyana Ali (who played Ashley Banks), Karyn Parsons (Hilary), Alfonso Ribeiro (Carlton) and James Avery (Philip) And Will, 43,  said he was delighted to be able to see his second family in the run up to Christmas at a special charity event last week, before he shaved his head. He said: 'Got the Holiday season started right with a Fresh Prince of Bel Air reunion. 'There's nothin' like spending Holidays with fam!' The picture was taken last week at a luncheon for the charity Sweet Blackberry, which was founded Karyn Parsons, who played airhead weather girl Hilary on the show. The other cast members there were Tatyana Ali, who played his little cousin Ashley, Alfonso Ribeiro who played his snobby cousin Carlton and James Avery, who was the Banks family patriarch Uncle Phil. Sadly missing was Joseph Marcell, who played the Banks' butler Geoffrey, and the two actresses who filled the role of matriarch Aunt Vivian. Will posted the exciting photograph on his Facebook page earlier today, and it proved extremely popular. As they were: Will as he appeared in the early 90s show's first season, with the show's butler Geoffrey and his aunt Vivian also appearing in this pic . It has already attracted almost 50,000 likes from fans on the social networking website. Of course there are a few more grey hairs and wrinkles on display than during their 90s heyday. On the whole however, everyone was looking remarkably well preserved, . The Fresh Prince of Bel Air followed the adventures of a fictionalised version of Will himself. After getting into trouble with a local gang his mother decides to send him to stay with her wealthy and successful sister in the posh Bel Air area of Los Angeles. It was notable for Will's often eccentric choices of early 90s clothing, with the rapper displaying a particular fondness for dayglo pinks. Amazingly the future movie superstar only agreed to appear in the show as he was in massive debt problems with the IRS, owing $2.8 million after overspending on the income he earned from his then successful career as a rapper. It became a launch pad for his hugely successful acting career, which has saw him star in box office hits such as Independence Day, Men In Black and Ali.","Family affair continues, but without Joseph Marcell, who played butler Geoffrey .

"David Cameron will today insist that Scotland 'puts the great into Great Britain' as he seeks to love-bomb voters north of the border considering voting for independence . David Cameron will today insist that Scotland ‘puts the great into Great Britain’ as he seeks to love-bomb voters north of the border considering voting for independence. The Prime Minister is embarking on a two-day anti-independence tour of Scotland following jitters in Westminster about the state of the ‘no’ campaign ahead of the referendum taking place on September 18. Speaking in Glasgow, he will declare: ‘My message is simple. We want Scotland to stay.’ Mr Cameron is playing ‘good cop’ to George Osborne’s ‘bad cop’ – with the Chancellor yesterday delivering the most explicit warning yet to Scots that they can only keep the pound if they vote to remain in the United Kingdom. He told voters in Scotland: ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t break it.’ Mr Osborne told MPs there were ‘no ifs and no buts’ and a UK government led by whatever party would reject Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s plan for a currency union if nationalists win the referendum. Mr Osborne told MPs that he, Ed Balls, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, have ‘all made it clear that there will not be a currency union if Scotland becomes independent’. He also predicted that the banking sector, which makes up a large part of Scotland’s economy, would leave if it found itself in a country with no central bank to print currency. Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury permanent secretary, appearing before a Commons committee alongside the Chancellor, warned that Scottish interest rates could rise by up to 5 per cent if it refused to pay its share of the UK’s national debt as an independent nation. Nationalists have suggested that an independent Scotland might take this course if Westminster refuses to let it keep on using the pound. But Sir Nicholas, taking the highly unusual step for a senior civil servant of entering a political debate, insisted Scotland would face disaster if it sought to dodge its share of debt. Today, Mr Cameron will evoke the memory of the late Labour leader John Smith, a Scot. ‘People from all walks of life and all parts of the UK know, as I know, that we are all better together,’ he will say. Mr Cameron is playing 'good cop' to George Osborne's 'bad cop' with the Chancellor yesterday delivering the most explicit warning yet to Scots that they can only keep the pound if they vote to remain in the United Kingdom . ‘Twenty years ago this week, John Smith died. Whatever people thought of his policies, nobody could argue that he was a proud Scot who wanted the best for his country . ‘And why not? He knew that loving your country and at the same time wanting to be part of something bigger does not make you any less Scottish. 'That truth is shared by millions of others. So my message is simple. We want Scotland to stay. We are all enriched by being together. Scotland puts the great into Great Britain. 'Together we are a United Kingdom with a united future.’ Mr Cameron’s visit comes amid growing signs of nervousness in London at the possibility of nationalists clinching victory. Some recent polls have suggested that the ‘yes’ campaign is closing the gap, with significant numbers of voters in Scotland yet to make up their minds. Labour ‘big beasts’ are being drafted in to relaunch the ‘no’ campaign following a whispering campaign against the ‘lacklustre’ former Chancellor Alistair Darling, head of Better Together. Mr Darling yesterday laughed off suggestions he had been sidelined, but sources said Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, and John Reid, the former home secretary, would take more prominent roles from now on.","Cameron embarking on a two-day anti-independence tour of Scotland .

"As Liverpool chase fourth spot in the Premier League and another place at Europe's top table, Brendan Rodgers will be well aware of the improvement his side must make on the continent. Thursday night's penalty shootout defeat by Besiktas in Istanbul ended their Europa League campaign at the first hurdle, just two-and-a-half months on from Champions League disappointment. Rodgers' men were expected to make it through Group B along with Real Madrid but could only finish third behind Basel and Los Blancos after a series of underwhelming displays at home and abroad.

Brendan Rodgers shakes hands with Raheem Sterling after Liverpool's penalty shootout defeat . Liverpool dropped into the Europa League after finishing third in their Champions League group . Games played: 8 . Won: 2 . Lost: 4 . Drew: 2 . Goals scored: 6 . Goals conceded: 10 . A drop into UEFA's secondary competition followed but Raheem Sterling and Co couldn't reproduce their domestic form at the Ataturk Stadium, falling to a 1-0 defeat on the night before exiting via spot-kicks. The result completed what has been a miserable season in Europe for Rodgers, a manager whose lack of experience has told since the Reds' first nervy, narrow win at home to Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets in September. The statistics make for grim reading - played eight, lost four, won two, drawn two and just six goals scored, two of which were penalties. Liverpool are flying domestically but in Europe it's been a different story. Cristiano Ronaldo opens the scoring in Real Madrid's 3-0 group stage win at Anfield in October . Karim Benzema celebrates after scoring the winner against Liverpool at the Bernabeu in November . After the aforementioned 2-1 victory at Anfield, everything went downhill. Home and away defeats by Real Madrid were to be expected to some extent, but failing to beat Ludogorets away and losing to Basel were unacceptable results. The dominance of Carlo Ancelotti's men meant that Rodgers still had a chance to lead his side through to the last 16 on matchday six but again they faltered, only managing a 1-1 draw at home to the Swiss champions when they had to win. They finished the group stage with just one victory, five points and five goals scored. After working so hard to end the club's Champions League absence, the players didn't do themselves justice. Liverpool are the Premier League's form team, unbeaten in 11 matches and well in the hunt for fourth - or even third - place after a slow start to the season. Fabian Frei's goal for Basel at Anfield helped eliminate Liverpool at the Champions League group stage . Reds skipper Steven Gerrard looks dejected after playing his last Champions League game for the club . But with Arsenal, Manchester United and Southampton also battling for a place in the top four, winning the Europa League was an attractive way of qualifying for next season's Champions League. A 1-0 home win against Besiktas kept that dream alive but a limp performance in Istanbul - the setting for that memorable victory over AC Milan in 2005 - meant that progression always looked unlikely, even with the unpredictable nature of penalty shootouts. Liverpool appear well-placed to earn a spot in Europe next season, but it'll be another disheartening experience if Rodgers can't get his players to take their league form to the continent.","Liverpool were dumped out of the Europa League by Besiktas in Istanbul .

"Hollywood ' svengali' Sam Lutfi insists there was 'no trickery' in getting troubled former child star Amanda Bynes into a psychiatric hospital. Lutfi, the controversial ex-manager of Britney Spears, spoke out to MailOnline to insist he did bring her back to Los Angeles from New York two weeks ago - despite her parents Lynn and Rick Bynes' denial that they are working with him. Today, he details the sad events that saw Amanda put in a psychiatric hold and admits he bought the star her plane ticket home following her very public meltdown. Despite earlier reports that the Bynes were forced to lie to Amanda to get her to the clinic, Lutfi tells MailOnline, 'There was no trickery. She knew where she was going.' Once Amanda was in the hospital, Lutfi syas he told her to 'stay calm, to take her time, to gather her thoughts. I felt that she feels, deep down, that she needs help.' Scroll down for video . Restraining order: Sam Lutfi worked with Britney Spears at the time of her public breakdown - her mother Lynne (pictured left) then filed for a restraining order against him . By her side: Sam Lutfi was a constant presence by Britney Spears' side. Her mother Lynne said he 'essentially moved into Britney's home' and took control of her life, home and finances . Lutfi, 40, first hit the headlines in 2008 when he was working with another former child star, singer Britney Spears, at the time of a breakdown that saw her shave off all her hair and led to her father taking control of her affairs. A shadowy figure constantly by the star's side, Britney's mother Lynne Spears would eventually file a restraining order against Lutfi. In the order, Lynne said her daughter met Lutfi in October 2007, and that he 'essentially moved into Britney's home and has purported to take control of her life, home and finances.' She described witnessing a situation of tight control and manipulation, with Lutfi calling the shots on her medications, cutting her phone lines, and deciding who could see the pop star.. Lutfi would go on to work with singer Courtney Love, who sings his praises, and told MailOnline that he first heard from Amanda before a court ordered her parents to take over her conservatorship in August last year. He said: 'We remained in contact ever since. She was curious about the Britney situation. I figured that deep down in her mind that she felt she may have needed some help. And that's why I feel she called me. 'And then I got a call in mid-September, she said she was back in New York  and she wanted help in finding a manager and a lawyer. I asked her to please 'call your parents, talk to your counselor'. And that's when she informed me that the conservatorship was over. It sounded like she was doing well from the initial call. But subsequent calls proved otherwise. But I still advised her to stay in contact with her parents and counselors first and foremost.' A source revealed that Amanda actually changed her cell phone number and stopped calling her distraught parents, who became 'extremely concerned' after she arrived in New York and displayed erratic behavior that included her being accused of shoplifting. She was also accused of trying to steal a hat from high end store Barneys, although charges were not filed. Things came to a head when Amanda posted shocking tweets claiming her father Rick  physically, sexually and mentally abused her as a child, which she soon took down. The friend said: 'Sam bought Amanda a ticket back to LA, as friends were imploring her to apologize to her father and speak to her lawyer.' Detailing what exactly happened after Amanda landed back in LA on October 10, Lutfi said: 'Upon arriving in LA, Amanda was to take a car. At that point, her family and her lawyer took over her whereabouts. They decided where she would go and I guessed her doctor was involved as well.' The source added: 'Amanda called her parents when she landed and agreed to meet them at Las Encinas Hospital. She wanted to let them know she was okay and that she was fine and then she would leave. 'She wanted to prove that nothing was wrong, but things went a different way.' Amanda was originally put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, which was extended to a 14-day hold on Monday, October 13, and is believed to be receiving treatment at Las Encinas Hospital. It is the second time in a year she has been put in a hold. No trickery: Sam Lutfi, who managed Britney Spears, said Amanda Bynes reached out to him for help. The troubled star is seen arriving at LAX on October 10 shortly before she was put in a psychiatric hold . Concerned: Rick and Lynn Bynes, Amanda's parents, arrive at Las Encinas hospital in Pasadena, California, on October 10. The actress is believed to receiving help there . As People stated, if Amanda won't accept treatment voluntarily and is ruled unable to care for herself, her doctors could choose to ask for an LPS conservatorship, a one-year psychiatric hold they likely plan to request that in the coming days. Amanda and her current treating psychiatrist would have to appear in the Los Angeles Central District Mental Health Courthouse for this type of conservatorship (LPS is short for Lanterman-Petris-Short Act) to go into place. The source told MailOnline: 'The psychiatric hold is unfortunate, but a good thing for Amanda, because if she is properly diagnosed and if she is put on the right medications and undergoes therapy this will help. It's not her fault, it really is a disease.' Speaking at her California home on Monday, Lynne Bynes, 67, denied Lutfi's claims, saying: 'Don't worry, we're not working with Sam.' When asked how Amanda, 28, is doing, Mrs Bynes said: 'She is fine.' Just hours before Amanda arrived in LA and was was rushed for psychiatric help, she tweeted:  'you feel like a brother to me @SamLutfi i mean it. Thank you luuuuv.' Despite the Bynes' claims,  Lutfi published a bizarre self-penned piece on XOJane.com at the weekend, where he said he had tried to help Amanda. Getting help: Following a breakdown in New York, Amanda Bynes is being held under a psychiatric hold for the second time in past year . Admitting to being called 'shady' and a 'Svengali', Lutfi attempted to defend himself, saying: 'I’ve worked in Hollywood for a long time, and over the years, these experiences have led me to see what happens when too much fame and too much money can sometimes get the best of celebrities. 'I am a problem solver, and I care about helping people get out of what may seem like some of their more difficult places in life. 'Which is why you have seen me associated with some of the more famous celebrities when they are in their most trying hours.' He also said that he has no problem being slandered if it helps other people get better. Lufti also included a Facebook message from Courtney Love in the article, which read: 'Good job Sammy, that one needed your help. Quite heroic how your (sic) always helping strays, no you cannot have my cat!'

Lutfi added: 'Amanda is a beautiful, amazing and very strong woman who has been through a lot. So are Courtney and Britney. Like me, they are also survivors.' Britney Spears' mother Lynne Spears, meanwhile, blamed Lutfi for his involvement in her daughter's breakdown, when he managed her in 2007 and 2008.

Happier days: Amanda Bynes with her parents Lynn and Rick, who have desperately trying to help their daughter . An LPS conservatorship would put Amanda under the care of a court-ordered conservator who would be in charge of her person and her finances. Terry K. Wasserman, an attorney specializing in mental health legal services, who has not represented Bynes, said it would have to be proven she is 'gravely disabled'. He told People: 'Her parents would have first choice to act as conservator if they wish, but the court can appoint alternative individuals. 'It can be the Los Angeles County Public Guardians office, it could be a private professional conservator that's licensed and bonded by the state of California, or it could be a family friend."" This type of conservatorship would legally place Amanda in the proper care facility. It also allows the conservator to enforce compliance with any psychiatric medicines prescribed to her by her doctor. Amanda - who is said to be furious with her parents, according to TMZ - would have the right to visitors under this type of conservatorship, but she can elect to not allow her parents to see her. Mr Wasserman said: 'There's a number of rights she [would maintain] for her dignity and welfare. She's entitled to visitations even if she's LPS conserved. She can't be forced to visit with her parents if she chooses not to see them.' Although the LPS conservatorship lasts for one year, it can be ended early or extended longer depending on circumstances. Once terminated, Amanda could go back to living on her own. Asked about the Bynes, a source told the publication: 'They're happy she's safe and that Amanda is finally getting some help.'

"China today launched its first ever extraterrestrial landing craft into orbit in the hopes it will become the first country in almost 40 . years to soft-land a probe on the moon. The nation is only the third in . history to launch an unmanned lunar probe after the Chang'e-3 device, nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character, set off at 5.30pm on Sunday . evening (1.30am local time). The lunar probe blasted off on board an . enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch . Center in China's southwestern Sichuan province. Scroll down for video . The Long March-3B rocket carrying the Chang'e-3 lunar probe blasts off from the launch pad at Xichang Satellite Launch Center, Sichuan province, on Sunday . First: This probe is the first time China has sent a spacecraft to soft land on the surface of an extraterrestrial body . Exploring: If all goes well, the probe will conduct surveys on the moon over the course of 90 days . Ahead of the launch: The Chang'e-3 rocket carrying the Jade Rabbit rover prior to its launch at 1.30am local time . The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, . is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus . Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14. The . mission is a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme and forms part of a plan in which China hopes to build a permanent . lunar base in order to launch future missions to Mars within the next 15 . years. President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower, and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess. State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off. If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December. It is designed to roam the lunar . surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area . of about five square kilometres. Plan: The probe launch is a major step for China's ambitious space programme which includes building a permanent lunar base . Record-breaker: The probe will be the country's first to land on the moon and has been nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking . high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten . basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago. The journey of the probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the European . Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China. ESA’s own . launch station in Kourou, French Guiana, will immediately start . receiving signals from the mission after take-off and it will upload . commands to the probe on behalf of the Chinese control centre. 'Whether . for human or robotic missions, international cooperation like this is . necessary for the future exploration of planets, moons and asteroids, . benefitting everyone,' said Thomas Reiter, director of ESA’s human . spaceflight operations. This will be China's first spacecraft to make a soft landing beyond Earth. In recent years, China has made considerable progress in its space programme. History: China will become just the third country in history to soft land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon when 'Jade Rabbit' launches next month.The gold-coloured model has six wheels and wing-like solar panels . Chinese scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch. The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years . In June, three Chinese astronauts spent 15 days in orbit and docked their craft with an experimental space laboratory. In 2007, the country despatched an unmanned spacecraft called Chang'e to orbit the Moon. The craft stayed in space for 16 months before being intentionally crashed on to the Moon's surface. The name Jade Rabbit was chosen after an online poll in which millions took part. Ouyang . Ziyuan, head of the moon rover project, told Xinhua earlier this week . that the ancient beliefs had their origins in the marks left by impacts . on the lunar landscape. 'There . are several black spots on the moon's surface. Our ancient people . imagined they were a moon palace, osmanthus trees, and a jade rabbit,' he said. China sent its . first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third country after . Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel . independently. The military-backed space programme is a source of national pride. China . is one of only three countries to have managed to independently send . humans into space, the others being Russia and the US.

"A manhunt has been launched four 'black widows' planning to suicide bomb the Winter Olympics. Officers are scouring Sochi, where the games begin next month, with wanted posters featuring Ruzan Ibragimova, 22, whose husband was killed by Russian security forces last year. The suspect, from Dagestan - a city notorious for its use of 'black widows' - is believed to be plotting an attack with three other women. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wanted: Ruzan Ibragimov, whose husband was an Islamist militant killed by Russian security forces last year, is one of the 'black widow' terrorists who may be in Sochi plotting an attack . Changeable: Islamists in Caucasus are notorious for their use of 'black widows' as they can use make-up to change their appearance and usually go unsuspected. Ibramigova, pictured, is described as having a limp and a scar . She is described as having a limp, a scar on her cheek, and that her left arm does not bend at the elbow. The posters say that Russian authorities believe she left Dagestan, a Russian republic in the Caucasus, earlier this month, and may be headed for the Olympic city. The hunt follows the release of a video showing two young men who are believed to have been bombers in the December 2013 Volgograd attacks. Posted by group Ansar al Sunah on a militant Chechen site, the two men warned that as long as President Vladimir Putin occupies the North Caucasus region near Sochi, Russians and Olympic visitors alike will not be safe, ABC News reported. 'We'll have a surprise package for you,' one of the men said in the video, according to the ABC report. 'And those tourists that will come to you, for them, too, we have a surprise. If it happens [the Olympics], we'll have a surprise for you. The two men in the video, seen here, warn their 'surprise package' will be 'for all the Muslim blood that is shed every day around the world, be it in Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, all around the world' U.S. officials are investigating whether the two men in the video, seen here, are tied to the December Volgograd bombings .

U.S. authorities are examining the video -- but an official told USA Today that 'there was no definitive evidence' to indicate whether the men shown in the video were actually tied to the Volgograd bombings, which killed more than 30 people. Russian and US authorities are also thought to be looking for as many as four 'black widows' who they believe may attempt to carry out terrorist attacks close to the Winter Olympics.

"Lord Bichard said older people had to stop being a 'negative burden on the state' The elderly should earn their pensions by doing voluntary work in their communities to avoid being a ‘burden on the state’, a retired mandarin  has suggested. Lord Bichard, formerly head of the Benefits Agency, made the controversial suggestion at a House of Lords discussion on how to meet the costs of Britain’s ageing population. Last night his plans were branded ‘National Service for the over-60s’ by angry pensioner groups. The cross-bench peer, a former permanent secretary at the Department for Education, retired from the civil service at just 53. His taxpayer-funded pension is estimated to be £120,000 a year. Lord Bichard, 65, drew a parallel between the workshy claiming unemployment benefits and retirees drawing their pensions. He said: ‘We are now prepared to say to people who are not looking for work, if you don’t look for work you don’t get benefits. So if you are old and you are not contributing in some way or another, maybe there is some penalty attached to that.’ He called for ‘imaginative’ ideas such as making old people care for the very old. Lord Bichard added: ‘Are we using all of the incentives at our disposal to encourage older people not just to be a negative burden on the state but actually be a positive part of society? ‘It is quite possible, for example, to envisage a world where civil  society is making a greater contribution to the care of the very old, and older people who are not very old could be making a useful contribution to civil society in that respect, if they were given some incentive or some recognition for doing so.’ He later pledged to investigate the idea further as part of his work for the Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change. Lord Bichard, who led the inquiry into the Soham murders, said it would be difficult for politicians to sell to the public, but added: ‘So was tuition fees.’ Pensioner groups reacted with fury at the suggestion that the elderly should have to ‘earn’ their pension after a lifetime of working and contributing taxes. Lord Bichard wants a system where civil society is making a 'greater contribution to the care of the very old' Dot Gibson, general secretary of the . National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘This amounts to little more than . National Service for the over-60s and is absolutely outrageous. ‘Those who have paid their national . insurance contributions for 30 or more years are entitled to receive . their state pension and there should be no attempt to put further . barriers in their way. ‘We already have one of the lowest state pensions in Europe and one in five older people in Britain live below the poverty line. ‘Lord Bichard’s comments are also . extremely divisive – trying to pitch younger people against older people . – when the truth is that the real division in our society is between . rich and poor. The general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention said nothing should be put in the way of retirees receiving their pension . Frankly, Lord Bichard needs to think twice before making such silly and ill-informed remarks.’ Michelle Mitchell, director general of the charity Age UK, said: ‘Older people are a hugely positive part of society. ‘Over a third of people aged between . 65 and 74 volunteer, a percentage that only drops slightly for the . over-75s. In addition, nearly a million older people provide unpaid care . to family or friends, saving the state millions of pounds.’ Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, added: ‘This is a very strange idea indeed. ‘Those who have retired have already . made huge contributions to our society and are already the largest group . of charity and community volunteers. ‘Lord Bichard’s suggestion smacks of . social engineering of a dangerous kind. He seems to be suggesting that . if you decide to stop working, even once you reach the age that society . determines it is reasonable to stop, civil servants should assess you . and decide whether you are fit to be assigned to do work that they . decide you should do.’ Professor James Sefton, of Imperial College, London, a former adviser to the Treasury, appeared to back Lord Bichard. He told the committee he could not . understand why young people were not taking to the streets  in protest, . because they were subsidising the older generation. He told peers: ‘I think they  should be angry. ‘I think the deal they are getting is poor.’ Lord Sefton, who is also an analyst at . the Swiss-owned UBS bank, said research he was carrying out at Imperial . College, suggested that ‘the current generation are very heavy . contributors to the public purse, whereas previous generations have . benefited from the public purse’.","Former Benefits Agency chief Lord Bichard says older people must stop being a 'negative burden' on the state .

"Supermarket giant Morrisons is sparking a major fuel war by slashing a record 15p off a litre of petrol for anyone spending £60 in store. The petrol discount is the biggest ever offered in the UK, and comes a month after rival Tesco gave customers 10p off petrol when they spent £60. As the cost of oil soars, thousands of campaigners are preparing for a landmark day of action to demand lower fuel tax ahead of next month's budget. Slashing prices: The discount offered by the supermarket giant is the biggest ever in the UK and will be welcome news for drivers . Fairfuel UK is organising a mass lobby of Parliament to combat what it calls an 'absolute crisis', with Chancellor George Osborne planning a 3p-a-litre increase in fuel duty in August. Richard Lancaster, Morrisons marketing director, said: 'We know how tough it is for our customers. This deal will help them in these tough economic times. 'Nobody has ever knocked this much off a litre of fuel before. This will make a real difference for our customers.' The announcement from Morrisons will be welcome news for families returning to the school run this week after the half-term holiday. It is likely to trigger a rush by other supermarkets to offer fuel deals in an effort to compete. Asda slashed pump prices by 2p a litre in November, and it proved to be one of the few supermarkets that defied typically poor sales for retailers over the festive period. Road rage: Soaring oil prices and a planned rise in fuel duty could lead to protests like the 'Go Slow' demonstration of last May . But a spokeswoman for the supermarket said today: 'Discounted petrol that’s dependent on buying overpriced groceries, is a fuel’s paradise.' Diesel prices reached a record high last week and crude oil hit its highest sterling price of £77.20 yesterday. The average forecourt price is now . 143.05p a litre – meaning it costs more than £100 to fill up the . 70-litre tank in a typical family car. The rising cost of crude oil is the key factor behind the soaring price of petrol. The biggest influence on prices at present are: . The price of diesel in the UK rose to an all-time high this month as speculators drove up crude oil prices and refineries failed to keep up with British demand. Petrol prices are also on the rise, hitting 135.39p a litre last week, just shy of the 137.43p record reached in May last year. Motorists are paying £20.50 more than just two years ago to fill their cars with petrol – a punishing 26 per cent rise. Morrisons said that customers who take part in their 'Fuel Britannia' deal and spend £50 on fuel should receive savings of well over £5. The vouchers will be issued from February 23 to March 4 and drivers will be able to claim the discount at Morrisons petrol stations until March 11. Paul Watters, head of public affairs at the AA, welcomed the news about the Morrisons discount, saying: 'It always takes supermarkets to step into the fray and push prices down. 'Anything that keeps the other forecourts on their toes is a good thing. 'This is excellent news at a time when diesel prices have reached a record high and will bring some relief to motorists - but it may only be short term depending on which way oil prices go.' Fuel duty: How the average tank of petrol and diesel breaks down . But Mr Watters warned that there is often a disparity between petrol prices in 'supermarket towns' and 'non-supermarket towns', such as Bedford and Luton or Margate and Canterbury, with costs varying by as much as 5p per litre. Fairfuel UK will confront MPs on March 7 along with struggling motorists, taxi firms, catering companies and car companies including the RAC. Peter Carroll from Fairfuel UK said: 'This is an absolute crisis in the history of the nation. Enough is enough. The current fuel prices are killing the economy and stunting growth. 'The Government has to cut fuel duty to create jobs and stimulate growth to start getting the deficit down.' The RAC and Fairfuel UK will meet treasury minister Chloe Smith on Tuesday and are releasing a report on fuel duty on the same day in connection with the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Mr Carroll said the report will call for a cut in fuel duty of at least 5p per litre. He said the group saw off rises of around 9p per litre last year.","Diesel prices reached record highs of 143.05p a litre last week .

"A mother who let her two-year-old son drive and then uploaded a video of the toddler chauffeur online, said the stunt was a mistake. Footage posted to Facebook shows little Giovanni Madrid seated on the lap of his daddy, Marine Corporal Marcos Madrid, steering the couple's car in what appears to be rainy conditions, near the Madrid's home in Richlands, North Carolina. Laughter can be heard in the background of the low quality video, as the youngster looks pleased with his motor skills. I'm driving! Car enthusiast Giovanni Madrid took the wheel of his parent's car . But a friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, was shocked to see the video on the social networking site and alerted the local news. 'The kid could possibly die if something were to happen,' the woman told WCTI-TV. Now the child's mother, Angelina, said she and her husband, who is stationed at Camp Lejeune, were driving down the road when their little boy, who loves cars, said he wanted to try his hand behind the wheel. The parents obliged the toddler's whim but now the mom says it was a big mistake. 'I feel bad for doing it and I wasn't thinking, we weren't thinking,' the mother said, as she wept over the incident. Bad idea: Angelina Madrid weeps as she says the driving stunt was a mistake . Lesson learned: Angelina says she and her husband just weren't thinking when they let Giovanni take the wheel . Angelina says she is fearful that the incident could prevent her husband, who just finished his first four years in the Corps, from reenlisting. The concerned wife is scared his commanding officers will look poorly on the incident, that has garnered attention for the family for all the wrong reasons. 'Other parents could see this, they could learn not to do this,' she added. So far, no charges have been brought against the Madrids. Angelina's mother, Tracee Ramos, assured naysayers that her grandson is very well cared for and said his parents would never put his life in danger.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge began legal proceedings last night against a French magazine which published topless photographs of Kate. As sources close to the couple said she felt ‘violated’ by the pictures, there was mounting fear among royal aides that the Duchess faces being relentlessly stalked like the Princess of Wales. A strongly worded Palace statement compared the photographs to the ‘worst excesses of the Press and paparazzi during the life of Diana’. Scroll down for video . Upset:  As sources close to the couple said Kate felt ‘violated’ by the pictures, there was mounting fear among royal aides that the Duchess, right, faces being relentlessly stalked like the Princess of Wales, left . Angry: The Royal couple learned of the existence of the pictures - which show Kate removing her bikini top - while in Malaysia continuing their Diamond Jubilee tour. An image from the magazine's website is pictured . It is the first time in modern history that a British royal is set to sue through the courts in France for ‘breach of privacy’ over what the couple described as a ‘grotesque’ and ‘unjustifiable’ act. A source at French Closer, which . claims to be the country's leading women's 'people' magazine, said its . website would be carrying the topless pictures too. But in conflicting reports, U.S. entertainment website Radar Online said the site had already removed the . pictures in response to the legal threat. Yesterday the 30-year-old Duchess tried to mask her humiliation as she followed in the  footsteps of her husband’s late mother by visiting a mosque for the first time in bare feet and a veil. She and Prince William learned of the existence of the pictures – which show Kate removing her bikini top as she sunbathed by a pool during a holiday in France last week – while in Malaysia continuing their Diamond Jubilee tour. The Prince told those close to him that it was ‘as if the clock had been turned back 15 years’ to when his mother died in a Paris car crash while being chased by photographers. The Mail has learned that legal papers have already been served on the French magazine Closer and an initial hearing will be heard in the French courts on Monday. If the judge decides the couple have a strong enough case to proceed they will immediately seek an injunction to stop all photos from the holiday being published. It is also hoped that it will emerge at the hearing who took and who owns the copyright to the pictures. Legal action: It is the first time in modern history that a British royal is set to sue through the courts in France for 'breach of privacy' over what the couple described as a 'grotesque' and 'unjustifiable' act . The show must go on: The Royal couple looked pensive at a tea party in Kuala Lumpur yesterday . Last night the magazine’s editor . Laurence Pieau was unrepentant about the pictures, apparently taken from . 1,000 yards away with a long-distance lens. She insisted that the . swimming pool was in full view of a public road and the images were ‘not . in the least shocking’. She even argued that it was the couple’s own fault as ‘they were not making any special effort to conceal themselves’ and made claims about having ‘more intimate shots’ of the couple. The Mail understands the Duke and Duchess have the unequivocal backing of both the Queen and Prince Charles for their legal action. A St James’s Palace spokesman last night confirmed that ‘legal proceedings for breach of privacy have been commenced today in France by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge against the Publishers of Closer Magazine France’. Secluded: The pictures were allegedly taken last week, while the couple were on holiday at Chateau d'Autet, set amid 640 acres of woodland in the picturesque Luberon region .

"Claimed Buffalo fire department wanted to promote African-American firefighters instead . Two men received $500,000 each after failing to be promoted to lieutenant . Twelve white firefighters have been given more than $2.5 million from the city of Buffalo after they sued the fire department not awarding them promotions they had been expecting. The men alleged the fire department illegally allowed promotional lists on which they were named to expire so they could promote African-American firefighters instead. The payouts were based on the level their promotions would have afforded them ranging from $49,000 (£31,000) to $500,000 (£317,000). Massive award: Twelve white firefighters have been given more than $2.5 million from the city of Buffalo after they sued the fire department not awarding them promotions they had been expecting . Emotional damages were also considered, ranging from $20,000 (£12,000) to $30,000 (£19,000) reported NBC affiliate WGRZ.com. Two men who received the largest awards were selected for promotion to lieutenant late in 2005 by the fire commissioner, and again in early 2006 by a new fire commissioner. But they were never awarded the promotion. 'They had been working 10 or 12 years by . 2006. So the judge looked at what their prospective promotions would . have been, and ruled that it was likely they would have made battalion . commander' an attorney representing the plaintiffs, Andrew Fleming, told msnbc.com. The men alleged they had scored well on their exams, but were passed over for promotions because the city wanted to give minorities, a chance to fill those positions . The pair were each given $500,000 based on the judge's calculations, he said. The ruling of compensation was made by state Supreme Court Justice John . Michalek. Fifteen months earlier he made the the initial ruling that Buffalo had . illegally failed to promote the firefighters because of racial . discrimination . Sleeplessness, . marital strain, and depression are all cited in the emotional distress that . the men experienced over the past several years. To . be considered for a promotion,firefighters take a promotional . eligibility exam, which is designed to test the skills they would need . to serve as a lieutenant, captain, or other higher-ranking position in . the fire department. The . men alleged they had scored well on their exams, but were passed over . for promotions because the city wanted to give minorities, who had not performed as well a chance to fill those positions. 'The word that kept coming up was betrayal,' Mr Fleming said. 'They really felt betrayed by the city.' Anthony Hynes, a 13th firefighter listed in the suit, failed to receive a payout  because there was not enough evidence to support his claim, according to the court. A spokesman for Buffalo told WGRZ.com that officials are reviewing the decision, and the city may appeal the ruling. Lawyers for the city said they disagreed with the judge's ruling on how much the firefighters should be paid. 'The city, at all times, acted under its rights under federal law,' Attorney Adam Perry told BuffaloNews.com. 'The city has maintained its position that the liability determination made by Justice Michalek was erroneous and should be reversed on appeal.'","Claimed Buffalo fire department wanted to promote African-American firefighters instead .

Bitterman petitioned for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences in 1995. The couple separated for good in 1997, but did not have the divorce finalized until 2002. In the papers, De La Vega claimed she saw the extent of anger and added that the things she saw were 'terrifying'. She added that it was clear that Jace's 'ambition was the most important thing to him and not his son and wife'. In 2005, as Bitterman and Jace continued to fight over custody, the actor's ex-wife said in a declaration: 'The Respondent threatens corporal punishment and has spanked jordan for crying and being afraid.

Bitterman was awarded primary custody. According to TMZ, April astonishingly testified on Jace's behalf. She said he provided a stable home for Jordan.

"Children who look unhappy in childhood school photographs are five times more likely to get divorced than those who smile most, a scientist claims. People who stayed married in later life tended to smile more widely and warmly in their school photographs, while future divorcées were more likely to smile weakly, if at all in their photos. A U.S. psychologist came up with his conclusions when exploring whether school photos reveal who individuals are in a moment in time, or if they can predict their future. It's all in the smile, according to one psychologist: People who stayed married in later life . tended to smile more widely and warmly in their school photographs, . while future divorcées were more likely to smile weakly, if at all in . their photos . Matthew Hertenstein, an associate . professor of psychology at DePauw University, Indiana, measured . individuals’ emotional displays based on photographs in hundreds of . school yearbooks to see if he could predict who would get divorced. In an article for The Wall Street Journal, he said he found that people who smiled least genuinely were five times more likely to get divorced at some point in their lives than those with happy photographs. To work out who was smiling strongly, he looked at whether the individual in the photo contracted the muscle that pulls up the lip corners as well as the orbicularis oculi, which is the muscle that makes someone’s eyes ‘smile’ too. Professor Hertenstein said that future divorcées tended not to smile, or if they did, did not contract their orbicularis oculi - indicating a smile that was not genuine. Together with his team, the psychologist, who is the author of a new book called THE TELL: THE LITTLE CLUES THAT REVEAL BIG TRUTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE, examined the childhood and adolescent yearbook photos of people over the age of 55 in a small town in mid-west U.S. As part of their research in 2009, which . was published the journal Motivation and Emotion, they also looked at . photographs of participants at birthdays and graduations and concluded . that the photos predicted divorce as accurately as the yearbook photos . did. Matthew Hertenstein, an associate professor of psychology at DePauw University, Indiana, measured individuals' emotional displays based on photographs in hundreds of school yearbooks to see if he could predict who would get divorced . According to a study by psychologists LeeAnne Harker and Dacher Keltner in 2001, college yearbook photographs can also predict whether someone will enjoy a life with less sadness, anxiety and despair 30 years after the graduate. The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found more stoic looking classmates were less well socially connected and had less fulfilling lives than their more smiley classmates. However, Professor Hertenstein concedes that smiling in photos cannot cause happy outcomes and is not the only valid predictor of them. He writes: ‘Your smile, or lack thereof, is not the great determinant of your destiny. Individual cases will certainly vary.’ The psychologists looked at photographs of participants at birthdays and graduations and concluded that the photos predicted divorce (illustrated) as accurately as the yearbook photos did .","A U.S. psychologist said children who look unhappy in school photos are five times more likely to get divorced than those who smiled .

"Ginger map: Around 13 per cent of Scots, including actress Karen Gillan, have red hair - compared to 1-2 per cent of the world population . They are often the butt of cruel jibes and perhaps blame it on their parents’ genes. But now research suggests that redheads can in fact put their colouring down to the weather. Experts believe that Scotland’s gloomy climate has seen a deliberate genetic adaptation to help exploit rare sunny days and boost Vitamin D production. Alastair Moffat, managing director of the ScotlandsDNA project, said the country’s dull weather was responsible for a larger number of flame-haired men and women being born. Only about 1-2 per cent of the world’s population has red hair but in Scotland the figure is much higher, with about 13 per cent, or 650,000 people, with flaming locks. Famous Scots with red hair range from Doctor Who actress Karen Gillan to football manager Alex McLeish, while the Disney/Pixar movie Brave features a red-haired Scottish Princess Merida. Researchers are investigating how many people carry the red-hair gene and their findings will be used to make a ‘ginger’ map of the British Isles. Mr Moffat said he wanted to map the number of possible carriers of the gene in Scotland in a bid to try to explain why so many Scots have red hair. But yesterday he revealed his own theory, saying: ‘I think it’s to do with sunshine. We all need Vitamin D from sunshine but Scotland is cloudy. ‘We have an Atlantic climate and we need light skin to get as much vitamin D from the sun as possible.’ A person who does not have red hair can still produce red-haired children if their partner is a carrier of the gene. In the spotlight: Famous Scottish redheads include Alex McLeish, left, and Disney/Pixar heroine Princess Merida, right . Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16, which causes a mutation. But despite concerns that red hair could be dying out, the experts say that it is likely to continue for many more generations. The Centre for Equality Policy Research think tank recently controversially claimed that redheads suffer more discrimination per head of population than ethnic minorities. They conducted an experiment and found that 'a job applicant with ginger hair is seven times more likely to be rejected than a dark-haired applicant, and eight times more likely than a fair-haired applicant.' Barbara McNulty, lecturer in psychology at the University of the Western Isles, and herself a redhead, said: ‘Red hair still gives out deep cultural signals. 'Women, for example, are wild and quick-tempered, while ginger-haired men are unattractive and geeky.’","One or two per cent of the world’s .

"Hollywood legend Lauren Bacall’s Manhattan apartment is going on the market for $26 million, it was confirmed today. The actress died at age 89 in August and left behind a magnificent, sprawling home in the famous Dakota building. Rebecca Edwardson of Warburg Realty has the exclusive listing and the apartment will go up for sale later this month, the firm confirmed to MailOnline today. Scroll down for video . Old school glamor: Lauren Bacall in her Manhattan apartment in 1969. She bought it for just $48,000 and it's going on the market for $26 million . Under the hammer: Hundreds of Lauren Bacall's artworks will be auctioned off at Bonhams in New York this month and in March, along with furniture and jewelry. Her drawing room at The Dakota is pictured . The Real Deal, which first reported the sale, said the building’s strict co-op board has insisted on keeping details about Miss Bacall’s home under wraps - including its size, location and floor - as sources said the apartment’s Central Park-facing frontage spans approximately 100 feet. A source described the apartment as 'grand', saying 'almost all of the important rooms face the park'. It also boasts seven fireplaces and 'tons of original details'. The husky-voiced actress bought the home for just $48,000 in 1961. She shared it with second husband Jason Robards until they split in the late 1960s, and raised her three children there. The Dakota counted John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono as residents and it was outside that building on December 8, 1980, that Mark David Chapman shot dead the Beatles legend. Stars including Boris Karloff, Judy Holliday and Roberta Flack, were also Miss Bacall's neighbors. In a 2011 Vanity Fair article, the apartment was described as 'cavernous,' with a wood-trimmed parlor and huge windows that 'overlook Central Park, 30 feet above the tree line'. Last month, it was reported that Miss Bacall's art, jewelry and furniture will be auctioned at Bonhams auction house in New York. Happy at home: Lauren in 2007. She was still living in the same home when she died last August . Filled with art: Lauren Bacall poses in 1979 at home - and the mementos of her life are on show behind her . Hundreds of items from her three homes will be sold by the executors of her estate in a sale expected to bring in $3 million. Two Henry Moore sculptures from her extensive art collection will go under the hammer in November, followed by six more in March; as well as artworks from the likes of Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro and Alexander Calder. Miss Bacall was a big fan of Mr Moore's work in particular, and his sculptures - as well as the rest of the many artworks - once decorated her homes in Los Angeles, Amagansett, Long Island and in New York City. She also had a large collection of African Art, an interest that developed while former husband Humphrey Bogart was filming The African Queen. As for the rest of her fortune, almost all of her  estate will be split among her three children, it was revealed shortly after her death from a stroke two months ago. The first item in Ms Bacall's will - filed in a rush order at Manhattan Surrogate’s Court in August, according to Page Six - left $10,000 to her son, Sam Robards, to take care of her beloved spaniel, Sophie. Home, sweet home: Lauren Bacall pictured with her baby son, Sam Robards at her Manhattan apartment in July 1962. Sam is her son with second husband, actor Jason Robards, Jr. Artwork: Gorgeous Miros can be seen hanging over the fireplace at Lauren Bacall's home . Clear out: The dining room at Lauren Bacall's NYC home. Items from her apartment ill be sold by the star's estate in a sale expected to bring in $3 million, following her death in August in New York City at the age of 89 . Her wealth - built up from a lifetime of lucrative films and her marriage to screen legend Bogart - will be shared evenly among New York-based Mr Robards and his half-siblings Stephen Humphrey Bogart and Leslie Bogart. A sum of $15,000 was left to Isla Hernandez, who worked as the former model's maid for the last 14 years. 'It’s wonderful - I never thought she would do something for me,' Ms Hernandez, a Honduran immigrant, told The New York Post. Another staffer, Maria Santos, was left $20,000. While her art is soon to be auctioned, Miss Bacall was sure to stress that her family keep some of her items private. Famous: The Dakota is one of the most celebrated co-op buildings in New York City and has housed stars including John Lennon and Yoko Ono . 'I request that my children respect my wish to keep private certain personal letters, writings, diaries and other papers or memorabilia,' she wrote in the will. Miss Bacall first married Humphrey Bogart in 1945 at the age of 20. Mr Bogart, who was 25 years his wife's senior, died of throat cancer in 1957. The couple had two children, Stephen, 65, a news producer and documentary film maker, and Leslie, 58, a yoga instructor. Miss Bacall married her second husband, actor Jason Robards Jr., in 1961. Together they had a son, Sam, 53, who is also an actor. Miss Bacall and Mr Robards divorced in 1969.

"Smiling again: Lavern after she had reconstructive surgery to fix her nose a second time . Lavern Barnes booked a  cosmetic surgeon to straighten out her ‘bumpy’ nose. But her botched operation left her with even more bumps. She later found he had a record of botched operations and had been temporarily struck off. Beauty therapist Lavern, 51, had disliked her nose all her life. She took the advice of a client who was a nurse and booked an appointment to see surgeon Ravi Agarwal at his Chester clinic. It turned out he was the nurse’s boss. Lavern’s consultation with Mr Agarwal . lasted less than ten minutes. He claimed that he could fix her nose . without breaking it and with minimal bruising. He told her it would heal . within a week. ‘That was all the time I could take off work so it sounded fine,’ says Lavern. Believing Mr Agarwal to be an expert, Lavern decided to go ahead. But alarm bells rang the next time they met. Just minutes before the operation Mr Agarwal told Lavern that he would also be changing the tip of her nose. ‘I . told him that wasn’t what I had asked for. He had drawn markings on my . nose and it was only when I argued with him that he suddenly scribbled . new markings across my nose. Then that was it.’ The £3,400 procedure was carried out in 2009 in an operating theatre at the back of an office block in Manchester. Afterwards . Lavern had to walk to the recovery room and just half an hour later, . with bloody gauze to hold under her nose, she was sent home. ‘I was . still bleeding heavily and was given a lift home by the nurse. It was . traumatic to say the least.’ A week later Lavern, from Northwich, Cheshire, discovered that underneath her gauze lay a broken nose, with more bumps than it had before. ‘I had a bump on the bridge where he had broken my nose and a bigger bump lower down. The original bump had also moved. 'I . felt really disappointed but Mr Agarwal quickly said it was swollen, . it would settle down and I would have to come back in to have it be . rasped down further. 'I’d never had an operation like this before so I . didn’t know what to expect, and believed him. I thought it would all be . OK.’ Broken and scarred: Lavern's nose after the bad surgery in 2009 which cost her £3,400 . Over the following week Lavern’s nose . began to collapse.  ‘I was really upset and worried. I went back to him . but he said I should come back after six months to a year, to allow it . to heal first. I was distraught, it looked horrendous.’ Lavern . sought a second opinion from another Cheshire-based plastic surgeon, . Douglas McGeorge, who told her the nose would need rebuilding and to . demand a refund. But Mr Agarwal’s clinic refused to give her money . back. ‘I was angry and devastated with the way . my face looked. I didn’t want Mr Agarwal to perform any more operations . on my nose. There was no way I would let him near me.’ Lavern sought legal help from medical . negligence experts Irwin Mitchell and discovered Mr Agarwal had been . struck off by the General Medical Council in 2003 for botched penis . enlargement operations. He had appealed and was given a three month . suspension and allowed to return to work in 2004. Lavern says: ‘I felt so stupid. I should have checked him out before.’ Last year, Mr Agarwal agreed to pay a five-figure sum to Lavern. Since then she has had £4,247 reconstructive surgery carried out by Mr McGeorge. ‘It has been a nightmare,’ she says. ‘I can’t believe Mr Agarwal was allowed to operate again after being struck off.’ Mr Agarwal said due to patient confidentiality, he could not comment. there are key questions you must ask your cosmetic surgeon before booking an operation, says Michael Cadier, president elect of BAAPS. A good surgeon will ideally give the answers below. Q Are you on the General Medical Council (GMC) specialist register? A Yes. Those offering surgery should be on the register, for which there are stringent rules. They must have done the requisite training and have passed a specialist exam. Go to gmc-uk.org and enter the  surgeon’s name. It will give their GMC reference number, date of registration and speciality. They don’t have to be plastic surgeons – but they should have relevant experience. For example ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgeons can perform rhinoplasty (nose jobs). Overseas surgeons must be on the GMC register. If not, they are working illegally in the UK. Q How many procedures like mine do you carry out? A More than 20 a year. Statistically, a surgeon performing this number gets a better outcome. Breast reduction and uplifts are counted as the same surgery. Q How long have you been performing the procedure? A Five years is a reasonable amount of experience and the ideal answer. If not, the surgeon needs to show sufficient training or have a mentor to vouch for them. Q What are the risks involved with this kind of surgery? A It depends on the health of the individual and the nature of the surgery. Risks are based on a surgeon’s assessment of your physical and mental health. Q What is your complication rate for this procedure? A Under five per cent. More than this for any procedure is concerning and would need to be explained. Q What is the likely outcome – will it meet my expectations? A Yes. You should be given a realistic idea of what to expect. Many surgeons will show before-and-after shots of their work. Q Do you have appropriate insurance in the UK? A Yes. I recommend going to a big hospital group such as BMI, Spire, Ramsay or Nuffield. The practitioners are independent and have their own insurance – usually between £3million and £10million, without which they can’t practice. Q Does the cost I am paying now cover all aftercare? A Yes. You need to confirm the cut-off point in terms of timing.  I – and many reputable surgeons – will give a cut-off point of a year, after which you may be required to pay for any further treatment. Other companies may only give you  three months. Q Who looks after me if something goes wrong at the time and I need further treatment? A We do. If there is an acute problem, the surgeon who performed the operation and the hospital should look after you at no extra cost to yourself.","Lavern Barnes, 51, paid £3,400 for a nose job in 2009 to fix her 'bumps'

"New York Red Bulls have pulled out all the stops to make Arsenal feel welcome on their first ever trip to New York. The sides meet as part of the Gunners' pre-season tour of the United States on Saturday at the Red Bull Arena in New Jersey. And the MLS side have made a video of their players attempting, badly, English accents in order to make the likes of Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Wojciech Szczesny feel at home. Comedians: Chris Duvall and Eric Stevenson took part in the video parodying English accents . Connor Lade and Ryan Meara tried out phrases such as 'alright mate' and 'sweet guv'nor' The video begins with a pre-roll which says: 'For the first time ever Arsenal are coming to New York so to make them feel welcome we have been speaking like them'. Eric Stevenson, Chris Duvall, Connor Lade and Ryan Meara then give their best English accents an airing, trying out such famous cockney phrases as 'alright mate', 'are you having a laugh', 'sweet guv'nor', 'I'm bond, James Bond'. The game will see Arsenal come up against club legend Thierry Henry who joined the Red Bulls in 2010. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger joked that he had hoped Henry might play one half for the Gunners, saying: 'I came here with only one striker because I hoped he would play one half for us. He practices with us and is still very sharp and he came back here in very good shape.' Arsenal will also come up against former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill and ex-Manchester City and Southampton striker Bradley Wright-Phillips.

"They may look like the same thoughtful photographic portrait of Morgan Freeman, but in fact one of these is a hyper-realistic finger-painting, created using only an iPad. If you are still not convinced, the British artist responsible, Kyle Lambert, 26, has produced a video to accompany his painstaking work viewed by almost four million people on YouTube - the only thing it is missing is a trademark narration by the Hollywood legend. The ultra-detailed picture, originally by photographer Scott Gries took Lambert one month and constitutes 285,000 finger strokes that blend ontop of one another to produced the precise wisps of hair in Freeman's beard, the wrinkles in his forehead and the freckles on his cheeks - rendering it almost indistinguishable from the original image. Scroll Down for Video . Painting or photograph? The image on the left is the incredibly realistic iPad finger painting created and conceived by Kyle Lambert using the photograph of Morgan Freeman by Scott Gries (right), where Freeman poses for a portrait backstage during the Mandela Day Concert at Radio City Music Hall on July 18, 2009 in New York City . In the time-lapse video which shows the humble beginnings of his piece, Lambert reveals how he uses a specialist art app called Procreate to allow him to zero-in and layer his work. Lambert, who is a trained artist and oil painter used the app to reduce the brush sizes to only a few pixels - which in turn lets him zoom in to apply stroke upon stroke to produce the ultra-lifelike portrait. 'It captures every brush stroke automatically and you can export it to the camera roll,' Lambert explained. 'It has the best canvas size and and video export. It’s the most like Photoshop.' Beginnings: Kyle's video shows how he painstakingly created the picture from scratch on his iPad using only his fingers and an advanced app called Procreate . The incredible detail of the work has led to some doubting whether the finger painting is all Lambert claims it to be. Critics have pointed out that apps like Procreate allow the user to easily add on images or photos and set them as paintings. As such, some have attempted to claim that Lambert's step-by-step video is in fact played backwards and is not a true representation of a life-like portrait of Freeman. However, Lambert's portfolio of iPad work is extensive and includes pictures of Barack Obama and Beyonce - all incredibly realistic. Painting: The image of Morgan Freeman is clearly coming together but is still a painting and not the hyper-realistic image that is indistinguishable from a photograph that Lambert finally creates . Almost there: While at first glance the picture on the left could be mistaken for the real thing but the softness of the eyes and the tip of the nose are a giveaway. It is a lot hard to tell whether the picture on the right is a painting or the real thing . Lambert told ninemsn that the painting was a very long process. 'I get very involved in my process so spend a lot of time each day on the painting,' he said. 'I was spending 9-10 hours some days if a certain area I was working on was complicated.' Launchpad: This portrait of Beyonce was created by Lambert in 2010 and quickly spread around the Internet as an example of his talent with finger painting on the iPad, while (right) this image of Rhianna displays Lambert's uncanny ability to produce intricate image using his Procreate app . Inspired to create the picture after viewing Freeman in the Tom Cruise vehicle, Oblivion, Lambert has been using an iPad to paint since 2010. 'I've found with past videos people are more engaged when the subject is familiar to them,' he said. 'I think I must have been watching the movie Oblivion when the idea of Morgan Freeman came to mind.' However, the portrait of Morgan Freeman seems to be a quantum leap forward in terms of the final product for Lambert, who lives in Cheshire. Evolution: Kyle Lambert began his work on the iPad application known as Brushes - and this portrait of David Beckham from 2011 illustrates his early skill - which has developed over the past two years as an early portrait of Jennifer Anniston from 2011 also shows . Beauty: Megan Fox and her green eyes are the highlights of this portrait by Kyle Lambert as the beehive of Amy Winehouse in her prime reveals an artists touch . Inspired by the iPad art of legendary British artist, David Hockney, who used Apple's tablet to paint in 2010, Lambert originally used an app known as Brushes, before updating to Procreate. The illustration and animation graduate first began creating digital art following the release of the iPad and was first recognized for his artwork after he posted his re-creation of the Toy Story 3 poster on the Apple Mac website. Even Apple - the creators of the iPad - were so impressed they invited him to give a speech at their Macworld Conference in San Francisco - just days after he posted the picture.","British iPad artist wows with his portrait of Hollywood legend Morgan Freeman which is practically identical to the photograph it is copied from .

"The daughter of football legend Colin Hendry has spoken of her disgust at the Government’s failure to regulate cosmetic surgeons – more than a decade after her mother suffered botched liposuction that led to her death. Denise Hendry died in 2009 aged 42 from an infection she caught during surgery to rebuild her stomach. She had been in and out of hospital for seven years after a plastic surgeon punctured her bowel nine times in a routine liposuction operation in 2002. Anguish: Colin and Denise Hendry with Rheagan and her brother Kyle before Denise's operation . Ongoing battle: Rheagan Hendry, pictured with her daughter River, 2, is campaigning for better regulations after her mother Denise died of a botched liposuction operation . Now her daughter Rheagan Hendry is launching a new Mail on Sunday campaign under the banner Stop The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys. Rheagan, who lives with her two-year-old daughter River in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was just 12 when her mother became ill. In her first major interview since her mother died, Rheagan, 23, says clinic owners ‘answer to no one’ and surgery is becoming ever more dangerous. She is shocked that repeated warnings from senior medics, including a former chief medical officer, have been ignored by Ministers. ‘How many more women need to die or be disfigured before someone takes action?’ said Rheagan, a carer in a home for the elderly. ‘My mother cannot have died in vain.’ Under current rules, doctors who perform cosmetic operations are not required to have any training in the procedures or even to be a surgeon. Foreign doctors are able to fly in, carry out operations and fly out  without proper insurance or specialist training. The Mail on Sunday has consulted with leading medical organisations and compiled a five-point action plan to ensure patients are protected from the cowboys. We are demanding that: . Fatal infection: Denise Hendry with her former footballer Colin Hendry. Denise died in 2009 . Former chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson, now a professor at Imperial College London, first called for tougher regulations in 2006. Last night he said: ‘I commend The Mail on Sunday on its campaign to protect patients from poor standards of cosmetic treatment.’ Former Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said: ‘This campaign has  the right objectives and something needs to be done. I absolutely agree that anyone carrying out cosmetic training must be properly trained.’ Mr Dorrell added that current regulators needed to play a tougher role. Ann Clwyd MP was appointed by the Prime Minister as an adviser on patient complaints and has recently launched a private members’ Bill, The Cosmetic Surgery Bill, to try to tackle the issue. She said: ‘I am absolutely delighted by The Mail on Sunday campaign and I fully support it.’ In recent years, the number of people opting for cosmetic surgery, including nose jobs, breast enlargements and liposuction, has spiralled. The Royal College of Surgeons estimates that last year alone 130,000 operations were carried out, up five per cent on the previous year. Although many surgeons undergo extra training to ensure they know how to do cosmetic procedures properly, this is not required by law – and in many cases, doctors are not skilled in the procedures they offer. Last year the Government ordered a review of cosmetic surgery  following the PIP breast implant scandal. The report by the Department of Health’s medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, is due to be published shortly.","Denise Hendry was ill for seven years after her botched liposuction .

"Shameless bosses of cosmetic surgery firms that go bankrupt and leave patients in the lurch are to be blocked from running new health clinics. A Government crackdown will mean the directors of surgery firms that go bust, as well as those found guilty of providing poor care, will not be allowed to shut up shop simply to open weeks later under a new name. In 2012, The Mail on Sunday revealed how The Harley Medical Centre chain of cosmetic surgery clinics went into administration to avoid possible payouts to 13,000 patients who had been given faulty PIP breast implants. Crackdown: Directors of surgery firms that go bust will not be allowed to shut up shop simply to open weeks later under a new name . The company appointed administrators after its management complained that legal action could put the firm out of business. But within days, and using a slightly different company name, the clinics reopened with many of the same directors in charge. 13,000 patients of The Harley Medical Centre were given faulty PIP breast implants . Last week, the Department of Health announced the introduction of a ‘fit and proper person test’. For the first time, dishonest and incapable bosses will be refused a licence to run a health clinic by the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. The rules will apply to those holding top jobs in both the NHS and private sector and will also mean that unfit directors can be removed from their job. Norman Lamb, the Care and Support Minister, said: ‘This test will allow us to make sure that those leading health and care organisations are up to the job  – and to remove those who are not, including those who have presided over poor care.’ Jan Spivey, from the campaign group PIP Action, which represents victims of the breast implant scandal, said: ‘Finally, we can see the Department of Health are addressing some of the issues the PIP scandal exposed. ‘But we are disappointed it has taken this long. We are still fighting to get compensation for victims of the PIP scandal and this announcement will do little to help with that battle.’","The Harley Medical Centre chain went into administration in 2012 .

"Jennifer Lawrence ‘blindsided’ Chris Martin by breaking up with him after an intense four-month romance, it has been revealed. Friends said today that Oscar-winner Lawrence, 24, split with Martin, 37, late last week, leaving the Coldplay frontman ‘really sad’. She made the decision to end the relationship before embarking on a six-week promotional tour around the world for her new movie Mockingjay, the latest episode in the Hunger Games series, prompting the announcement on Monday. Scroll down for video . Out again: Jennifer Lawrence looked downcast as she headed to dinner with her dad Gary on Monday night in LA - just hours after confirming she had split from Chris Martin . Her main man: Jennifer turns to father Gary Lawrence after splitting with boyfriend Chris Martin . The actress is believed to have been speaking openly about the problems in the relationship to friends while promoting Mockingjay in the US. One friend said: ‘Chris wanted to spend all his free time with Jen – there was a discrepancy between how they viewed their relationship, she’s so easy going and he’s quite intense.’ And she also told friends that the Coldplay frontman, 37, was so keen on their being together that he wanted to spend all his free time with her. But throughout the brief relationship, Martin remained close to his estranged wife Paltrow, with whom he has two children, daughter Apple, ten, and Moses, eight - another source of strain for the pair. He and Paltrow, 42, announced in March that they were 'consciously uncoupling' after ten years of marriage. The source told MailOnline: ‘Jennifer said Chris is an all or nothing kind of guy, so she chose nothing. She broke up with him late last week. ‘He was completely blindsided, he was really sad about it. ‘Jen is contractually obliged for the next six weeks to promote Mockingjay and she just couldn’t see how it was going to work. ‘ . Starring role: Jennifer Lawrence plays heroine Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games franchise. She is about to embark on a six-week global promotional tour ahead of the release of Mockingjay . Not enough time: Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence told friends she could not devote enough time to smitten Chris Martin . The couple were first publicly linked  in August, shortly after Jennifer split from her long-term boyfriend, British actor Nicholas Hoult, but are believed to have first struck up a romance as early as June. They quickly became a hot item and were spotted enjoying an intimate afternoon for two at the Wolffer Estate Vineyard just a few days before Jennifer’s birthday on August 15. A source told E! News at the time: 'They were there on a date. They were very low-key, nobody realised who they were. The setting was super-romantic.' The pair were seen sampling wines together, with the source adding: ‘They watched the sun go down together, then quietly left.' They then shared a string of quiet date nights at Martin's Malibu home and the romance seemed to move further into the spotlight on September 19, when Lawrence attended Coldplay's performance at the iHeartRadio music festival in Las Vegas. But throughout everything, Chris stayed close to his ex-wife Gwyneth. The ex-couple were even pictured enjoying an intimate sushi dinner in LA last week with Oscar winner Gwyneth tenderly stroking Chris's face as she left. The singer met up with Jennifer later that night. And another source claimed to MailOnline on Monday: 'Jen got tired of watching Chris play happy families with Gwyn and was annoyed that he was trying to keep her hidden away.' Still close: Gwyneth Paltrow reached out of her car to caress her ex-husband Chris Martin's face as they stopped for a chat on the side of the road following their family dinner in LA last week . Not herself: The usually bubbly actress failed to crack a smile as she headed out with her father in LA on Monday night . But a source close to Martin told US Weekly that their relationship had been ‘rocky’ due to their ‘insane’ schedules, adding: ‘They really like each other, but it’s just so complicated with so much going on.’ And while Lawrence is believed to have had a crush on Martin since she was a teenager, another source told US that the British singer was equally enamored and believed she was ‘the real deal’. Hours after the split was confirmed, a rather downcast looking Jen was seen going to dinner with her dad Gary in LA. A source confirmed to People magazine that  it was indeed Jennifer who did the dumping, saying: ‘Jen is the one who broke it off with Chris.’ Mockingjay, the first part of the final two movies from the Hunger Games series, is released on November 21 by Lionsgate. Representatives for both Jennifer and Chris declined to comment. Caught out: Jennifer and Chris enjoyed a very secretive relationship, but she was pictured in Las Vegas after attending his iHeartRadio Music Festival performance in September .

"The family of a mother-of-two who died from skin cancer have spoken of their anger that the disease wasn't spotted by doctors earlier. Lianne Gosling, 33, had gone to her doctors a year before she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma about a mole above her eyebrow. But Miss Gosling was reassured that the mole 'looked fine' and advised to return if it bled or became itchy. She went away and it was only when the mole was spotted by another GP she went to see about a stye on her eye that she was sent for tests. Lianne Gosling (pictured with her twin sons, Sam and Ryan) died of skin cancer at the age of 33, less than a year after finding a suspicious mole on her face . Doctors removed the mole and she was expected . to make a full recovery - but tests then revealed she was ravaged with . cancer which had spread to several of her major organs. She passed away on October 28 in a hospice and her funeral was held today. Friends said Miss Gosling was a 'very regular' sunbed user who topped up her tan as often as she could, sometimes a few times a week. After having the mole removed, Miss Gosling, an online retailer, assumed she was on the road to recovery. But a few weeks later she began to feel ill - and tests revealed the cancer had spread to organs such as her lungs and liver. Her father, Robert, 62, and mother, Glenda, 58, from Boosbeck, North Yorkshire, now want to warn others of the risk they believe is posed by the sunbeds their daughter regularly used. Mr . Gosling said: ‘Experts at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University . Hospital have told us they think sunbed use was the prime reason for . Lianne’s death. 'Sunbed use has robbed us of our stunning only daughter. She hardly ever went abroad. 'If this story just saves one life, then it’s worth it and Lianne will not have died in vain.' Ms Gosling was initially expected to make a full recovery after having surgery to remove the mole on her face. However, the cancer spread to her jaw and major organs . Ms Gosling's parents, Robert and Glenda, believe their daughter developed the cancer as a result of her sunbed use - they are now encouraging other people not to use sunbeds . ‘She was such a lovely person, so . loving - especially to her twin sons Sam and Ryan, aged eight - and she . had so many friends. She was so well known all over this region.’ Her mother added: ‘The two boys were . her life. Even though she was so desperately ill at the end, nothing . would stop her attending their birthday party on October 20, just eight . days before she died.’ She . added: ‘Lea is irreplaceable and, though our hearts are broken, we are . so very proud of her and the way in which she lived her life.’ Research has shown that people who have ever used a sunbed are 20 per cent more likely to  develop melanoma later in life, compared to people who had never used one. And those who started using sunbeds before the age of 35 were 87 per cent more likely to develop melanoma compared to people who have never used a sunbed. Cases of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the last decade, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. Mr Gosling said: 'If this story just saves one life, then it's worth it and Lianne will not have died in vain.' Ms Gosling (pictured as a child) was a keen horse rider who won many awards as a child and teenager . Around 13,000 Britons are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths. Miss Gosling's parents said that doctors in the U.S. have just announced a wonder drug . combination which means 50 per cent of advanced skin cancer sufferers . can now be saved, but it came too late for their daughter. This involves using a drug called Yervoy and another called Nivolumab, which fight and suppress the cancer simultaneously, in a revolutionary new way. Mr Gosling said: ‘Just a month before she died, Lianne wept as she watched a Sky News report which stated this was now a fact. ‘I . had also searched the internet for the very latest news on treatment. But the lifeline came just too late for her as she wasn’t able to . benefit from the new drug combination. 'If this story saves just one life, then it's worth it and Lianne will not ahve died in vain. 'Sunbed use robbed us of our stunning only daughter. 'She hardly ever went abroad.

"The female android robot, named Otonaroid, looks on during a press unveiling at Miraikan in Tokyo . In a dystopian future, the rise of our robot overlords may be far stealthier than you might expect. Far from being Terminator-like machines, these robots could look so human that, someday, we may not be able to tell man apart from machine. That day may still be in the distant future, but a new set of ultra-realistic robot newsreaders at a Tokyo museum reveals just how far research has developed in this area. Named Kodomoroid and Otonaroid, the creepy-looking robots speak so smoothly they are eerily lifelike. Japanese robotics expert Hiroshi Ishiguro, an Osaka University professor, said they will be useful for research on how people interact with robots. 'Making androids is about exploring what it means to be human,' he told reporters Tuesday, 'examining the question of what is emotion, what is awareness, what is thinking.' In a demonstration, the remote-controlled machines moved their lips in time to a voice-over, twitched their eyebrows, blinked and swayed their heads from side-to-side. Scroll down for video . Japanese robotic scientist Hiroshi Ishiguro (right) poses next to girl android robot named Kodomoroid (left). In a demonstration, the remote-controlled machines moved their pink lips in time to a voice-over, twitched their eyebrows, blinked and swayed their heads from side to side . Kodomoroid and the woman robot Otonaroid (right) were joined at the demonstration by the minimally designed Telenoid (left), a mannequin head with pointed arms that serves as a cuddly companion . The prospect of robot friends and servants has been the topic of science fiction novels for years. But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist. This . is because computers can't handle any process that completely . integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of . feeling, one expert claims. A . mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last . decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows . that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces . of information together seamlessly. This . means. if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces . of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing . emotions like humans. Powered by compressed air and servomotors, they were seated but could move their hands. Kodomoroid read the news without stumbling once and recited complex tongue-twisters glibly. The robots, designed with a girlish appearance, can use a variety of voices, such as a deep male voice one minute, and a squeaky girly voice the next. The speech can be input by text, giving them perfect articulation, according to Professor Ishiguro. There were some glitches - such as the lips not moving at all while the robot spoke, or the Otonaroid announcer robot staying silent twice when asked to introduce itself. But glitches are common with robots because they are delicate gadgetry sensitive to their environment, said the researchers. Kodomoroid and the woman robot Otonaroid were joined at the demonstration by the minimally designed Telenoid, a mannequin head with pointed arms that serves as a cuddly companion. In what appeared like a scene out of ‘Pinocchio’, Kodomoroid asked Professor Ishiguro why he had created it. The professor replied that he wanted to create a child news announcer. The robots, which have silicone skin and artificial muscles, will be on display from Wednesday, at Miraikan museum, or the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, in Tokyo.

The robots, designed with a girlish appearance, can use a variety of voices, such as a deep male voice one minute and a squeaky girly voice the next . Reflecting widespread opinion, Professor Ishiguro said Japan leads the world in playful companion robots. But he acknowledged the nation was behind the U.S. in military robots. 'We will have more and more robots in our lives in the future,' Professor Ishiguro said. 'You can take my androids on planes - the torso in the suitcase and the head in carry-on.' Professor Ishiguro has a humanoid version of himself which he sends overseas to give lectures. 'It cuts down on my business trips,' he said. 'Technical advances mean robots look and act more human, and that makes us think about our worth.' His approach differs from some robotics scientists who say human appearance is pointless, perhaps creepy, and robots can look like machines, such as taking the form of a TV screen or a portable device. Professor Ishiguro noted proudly how Japanese Internet company Softbank recently showed a robot named Pepper, which looks a little like C-3PO in ‘Star Wars,’ and will sell for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). Pepper's arrival means robots are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Japan. 'Robots are now becoming affordable - no different from owning a laptop,' said Professor Ishiguro. In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots. Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. Pepper . uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to . study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. The . 48-inch (121 cm) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two . large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots.","The Kodomoroid and Otonaroid droids were revealed at Tokyo Museum .

"Advertisers are backing away from the Los Angeles Clippers after racist comments attributed to the NBA team's owner - as moves continue to make Donald Sterling's position as owner untenable. Mercedes-Benz USA said Monday its dealerships are ending their sponsorship of the Clippers in the wake of comments allegedly made by the team's owner, Donald Sterling. Used car dealership chain CarMax, airline Virgin America, Sprint, Amtrak and Corona are doing the same. Three other sponsors, Kia Motors America, energy drink maker Red Bull and hardwood flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators, said they are suspending their advertising and sponsorship activities with the team. Insurer State Farm, said it 'will be taking a pause in our relationship with the organization.'

Sterling has become so unpopular that . companies that weren't even officially sponsoring his team have issued . statements. A spokesman for Anheuser-Busch, the 'Official Beer of the . NBA,' said his alleged comments were disappointing. A Miller Lite . spokesman told Buzzfeed that the company is 'kind of assessing everything right now,' but added that they 'aren't actually an ""official sponsor of the team.""' The Clippers declined to comment. The incident highlights the risks that companies face when they make sponsorship deals. The deals can bring goodwill when things are going well, but brands face a tough spot when they link themselves with teams or athletes that become mired in controversy. Advertising experts say that once the bad news it out there, a negative association could have already been made in the eyes of consumers. Allen Adamson, managing director of research firm Landor Associates, said there's little benefit for brands to stick with their sponsorship deals in this instance. 'There's some benefit in moving quickly,' he said. 'You can always renew your sponsorship later, but the longer you're linking your brand to a brand in trouble, the higher the risk.' Paul Swangard, managing director at Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon, said sponsorships like Carmax and Virgin America can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions, depending on terms of the agreement. He said many brands might be waiting to see what happens at the NBA's press conference on Tuesday. Watch Video Here . 'The early indication is that this could be incredibly damaging to the franchise if things aren't dealt with quickly,' he said . This isn't the first time companies have had to consider whether to keep a sponsorship deal after a controversy erupts. Nike and other sponsors dropped disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong after his doping scandal. But many sponsors stood by golfer Tiger Woods after he acknowledged infidelities and went to rehab for sex addiction. Sterling has come under fire for comments he is alleged to have made in a recorded conversation with a woman. Portions of that conversation were released over the weekend by TMZ and Deadspin, leading to a national outcry. The NBA is planning a news conference Tuesday on its investigation into Sterling. Dropped: A CarMax sign at the dealership in Oak Lawn, Illinois, CarMax on Monday - the firm has told the LA Clippers they will no longer sponsor them while Donald Sterling is owner . 'CarMax finds the statements attributed to the Clippers' owner completely unacceptable,' Richmond, Va.-based CarMax Inc. said Monday in an emailed statement. 'While we have been a proud Clippers sponsor for 9 years and support the team, fans and community, these statements necessitate that CarMax end its sponsorship.' Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm also described the remarks as offensive and said it will monitor the situation as the facts are sorted out. It will continue to run its Born to Assist ad campaign, which began in December 2012 and features Clippers point guard Chris Paul as himself and a fictional, mustachioed insurance-selling twin, Cliff Paul. State Farm said that campaign is part of its overall sponsorship of the NBA.

"The throat specialist to the stars who was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers’ death is still seeing patients, MailOnline can reveal. Dr Gwen Korovin, who was reportedly not authorized to practice at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in Manhattan where Joan underwent an endoscopy on August 28, is still accepting new patients at her Upper East Side practice. New York's Department of Health is continuing its investigation into the star's death after Dr Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, stepped down from his position at the clinic last month. And today, a close family friend told MailOnline that Joan's daughter Melissa Rivers does indeed plan to sue the clinic following her mother's death at age 81 on September 4. Scroll down for video . Gone too soon: Comic icon Joan Rivers fully expected to exit the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic after her procedure to meet up with friends. Instead, the 81-year old went into cardiac arrest and died days later . Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges $460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28 . The friend said: 'Melissa does plan to sue the clinic. It's very difficult to discuss something so unpleasant with her, but she is going to launch a lawsuit. Questions from friends and family that have yet to be answered include whether there was actually an anesthesiologist present as Joan underwent the endoscopy. CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said she suffered a cardiac arrest following the endoscopy as her personal doctor performed an 'unauthorized procedure'. According to CNN, several clinic workers told investigators the procedure began with Dr Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds. Dr. Lawrence Cohen, a longtime gastroenterologist, then performed an endoscopy to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said. It's believed the comedienne had a trans-nasal endoscopy, which feeds a slim tube down the nose, instead of a tube being placed down the throat via the mouth, according to the family friend. Dr Cohen detected something of concern and Dr Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view Joan's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cutoff of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source. Doctor of choice: Dr Korovin - pictured at her Manhattan home last month - counts celebrities including Hugh Jackman - who performed at Joan Rivers' funeral, Daniel Radcliffe, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande among her famous patients . Gone: Gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, the medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, stepped down from his position. He carried out an endoscopy on Joan Rivers on August 28. It was later reported he had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine the star . The clinic, however, denies reports that a vocal cord biopsy was performed moments before Joan went into cardiac arrest. Paramedics then rushed the star from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. Dr Korovin - who charges $460 for an initial consultation and does NOT take insurance - was authorized only to observe Dr Cohen, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source told CNN. Dr Korovin, 56, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients. Sources close to the specialist have already been forced to deny that Dr Korovin took a 'selfie' picture while Joan was under anesthesia. Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who was in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords . Celeb doctor: Pop princess Ariana Grande posted a picture of Dr Korovin giving her a B12 shot in her bottom before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon . Dr. Korovin's  lawyer, Michael Kelton, released a statement to MailOnline, saying:  'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.' Today, Mr Kelton's office declined to comment on whether Dr Korovin was still at work. Meanwhile, the New York Medical Examiner's Office has yet to release the exact cause of death for Joan Rivers.","Dr Gwen Korovin was in the room during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers' death .

"A top doctor has called for warnings to be put on the front of hair dye packs because they contain chemicals that can cause serious allergic reactions, which in turn could prove fatal. A major review for the European Commission has found 36 hair dye chemicals ‘may not be safe for use’ and that consumers are not ‘effectively protected’. Since 2011, two British women have died in cases linked to the dyes, which are used by millions each year. Leading cosmetics companies including L’Oreal and Clairol use potentially dangerous compounds in scores of their hair dyes. A review by the EU found that 36 hair dye chemicals may not be safe for use . Dr Ian White, a dermatologist at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, undertook the most comprehensive review of the chemicals yet. His report for the EC’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) identified 36 chemicals that are potentially ‘extreme’ or ‘strong’ skin sensitisers – meaning they could trigger allergies. These ‘may not be safe’, he concluded. The ones most likely to lead to a reaction are ‘permanent’ chemicals used to colour hair brown or black for up to six weeks. One medium-brown dye in Clairol’s Nice ’n Easy range contains six such compounds, The Mail on Sunday has found. Allergic reactions to these chemicals can include burning sensations, an itchy scalp, flaking skin and rashes. In rare cases they can cause the face to swell up, hair loss and breathing problems. Dr Ian White has called for safety instructions to be printed on the front of packets of hair dye to ensure they are read . Since November 2011, manufacturers have had to place warnings on the side of hair dye packs under European Union regulations. These say that each time a person dyes their hair, they should carry out an allergy patch test beforehand. But Dr White believes the warnings are not prominent enough. ‘The new warning is on the side,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘It doesn’t hit you in the face like a cigarette warning does. We need to make the warnings explicit. Consumers are not as effectively protected as they should be.’ The hair dye industry is worth millions of pounds in the UK, with dyes used 100 million times a year in homes and salons. Yet the European Commission estimates that between one in 50 and one in 100 people who use hair dyes suffer from an allergic reaction to them at some point. The hair dye industry is worth millions of pounds in the UK, with dyes used 100¿million times a year in homes and salons . An investigation by this newspaper found Clairol’s Nice ’n Easy Natural Medium Brown dye contains six of the chemicals on the SCCS list of those that might not be safe. L’Oreal Excellence Crème Natural Mahogany Brown contains three, while its Garnier Nutrisse Crème Dark Golden Brown product includes two. In 2011, Julie McCabe, 38, a mother of two from Keighley, West Yorkshire, was taken to hospital suffering from breathing problems that started while she was dying her hair using L’Oreal’s . Preference. She suffered heart failure and brain damage, and spent a year in a coma before dying last November. The previous month, 17-year-old Tabatha McCourt, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, started vomiting and collapsed after colouring her hair. She later died in hospital. In neither case was it proven that chemicals in the dyes were to blame. However, personal injury lawyers say they are hearing from far more consumers on the issue. One lawyer, who did not wish to be named, said there had been a ‘massive increase’ in the number of cases lately. The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, which represents hair dye manufacturers, said all dyes underwent extensive safety tests to prove they are not toxic or carcinogenic and that the existing warnings were sufficient. A Clairol spokesman said millions of people used hair dyes ‘without experiencing any adverse effects’, although she acknowledged reactions could occur ‘for a very small number’. A L’Oreal spokesman said: ‘We are confident the warnings and advice on our product packs are sufficient to inform people of the risks and they clearly state the importance of carrying out an allergy test 48 hours before using the colorant.’ An EC spokesman said it was not the job of their scientific advisers to dictate how best to protect consumers. He said: ‘In general, hair dyes are safe. Only in rare cases can they cause allergic reactions. To determine an exact spot where the warnings should be placed seems disproportionate for a cosmetic product.’","European Commission found 36 hair dye chemicals ‘may not be safe for use’

"Banned: Chemical MI will now be banned from all leave-on cosmetics thanks to a Mail on Sunday campaign . A chemical is to be banned from beauty products after an investigation by The Mail on Sunday showed it was responsible for triggering one of the worst skin-allergy epidemics doctors have seen. The preservative methylisothiazolinone – also known as MI – has been a popular ingredient in moisturisers, sun creams, shampoos and even baby wipes. But in July, this paper revealed that one patient in ten who went to hospital with the painful skin condition dermatitis had suffered an allergic reaction to MI. After our report, British dermatologists demanded action, warning the epidemic would only intensify. Now the European Commission  is set to outlaw the chemical from all leave-on cosmetics that are rubbed on to the skin, and dramatically reduce its use in rinse-off products such as shampoo. The Commission is expected to announce the plan next week after Cosmetics Europe, the trade body for 4,000 cosmetics firms, took the unprecedented step of advising its members to urgently remove MI from products left on the skin. Dr David Orton, president of the British Society of Cutaneous Allergy, said he was delighted. ‘It is good news there are proposals to regulate,’ he added. ‘We are also pleased the industry itself is advising members to remove MI from leave-on products so that consumers are protected even more quickly.’ Dr Ian White, a consultant dermatologist at the St John’s Institute of Dermatology at St Thomas’ Hospital in London who campaigned for tighter regulations, said: ‘I’m delighted something is being done. ‘There is strong evidence that the number of patients affected is continuing to rise and so it is clear that strong action is needed.’ MI started being used as a preservative in 2006 but only recently became a popular ingredient, triggering a surge in allergic reactions. Last year, only about six per cent of dermatitis patients were found  to be sensitive to MI. By this summer, the figure had jumped to ten per cent and now, estimates suggest the number is 14 per cent. Reaction: One in ten sufferers of dermatitis were found to have had an allergic reaction to the chemical . In September Johnson & Johnson said it would change the formula of its Piz Buin 1 Day Long suncream after more than 150 people told of reactions. Under current rules, MI can be added to cosmetics at a concentration of 100 parts per million. But next week, the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety will say that MI should be banned from all leave-on products and used at just 15 parts per million in rinse-off products. It is this second proposal that is likely to cause controversy, as many companies contest the claim that MI in rinse-off products causes harm. However, dermatologists argue there is now a pool of people sensitised to MI who could react to it even in shampoos and shower gels.","Methylisothiazolinone (MI) an ingredient in moisturisers and sun .

Cosby, best known for his role as Dr Heathcliff Huxtable in the The Cosby Show, has however never been  charged with rape in a court of law. Last month, stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a live performance. 'Bill Cosby has the f***ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,' Buress declared from the stage at the Trocadero Theater in Cosby's hometown of Philadelphia. Buress said: '''Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom."" Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.' In fact, one woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward and shared her story with MailOnline in the wake of Burress' outburst. According to published reports, between the 1970s and early 2000s, as many as 13 women come forward accusing Cosby of sexual assault . In 2006, the legendary comic, actor and activist reached a settlement with a woman who claimed that Cosby drugged and assaulted her at his home in a Philadelphia suburb . 'I was drugged and raped by that man,' she revealed. 'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster.

"A new book titled How To Choose a Husband gives a 12-step guide on how to seek and then hook a man in today's 'post-feminist' culture, which is apparently preparing young women for perpetual singledom. Author Suzanne Venker, who also wrote 7 Myths of Working Mothers and The Flipside of Feminism, believes a submissive wife who gives up on her dreams for marriage and motherhood is the best way to maintain a lasting union. The 45-year-old married mother-of-two explains: 'Our post-feminist culture is toxic. It celebrates women at the exclusion of men; it ignores . the needs of children; and it glorifies the single life... Sadly, more . women than not will allow this poison to invade their bodies and even . ruin their lives.' Happily ever after: How To Choose a Husband gives a 12-step guide on how to seek and then hook a man in today's 'post-feminist' culture, which is apparently preparing young women for perpetual singledom . Ms Venker believes young women's mothers, who drummed in the ideology that being an independent woman, with equal pay, was something to strive for, are to blame. '[Mothers] did their daughters a great disservice. They were wrong to tell their daughters they could never rely on a man,' wrote the author, who has built a career on challenging feminism and questioning contemporary female freedoms. On equal pay, she continues: 'Women . don’t make as much as men precisely because they don’t work the same . number of hours. Women continue to take years off the job to care for . their children or aging parents or to live a more balanced life. Feminists leave that part out. 'You also need to recognize your enemy,' she adds. 'Culture is working against you every step of the way... At the moment, the single greatest problem your generation faces is the relentless anti-male/pro-female rhetoric you're exposed to. It's inescapable.' Ms Venker believes that to have a happy marriage, it is these gender difference we have to embrace, rather than rail against. For example, 'Men are hunters. They want to build things and kill things—that’s why more men than women shoot guns,' she writes. 'Mothers were wrong to tell their daughters they could never rely on a man' 'It’s why male engineers greatly . outnumber female engineers. Females, on the other hand, like to gather . and nest—that’s why more women than men like to shop and bake, or stay . home with their kids. 'Women also like to get all dressed up and prance about in their heels. And men love to watch women prance about in their heels. That’s the yin and yang of gender relations.' In one chapter, she also asks that women 'Decide To Stay' a plea to ensure people don't give up on marriage when things get tough, which seems like sound advice for both men and women a like, regardless of their stance on gender equality for women. In a case against day care, nannies, and full-time work, she also advises: 'Accept It: You Can’t Have It All.' Anti-feminism: Suzanne Venker, author of How To Choose A Husband, believes a submissive wife who gives up on her dreams for marriage and motherhood is the best way to maintain a lasting union . 'Making choices is part of life, she writes. 'You can’t go to every . party. You can’t go on every vacation. You can’t go to every college. You have to choose.' And above all, she writes of the ideal wife's role: 'Just be nice, cook, and have sex!' Ms  Venker has faced criticism for her new book, which some have nicknamed: 'How NOT to choose a husband.' Slate's Maya Benedikt wrote: 'Venker thinks women like me—working mothers who expect things from their husbands—are unhappy, and are making their spouses and children unhappy too.' While Yahoo's Jessica Ferri explained: 'It's a fairly large assumption to make-that all men want a return to a 1950s mentality, when their family was completely dependent on the success of their job. And just because a marriage survives doesn't necessarily mean it's a happy one.' But Ms Venker, who recently wrote a Fox News op-ed titled The War on Men, where she blamed the decline of marriageable males on feminists, insists that American women 'need a detox'. 'If they want to be happy, or just plain satisfied, they must do a 180 when it comes to their attitude toward sex, courtship, and married life. 'If they do, marriageable men will reappear -- and women will find the love that eludes them,' says her book.",Suzanne Venker believes a submissive wife who gives up on gender equality for marriage is the best way to maintain a lasting union .
"Shocking injuries: 78-year-old Sabina Harrison was left black and blue after an alleged attack in Leeds in broad daylight . This is the shocking image of a grandmother-of-four who was beaten black-and-blue by a gang of thieves who allegedly launched a violent attack on her in broad daylight to steal her handbag. Sabina Harrison, 78, suffered horrific injuries after she was mobbed by four men while walking to a bus stop in in Leeds, West Yorkshire, leaving her shaken and scared to leave her home. She said: ‘I had gone out to see my sister and was just walking along the road minding my own business when all of a sudden I was grabbed from behind. ‘They went for my bag but it was over my shoulder and I had it wrapped around my hand so the more they pulled it, the more it tightened around me. ‘They kept on until they got me on the ground and then they dragged me along the floor.’ Mrs Harrison, who worked in the catering industry before retiring, suffered bruising across the entire left side of her body as a result of the alleged attack. She said: ‘I have two artificial hips so I was very worried about them. ‘It happened so quickly and I didn’t get a look at them. It was just the last thing I expected. ‘I didn’t have anything valuable in my bag so I don’t know why they targeted me. I want to just forget about it all and not let this beat me.’ Police have released the photograph of Mrs Harrison’s injuries to encourage the public to help their investigation and have arrested four youths in connection with the attack. Now Mrs Harrison’s family are calling for people to take responsibility to protect the vulnerable. Mrs Harrison’s daughter, Sabina Halliday, says more needs to be done to prevent such attacks. Investigation: Police wish to speak to the occupants of a VW Golf that which was seen on CCTV at the time as they may have witnessed the incident . She said: ‘We want to prevent this from happening to someone else. ‘As a community in the city, we need to make sure that our vulnerable people are safeguarded so that they aren’t afraid of going outside in daylight. ‘We can’t turn the clock back - but those who were involved need to learn that this is not acceptable.’ Mrs Harrison was walking through Harehills on her way to catch a bus when she was allegedly targeted by the gang in Milan Road at about 5.20pm on Friday, February 28. Passers-by called emergency services and Mrs Harrison was taken to hospital. Mrs Halliday added: ‘I was the first person from our family to see her and I was very shocked. I knew that she had been mugged and had a fall but I was quite alarmed when I saw the extent of her injuries.’ She said her mother had not been out of her house alone since the incident and still required regular hospital check-ups. Mrs Halliday said: ‘Her face was very swollen. And the doctors suspected she may have fractured some of the bones in her face, but because of the swelling they couldn't pick this up on X-rays, and they thought it wasn't worth putting my mum through it again as they probably wouldn't do anything. ‘But more than the physical injuries, it's the emotional ones she's been left with. Hopefully she'll get back to herself but it will take time to build her confidence again.’ PC Philip Dodsworth, of Leeds District CID, said: ‘We hope the impact of this image will encourage anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.’ Police are especially keen to talk to the driver of a Mark IV Volkswagen Golf which was seen on CCTV at the time who may have witnessed the incident.

"Just days after rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby resurfaced, and one woman bravely shared her story, the comedian has gotten the boot from one of America's most popular talk shows. It is being reported that Queen Latifah has decided to scrap an interview she had planned with Cosby for next Monday. Production sources told TMZ that the higher ups at The Queen Latifah Show did not want to be 'associated' with Cosby in the wake of these stories. Scroll down for video . Axed: Queen Latifah (left) cancelled a scheduled interview with Bill Cosby (right) after rape allegations against the comedian resurfaced last week . Famous father: Cosby shot to fame playing Dr. Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show (above) But in an official statement released Thursday, The Queen Latifah Show denied the claims. 'Mr. Cosby¹s scheduled appearance on The Queen Latifah Show was postponed at his request and was in no way related to any of our recent or upcoming scheduled guests.' Cosby's history of rape and sexual assault, which he has never been charged with in a court of law, became a major topic last week when comedian Hannibal Burress brought it up during one of his stage shows. In fact, one woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward and shared her story with MailOnline earlier this week. 'I was drugged and raped by that man,' she revealed. 'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.' Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels. Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too. After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her. Hours after Bowman came forward with her story on Monday, Cosby cancelled a scheduled live performance in Florence, Arizona. Telling her story: Just this week, Barbara Bowman (above) detailed how Cosby raped and drugged her' while she was just a teenager . In 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004. It was at that trial that 13 women came forward to allege they too were drugged and sexually abused by Cosby. Cosby has not commented on any of the allegations since they resurfaced. A rep for The Queen Latifah Show said in a statement, 'Mr. Cosby’s scheduled appearance on The Queen Latifah Show was postponed at his request and was in no way related to any of our recent or upcoming scheduled guests.'","Queen Latifah has cancelled an interview scheduled for this Monday on her popular talk show with Bill Cosby .

"He might be a not-so-small 6ft 2"" but Prince Harry was left looking positively diminutive when he joined forces with 6ft 8"" basketball star Carmelo Anthony for a reception at St. James's Palace. Posing for photos with the New York Knicks player, the fourth-in-line to the throne was forced to crane his neck while attempting to make eye contact. Despite the disparity in height, Harry, who was making his first official appearance of 2015, appeared to be enjoying the star's company with the pair seen beaming as they traded quips. Scroll down for video . Dwarfed: Prince Harry with New York Knicks basketball star, Carmelo Anthony, 30 . Unusual: Anthony presented the 30-year-old prince with a basketball shirt and a single orange shoe . The prince, who was given a personalised training shirt by the athlete, then burst into fits of laughter when Anthony also presented him with a single orange shoe. Still chuckling, he promptly told a smiling Anthony that he would have to come to his upcoming game in London to collect the other one. 'And I love the shirt,' he added. The duo were joined for the reception by Congolese basketball star Dikembe Mutombo, 48, who, at 7ft 1"", towered over Anthony as well, and British basketball player John Amaechi. The reception at St James's Palace was held in aid of the Core Coach programme, an apprentice scheme run for jobless young people by the Royal Foundation. Speaking to the 33 newly qualified sports coaches who were trained via the programme, Harry said: 'This is not where it ends but where it starts. Where's the other one? Harry told the Knicks star he would have to come to a game to get the other one . Getting along: The pair seemed to hit it off and spent much of the reception trading quips . Royal seal of approval: Harry said he 'loved' the personalised basketball shirt emblazoned with 'Wales' Pint-sized prince: 7ft 2"" NBA ambassador Dikembe Mutombo made Prince Harry look positively small . 'When my brother, Catherine and I launched the Coach Core programme back in 2012, we had a vision of young people being inspired to become amazing sports coaches for their communities and beyond: Young people, who would in turn, inspire others to change their lives through sport. 'Like many others, we had been profoundly moved by the excitement of the London Olympics - a celebration of sporting achievement. Of course, this level of excellence is only possible through an immense amount of hard work by the athletes, their coaches, mentors and all those who support them on their journey to greatness.' He said the graduates had worked 'fantastically hard', adding: 'Completing the Coach Core programme has, I know, not been easy – but then trying to be the best you can be, isn’t easy. ‘Today's graduation marks a success for all those involved - graduates, coaches, mentors, friends, family and all those who have supported the programme so generously. Important work: The royal joined forces with the basketball stars on behalf of the Coach Core scheme . Speech: Harry also made a speech at the reception and presented new graduates with completion certificate . Enjoying themselves: The scheme aims to train people with few prospects - some of whom were at the Palace . Getting along: Harry and Carmelo Anthony appeared to be getting along famously . So, to the graduates - I hope that wherever the future takes you, that you will continue to be role models and to inspire others through sport.’ Among the hopefuls he spoke to was James Forrester, 19, from Glasgow, who is currently working as a lifeguard after taking the year-long Coach Core course and hopes to become a sports development officer. ‘What was so great about the course was that it was very practical, we worked with children and learn about every kind of sport imaginable from football to tennis and even off-ice-skating, which is ice-skating in a sports hall,’ he said. Who me? The pair traded quips as photographers attempted to take a group photo . Inspiration: Harry said he hoped the new coaches would prove to be role models and inspire their students . Delighted: Harry and Carmelo Anthony present one of the graduates with his certificate . ‘I’m not doing exactly what I want at the moment but it had helped me get settled financially and I have so many ambitions for the future. It has transformed my life.’ Coach Core apprentices learn technical sports skills alongside coaching and mentoring. The course is specifically designed to help students to find employment afterwards. The programme has helped many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, some of whom had dropped out of school, were unemployed or struggling to gain qualifications. It currently has three programmes running, in London, Glasgow and New York. Supporters: As well as Anthony, British basketball star John Amaechi is also a Core Coach supporter .

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has wasted no time in getting back to business since returning to work following treatment for a blood clot. But tiny lines visible on the 65-year-old's glasses when she appeared before the Senate this week indicate she may still be experiencing the after-effects of her spell of ill health. It is thought Clinton was wearing a Fresnel prism on her spectacles - a stick-on panel often used to treat double vision. Double vision? Hillary Clinton, who was hospitalised last month due to a blood clot close to her brain, wore glasses when she appeared before the Senate this week . Treatment: Lines visible on the lens of the Secretary of State's glasses are thought to be a Fresnel prism - a stick on panel used to treat double vision . The faint vertical lines are visible on the left lens of Clinton's glasses in photographs taken during her testimony about the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 2012, in which four Americans were killed. Fresnel prisms are wafer-thin, transparent sheets of adhesive plastic. One side is fixed to the lens of the wearer's glasses, while the other has special grooves that alter the way light enters the eye. The prisms, the strength of which can be adjusted depending on the patient's needs, are often used to treat double vision. The stick-on panels may be worn for several months. If they prove particularly successful, patients can have glasses made with built-in prisms. Double vision can occur in one or both eyes. It can be caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or abnormalities of the cornea, dry eye, or abnormalities of the lens or retina. Eye experts told the New York Daily News it is likely she has had an adhesive Fresnel prism placed on her glasses. 'If she's wearing a Fresnel prism, then she has double vision without it,' said Dr Mark Fromer, medical director at Fromer Eye Centers. Professor Dan Reinstein, from the London Vision Clinic, told MailOnline that double vision occurs when both eyes are receiving good images individually, but the alignment of the eyes is not exactly parallel, causing the brain to interpret the images as coming from different positions. 'Fresnel prisms can be used to compensate for the deviation between the eyes,' he explained. Professor Reinstein said the Secretary of State's fall could have affected the muscles that control the movement of her eyes. 'If indeed Secretary Clinton is wearing a Fresnel prism, and if indeed this is related to what has been described as a result of her recent unfortunate fall, this would imply the head injury may have affected her extraocular muscle balance,' he said. Professor Reinstein said such squints are often temporary, or can be corrected by squint surgery. 'I doubt this will have any effect on her ability to see clearly all the way to 2016,' he said of the Secretary of State, who is widely expected to run for the presidency in three years time. Clinton's spokesperson confirmed she was wearing glasses as a result of the fall and concussion she experienced last month, but did not elaborate further. Clinton returned to work earlier this month following a month long absence, after initially falling ill with a stomach virus. While at home recuperating from the . bug, which forced her to cancel a planned visit to North Africa and the . Middle East, Clinton suffered concussion after fainting and falling. Doctors later discovered a blood clot . between her skull and her brain during a follow-up exam on December 30, . and she was admitted to New York-Presbyterian for treatment with blood . thinners. Recovery: The Secretary of State returned to work earlier this month after spending three days at New York-Presbyterian Hospital . Evidence: Clinton was testifying on Capitol Hill about the terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya . Focus: A spokesman for Clinton confirmed she was wearing the glasses as a result of the fall and concussion she suffered last month, but did not elaborate further . Clinton attended back-to-back hearings on the Benghazi attack before the Senate and the House on Wednesday. The attack on September 11 left four Americans dead, including ambassador Chris Stevens. Clinton, who faced tough questions and harsh criticism from senators during heated exchanges on Capitol Hill, defended the State Department's response in the aftermath of the attack.

"Roy Keane has admitted he cannot see himself managing Manchester United... at least not while Sir Alex Ferguson is associated with the club. The former United midfielder spectacularly fell out with legendary boss Ferguson in 2005 after an MUTV interview he did about his team-mates and left the Old Trafford club under a cloud. And he the Irishman has not been quiet in his criticism of his former boss in his new autobiography, Roy Keane: The Second Half. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane discussing Sir Alex Ferguson . Roy Keane claims he will never manage Manchester United while Sir Alex Ferguson is involved with the club due to the breakdown in their relationship since the midfielder left Old Trafford in 2005 after a bust-up . The pair have taken pot shots at one other in their respective books and have failed to repair their relationship . Keane in happier times with Sir Alex Ferguson after Manchester United won the FA Cup final in 2004 . The Irishman managed Ipswich Town (pictured) and Sunderland but doesn't want United job with Fergie there . Keane writes about a range of topic in his autobiographyThe Second Half . When asked if Keane could ever see himself managing United in the future, Keane told The Telegraph firmly: 'Not if Ferguson's still around.' Seemingly, the relationship between the pair is still so fractious that Keane could not take to the dugout at a club for whom he made 480 league appearances between 1993 and 2005 while Ferguson is still in any way involved at United. Keane, 43, has managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town, as well as currently being assistant boss at both the Republic of Ireland and Aston Villa, and has admitted he does envisage returning to coaching in the future. But it appears he is not eyeing the touchline at Old Trafford as his next venture into management. Keane has not made any secret of his dislike for his former mentor, speaking candidly in both interviews and his book about his disdain for Ferguson. At the press conference for the unveiling of his new book, Keane took aim at his old manager once more. He was asked if he would ever forgive Ferguson. 'Good question,' he said. 'Not sure. Football's a small world and eventually you think you might cross paths again. 'The problem I had, when you're writing and reflecting on something … we had our disagreement … but it's afterwards when people start coming out with all sorts of nonsense. Sir Alex and wife Cathy applaud as a statute in unveiled of the former United boss in 2012 . United named a stand at Old Trafford after their legendary former manager . Keane holds a copy of The Second Half, in which he reveals another side to his personality . 'We had a great team that entertained a lot of people. So to criticise people like that, not just me, people who brought him a lot of success, I thought it was wrong.' And then the killer line from Keane. 'He made his millions, got his statue, got a stand named after him,' he said. 'But to criticise people who brought him success was just wrong.' It seems Louis van Gaal does not need to worry about Keane replacing him any time soon. Keane (centre) gives a wry smile ahead Ireland's 7-0 defeat of Gibraltar in Euro 2016 qualifying .

"Super-agent Jorge Mendes has ruffled a few feathers after claiming that only his client, the 'genius' Jose Mourinho, is capable of taking over Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious legacy at Manchester United. Ferguson, who won 38 trophies in 26 years at the Old Trafford club, retired as manager in 2013 and was replaced by David Moyes. Moyes, however, did not enjoy a successful reign and was dismissed by the club before the end of his first season, with United faltering in seventh in the Premier League table. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is the best man for the Manchester United job, claims his agent Jorge Mendes . Mendes' list of clients includes  Mourinho, David de Gea, Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria . United turned to Louis van Gaal last summer, a proven winner on the continent, as the big name to take the club forward. His side are third in the Premier League table with 43 points,10 behind the pace of leaders Chelsea, were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by League Two Side MK Dons, and required a replay to edge past another League Two team Cambridge United in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Mendes told the BBC: 'It's completely impossible to find someone like Sir Alex Ferguson because he's a god, he's a genius and to find a genius is very difficult. Di Maria arrived at Manchester United from Real Madrid for a reported £58.7 million fee in the summer . 'You have one in England – Jose Mourinho. Having Sir Alex Ferguson ensures at this moment you have 12 or 15 points more. He's finished his career, but he's someone that makes the difference.' Mendes admitted, though, it was unlikely that Mourinho, who is in a second spell in charge of Chelsea, will leave Stamford Bridge any time soon. 'Jose will stay for sure,' said Mendes. 'He will be the Sir Alex Ferguson of Chelsea Football Club. He loves the supporters, he loves the city and I think he will stay there for more than 10 years.' So far, Louis van Gaal's first season in charge of Manchester United has been a little underwhelming . Another of Mendes' clients, United goalkeeper David de Gea has just 18 months to run on his Old Trafford deal and is wanted by Real Madrid. But Mendes offered reassurances to United fans. 'He has one year left on his contract and I think he will stay in Manchester,' Mendes said. 'The player will decide, but he's happy there at the moment.' Goalkeeper David de Gea is wanted by Real Madrid, but Mendes suggests his future is at Old Trafford .","Jorge Mendes has hailed his long-term client Jose Mourinho as 'a genius'

"Five radicalised footballers from east London who left the UK to join ISIS may hold the key to helping western authorities locate British executioner Jihadi John. The group of militants all moved from their native Portugal to London, where they converted to Islam before adopting extremist views and travelling to Syria to join the terrorist network's ranks. The men, who lived in Leyton and Walthamstow, have long been on the radar of intelligence officials - who believe the group plays a vital role in the production and dissemination of the sick beheading videos featuring Jihadi John. Scroll down for video . Talented footballer turned jihadist: The youngest of the east London terror cell, Fabio Pocas, 22, played at the same Portuguese academy as Cristiano Ronaldo, before joining an amateur side in London . In July 2014 - 39 days before James Foley became the first Western hostage to be murdered - one of the east London cell's ringleaders posted a message on Twitter indicating he had advance knowledge of the American journalist's grisly fate. Nero Saraiva, who lived in a one-bedroom council flat in Walthamstow for three years, tweeted: 'Message to America, the Islamic State is making a new movie. Thank u for the actors.' Just over a month later James Foley was beheaded in a YouTube video entitled A Message To America. European security officials now believe Saraiva and his East London cell are responsible for the filming and dissemination of the series of sickening beheading videos, including the execution of British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. Experts hope the group's link to Jihadi John, who speaks with a London accent, will help them build a background profile of the ISIS executioner and his networks - and aid in any mission to capture or kill him, the Sunday Times reports. MI5 are said to have worked out the identity of Jihadi John but have not yet released his name. Promising: Pocas (circled), pictured with amateur side UK Football Finder, had received attention from an agent who told him he could expect a trial at a professional club . In his most recent video, broadcast lat week, the killer threatened to murder two Japanese hostages unless a ransom of $200million was paid. Yesterday, new footage appeared to show that one of the captives has been killed. All five of the football-playing jihadists showed a passion for football in their younger years, and after moving to the UK, would often meet in a Portuguese-run cafe in east London to watch matches. It is still unclear how they were radicalised in Britain but the borough of Waltham Forest where they lived is known to be home to a number of Islamic extremists. Also among the five, who all moved to London over the space of several years to study or find work, is Fabio Pocas, the youngest member of the group at 22. Pocas moved from Lisbon to London in 2012 in his bid to become a professional footballer. He had previously played at the youth academy of Sporting Lisbon - a club which has bred a host of world stars including Luis Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo. Ringleader: Nero Saraiva, 28, was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012 and is thought to have lived in the UK for the longest. He has a five-year-old son living in Britain . A tweet posted 39 days before the murder of James Foley suggested Saraiva had advance knowledge of the American journalist's grisly fate . After arriving in London, Pocas began playing for an amateur league team called UK Football Finder Football Club (UKFFFC), where he flourished. After helping the side become champions of their division, he was offered the prospect of a trial with a professional club. The team's coach, Ewemade Orobator, told The Sunday Times: 'He came here to play football seriously. One of the brothers: Celso Rodrigues da Costa followed his older sibling Edgar to Syria to join ISIS. 'In about May 2013 an agent came down and said ""Work hard over the summer and I will get you a trial [with a professional club]"".' But Pocas, who had recently converted to Islam, failed to capitalise on the offer and simply 'disappeared' - before later resurfacing in Syria in ISIS propaganda photos. The talented footballer has since been prolific on social media, posing in online pictures with ISIS flags and guns. He now goes by the name Abdurahman Al Andalus and lives in a town called Manjib with his Dutch teenage jihadi bride. In a recent Facebook message, he wrote: 'Holy war is the only solution for humanity.' All five of the men had family roots in Portugal's former African colonies and some were brought up to be Christians. They travelled to London separately but at one point, a few of them shared a flat in Leyton, according to Expresso newspaper in Lisbon. Links to killer: European security officials believe the East London cell are responsible for the filming and dissemination of the series of sickening beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John . Celso Rodrigues da Costa, 28, is believed to have had training sessions with Arsenal - but was not offered a contract by the club. However an Arsenal spokesperson said: “We don't have any record of a Mr Celso Rodrigues Da Costa being involved with the club at any level.” Last April, he was seen in an ISIS video shot on the banks of the Euphrates in Syria with an AK-47 in hand. In the clip, he slammed the West and denounced school teachers as 'drug dealers and paedophiles'. Celso is thought to have followed his older brother, Edgar, to Syria in 2012. His 31-year-old sibling, who studied management and accounting in Portugal before emigrating to London, is thought to leading a band of foreign militants in Aleppo. Both men were enrolled at the University of East London (UEL) in Stratford, but were thrown off their courses after failing to attend lectures. Where they were radicalised: The five keen footballers turned jihadists had all been living in Walthamstow and Leyton in east London after moving to the UK from Portugal . Ringleader Saraiva, who posted the tweet suggesting advance knowledge of James Foley's death, was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012. He has a five-year-old son in the UK, who he has never supported financially, and is thought to have lived in Britain the longest, having appeared on the electoral role in 2003. Last year his name was linked to an alleged terrorist plot in east Africa involving al-Qaeda affiliate group al-Shabaab. He is a known supporter of hate-preaching cleric, Abu Hamza, recently jailed for life in America for terrorism offences. The fifth member of the cell, a 26-year-old former Catholic known as Sandro, was the last to travel to Syria and was reportedly killed last October in a coalition airstrike.","All five are Portuguese and moved to London separately to work or study .

"Dallas star Charlene Tilton and her ex-husband - country crooner Johnny Lee – have been divorced for 30 years. But they came together to celebrate the wedding of their only daughter Cherish Lee. And where else would the woman who played Lucy Ewing in Dallas hold such a celebration but at Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas,.where Charlene co-starred in the hit TV series from 1978 until 1985 and again from 2012 until 2014. Cherish, 31 tied the knot with her fiancé of only two months, 31-year-old Matt Dunn at the very ranch last month. Both are country singers. 'Southfork was my second home since I began playing 17-year-old Lucy Ewing in 1978,' Tilton, 55, told Mail Online in an exclusive interview. Scene setter: Where else would Lucy Ewing hold such a celebration as her daughter's wedding but at Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas. Charlene and Cherish's dad country singer Johnny Lee divorced 30 years ago . Deja vu: Dallas castmembers Patrick Duffy ( Bobby Ewing), Victoria Principal (Pamela Barnes Ewing), Barbara Bel Geddes ( Eleanor 'Miss Ellie' Ewing), Larry Hagman (John Ross 'J.R.' Ewing, Jr.), Charlene Tilton ( Lucy Ewing), Jim Davis (John Ross 'Jock' Ewing), and Linda Gray  (Sue Ellen Ewing) at  Southfork ranch in 1979 . Here comes the bride: Mom and Dad walked Cherish down the aisle . Hitched: Cherish, 31,  tied the knot with her fiancé of only two months, 31-year-old Matt Dunn at Southfork . 'Larry Hagman was like an uncle to me and I have many great memories of our times together. His death greatly affected me and I miss him very much.' Hagman died in November, 2012 of complication from acute myeloid leukemia. 'When my daughter Cherish was born in 1982, I used to bring her down on the set, and she loved running around the ranch and through the fields at Southfork, and we both agreed it would be a dream location for a wedding. 'The ranch staff could not have been more accommodating,' she adds. 'They booked me into the 'Miss Ellie Suite,' at the nearby Southfork Hotel (named after the late Dallas actress Barbara Bel Geddes who died in 2005) and the chef laid out a huge spread offering beef and chicken skewers and lots of Southwestern fare, including mini tacos and homemade guacamole. 'And Cherish's Auntie baked her a three-tier white cake with white icing and flowers covering the layers. 'As you might imagine, with such a talented family, the music flowed,' she says. 'My two-ex husbands… Cherish's dad Johnny and my second husband Dominick Allen, a Vegas entertainer, serenaded her, and her new husband Matt Dunn performed a song he'd written especially for the occasion. 'And Cherish and her dad even performed a few duets.' We love Lucy: Charlene co-starred in the hit TV series from 1978 until 1985 and again from 2012 until 2014 . Dream come true: 'When my daughter Cherish was born in 1982, I used to bring her down on the set, and she loved running around the ranch,' Charlene tells MailOnline. 'We both agreed it would be a dream location for a wedding' Tilton married 'Lookin' for Love' singer Johnny Lee in 1982. Their daughter was born later that year. And despite the fact Charlene and her ex once shared a stormy relationship; they came together earlier this year when he lost his only son, 23-year-old Johnny Lee Jr., from a drug overdose. 'My daughter and her-half brother were very close,' says Tilton. 'And she was devastated over his loss. 'But I believe God has a way of healing grieving families by bringing them together to share the joy we were all able to share on Cherish's wedding day. 'When tragedy strikes, we need to let bygones be bygones, so I reached out to Cherish's distraught father in an effort to offer comfort. 'We have been able to forge a new, more amicable relationship and while it's still a work in progress, we are both determined to be there for our daughter and new son in law, and of course for any grandkids that come along!' The heartbreak of losing her only sibling may actually have played a part in Cherish and her new man finding each other.' Soon after her brother died, Cherish went to stay with her father in Dallas. And that is where she met her new husband. 'Although Matt is a singer and guitar player, he spent four years with the army in Afghanistan,' says Tilton. 'When he returned to the States in 2011, he signed on as the opening act for Johnny Lee. He and Cherish met in June, and it was love at first sight. 'He actually proposed out under a tree at Johnny Lee's ranch, and they were married just four months after they met! Cherish is off to Nashville to record a new album next month. She and Matt will also tour the US performing together. Wheels: Cherish Lee arrived at her wedding venue in her dad's vintage red Camaro convertible with dad at the wheel and she and mom seated in the back. She was then escorted down the aisle by both proud parents. 'Not only do Cherish and Matt have their performing in common while my daughter was grieving the loss of her brother, Matt was mourning the loss of his father who died last year as the result of a freak accident,' she said. Cherish Lee arrived at her wedding venue in her dad's vintage red Camaro convertible with dad at the wheel and she and mom seated in the back. She was then escorted down the aisle by both proud parents. 'Cherish looked amazing,' says her mom. 'She wore a floor length, white, strapless, Vera Wang couturier gown accompanied by a traditional white veil. She carried a bouquet of white hydrangeas with white and peach colored roses, and seven bridesmaids and seven groomsmen were in attendance. 'There were about 105 invited guests, including my Dallas co-star Sheree Wilson who played April Stevens. 'And while Matt and Cherish said their vows outdoors with Southfork Ranch as a back drop, we later moved indoors for the reception, music and dancing.' Charlene says the couple hope to have a more traditional honeymoon in the near future, but with only a few days free, they opted to stay close to their new Dallas apartment and do a few things on their bucket list like visit the zoo, and attend a WWE wrestling match. 'Cherish is off to Nashville to record a new album next month,' shares the proud mom. 'And she can't wait to get started. She and Matt will also tour the US performing together, and they are really looking forward to that. 'Of course like any mother of the bride, I hope they will have children someday, but for the time being I'd like to see them concentrate on their careers because they are both extremely talented.'","Charlene Tilton played Lucy Ewing on the long-running hit TV show Dallas .

"Isis has called on insurgents in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula - home to the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh - on Monday to press ahead with attacks against Egyptian security forces and to continue beheadings, an appeal likely to deepen concerns over ties between the militant groups. Egyptian officials, including the foreign minister, have acknowledged coordination between the two groups but have said there are no Isis fighters in the country. Isis, also known as the Islamic State, controls swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria where it has proclaimed a caliphate. Egypt has faced an Islamist insurgency since the army ousted President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood last year. Scroll down for video . Isis has called on insurgents in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula - home to the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh - on Monday to press ahead with attacks against Egyptian security forces . Chilling: Isis spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani (pictured) called for 'disbelievers' to have their heads cut off and their homes raided . 'Rig the roads with explosives for them. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads. Do not let them feel secure,' IS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani said in a statement released online. He praised Egyptian militants for carrying out 'blessed operations against the guards of the Jews, the soldiers of Sisi, the new Pharaoh of Egypt'. He added: 'O America, O allies of America, and O crusaders, know that the matter is more dangerous than you have imagined and greater than you have envisioned. We have warned you that today we are in a new era. 'If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, kill him in any manner or way however it may be.' Sharm el-Sheikh has been targeted by terrorists in the past. Pictured is the destroyed Ghazala Garden Hotel after suffering a bomb attack by militants . President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief last year led Mursi's ouster following mass protests, has expressed concerns about Islamist militants in Egypt and in other parts of the Middle East. A militant from the Sinai-based al-Qaeda-inspired Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which has killed hundreds of Egyptian security forces over the last year, has told Reuters IS has provided instructions on how to operate more effectively. On Sunday, a bomb attack beside the Egyptian foreign ministry in Cairo claimed by a militant group killed three policemen, including a key witness in a trial of Mursi.","Isis has called on insurgents in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula to spread terror .

"The government has created a video to explain to the heartbroken families of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 victims why their loved ones have still not been found after eight months. Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8 2014 carrying 239 people, including six Australians, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. In the four-minute video, posted by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre on YouTube, authorities attempt to explain why the search mission has taken so long and why the search area continues to be based along the seventh arc in the southern Indian Ocean, an area with incredibly deep water and rough conditions. The arc is described as 'a thin long line that identifies all the possible points the last communication between the aircraft and the communication satellite could have taken place'. Scroll down for video . Brisbane couple Rodney and Mary Burrows, pictured, were among the Australians who were killed when MH370 plunged into a remote area of the Indian Ocean . The aerial search for MH370 has been scaled back but a deep sea underwater search continues . Trying to calm recent fears that the search operation could be stopped, the video says: 'The expert satellite working group is continually refining analysis of the available data to identify the areas of the highest priority for the search.' Relatives of MH370 passengers were outraged last week after a senior Malaysia Airlines representative allegedly said the beleaguered carrier is planning on officially declaring the plane 'lost', which would call off the search. Commercial director Hugh Dunleavy said authorities are working to set a date, likely by the end of the year, to formally announce the loss of the Boeing 777. An organisation representing families of the MH370 passengers, called Voice370, said Mr Dunleavy's comments, denied by both Malaysia Airlines and Australia, had brought 'intense agony and confusions to family members'. The new video illustrates that the water is up to 6km deep in some points making it hard to search . Survey ship M/V Fugro Discovery has been searching for missing flight MH370 . The official search area revolves around the seventh arc in the Indian Ocean . In the new video, families are reassured that Australia, Malaysia and China 'are all contributing significant assets and resources' to finding MH370. But it’s explained that the plane is believed to be in a remote region of the Indian ocean were the water is up to 6km deep in some areas. Search operators are 'mapping the sea floor with sonar waves to gather detailed information about the shape and composition of sea floor'. Once they've got enough information it can 'guide the underwater vehicles used in the search operation'. Queensland couple Robert and Catherine Lawton were also on the flight . A search team are still mapping the ocean floor while looking for MH370 . Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8 2014 carrying 239 people, including six Australians, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . The video reasoned that because the water is so deep 'daylight can only penetrate in some areas' and on the 'deep sea floor there is no sunlight' making the search extremely difficult. JACC Chief Coordinator Judith Zielke recently said she wants the search vessels to cover the entire 55,000 square kilometre 'high priority area' by May. There were three Australian couples on board MH370 when it disappeared and one New Zealand man. Queensland couple and doting grandparents Robert and Catherine Lawton, who lived at Springfield Lakes in Brisbane's south-west, were on their annual holiday. Three-dimensional models of the area MH370 is thought to have gone missing in the Indian Ocean have been created . Knowing the location of the features is essential to steer deep-sea vehicles around them . The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority’ area - is around the seventh arc . They were travelling with fellow Brisbane couple Rod and Mary Burrows, who had three children and were reportedly expecting their first grandchild in April. And Sydney couple Gu Naijun and Li Yuan, originally from China, were reportedly on a business trip. Ms Gu, 31 and Mr Li, 33, owned a petrol station at Miranda in southern Sydney. Meanwhile, Perth-based New Zealand man Paul Weeks was en route to Mongolia to begin a fly-in, fly-out job with a mining contractor. He had two young children with his wife Danica.

"Hundreds of protesters stood inches from Ferguson police officers in riot gear late Friday before demonstrators dissipated, anticipating a long weekend of marches and rallies. Organizers of the four-day 'Ferguson October' events expected 6,000 participants, but the initial protest Friday outside the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton didn't draw nearly that amount. Later Friday, tensions increased, with hundreds of people amassing outside the Ferguson Police Department and chanting anti-police slogans such as, 'Killer cops, KKK, how many kids did you kill today?' as a wall of about 100 officers in riot gear stood near them.

Written in black and white: A protester holds a sign 'We Are Human' in front of a police line in Ferguson . Rage: A group of female activists protest in front of a sign listing the names of people allegedly killed by law enforcement . Some 300 people stood in the middle of the street screaming out: 'My hands on my head. Please don't shoot me dead' and 'Who shuts it down? We shut it down!' Roughly 30 regularly uniformed police officers stood guard outside the department. Soon after, most of the crowd left, with organizers urging people to avoid arrest so that they could come back for more protests throughout the weekend. Protesters renewed their call for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson officer, in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, an armed black teenager. A grand jury is reviewing the case, and the US Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Brown's death and a broader inquiry into the Ferguson police force. 'We are here to demand the justice that our people have died for,' chanted protest organizer Montague Simmons of the local group Organization for Black Struggle. 'We are here to bring peace, to bring restoration, to lift our banners in the name of those who've been sacrificed.' In Clayton, officers escorted the several hundred demonstrators through the suburb's downtown as they marched past high-end restaurants, jewelry stores, banks and law offices in the rain, before the protests moved to Ferguson. After the Ferguson demonstration broke up, some protesters planned to go to the site of a police shooting in St. Louis.

Meanwhile, the St. Louis Police Department announced it had encrypted its radio communications system, saying tactical information relayed to officers had been compromised during recent events, putting officer and the public at risk. Tensions remain high in the wake of another black 18-year-old's shooting death by a white police officer Wednesday night in St. Louis. Police say Vonderrit D. Myers shot at the St. Louis officer, who was in uniform but working off-duty for a private neighborhood security patrol. Myers' parents say he was unarmed. The officer's name hasn't been released. 'It's important for this country to stand with this community,' said protester Ellen Davidson of New York City, who was making her second trip to the St. Louis area since Brown's death. 'This community is under siege. ... The eyes of the world are watching.' On Saturday, the protests shift to downtown St. Louis, hours before the Cardinals host the San Francisco Giants in the first game of the National League Championship Series. And on Monday, a series of planned — but unannounced — acts of civil disobedience are to take place throughout the St. Louis region. 'I'm not planning to get arrested,' said Davidson, who was meeting up with other protesters from Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Tennessee. 'But I do plan to do what I believe are in my rights as a protester. If I get arrested, that's on the people who arrest me.'

Brown's parents, the local chapter of the NAACP and other organizations called for peaceful protests ahead of the 'Ferguson October' events. 'We understand first-hand the powerless frustration felt by people of all walks of life regarding their interactions with law enforcement,' they said in a statement. 'We ask that those coming to show support for our son do so within the law.' St. Louis police arrested eight people Thursday as hundreds gathered to protest Myers' death. At one point officers used pepper spray to force protesters back. A police spokeswoman said one officer was struck in the arm after someone threw a brick, and several cars were damaged. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said authorities are planning for large crowds and possible violence. Black leaders in St. Louis want the Justice Department to investigate Myers' shooting as well. Police said the officer fired 17 rounds after Myers shot at him. Preliminary autopsy results show a shot to the head killed Myers. The officer wasn't injured. Online court documents show Myers was free on bond when he was killed. He had been charged with the unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest in June.","Friday's protest kicked off a weekend of 'Ferguson October' events .

"Leaders of the so-called Islamic State insurgency and Al Qaeda's offshoot in Syria have agreed a truce and a plan to wipe out Western-backed rebels in the country, it is claimed. Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra have until now fought a bitter internecine war for supremacy in the rebellion against the regime of Syrian president Bashar Assad. But a high-level Syrian opposition official and a rebel commander have told The Associated Press that they've learned of a deal between the factions to join forces against Western-backed groups. Islamic State fighters parade in Raqqa, Syria: Leaders of Islamic State and Al Qaeda-linked rivals Jabhat al-Nusra have reportedly agreed to join forces to wipe out Western-backed rebels in war-torn Syria . Still alive? Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who had been reportedly killed in a U.S. airstrike, apparently speaks in an audio message released by the group to supporters this week . It comes as an audio message by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was released urging supporters to unlease a 'volcano of jihad' on opponents - and seemingly disproving claims he had been killed in a U.S. airstrike. Lacing his speech with religious phrases, the voice believed to belong to Baghdadi describes jihad as 'the peak of Islam' and said those who do not fight non-believers will suffer 'painful torment. Militant leaders from Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra gathered at a farmhouse in northern Syria last week, opposition officials told The Associated Press. Their new agreement, according to the sources in rebel groups opposed to both IS and Nusra Front, would involve a promise to stop fighting and team up in attacks in some areas of northern Syria. AP reported last month on signs that the two groups appear to have curtailed their feud with informal local truces. Any accord could present major difficulties for Washington's strategy against the Islamic State insurgency. While warplanes from a U.S.-led coalition strike militants from the air, the Obama administration has counted on arming 'moderate' rebel factions to push them back on the ground. Those rebels, already considered relatively weak and disorganised, would face far stronger opposition if the two heavy-hitting militant groups now are working together. Al Qaeda-linked: Members of the Islamist Syrian rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra ride on a vehicle mounted with an anti-aircraft weapon, along a damaged street in Deir al-Zor, eastern Syria on February 5, 2014 . According to a Syrian opposition official speaking in Turkey, the meeting took place on November 2 in the town of Atareb, west of Aleppo, starting at around midnight and lasting until 4am. The official said the meeting was closely followed by members of his movement, and he is certain that an agreement was reached. The official said about seven top militant leaders attended. A second source, a commander of brigades affiliated with the Western-backed Free Syrian Army who is known as Abu Musafer, said he also had learned that high-ranking members of Nusra and IS met on November 2. He did not disclose the exact location, but said it was organized by a third party and took place in an area where the FSA is active. According to Abu Musafer, two decisions were reached: First, to halt infighting between Nusra and IS and second, for the groups together to open up fronts against Kurdish fighters in a couple of new areas of northern Syria. Embattled: Free Syrian Army fighters run with their weapons during clashes with forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad on the Amerya front in Aleppo last week . Best laid plans... The Obama administration has counted on arming 'moderate' rebel factions to push Islamists back on the ground in Syria, as well as topple the Syrian regime . The Nusra Front has long been seen as one of the toughest factions trying to oust Assad in a civil war estimated to have killed more than 200,000 since 2011. Islamic State entered the Syria war in 2012 from its original home in Iraq and quickly earned a reputation for brutality. It has tried to impose itself as the leading rebel faction behind which all pious Muslims should unite. Al-Qaida initially rejected IS's claims to any role in Syria, and Nusra and other factions entered a war-within-a-war against it. But the Islamic State group swelled in power and became flush with weapons and cash after overrunning much of northern and western Iraq over the summer. According to the opposition official, the meeting included an IS representative, two emissaries from Nusra Front, and attendees from the Khorasan Group, a small but battle-hardened band of al-Qaida veterans from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Also reported present at the meeting was Jund al-Aqsa, a hard-line faction that has sworn allegiance to IS; and Ahrar al-Sham, a conservative Muslim rebel group. The official said IS and the Nusra Front agreed to work to destroy the Syrian Revolutionaries Front, a prominent rebel faction armed and trained by the U.S. and led by a fighter named Jamal Maarouf. They agreed to keep fighting until all of the force, estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000 fighters, was eliminated, the official said.","IS and Jabhat al-Nusra leaders met in northern Syria last week, it is claimed .

"Terror case: Science teacher Jamshed Javeed, 30, has admitted two Syria-related terror offences revealed to police after a row with his family . A British science teacher today admitted plotting to fight with ISIS in Syria but was only stopped after his upset family confiscated his passport. Radicalised father-of-two Jamshed Javeed, 30, taught 11 to 16-year-old pupils at Sharples High School in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Police said the teacher was 'determined' to leave his job and fight alongside ISIS but his family, including his pregnant wife, grabbed his 'go bag' of money, supplies and his passport. Jamshed Javeed had intended to travel with a man he had met only three months beforehand but could not travel without his documents. When he applied for a new passport and received it last December anti-terror police swooped and arrested him. He was planning to fly out  to Syria via Turkey with equipment he had bought for use on the battlefields. His family pleaded with him not to travel to Syria but he told them he wanted to go regardless of their wishes. It also emerged today Javeed was twice spoken to by MI5 agents as he plotted join ISIS and he knew 'they were keeping an eye on him' just before he was held. The teacher was due to stand trial at Woolwich Crown Court today but instead pleaded guilty to two terror charges. He was remanded and will be sentenced in December. His brother Mohammad Azzam, 19, is missing and presumed dead in Syria after travelling there last September. Javeed also admitted today he transferred £1,400 into his brother's account to pay for his and a friend's flights to the warzone shortly before his own arrest. The other man was Anil Khalil Raoufi, 20, from Didsbury, who died in the fighting earlier this year. Police claim the previously 'law-abiding' married father-of-two 'started to support the Isis cause' from August last year. Det Ch Supt Tony Mole, head of The North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'What we have seen here is an interesting case of somebody who has lived quite a normal, stable family life with children – a school teacher leading on the face of it a fruitful life. 'But now he has pleaded guilty to two serious offences involving preparation of himself and others for terrorist offences – namely going to Syria to fight for ISIS. 'It is an interesting case because of the speed of the process. Scroll down for video . Fall out: Javeed, sketched in court,  had a bag packed with equipment and money but his family took it all . Guilty: Jamshed Javeed, 30, who taught at Sharples High School in Bolton, pictured, today pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to Syria-related terror charges . The brother of a British man who was killed fighting in Syria has appeared in court charged with trying to help others to commit terrorist acts. Mustakim Jaman, 23, from Portsmouth, spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth when he stood in the dock at London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court. Helping would-be terrorists with travel plans and collecting donations to try to replace items that were lost on the battlefield are among the alleged offences, which are said to have taken place between August 1 2013 and October 14 this year. Jaman was charged under section five of the Terrorism Act 2006 with having the 'intention of assisting others to commit acts of terrorism' and of 'engaging in conduct in preparation' for this cause. District Judge John Zani ordered that he next appear in custody at the Old Bailey on November 14. Jaman, of Hudson Road, Southsea, is the brother of Ifthekar Jaman who was killed last year. He is alleged to have given 'a group of men a lift to a train station knowing that they intended to travel to Turkey and onwards to Syria to join the non-government forces in the ongoing conflict'. He is also charged with 'giving advice to a Whatsapp user about how to travel to Syria without being detected, including shaving off his beard and travelling with others'. 'The evidence indicates he got together with a group determined to go out to Syria to fight and despite efforts of his family who were against him going out there, he was still determined to go. 'The earlier we can be aware from the communities of people that might be showing some signs of going out to meet terrorist groups, or engage with terrorist groups, the more we can do on the prevention side of the business. 'Anybody that goes out to ISIS, or get out to ISIS, is putting themselves, their family and therir communities in a very vulnerable position. 'It is a life-changing decision. There is a sector of society which is very vulnerable to this rhetoric and you only have to watch the news to see what this group is about. 'I still maintain that anybody who goes out there to fight with ISIS could potentially be a serious danger to their communities if they return, or try to return. 'By the time they have been trained out there, had experience, built up future friendships and fully engaged with that terrorist rhetoric – you can potentially become a dangerous individual. 'Hence we take a robust to anybody who engages in terrorist organisations.' In his basis of guilty plea he claimed he was never warned he could be arrested for flying out to the Middle East. It states: 'The defendant was spoken to by MI5 officers on two occasions in December 2013. On neither occasion was he told fighting with the opposition would constitute a terrorism offence under domestic law. 'He understood that MI5 wanted him to know that they were keeping an eye on him to ensure that he did not get involved in any unlawful activity within the UK.' Terror case: Teacher Jamshed Javeed, 30 was held at this address in Levenshulme in Manchester after his family took his passport and informed the police . Police, pictured outside his home, said the teacher was 'determined' to leave his job and fight alongside ISIS but his family confiscated his 'go bag' of money, supplies and his passport . His school said it was in 'shock' today. Headteacher Rachel Quesnel said: 'It came as a huge shock to be informed by the police that they had arrested a member of staff. We acted on the advice of the local authority and the police and suspended the individual. This was a neutral act pending a police investigation, and in line with the council's HR procedures. 'There was no evidence whatsoever to link any criminal activity to our school or the wider community and no evidence to suggest that any pupils, staff or the wider community were under any kind of threat. 'We would like to reassure all our stakeholders that this was an isolated incident, involving one individual, and is in no way a reflection on Sharples School.' Backing: Javeed admitted he paid for his brother and friend Anil Khalil Raoufi, 20, from Didsbury, who died in the fighting earlier this year, to fly to Syria . The 30-year-old from Levenshulme also admitted he funded his younger brother Mohammed and his friend to fly to the war ravaged country to take up arms against the Bashar al-Assad regime last September. He had travelled to Syria with university student Anil Khalil Raoufi, 20, from Didsbury, who died in the fighting earlier this year. Javeed says he discovered that his younger brother Mohammed Javeed was planning to join rebels in Syria in August or September last year. He transferred a total of £1,400 to his brother's account, and accepts that £1,100 of that money would be used to fund Mohammed and a friend's travel to Syria. The basis of plea says Jamshed Javeed did not 'recruit, advise or encourage' anyone to travel to Syria. It says the defendant is a practising and sincere Muslim and 'not an extremist'. He was said to have been 'deeply moved' by images and reports of 'extreme suffering of the Syrian people at the hands of (President) Bashar al-Assad's vicious regime'. The basis of plea says: 'It was against this background, and influenced by his younger brother's decision, that Jamshed Javeed subsequently came to the conclusion that he should go to support the ordinary people of Syria. 'He accepts that this would have meant becoming involved in some fighting as well as humanitarian relief. He also acknowledges that he spent time on the internet looking at various websites and followed individuals on Twitter. 'But he does not have an 'extremist' mindset. His motivation was no more than to play a part in defeating Assad or at least repelling his army from attacking the civilian population. He has no broader agenda than that. He had no interest in creating a new Islamic state.'","Jamshed Javeed, 30, taught children at Sharples High School in Bolton .

"Sir Alex Ferguson was no stranger to splashing the cash during his 26 years in the Old Trafford hotseat and so the Scot is well-placed to assess Manchester United's summer signings. The former Red Devils manager sat down with sports presenter Jim Rosenthal for an exclusive interview on MUTV about his life after retiring in 2013. Casting an eye over the £150million worth of talent acquired by Louis van Gaal, here Ferguson assesses each of United's new boys. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Falcao scores a stunning header for Colombia v El Salvador . Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson chats with presenter Jim Rosenthal on MUTV . Ferguson discussed  United's summer signings and gave his view on Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria . ANGEL DI MARIA . Former club: Real Madrid . Fee: £60million . Man United appearances: 5 . Man United goals: 3 . Ferguson admitted Manchester United needed to spend in order to reinforce the squad this summer. The Red Devils broke the British transfer record to land Real Madrid wideman Di Maria in a massive £60million deal and Ferguson believes big fees are part and parcel of modern day football. 'That's the way the game is going today with fees like £86m for Gareth Bale,' said Ferguson. 'I think when you can identify ability like that needed by Manchester United, they have the resources to do that. They are fees I never quite equalled but nonetheless they were needing quite a big injection this year.' Angel di Maria cost Manchester United £60million when he arrived from Real Madrid during the summer . RADAMEL FALCAO . Former club: Monaco . Fee: Season-long loan . Man United appearances: 4 . Man United goals: 1 . One of the most lethal strikers in world football, Radamel Falcao's arrival - and the prospect of the Colombia sta playing up front with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie - certainly got United fans excited. However, having missed the World Cup through injury and lacking fitness, Ferguson believes the club made the correct decision in loaning the Monaco frontman rather than signing him permanently. 'The big one is Falcao who we're all waiting to see. Obviously, he has fantastic goalscoring ability. He had his injury so getting him on loan is the right thing to do,' said the former United manager. Ferguson believes United made the right decision in loaning Radamel Falcao following his recent injury . DALEY BLIND . Former club: Ajax . Fee: £14million . Man United appearances: 4 . Man United goals: 0 . Ferguson compared Dutchman Blind to fellow midfielder Darren Fletcher and believes the two players share a similar style. Ferguson said: 'Daley Blind is one of those common-sense footballers that make up a team. He's probably a version of Darren Fletcher of a few years ago, that type of player. 'He's a good professional with common sense to his game. He keeps it simple and protects the defenders and the attacking midfield players in his role.' Daley Blind is a good professional with common sense, according to former United boss Ferguson . ANDER HERRERA . Former club: Athletic Bilbao . Fee: £29million . Man United appearances: 4 . Man United goals: 2 . Ferguson is a big admirer of Ander Herrera and revealed the Spanish midfielder had been on the radar for quite sometime before finally moving to Old Trafford in the summer. 'Herrera played against us three years ago for (Athletic) Bilbao in the Europa League. In fairness, they gave us a right battering at Old Trafford,' said Ferguson. 'He's a talented young player and we scouted him quite a lot at that time. Obviously I think they tried to get him last year but it fell through for some reason or another. 'He's athletic, quite aggressive actually for a lad who has not got a great frame and he's quite slim but he's quite aggressive and he gets around the pitch.' Ander Herrera, here celebrating scoring against QPR, had long been on the United radar before signing . LUKE SHAW . Former club: Southampton . Fee: £30million . Man United appearances: 2 . Man United goals: 0 . Man United attempted to sign left back Shaw long before the youngster made his Premier League debut for Southampton. The 19-year-old, who played in England's final group game at the World Cup, became the most expensive teenager when he eventually signed for Manchester United in a £31m deal shortly after the summer tournament in Brazil. 'The signing of Shaw was the one we tried to get when he was 16 years of age,' said Ferguson. 'They wouldn't sell him to us but they always said we'd be first to know if they ever did.' 'Of course, Ed Woodward has carried that through and we got him for, I think it was £30m. He's a talented boy, a good footballer who likes to get forward all the time.' Man United attempted to sign left back Luke Shaw from Southampton when he was just 16 years old . MARCOS ROJO . Former club: Sporting Lisbon . Fee: £16million . Man United appearances: 4 . Man United goals: 0 . Argentina defender Rojo, 24, impressed Ferguson during the World Cup and can play in a number of position across the backline. Ferguson said: 'Rojo, the Argentinian boy, I watched him at the World Cup, I thought he did really well for them and I think he's capable of playing either left side as a wing back if you like or as a centre back.'

"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that he is confident that 'social stability' can be preserved in Hong Kong and insisted that Beijing won't change its 'one country, two systems' approach to running the territory. Li met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Friday as thousands of protesters arrived for a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong - reviving the ongoing civil disobedience movement. Li said that preserving the 'long-term prosperity and stability' of Hong Kong is not just in China's interest but in that of the residents of the former British colony. Scroll down for video . Resurgence: Protesters gathered in their thousands on the streets of Hong Kong on Friday. The government has repeatedly urged protesters to withdraw from the streets and allow the city to return to normal . Solidarity: Following a week of waning support for the pro-democracy movement, Hong Kong residents flooded the streets in the centre of the city on Friday night. Yesterday the government called off talks with protesters . Keeping busy: Protesters check their laptops and phones as they wait on the streets of Hong Kong, the city's iconic skyscrapers in the background. They are demanding a greater say in choosing the city's leader . Speaking through an interpreter, he said the territory's government will protect inhabitants from 'injury or material damage.' Merkel said she hopes demonstrations remain peaceful. His announcement came as thousands of protesters flooded a main road in Hong Kong for a pro-democracy rally late Friday. The renewed support revived the civil disobedience movement a day after the government called off talks with student leaders. The resurgence came after a week that saw flagging support for the protests, which have blocked off main roads and streets in three of Hong Kong's busiest areas for the last two weeks. Some of the roads have reopened to traffic, but a main thoroughfare through the heart of the business district remains occupied.

Resolute: Speaking through an interpreter at a press conference in Germany on Friday, Li Keqiang, pictured with Mrs Merkel, said the territory's government will protect inhabitants from 'injury or material damage' Meanwhile, Taiwan's President used the country's National Day celebrations to urge mainland China to embrace democracy, starting with Hong Kong. President Ma Ying-jeou said Taiwan gave 'strong support' for the people of Hong Kong's struggle for the democratic election of their local government. Drawing on an ancient Chinese proverb, the Taiwanese leader and Kuomintang Party (KMT) chairman said China's 1.3 billion people 'wish to enjoy greater democracy and rule of law.' Pointedly, he said 'such a desire has never been a monopoly of the West, but is the right of all humankind.' He also suggested that Beijing should approach political reform today in the way it embraced early economic reforms three decades ago. China and Taiwan have been ruled by rival governments since 1949 when China's Civil War ended. Renewed support: Premier Li Keqiang insisted that Beijing won't change its 'one country, two systems' approach to running the territory as thousands attended a rally outside government headquarters (pictured) Determined: Billionaire and pro-democracy supporter Jimmy Lai, pictured centre, joined protesters on the streets of Admiralty, near the government offices, on Friday night . United: Men and women dressed in suits came straight from their offices in the city's financial district to join in a pro-democracy rally on Friday night. Many of those gathered were students, some wearing school uniform . Students and activists gathered on the streets of Hong Kong are demanding a greater say in choosing the city's leader have vowed to stay until the government responds. The government has repeatedly urged protesters to withdraw from the streets and allow the city to return to normal. When the government cancelled the talks, it said grounds for dialogue had been 'severely undermined' by the students' call for more people to occupy streets. Student leaders say it was up to the government to resolve the crisis. Alex Chow, from the Federation of Students, one of the groups involved in the demonstration said: 'If they do not give a just, reasonable answer to all the occupiers, there is no reason to persuade people to retreat.' Crowds gathering in the city's Admiralty district, near the city's government headquarters, chanted 'Our Hong Kong, Ours to Save.' Deadlock: Yesterday, Hong Kong government officials called off planned talks to negotiate with protesters while student groups organising the resistance insist that it is their responsibility to resolve the stalemate . Connected: A young pro-democracy protester  does his homework on a table set up in the middle of one of Hong Kong's busiest thoroughfares. One schoolgirl said they were willing to 'stay for a year' if they needed to . Many of those in the main protest zone were young people, including secondary school pupils in uniforms, but there were also office workers who came straight from work. One schoolgirl, Natalie Or, said: 'We don't want to see a government that treats people this way, where thousands can protest for weeks on the street and not get any response at all. She added: 'Maybe they think if they keep delaying people will disperse on their own, but my friends and I aren't going anywhere. I'll come for months, I'll stay for a year, I'll stay for as long as it takes.' Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets as part of the protests that began on September 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017. Waning: The renewed support on Friday night comes after a week which saw the city regain some normality - with civil servants returning to work at the city's schools reopening . Challenge: The Chinese premier insisted that maintaining 'social stability' in the territory was in the interest of both the Chinese government and the residents of the former British colony. Above, protesters on Friday . Barricade: Some of the roads have reopened to traffic, but a main thoroughfare through the heart of the business district remains occupied. Above, a barrier across a road in the busy Causeway Bay district . Beijing said a 1,200-member committee stacked with pro-government elites should nominate two or three leadership candidates before the public votes. Protesters say this gives them no real choice and do not amount to genuine democracy. Earlier this week, student demonstrators said they have taken early steps to begin talks with the government on their demands for wider political reforms, but the government has since cancelled any talks. The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Beijing since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The protesters are also demanding the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader, but he has refused to step down.","Li Keqiang insisted 'social stability' was in the interest of territory's residents .

"One of hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s top henchmen was able to skip bail and flee to Syria because of police blunders. Siddhartha Dhar, 31, disappeared less than 24 hours after being freed on police bail by Scotland Yard detectives investigating Choudary’s inner circle. They asked him to surrender his passport under strict conditions designed to prevent him promoting al-Muhajiroun, the banned extremist group founded by the fanatic preacher. Scroll down for video . Siddhartha  Dhar, circled, disappeared only 24 hours after being released on police bail, the follower of Anjem Choudary, centre, took a coach to Paris with his family before travelling on to Syria . But instead, the Islamic convert, known as Abu Rumaysah, took a coach from London to Paris and headed to the Islamic State war zone with his young family. Last night outraged critics said it beggared belief that a high-profile terrorist suspect could slip through the grasp of police. Dhar, a darling of TV interviewers repeatedly given a platform on the BBC to promote his radical views, had publicly stated that he wanted to live under the Islamic State. Just weeks before his arrest, he told one interviewer that he was willing to renounce his British citizenship if it meant he was allowed to travel. He was a key member of al-Muhajiroun and offshoot groups such as the Shariah Project, masterminding ‘roadshows’ in London that aimed to recruit troubled youngsters to Islam. It was at one of these that he is believed to have met, and possibly mentored, Michael Adebolajo, one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Dhar and nine other men, including Choudary, were held in raids in London and the Midlands in September on suspicion of supporting al-Muhajiroun. Dhar was among  nine men including Choudary, right, held and questioned by police in September . They were also questioned on suspicion of encouraging terrorism before being released on bail and ordered to return to police stations in December. Police wanted to impose strict bail conditions to prevent them associating with each other, promoting extremism or going overseas. But it can now be revealed that Dhar fled to Syria with his wife and four young children the day after he was released. The details emerged at a bail hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in which Choudary and other suspects demanded the return of their identity documents. Asked why Dhar was not in court, prosecutor Luke Ponte said he boarded a coach for Paris on September 27. He said: ‘He failed to comply with the conditions to surrender his travel documents to police. It’s my understanding that he is no longer in the jurisdiction and that he is currently in Syria.’ The court refused to hand back the identity documents. Former shadow home secretary David Davis said it ‘beggars belief’ that Dhar could escape so easily. ‘To allow him to surrender his own passport, rather than take it off him, seems at best careless and at worse a terrible error of judgment,’ he added. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Siddhartha Dhar was arrested in September with eight other men .

"Japan is braced for torrential rain and 120mph winds as Super Typhoon Vongfong sweeps north towards the country's southern islands. The storm, which will be Japan's second typhoon in a week, was moving extremely slowly on Friday afternoon - raising the risk of landslides and flooding when it makes landfall this weekend. Satellite images taken of Vongfong, which means 'wasp' in Cantonese, suggest that the eye of the hurricane is approximately 50 miles wide. Scroll down for video . Striking: Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is currently serving as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station, tweeted this striking picture of Vongfong - swirling across the ocean . Approach: Waves smashing the shores of the island of Okinawa, southern Japan, show waves up to 50ft high . Threatening: Infrared satellite images suggest that the eye of the hurricane is approximately 50 miles wide . Vongfong is currently following the path of Phanfone, a typhoon that slammed the mainland on Monday, disrupting transport and prompting evacuation advisories for hundreds of thousands of people . Earlier in the day, Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is currently serving as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station, tweeted a picture of Vongfong, and said: 'I’ve seen many from here, but none like this.' His striking shot shows thick white clouds swirling across the ocean. At one point the typhoon rivalled last year's devastating typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, which killed more than 6,000 people in the Philippines alone when it struck in December last year. Vongfong is expected to weaken further as it crosses the open ocean. There have already been reports of waves that are up to 50ft high. 'There is no question that it is an extremely large, extremely powerful typhoon,' an official at Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. 'It's the strongest storm we've had this year, definitely, although it has lost some strength from its peak.' It was likely to be closest to Okinawa, an island chain 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo, and the home of the largest contingent of U.S. troops in Japan, late on Saturday or early on Sunday. Dangerous: Waves batter the coast in Tamagusuku, Nanjo city on the southern island of Okinawa. The typhoon is expected to make landfall at some point this weekend . Deadly: This satellite image from NASA shows the eye of Super Typhoon Vongfong in the Philippine Sea.  At one point the typhoon rivalled last year's devastating typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people . Slow moving: The creeping speed of the typhoon raises the risk of landslides and floods once it makes landfall . Television broadcast images of residents of Minami Daitojima, an island southeast of Okinawa, boarding up windows ahead of the storm. Government officials were set to meet on Friday night to coordinate their response, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference. Suga said: 'We are calling on all citizens to pay close attention to weather reports and respond promptly if the authorities advise them to evacuate.' The typhoon was expected to weaken as it moved north, however, and likely to hit land on Sunday on the westernmost main island of Kyushu, before moving northeast towards Japan's largest main island of Honshu, where it is likely to weaken into a tropical storm. Tokyo was set for heavy rain, at the worst. Tropical Storm Risk, which tracks typhoons, labelled Vongfong as a Category 4 typhoon, set to weaken to Category 2 before hitting Kyushu. There are no nuclear plants on Okinawa, but there are two on Kyushu and one on Shikoku island, which borders Kyushu and may be hit. All are currently halted in line with national policy. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011, is on the other side of the country, which is likely to see rain at the worst. Vongfong is currently following the path of Phanfone, a typhoon that slammed the mainland on Monday, disrupting transport and prompting evacuation advisories for hundreds of thousands of people. Seven people were killed, including three U.S. airmen swept out to sea and a man who died while surfing. It was unusual for two powerful typhoons to hit Japan in such quick succession, the JMA official said, but added the overall number of such storms had not increased. 'It's more coincidence than anything else, mainly due to the way the high pressure systems are located off Japan this year.'","Vongfong, Japan's second typhoon in a week, is sweeping north towards the country's southern islands .

"With shows like Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor dominating Saturday night TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking we were a nation of crooners. But not in Northampton - where a band has axed carols from its Christmas church show because people are 'too embarrassed to sing in public'. The 50-piece Northampton Concert Band scrapped the tunes after audience members felt 'press-ganged' last year into singing O Come All Ye Faithfull and Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. All is calm: Northampton Concert Band (pictured) has axed carols from its Christmas show - because people don't like public singing. Member Brian Crutchley said: 'We want people to feel less press-ganged' Instead, the award-winning group's Christmas concert will feature two hours of its trumpets, bassoons and trombones with no call for the 160-strong audience to take part. Brian Crutchley, who plays tuba and arranges the concerts, took the decision after an online survey last year found only 40 per cent of attendees wanted the carols again. 'We used to play at carol services and when we played our concert last year we pretty much stuck to the same formula,' the 43-year-old software developer said. 'People didn't seem to be that enthusiastic about the singing so I thought, let's try dropping the audience carols. 'We'll still be playing a short medley of Christmas songs and people are more than welcome to sing from their seats, but it's not at all like last year. 'We want people to feel more relaxed and feel less threatened and press-ganged into singing. Repertoire: Instead the concert will include instrumental versions of songs such as Fairytale of New York by the Northampton Concert Band (pictured), which began in 1919 and has around 50 players . He added: 'It seems it's been quite a talking point locally. We were joking about whether we'd have protesters singing carols outside.' The concert will be held on December 13 on Northampton's Holy Sepulchre Church and stars the 95-year-old wind and brass ensemble, which has won several prizes. The band won gold awards at the 2008 and 2010 National Wind Band Festival and this year took the platinum award at a regional competition. Its move was announced on the band's website, where musical director Stephen Bell wrote: 'We will not be short-changing our audience. They'll still get two hours of top entertainment.' Save the date: The strictly carol-singing-free concert is planned for Northampton's Holy Sepulchre Church . This year's repertoire will still include some Christmas favourites - including The Pogues' Fairytale of New York and The Snowman theme Walking in the Air - but there will be no forced singing along. Less obvious pieces include Johann Strauss' 1848 Radetzky March and Sandpaper Ballet, a 1950s dance by Leroy Anderson. Mr Crutchley said on the website: 'I can understand that a lot people do not enjoy singing in public, even with such a great band accompanying them. 'With the feedback we've had from our survey we thought we'd drop carols from the concert altogether, which leaves room for other popular music for our audience to listen to. 'If people want to sing carols they're better off going to a carol service.'","Decision taken by award-winning 50-piece Northampton Concert Band .

"Ruling: Liberal Democrats said blind or partially-sighted pedestrians would be vulnerable . Silent but potentially deadly electric cars will have to be fitted with artificial ‘sound generators’ so blind and partially sighted pedestrians can hear them coming, the European Parliament voted today. It is part of new EU legislation which will also require conventional cars and lorries with petrol and diesel engines to make 25 per cent less noise. The MEPs voted to introduce mandatory ‘acoustic vehicle alerting systems’ (AVAS) – sounding like a conventional engine - to all new electric and hybrid cars to protect vulnerable road users. It follows lobbying from British MEPs and campaign groups including Guide Dogs for the Blind. Electric cars and plug-in hybrid cars such as the all-electric BMWi3 or the Toyota Prius currently emit very little sound when running on electric power only. Campaigners say this particularly dangerous for partially-sighted and blind pedestrians. Earlier proposals from the European Commission called for the installation of an artificial sound system to be done on a voluntary basis only. But Liberal Democrat MEPs successfully introduced an amendment making this a mandatory requirement for all electric and hybrid vehicles. Following the vote manufacturers in the EU will have five years to comply with the new rules. The European Parliament reported that  ‘it is important to provide protection to blind and other vulnerable people through the installation of appropriate vehicle alerting systems in electric vehicles.’ It noted: ’The Parliament and Council have agreed that such systems should be mandatory.’ Clean energy: Electric cars are being used more as councils install charging points such as this one in London . The European Commission said: ‘So-called ""Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems"" requirements shall ensure that only adequate sound generating devices are used. ‘The fitting as such will be mandatory for all electric and hybrid electric vehicles after a transitional period of five years. 'This will increase road safety and undoubtedly help avoiding road-accident injuries.’ Liberal Democrat European environment spokesman Chris Davies said: ’Quiet electric cars could become a common sight on our roads in years to come but we have to ensure that this doesn't jeopardise the safety of blind and partially-sighted people. ‘The acoustic warning devices will make a sound very similar to that of cars with a regular combustion engine so that people will be able to clearly hear these vehicles, allowing them to judge how safe a road is to cross. Silent: Models such as the Toyota Prius currently make almost no noise when running on electric power alone . ‘Installing sound generators will ensure that all pedestrians are able to hear these vehicles and cross the road safely. ‘By working at an EU level we have been able to place this requirement on all car manufacturers and prevent needless accidents in future.’ The introduction of artificial engine noise to silent electric cars came as the European Parliament voted to decrease noise by four decibels for conventional passenger cars, vans, buses and coaches, and by three decibels for trucks. The European Commission said: 'Altogether, these measures will reduce vehicle noise nuisance by some 25 per cent.'","Major ruling was prompted by Liberal Democrats in European Parliament .

"The victims of the deadly Japanese volcano eruption earlier this autumn spent their final moments taking photographs of the catastrophic event, local media reports. More than  half of the 56 bodies recovered from the peak of Mount Ontake were found clutching mobile phones with photos of the deadly lava and ash on them. The September eruption on the central Japanese island of Honshu, left at least 57 dead, and a further six people remain unaccounted for. Scroll down for video . Final photograph: Izumi Noguchi took this incredible photograph of a huge cloud of ash from Japanese volcano Mount Ontake just moments before he was killed . More than half of the victims were still holding their smartphones, while others were found to have taken snaps of the ash and lava with cameras or phones just moments before they died. Among the victims of the volcano was 59-year-old hiker Izumi Noguchi, whose body was found near Mount Ontake's summit shrine compound. Search and rescue teams recovering his body discovered his camera and among the photographs he had taken were images of a huge cloud of ash creeping ever closer to him following the eruption. His wife Hiromi opted to make the images public as a tribute to Mr Noguchi's memory, but said ’I wish he had fled instead of taking pictures,’ the Guardian reports. Another hiker Hideomi Takahashi, 41, was found near the summit with his iPhone still working. Last sight: Izumi Noguchi's images show the minutes immediately after the volcano on Mount Ontake erupted on September 27 this year .

Another hiker Hideomi Takahashi, 41, was found near the summit with his iPhone still working. A family friend posted the photographs online after Mr Takahashi’s funeral, telling local media that the iPhone contained at least six photos from what would be the last few minutes of Mr Takahashi’s life. Most of the bodies were found near Mount Ontake's summit, where many climbers were resting or having lunch. Some bodies were retrieved from a trail at a slightly lower elevation. Experts say hikers near the summit might have been hit by rocks flying as fast as 190 miles per hour. Most of the ash fell in the first hour of the explosion, according to the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute. Survivors said they fled for their lives as rocks and debris rained down on them while they struggled with hot air and ash hitting their face. Deadly: The eruption on Mount Ontake, located on the central Japanese island of Honshu, on September 27 this year, left at least 57 dead, and a further six people remain unaccounted for . Medical experts who have examined some of the nearly 70 injured have said most had bruises, cuts and bone fractures on their back, an apparent sign they were hit by rocks flying out of the volcano. Some of the injured reportedly had damage to their lungs and other organs due to the impact of rocks hitting them. The eruption at Mount Ontake, located on the central Japanese island of Honshu, around 120miles southwest of Tokyo, caught hikers by surprise. Seismologists have said that increased seismic activity had been detected at Ontake, one of 47 active volcanoes in Japan that are under 24-hour monitoring, but that nothing signaled such a big eruption. The death toll is the highest from a volcanic eruption in Japan's postwar history, exceeding the 43 people killed in the 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen in southern Japan. Ontake, Japan's second-highest active volcano, last had a minor eruption seven years ago. Researchers say predicting a steam-driven explosion is especially difficult - and even harder with limited information about a peak's past volcanic activity.","More than half of Mount Ontake victims were still clutching phones .

"Militants from the Islamic State launched an attack on Kobane from Turkey for the first time today - indicating that the Syrian border town is now totally surrounded. The clashes, which killed at least 30 fighters, began when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives while driving an armoured vehicle across the border, Kurdish officials have said. Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said the terror group 'used to attack the town from three sides. Today, they are attacking from four sides'. Turkey denied the fighters had used its territory for the raid. Scroll down for video . Militants from the Islamic State launched an attack on Kobane from Turkey for the first time - indicating that the Syrian border town is now totally surrounded. Above, fighters line up against the terror group in Kobane . A Turkish government statement today confirmed that one of the suicide attacks involved a bomb-loaded vehicle that detonated on the Syrian side of the border. But it denied claims that the vehicle had crossed into Kobane through Turkey, which would be a first for the extremist fighters. It said: 'Claims that the vehicle reached the border gate by crossing through Turkish soil are a lie. 'Contrary to certain claims, no Turkish official has made any statement claiming that the bomb-loaded vehicle had crossed in from Turkey. 'The security forces who are on alert in the border region have ...  taken all necessary measures.' It is understood that a total of four suicide bombers blew themselves up amid the clashes, which killed at least 30 fighters. The most recent assault began when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives while driving an armoured vehicle across the border, Kurdish officials have said. Above, the aftermath of a truck bomb in Kobane . Witnesses reported seeing thick black smoke rise over Kobane during the attack. The sound of heavy gunfire echoed through the surrounding hills as armored vehicles took up positions on the border. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said heavy fighting also took place southwest of the town where the Islamic State group brought in tanks to reinforce their fighters. Mustafa Bali, a Kobane-based activist, said  that Islamic State group fighters have taken positions in the grain silos on the Turkish side of the border and from there are launching attacks toward the border crossing point. The Turkish government denied claims that the vehicle had crossed into Kobane through Turkey, which would be a first for the extremists. Above, Islamic State militants reached this roundabout at the entrance to the town . He added that the U.S.-led coalition launched an airstrike Saturday morning on the eastern side of the town. He said: 'It is now clear that Turkey is openly cooperating with Daesh,' using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. The Islamic State group began its Kobane offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against the militants. Kurdish slowly have been advancing slowly in Kobane since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months. The Observatory said the latest fighting killed at least eight Kurdish fighters and 17 jihadis.","Suicide bomber drove car across border from Turkey, officials have said .

"A video that appeared to show a young Syrian boy running through sniper fire to rescue a young girl is a fake, it has emerged. The boy was hailed a hero after the one-minute clip, thought to be filmed in Yabroud, a countryside town 50 miles from Damascus, was posted online earlier this week. But a group of Norwegian filmmakers have today revealed that the footage was in fact shot on location in Malta using professional actors. Scroll down for videos . Faked: This picture shows the Norwegian filmmakers on the set of the video, which was watched by millions . Heroic: The original video, uploaded earlier this week, appeared to show a boy running through sniper fire . Behind the camera: The one-minute clip was shot on location in Malta, on a set used for films such as Troy . Lars Klevberg, a director based in Oslo, said that he wrote the dramatic script after watching news coverage of the ongoing conflict in Syria. The 34-year-old said that he wanted to present the film as authentic in order to 'spur debate' and 'spark action' on behalf of 'innocent children all over the world who are affected by war'. He told the BBC that he was not uncomfortable about potentially deceiving viewers with the video - which has been watched more than 3.6million times on YouTube. He added that his hope was that people would react 'with hope' when they saw the video, which was filmed on a set used for blockbusters such as Gladiator and Troy. The clip shows the boy coming under fire as he dashes towards a car-wreck ahead. As he runs shots are fired at him and he appears to fake being shot in the chest and falling over. Professionals: The boy who pretended to be shot in the clip, above, is actually an actor from Malta . Duped: The filmmakers said that they wanted to spark a debate about children living in war zones . A second later he gets up and disappears behind the car before emerging hand in hand with the terrified girl who has been hiding from fire. He appears to struggle to convince her to run to safety, but the girl, dressed in pink, eventually runs with him as more shots are fired. Mr Klevberg said that, while the film aimed to appear authentic, the children surviving gunshots was supposed to send small clues that it was not real. 'Bravery': The video appeared to show the boy rescuing a girl hiding behind a car - but she was safely on set . Dramatic: The footage, which received thousands of pounds in government funding, was posted this week . No regrets: Director Lars Klevberg said he did not feel uncomfortable about potentially deceiving millions . Blockbuster: The set where the Norwegian film was filmed was used for movies including Gladiator, above . He said that their financial backers, including the Norwegian Film Institute (NFI) and Arts Council Norway, supported their intentions. Ase Meyer, short film commissioner for the NFI, told the BBC: 'It was not a cynical way to get attention. They had honest motivations . 'I was surprised people thought it was real.

"Radamel Falcao's agent Jorge Mendes has reiterated that his client would be better off at Manchester United under former manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The Colombia international has managed only four goals in 16 Premier League appearances since arriving at Old Trafford on an expensive loan deal in the summer.

"Plump turkeys in butcher shop windows. Harvest displays of pumpkin and corn. Sandwich boards describing groaning feasts. Thanksgiving isn't a holiday in Britain, but you might be forgiven for being fooled. It's not hard to find someone to talk turkey, never mind sell you one. That's because there are so many Americans in Britain these days that dozens of businesses have started selling the goods they need to celebrate. Festive season: Seen through the window, Danny Lidgate places a turkey on display at his butchers shop in Holland Park, which is dressed for Christmas but doing a roaring trade in Thanksgiving treats . Greg Klaes, a Detroit native who used to teach science on U.S. military base schools, started growing pumpkins 30 years ago so his students could carve Halloween jack-o-lanterns. This year, his Oxfordshire farm is selling 1,322lbs a week, filling harvest decorations and pumpkin pies. 'I believe firmly that there's a real integration of the societies,' he said. 'There's a lot of Americans and a lot people want to share their cultures.' Mr Klaes is one of some 200,000 UK residents who were born in the U.S., according to census data. That's 26 per cent more than in 2001. In Kensington and Chelsea, an upmarket London borough that is home to many bankers and celebrities, U.S.-born residents make up 5 per cent of the population. And since there's no other holiday that's quite like Thanksgiving, businesses big and small are finding ways to get in on the celebrations. Dozens of restaurants are putting on spreads. Texas-based Whole Foods has turned its store on Kensington High Street into a one-stop holiday shopping center beginning with a sidewalk chalkboard that welcomes customers with the message 'We are here to make your Thanksgiving epic.' One-stop feast shop: Mr Lidgate holds up one of his turkey's from behind the counter at his butchers . Even the mainstream British grocery chain Waitrose is getting involved, although in a smaller way. A few blocks down the High Street in a store that's already decked out with red-and-green Christmas decorations, Waitrose has a small 'Happy Thanksgiving' display, complete with a picture of a pumpkin wearing a buckled Pilgrim hat. Offerings include Ocean Spray cranberry sauce, Carnation evaporated milk and Libby's pumpkin, alongside British icons like Paxo Sage and Onion stuffing. Turkey producer Bramble Farm in Surrey has been around since the 1930s and sold 100 or so special birds during the Thanksgiving season 15 years ago. Farm owner Derek Joy says he now sells 4,500. It's not just Americans who are buying. Mr Joy said he has started getting calls from British families who want to put on feasts for their American work colleagues - so they don't feel lonesome on the big day. As he is most definitely British, Mr Joy finds it strange when he is asked to dispense advice on a quintessentially American holiday, but he tries to keep it straightforward. 'I'd say just treat it like Christmas day,' Mr Joy said. 'And instead of doing a pudding, just buy a pumpkin pie.' Big bird: Mr Lidgate ties a turkey. He says Americans keep gobbling up the broad-breasted bronze turkey . There's a lot of Americana in London, especially when it comes to food. In trendy Notting Hill, made famous to Americans by the Julia Roberts film of the same name, there's even a store catering to the expats. Aptly named the American Food Store, replete with sign decorated with the Stars and Stripes, it caters to those in need of Hostess Twinkies, Pepperidge Farms Goldfish and Campbell's Soup. For the holiday they've added Libby's canned pumpkin, Stove Top stuffing and graham cracker pie crusts. And for the really upscale, there's always Lidgate's. The ever-cheerful Danny Lidgate, whose 160-year-old shop has been in the same family for five generations, says Americans gobble up the big broad-breasted heritage Kelly Bronze turkeys he stocks. Put simply, business is very good. For those who don't understand the holiday, Lidgate's offers this primer on its website: 'Turkeys feature prominently in the history of the Pilgrim fathers, and it is believed that many Puritan families owed their survival to wild turkeys.' Never mind that those Pilgrim fathers left Britain fleeing religious persecution. That's all past. Everyone is friends now. Mr Lidgate says from the time he was a kid working at the shop, he's known Thanksgiving was special. 'It's like a mini-Christmas,' he said. 'It's an energy we love.' Desserts too: He sprinkles icing sugar on a homemade pumpkin pie in the kitchen behind his butchers shop . Americans can expect to pay more than they would for similar fixings back home. Lidgate's is taking orders for Thanksgiving turkeys up to 26.5lbs, enough to feed 20 people. The price: £198. Britain doesn't really have a holiday like Thanksgiving. There are harvest celebrations, but no single event compares to the mammoth festival of food and football that dominates American thought. B . ritons know about it, though, and in a world of multinational companies, they will expect their colleagues to be away on Thursday. 'I'm personally quite envious of your Thanksgiving.' Mr Joy said. 'It's about family and friends. It's all about being proud to be an American. It's all about not giving presents, but it's about your presence. It's about being there and being part of a family.' 'I think that's pretty cool,' he said before checking himself. 'That sounds very American, doesn't it?'","There are more than 200,000 U.S.-born people living in the United Kingdom .
Their numbers have risen by more than 26 per cent since 2001 .

"West Ham teenage star Oscar Borg is subject to a tug-of-war between the England and Turkey national teams. The 17-year-old was born and grew up in Surrey but alerted the Turkish Football Association to his eligibility when they discovered his grandmother was born in Istanbul. Since then representatives from the English and Turkish FAs have contacted his parents to declare their interest in him. Borg has been dubbed the next Gareth Bale for his ferocious pace down the left flank playing at full-back or on the wing. West Ham United youngster Oscar Borg is wanted by both England and Turkey on an international level . He went on trial at Manchester United last summer, when he was 16, during which he played in the Milk Cup in Ireland for them where he impressed in matches against CSKA Moscow, County Armagh, Gold Coast Academy and Vendee. He also featured in an Under 18 Premier League fixture against Bolton at Manchester United's Carrington training ground. But a move collapsed when United were unable to agree a suitable compensation package, understood to be around £220,000, with West Ham. Aston Villa have been monitoring him long-term while Chelsea and Fulham have also been keeping tabs on his situation, though the player is currently happy in East London. Borg joined West Ham when he was spotted by their scouts playing an Under 13 match for AFC Wimbledon and joined them aged 12. At 15 he already earned a called up to West Ham's Under 21 side and signed a two-year scholarship contract with them last September which runs until June 2016. Borg is yet to represent a national team at youth level but his impressive form has sparked a battle between England and Turkey for his services. One to watch: Borg has been likened to Gareth Bale because of his ferocious pace from left-midfield .","Oscar Borg was born in Surrey but his Grandmother is Turkish born .

"The chief executive of Emirates has claimed that 'control was taken of' Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 before it vanished. Sir Tim Clark said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of MH370 is an 'unexplained mystery' His airline, Emirates, operates almost 130 Boeing 777 aircraft, similar to the doomed jet. Flight MH370 vanished in March with 239 passengers and crew on board. Scroll down for video . Emirates CEO and president Sir Tim Clark, pictured, said he believes MH370 was 'under control until the end' The Boeing 777-200, similar to this one, vanished without a trace in March with 239 passengers and crew . Despite a massive multi-national search operation, not even 'a seat cushion' from the jet has been found . In an interview with German magazine Spiegel, Clark said: 'MH 370 remains one of the great aviation mysteries. Personally, I have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on. At the most, it might then make an appearance on National Geographic as one of aviation's great mysteries. We mustn't allow this to happen. We must know what caused that airplane to disappear. The flight, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, has been missing since March 8 after veering dramatically off course. Air Traffic Control lost all contact with the aircraft soon after it took off. Air accident investigators are trying to determine why the aircraft's transponders - which provide accurate location, speed and heading information - were switched off. For Sir Tim, there is only one logical conclusion as to what happened to the highly advanced and reliable passenger jet. 'MH 370 was, in my opinion, under control, probably until the very end.' The current search is concentrating on an area off the coast of Western Australia . The Fugro Discovery search vessel, pictured will spend a further year searching for the aircraft's wreckage . He said: 'My own view is that probably control was taken of that airplane. It's anybody's guess who did what. We need to know who was on the plane in the detail that obviously some people do know. We need to know what was in the hold of the aircraft. And we need to continue to press all those who were involved in the analysis of what happened for more information. 'I do not subscribe to the view that the Boeing 777, which is one of the most advanced in the world and has the most advanced communication platforms, needs to be improved with the introduction of some kind of additional tracking system. MH 370 should never have been allowed to enter a non-trackable situation.' Sir Tim said it would be unlikely that the aircraft's pilots would have been able to disable all the jet's tracking equipment. The aircraft was fitted with a highly advanced system called ACARS - Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System - which provides constant real-time information to the airline's engineering staff. This system monitors the aircraft's engines and can notify engineers of possible faults even before the pilots are aware of the situation. Malaysian Airlines lost contact with this system when the jet vanished. But for Sir Tim, one of the most baffling elements of the mystery is the complete lack of any physical evidence of where the aircraft landed. He said not even a 'seat cushion' has been recovered. He said: 'There hasn't been one overwater incident in the history of civil aviation -- apart from Amelia Earhart in 1939 -- that has not been at least 5 or 10 percent trackable. But MH 370 has simply disappeared. For me, that raises a degree of suspicion. I'm totally dissatisfied with what has been coming out of all of this.' The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has resumed in a remote area of the Indian Ocean – more than six months after the jet disappeared. A ship with specialised sonar equipment, the GO Phoenix, is one of three that will spend up to a year hunting for the wreckage. It recently arrived in the search area 1,100 miles west of Australia. The other two ships will join the hunt later this month. Flight 370 vanished on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 passengers and crew aboard. The search has been on hold for four months so crews could map the seabed in the search zone. Investigators analysed transmissions between the plane and a satellite to narrow down the search area. However, a search zone described as the ‘priority area’ is still huge – an arc covering 23,000 square miles, which is the size of Croatia.","Sir Tim Clark questions current thinking about the fate of flight MH370 .

"The British banker - identified as 29-year-old Rurik Jutting - has been charged with the double murder of two prostitutes in Hong Kong. Mr Jutting, who attended Cambridge University, was arrested by police after the bodies of two women were discovered in his up-market apartment in the early hours of yesterday morning. One of the victims, whose naked body was reportedly found tied up in a suitcase on the 31st-floor balcony, has been identified as 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih from Indonesia, according to reports. The other woman, believed to be aged between 25 and 30, is thought to have worked part-time as a DJ at a local bar, a source told the South China Morning Post. She had suffered a series of knife wounds. Scroll down for video . Rurick Jutting, a Cambridge University graduate, has been named as the suspect of the double murder . Government workers remove the body of a woman who was found dead at a flat in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district in the early hours of this morning. A British man was been arrested in connection with the murders . Both women were found after Mr Jutting, who is understood to have recently left his job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, allegedly called police to his address in Wan Chai - an area that is popular with young and affluent expatriate executives and bankers. It is thought the woman found inside the apartment was attacked shortly before officers arrived. Ms Ningsih, who is believed to have been killed several days before she was found, was identified on Sunday by her cousin, who works as a domestic worker in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post reports. It claimed that she had been arrested on suspicion of breaching her conditions of stay in the territory. Sex toys and cocaine were also reportedly found at the scene, along with a knife that was seized by officers. Mr Jutting's phone is today being examined by police in a bid to identify possible further victims, according to local reports. It is understood that photos of Ms Ningsih, apparently taken after she died, were among roughly 2,000 that officers found on the device. He will appear in court in Hong Kong today while police are said to have placed a 'holding charge' on him. A statement from Hong Kong police said: 'Police today laid a holding charge against a 29-year-old man with two counts of murder. 'Police arrested the man on November 1 in suspected connection with a murder case in which a foreign woman aged between 25 and 30, and another woman were killed. 'The arrestee will appear before Eastern Magistrates' Courts today.' Mr Jutting, who attended Winchester College, an independent boys school in Hampshire, grew up in Chertsey, Surrey, where his family lived in a Grade II listed home.

One neighbour, who remembered Mr Jutting and his brother Auryn as teenagers, said he had been shocked by the news of his arrest. He described the family as 'nice enough' and said they were 'quiet and kept themselves to themselves'. When Mr Jutting left to continue his studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied law and history, his parents, Helen and Graham, moved into a Grade II listed manor in nearby Cobham. The Victorian home, which was built in 1861, is set behind wrought iron gates and was the inspiration for Ernest Shepard's illustration of Kenneth Grahame's children's classic The Wind in the Willows. Rurik Jutting appears to have worked in Structured Capital Markets at Barclays in London between 2008 and 2010, when he took a job with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He was moved to the bank's Hong Kong office, where he worked as a trader in the Structured Equity Finance & Trading department, in July last year. A porter at the smart Wapping apartment where he lived before moving to China described him as unfriendly and uncommunicative. 'He was a single guy, he was just one of those that kept his head down,' he said. 'He didn't say 'hi' or anything like that. He was a bit of a loner. 'He did used to have a girlfriend - they lived together for a while then they broke up and she moved out. 'They seemed happy together, holding hands, smiling and laughing. 'He seemed quite normal, I can't believe it. He wasn't aggressive, he was a really quiet and calm guy.'

A policeman checks the window (right) in the apartment where the bodies of two women were found . One colleague told the Telegraph that he had apparently vanished from his workplace a week ago. It has also been reported that he resigned from his post days before news of the murders emerged. A spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch confirmed that it had previously employed a man by the same name but would not give more details nor clarify when the person had left the bank. CCTV footage from his apartment block, a 40-storey development of exclusive properties, showed the banker and the other victim returning to the 31st floor shortly after midnight local time yesterday. He allegedly called police to his home at 3.42am, shortly after the woman he was seen with is believed to have been killed. She was found with two wounds to her neck and her throat had been slashed. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Ms Ningsih's body, which was wrapped in a carpet and stuffed inside a black suitcase that measured about three feet by 18 inches, was not found by police until eight hours later.

'She was naked and wrapped in a towel before being stuffed into the suitcase. Her passport was found at the scene.' Wan Chai, the district where the apartment is located, is known for its bustling nightclub scene of 'girly bars,' popular with expatriate men and staffed by sex workers from South East Asia. Police have today been contacting nearby bars in an attempt to find out more about the background of the two murdered women. One resident in the 40-storey block, where most of the residents are expatriates, said he had noticed an unusual smell in recent days.

"A British banker accused of killing two Indonesian women was today ruled fit to stand trial, but there will be a delay of months as prosecutors comb over forensic evidence found with the victims' mutilated bodies in his Hong Kong apartment. Judge Bina Chainrai said Rurik Jutting, a former Bank of America Merrill Lynch employee, was mentally fit to face murder charges after two weeks of examinations at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre. But in a surprise decision, she also agreed to the prosecution's request to delay the trial until July 6 while the police comb through hundreds of pieces of evidence. Scroll down for video . British banker Rurik Jutting (pictured in the back of a prison bus arriving at court) has been declared mentally fit to stand trial over the murders of two prostitutes whose mutliated bodies were found at his Hong Kong flat . Jutting was charged with the murders of Seneng Mujiasih and Sumarti Ningsih after investigators found the bodies of the two women in his upmarket flat, one of them decomposing in a suitcase. He faces life in prison if convicted of the killings. Dressed in the same black T-shirt he had worn when he last appeared in court two weeks ago, the 29-year-old stood impassively in the dock as the judge made her ruling to a packed, but silent, courtroom. Prosecutor Louise Wong told the court that investigators would need 28 weeks to examine some 200 pieces of evidence, including conducting DNA tests. 'We are waiting for the chemists,' Wong told AFP outside the courtroom. Jutting underwent two weeks of examinations at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre . The trader wore the same black T-shirt he had worn when he last appeared in court two weeks ago . Chainrai had originally questioned the uncharacteristically long delay, raising her voice to object that 'the norm is never seven months' after hearing the request. She eventually conceded after Jutting's lawyers said they would not fight the adjournment, during which time he will be held in custody. Acquaintances described high-flying University of Cambridge graduate Jutting as a 'very, very ambitious' and a 'classic banker' who pushed himself academically and athletically. Mujiasih and Ningsih's bodies were discovered after Jutting called police to his flat in the city's Wanchai district in the early hours of November 1. Police are investigating whether they were sex workers after cocaine and sex toys were found in the apartment, just a few streets away from Hong Kong's red-light district where Jutting, until recently a securities trader for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, was reportedly a regular. Seneng was found naked in the living room, with knife wounds on her neck and buttocks. Victims: Seneng Mujiasih, 29, left, was found by police dying with wounds to her throat and buttocks. Officers later found the body of Sumarti Ningsih, 23, right, stuffed in a suitcase on Jutting's balcony . Macabre: Police called to Jutting's flat in J's Residence, pictured, discovered the two dead prostitutes inside . Sumarti's decaying body was found hours later by police, stuffed into a suitcase on the balcony. Investigators believe she was killed on October 27. That same day, Jutting posted on his Facebook page that he was embarking on a 'new journey'. 'Stepping down from the ledge. Burden lifted; new journey begins. Scared and anxious but also excited. The first step is always the hardest,' he wrote. The brutal killings have highlighted the huge wealth divide in Hong Kong, a city known for its famous financial sector and trendy nightlife but where a fifth of the population lives in poverty. Both of the victims, whose bodies have been flown back to Indonesia, formerly worked in Hong Kong as domestic workers. Rights groups say domestic workers face tough challenges in the southern Chinese city, with restrictive laws leaving them vulnerable to abuse and making it difficult to change jobs or move up the social ladder. The case has also sparked a backlash against what some locals say is a culture of excess enjoyed by many Western expatriates who come to work in Hong Kong's financial industry.","Rurik Jutting underwent two weeks of tests at maximum security unit .

Scroll down for video . Die Aktuelle, a women's lifestyle magazine, has come under fire for trying to deceive its readers into thinking this is the first picture of Michael Schumacher since his skiing accident - it is actually from January 26, 2013 . The magazine has been accused of tricking readers into believing this is the first photograph of Schumacher since he sustained brain injuries in a freak skiing accident last December. It claims that stricken Schumacher, 45, is 'pushed on to the terrace by (his wife) Corinna on mild autumn days' in his wheelchair. The photograph was actually taken in St Moritz, Switzerland, on January 26, 2013. The German news magazine Focus branded the cover 'deceptive'. Online publication Motorsport.com said: 'How low can you go? it seems that there is no limit for certain publications. 'The majority of readers will not notice the date of the photograph which is written in small typeface.' The German news website news.de said: 'Die Aktuelle proves once again that for the publication there's no bad taste that's too bad. The sole objective is to increase circulation.'

It was December 29 when he suffered a freak ski accident in the French Alps which left him brain damaged and fighting for his life. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But he lost control and hit a partially-covered rock. He was then catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. His wife Corinna has been a constant presence at his bedside. With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","Die Aktuelle, a women's lifestyle magazine, published controversial cover .

"Ukraine today claimed that a Russian secret services general was killed in fighting in rebel-held Donetsk region amid new signs the so-called ceasefire is under deep strain. If confirmed, he would be the highest ranking Kremlin loss in the bloody conflict and a huge embarrassment for Moscow, which claims its servicemen are not engaged in Ukraine. 'Russian general Sergey Andreychenko is among those killed,' said the National Defence Headquarters in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region. Pro-Russian rebels fire artillery toward Ukrainian positions at Donetsk Sergey Prokofiev International Airport. Ukrainian forces claim to have killed a Russian secret services general in fighting in the rebel-held Donetsk region amid new signs the so-called ceasefire is under deep strain . Several sources claimed he was a commander in the FSB, Russia's domestic secret service. There was no comment from Moscow on the report which claimed Ukrainian Interior Ministry troops 'eliminated' a subversive group in Telmanovo, Donetsk region. A Chechen fighter was also killed, it was claimed. Dnipro-1 battalion commander Yuriy Bereza said: 'The killing of Russian mercenaries and a general is just one of the many operations with a similar outcome. 'There is nothing to be surprised with. The same will happen sooner or later to anyone who dares to come to our land.' Seven civilians died and 17 were injured when shells exploded today near a funeral procession in Mariupol.

"Western secret services were today accused of a cover-up over the shooting down of flight MH17 by a retired chief in Vladimir Putin's military intelligence agency. Retired Lt. Gen. Nikolai Pushkarev - formerly a senior official Russia's notorious secret service, GRU - implied that the aircraft was shot out of the sky by Ukrainian forces. The conspiratorial allegation came as Ukrainian prime minister announced that state subsidies for the eastern territories controlled by pro-Russian separatists will be frozen for an unspecified amount of time. Scroll down for video . Accusations: Retired Lt. Gen. Nikolai Pushkarev - formerly a senior official Russia's notorious secret service, GRU - implied that flight MH17 (pictured) was shot out of the sky by Ukrainian forces . The official investigation into the MH17 disaster in July is still ongoing, but Western sources have pointed the finger at pro-Russian rebels downing the aircraft with a BUK missile. However, Pushkarev claims the investigation is being used to put blame on Russia. 'Western intelligence and the Americans are very well aware of all the details - who shot flight MH17 down, why and what for,' he alleged. They 'manipulate this information and this incident for their own benefit. 'This provocation was organised to lay blame on Russia and force it into sending troops to Ukraine, officially. But the Russian government did not succumb to this provocation'. BAd times: Billions in state subsidies for the territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, including Donetsk, pictured,  will be frozen for an unspecified amount of time . He alleged that the US was trying to spark 'direct military conflict between Russia and Ukraine'. The conspiratorial allegation came as separatist officials in Donetsk claimed eye-witnesses saw a second mysterious aircraft in the sky as the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down in July. 'Onlookers said that immediately after the Boeing had exploded they saw a smaller, grey plane moving in the area of the Boeing's air route, which then disappeared in the clouds.' A source claimed that 'more than 20 onlookers were questioned' in regard to the 'sighting', but did not give more details. Both rebels and Russian officials have previously suggested a Ukrainian aircraft was in the sky, and some have claimed it shot down MH17, killing all 298 people on board. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told a government meeting that $2.6 billion in state support will be held back from rebel-held areas . The source said that testimony on the sightings would be handed to the international Dutch-led probe into the Boeing crash. This follows the announcement by the Ukrainian government that billions in state support for the rebel controlled areas will be held back until further notice. Aging industrial operations in Ukraine's economically depressed but coal-rich east have for many years relied heavily on state subsidies. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told a government meeting that $2.6 billion in state support will be held back from rebel-held areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He did not say what time period that subsidy figure represented. Yatsenyuk said the payment of pensions and government benefits to residents in conflict-stricken parts of the east will resume after separatist forces have surrendered there. The government has not been paying pensions in those areas for several months, but has said back payments will be paid to recipients when the rebels move out. Ukraine's government has blamed Russia for fomenting the last six months of fighting between government forces and separatist fighters in the east. Moscow denies that it supplies rebel fighters with either manpower or military equipment. Yatsenyuk said suspending subsidies to the rebel-occupied areas would cut off a vital source of funding for rebel forces. 'The money we pay into those territories today does not get to the people but is stolen by Russian bandits, and this would be nothing but directly supporting Russian terrorism,' he said. The regions are among the most economically depressed in Ukraine and living standards have slipped further since hostilities erupted. Yatsenyuk said gas and electricity from government-held regions would continue to be supplied to rebel zones. 'Those are our citizens and the government will not allow these people to freeze, as this would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe,' he said. A cease-fire was agreed upon in early September but fighting has still continued. More than 4,000 people have been killed in the region since the conflict began in April, according to UN estimates.","Retired secret service chief said Ukrainian forces shot down MH17 .

"David Cameron has waded into the growing diplomatic row over China's decision to ban a group of MPs  travelling to Hong Kong amid growing political alarm over Beijing's crackdown on democracy protesters. MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee have been warned they will be denied entry if they go ahead with a planned visit to the former British colony. The Prime Minister this morning attacked the decision as 'mistaken and counter productive', adding: 'It only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong rather than diminishing concerns.' Scroll down for video . Pro-democracy protesters occupy Lung Wo Road outside Hong Kong's Government complex after pushing police back today . David Cameron - with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on a state visit to the country last year - said the decision to ban MPs 'only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong' It came after committee chairman Sir Richard Ottaway said his committee of MPs had been told by the Chinese embassy that they would be turned back if they tried to enter Hong Kong. The MPs had been planning to visit Hong Kong as part of an inquiry into its relations with the UK 30 years after the joint declaration which led to the handover to China in 1997. The move comes amid continuing protests by pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong who have been demanding the right to choose their own leaders without interference from Beijing. Sir Richard accused the Chinese authorities of acting in an ‘overtly confrontational manner’ and said that he would now be pressing for an emergency Commons debate. ‘I have been informed by the Chinese embassy that if we attempt to travel to Hong Kong we will be refused entry,’ he said. ‘We are a committee of elected Members of Parliament from a democratic nation who wish to scrutinise British diplomatic work in Hong Kong. ‘The Chinese government are acting in an overtly confrontational manner in refusing us access to do our job. ‘I shall be asking the Speaker tomorrow to grant an emergency debate on the floor of the House.’ Mr Cameron's official spokesman said he shared Sir Richard’s concerns. He said: ‘The Prime Minister's view is that the decision with regard to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee is a mistaken one. ‘We will continue to have a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on this, both through the Foreign Office here in London with the Chinese Embassy in London and through our embassy in Beijing. ‘The argument that we will be taking forward with the Chinese authorities is that the reason why the Prime Minister thinks it is a mistaken decision is because it is counter-productive. It only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, rather than diminishing concerns.’ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is facing pressure to confront China over their threat to block a group of MPs visiting China . Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters confronted Hong Kong police yesterday, stepping up their movement for democratic reforms after being camped out on the city’s streets for more than two months. Student protest leaders told a large crowd rallying at the main protest site outside government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign by surrounding the building. The protesting against proposals which they claim will see elections in the former colony rigged in favour of Beijing puppet candidates. They are demanding that the Hong Kong government scrap a plan by China’s Communist leaders to use a Beijing chosen panel to screen candidates for Hong Kong’s leader in 2017 elections.","Foreign Affairs Committee have been warned they will be denied entry .

"The father of a suburban Denver girl who tried to sneak into Syria and join ISIS with two others has condemned her actions. He also admitted that she was confused about what her role would be if she had actually made it there. 'She told me they were going to get there and somebody is going to contact them,' said the father of a 16-year-old Sudanese girl, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he is concerned for the girls' safety. 'I ask her, ""Who's that person?"" She actually didn't have a clear idea about what's going on. They're just like, you know, stupid little girls. They just want to do something, and they do it.' Scroll down for video . Back home: Police say this is the Aurora, Colorado apartment complex where one of the girls who tried to join ISIS with two friends . The FBI says the 16-year-old and her friends, 15- and 17-year-old sisters of Somali descent, were headed toward Turkey en route to Syria when authorities stopped them on October 20 at the Frankfurt, Germany airport. They sent them back to Denver, where FBI agents again interviewed them before releasing them to their parents without pressing charges. They're safe now, but the father said he is still troubled by lingering questions about their intentions, who recruited them online and how they were so easily able to board a plane and head overseas. The FBI is focusing on what contacts they had in Syria, having searched the girls' computers for clues. 'What they did is unacceptable, and they changed their lives, and they changed our lives,' he said, adding that he pulled his daughter out of school. She hasn't had contact with her friends. She told her father she was afraid to talk to him about going to Syria because she knew he would oppose it. 'She realizes she made a mistake.' He said he became concerned October 17, when his daughter's high school called to say she had not shown up for classes. He texted her, and she responded that she was just late, but she didn't return home, and her brother mentioned a disturbing Twitter conversation from her account. 'She asked her friends to pray for her because she and the other two girls ... and at that time, I just knew that something really bad was going to happen,' he said. Then, he noticed her passport missing. He called the FBI and his state lawmaker, Rep. Daniel Kagan, for help. Residence: Police say this Aurora, Colorado apartment building is where two out of the three would-be ISIS recruits live . Authorities said the girls had saved their money and stole from their parents to buy their tickets in cash at a Lufthansa counter at Denver International Airport. Their overseas trip raised no red flags. The U.S. government doesn't have any restrictions on children flying alone, domestically or internationally. Most U.S. airlines allow children 12 and older to fly alone but often with restrictions on international flights. The girl left behind her laptop, which showed she had been researching whether minors could travel alone and if an entry visa to Turkey was required. The father wasn't sure how his daughter, a typical high school girl who likes going to the movies and the mall, was lured to terrorism online. Officials have said one of the girls had planned the voyage and encouraged the others to come along. Authorities say the teenage girls tried to join Islamic State militants in Syria (file photo) The family moved to the U.S. in 2001 and to Colorado three years ago after living in Lincoln, Nebraska. Less was known about the Somali family, but those close to them said they have been in Colorado for years. Their father, who works as a hotel housekeeper, is from Mogadishu. Members of southeast Denver's tight-knit East African community are now concerned other children will follow the girls' path. The FBI has been investigating whether they had friends or associates with similar intentions. 'This is now an open wound,' said Halimo Hashi, a Somali immigrant who owns an African fashion boutique among a jumble of ethnic markets and restaurants where the girls' father often visits. 'I'm concerned about other kids now falling into that trap because of the attention those girls are getting.'","The FBI says a 16-year-old and her friends, 15- and 17-year-old sisters, were headed toward Turkey en route to Syria when they were stopped in Germany .

"Controversial University of Sydney Professor Barry Spurr has been suspended over a series of inflammatory emails that include derogatory references to Aboriginals, Asians and women. Professor Spurr - who is the university's Personal Chair in Poetry and Poetics - recently contributed to a review of the national curriculum. 'Professor Spurr is suspended, effective immediately, from teaching and engaging in any other University business and is precluded from attending any University campus, while the matter is investigated,' the university said in a statement. Professor Barry Spurr has suspended over a series of emails that label Tony Abbott as an 'abo-lover' 'Racist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the University of Sydney. 'The expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct are clearly set out in the University's Code of Conduct.' Daily Mail Australia asked a spokeswoman from the University of Sydney whether Professor Spurr was suspended without pay but was told that 'the university can not make any comments that will jeopardise the investigation process'. Professor Spurr sparked an investigation into allegations he labelled Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott an 'abo lover' in a string of emails containing racist taunts. He also allegedly referred to former South African leader Nelson Mandela as a 'darkie' and Archbishop Desmond Tutu as a 'witch doctor', the New Matilda reported. The allegations against Professor Spurr, who took charge of examining nationwide English courses, come just days after results of the National Curriculum Review were released. Other terms used by Professor Spurr in his emails include 'Mussies, Chinky-Poos, bogans and fatsoes'. In one email published on the news website, the scholar wrote 'Abo Lover Abbott and [Sydney Swans footballer] Adam Goodes' were 'Siamese twins' who could only be separated by undergoing surgery. He also referred Mr Abbott as 'gutless and hypocritical' in another email as well as criticising the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff Peta Credlin for allowing an 'Abo' singer to entertain Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to iconic Uluru in the Northern Territory in April. In the emails, Professor Spurr threw insults at Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Nelson Mandela (right) Sydney Swans footballer Adam Goodes was also mentioned in the string of emails . Professor Spurr is employed at The University of Sydney as Personal Chair in Poetry and Poetics . Professor Spurr has defended himself and said the views expressed in the string of emails were not reflective of his own beliefs, Fairfax Media reported. He also added that the exchange was a pastime  'that mocked extreme language'. 'The comments that you refer to are largely to one recipient with whom I have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements,' he said in an email seen by The Sydney Morning Herald. As part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum, Professor Spurr made the recommendation to reduce study into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language. He told the New Matilda they were made with his 'considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play'. Professor Spurr said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally. Christopher Pyne had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs . A spokesman for Education Minister Christopher Pyne said the MP was disgusted by the alleged slurs made by Professor Spurr and said the selection of the scholar to take part in the review was not made by the government. 'The minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex, race, sexual orientation or beliefs,' the spokesman told Fairfax Media. The University of Sydney said it was 'deeply disturbed' by the revelations involving one of its academic staff members sending offensive emails. 'The university takes the allegations very seriously and is examining whether any breaches of its Code of Conduct have occurred,' a statement on its website said. 'This code clearly sets out the university's expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct. 'In particular, the code requires that members of staff ""act fairly and reasonably, and treat [people] with respect, impartiality, courtesy and sensitivity"".

"Eight men have been jailed for 'inciting debauchery' after appearing in an alleged same-sex wedding video in Egypt. The men, who formed the wedding party on a boat on the Nile, were sentenced to three years in prison each for the crime of debauchery.

Today's verdict sentenced each of the men who appeared in an alleged same-sex prison to three years in jail . Although being gay is not illegal in Egypt, the men who appeared in the video were arrested last month and 'tested' for homosexuality. Officials subsequently said that they'd 'tested negative for homosexuality'. Precisely what the test involved has not been revealed, but it is thought to be an intrusive anal examination. The verdict is the latest in a crackdown by authorities against gays and atheists. The campaign also targets liberal and pro-democracy activists and violators of a draconian law on street protests. In the video clip purporting to be 'Egypt's first gay wedding' two men embrace after exchanging rings . Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat said the video 'violates public decency', but the Human Rights Watch have said that anal examinations 'violate international standards against torture'. Earlier this year, an Egyptian court convicted four men of committing 'homosexual acts' and sentenced them to up to eight years in prison. Police arrested the men for holding parties they say involved homosexual acts and where they found women's clothes and makeup. Three of the four received eight years while one received three years with hard labour. In 2011, a high profile trial of 52 men accused of being gay caught international attention and drew criticism from rights groups. Twenty-three of them were sentenced to up to five years in prison while the rest were acquitted.

"The captain of the South Korean ferry that sank in April with the loss of more than 300 lives was jailed today for 36 years, but avoided the death penalty after being acquitted of murder. In a ruling that followed five months of dramatic, often painful testimony, a three-judge court said prosecutors failed to prove Captain Lee Jun-Seok, 69, had acted with an intention to kill. However, he was convicted of gross negligence and dereliction of duty, including abandoning his vessel while hundreds of passengers - most of them schoolchildren - remained trapped on board. Relatives who were present in the courtroom in the southern city of Gwangju reacted furiously to the murder acquittal.

Sentenced: Lee (second left in front row) sits in court with other senior members of the Sewol ferry who were given jail terms of between 15 and 30 years, but also found not guilty of murder . Emotional case: In a ruling that followed five months of dramatic, often painful testimony, a three-judge court said prosecutors failed to prove that Captain Lee Jun-Seok, 69, had acted with an intention to kill . 'It's not fair. What about the lives of our children? They (the defendants) deserve worse than death,' screamed another. Three other senior crew members, who had also faced homicide charges, were sentenced to jail terms of between 15 and 30 years. Announcing the verdict, Judge Lim Joung-Youb said: 'We find it hard to conclude that the defendants... were aware that all of the victims would die because of their actions and they had an intention to kill them. 'Therefore the murder charges are not accepted.' Doomed: The 6,825-tonne Sewol ferry was carrying 476 people on board when it capsized. Of the 304 who died, 250 were students from the same high school . Capsized|: The ship capsized while making a turn during a routine voyage to the holiday island of Jeju . However, Lim stressed that if Lee and his crew acted properly as soon as the Sewol ran into trouble then many lives might have been saved. Lee and his crew were vilified in the wake of the April 16 disaster and, with emotions running sky high across the country over the loss of so many young lives, some legal experts had raised doubts over whether they would receive a fair trial. South Korean media coverage of their arrest and arraignment was often coloured by a presumption of guilt. Before the trial even began, President Park Geun-Hye publicly stated that the crew's actions had been 'tantamount to murder'. The approach of winter and the structural weakening of the vessel that has been under water for seven months in strong currents made it dangerous for divers to continue searching . Just hours before the court gave its ruling, Maritime Minister Lee Ju-Young announced the end of the near seven-month search of the sunken vessel for missing bodies . As well as abandoning the ship, Lee and his crew were condemned for instructing passengers to remain where they were as the vessel began to list dangerously. When the trial wrapped up late last month, Lee acknowledged that he had been paralysed by panic and failed to take 'appropriate measures' that could have saved lives. But he always strenuously denied having knowingly intended to sacrifice the lives of the passengers. The 6,825-tonne Sewol was carrying 476 people on board when it capsized. Of the 304 who died, 250 were students from the same high school. Just hours before the court gave its ruling, Maritime Minister Lee Ju-Young announced the end of the near seven-month search of the sunken vessel for missing bodies. 'The situation within the ship has become too difficult to continue,' Lee said, citing the collapsing interior and worsening sea conditions with the onset of winter. Two divers died in May during search efforts in an area known for rapid currents and poor underwater visibility. With nine victims still unaccounted for, and warnings that they may have been washed out to sea, Lee said he 'deeply regretted' that some families would be left with no body to mourn. The minister did not elaborate on when or whether the government plans to pull the ship out of water, saying the decision would be made after discussions with experts. The decision to end the search was agreed by the families of the nine passengers still missing . Of the 304 confirmed dead or still listed as missing, 250 were school children .

All 298 passengers and crew on board the jet perished when it was brought down on July 17 . In commentary on the footage, Vtulkin accuses 'Nazis' - as the Russians frequently label the Ukrainian authorities - of targeting MH17. 'Today, at 1700 on 17 July 2014, a civilian jet [was shot down]. What did the little Nazis not like about it? This is an act of provocation. There are a lot of bodies here.' State-controlled Channel One cited pro-Kremlin defence analyst Igor Korotchenko saying there was 'no doubt' the air-defence system used to target the plane belonged to the Ukrainian armed forces. Transport official Roman Gusarov blamed Ukrainian air traffic controllers for directing the flight into the conflict zone in Donetsk region.

New personal items have been found at the crash site, it was revealed. 'Four Dutch nationals were at the disaster site, as part of an OSCE team,' said a Justice Ministry spokesman in the Netherlands. 'The State Emergency Services managed to recover many personal belongings, nine boxes of a cubic metre each, from the crash site,' said Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the Dutch repatriation mission, on Dutch television. '(There was) jewellery, watches, credit cards, a driving licence, a passport, an iPad, photos - things that really should be with relatives.' He revealed that a full-scale search of the site - which crucial evidence may lie as well as human remains and personal items of the dead - may only be possible after the winter. On Monday there were sporadic exchanges of fire at the scene. Toys are placed on front of wreckage at the site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 .

Moscow announced a pullback of almost 18,000 troops ahead of the sessions, but doubts are being expressed over whether the retreat is real. Kiev military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk claimed Russia had reduced its frontline forces by 2,000 but this was part of a rotation of forces, not a scaling back. 'There is a rotation of units: the 98th airborne division, the 137th airborne regiment, other units of the 106th airborne division, and the 45th separate special purpose airborne regiment,' he said. Germany also expressed deep scepticism about the pullback of troops. 'If this announcement and significant withdrawal of Russian troops from the border actually takes place, then this would be a step towards de-escalation,' Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference in Berlin. 'But unfortunately we know from experience that there have been some cases before important international meetings where Russia made announcements which were then not upheld or only partially upheld. Actions alone are what counts.'","Stills are taken from footage shown in Russian television documentary .

"Shocking new footage taken moments after doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was downed in Ukraine shows the jet was just yards from hitting a village. The video, which comes four months after the passenger plane was shot down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, shows panicked villagers running to and from the blaze with buckets of water. Others stand and watch in shock as plumes of smoke rise into the sky, with no sign of life among the wreckage. Scroll down for video . New footage: Shocking amateur video shows Ukrainian villagers running towards MH17's crash site moments after it was shot down . The Malaysian Airlines flight was just yards from crashing into houses in the village of Hrabove . The amateur footage, filmed by a resident of the Ukrainian village of Hrabove, shows people reacting in alarm as the wreckage burns just yards away from their homes on the afternoon of July 17. Villagers rush towards the fire but quickly realise there is little chance that anybody on board will have survived. The video, thought to be the first taken after the tragedy, appears to suggest that residents first assumed it was a Ukrainian military plane that had been shot down. Before long, the shocked crowd of villagers start to question whether more than one aircraft had been shot down because of the sheer amount of debris. One man is heard asking if there was a second plane, but a witness tells him that only one aircraft was seen plummeting from the sky. One bystander is heard asking: 'And where is the pilot?' In vain: Villagers run to and from the site with buckets of water in an attempt to douse the flames . Others stand and watch in shock as smoke rises from where the plane crashed, with no visible signs of life among the wreckage . The video, thought to be the first taken after the tragedy, appears to suggest that residents first assumed it was a Ukrainian military plane that had been struck . Another answers: 'Who the hell knows?' As the mobile phone camera pans across the scene, it becomes evident that just a single-track lane separates the crash site from a house on the outskirts of Hrabove. The village's residents are likely to have been asking for the whereabouts of the pilot as, before MH17 was shot down, rebels would often capture pilots after shooting down military planes and hold them prisoner. Three days before the passenger jet crashed, rebels claimed responsibility for shooting down an Antonov-24 military transport plane. A day later, the pilot was questioned on Russian television. Recovery work begun at the wreckage site of Malaysian Airways flight MH17 earlier today. The Dutch Safety Board (DSB), which is leading the investigation into the tragedy - which cost the lives of 298 people including 10 Britons - has up to now had limited access to the crash site. But the board announced a few days ago that it hoped to start the recovery soon and today announced work had begun.

Kiev accuses pro-Russian separatists of shooting down the plane with an anti-aircraft missile. Russia says a Ukrainian military aircraft shot down MH17. The tragedy came months after the mysterious disappearance of another Malaysian Airlines plane - MH370.

"A Missouri police officer's full account of why he shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown has been revealed for the first time - and he describes a frantic struggle inside his police car during which Brown grabbed his gun, twisted it around and pointed it at him - making him fear for his life. Darren Wilson's testimony runs contrary to most eye-witness accounts and significantly makes the claim that Brown, 18, charged him after the initial struggle and never raised his arms in surrender. Wilson, 28, paints a picture of an officer in distress during the afternoon of August 8 as a belligerent Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and nearly 300lb, tried to steal his sidearm and turn the weapon against him. Further compounding Wilson's version of events was the revelation that Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot. The police also say Brown had marijuana on him at the time of his fatal run-in with Officer Wilson. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: New details of an account by Darren Wilson (left), the police officer who killed Michael Brown (right), describes a violent encounter in which Wilson was allegedly hit in the face several times before firing a gun which Brown was trying to wrest away from him . Aftermath: Pictured above in a grainy cellphone photograph grab, Wilson stands over Brown after the fatal - and hotly-disputed incident . Darren Wilson’s testimony, as leaked to the St Louis Post-Dispatch, is the first time a full account of the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, on 9 August has been revealed – and is sure to further stoke the controversy surrounding the shooting. It comes after partial elements of Wilson' version of events were leaked last week and the same day that the former head of the St. Louis County Police said he believed Wilson would most likely not be indicted by a Missouri state grand jury. The police officer’s dramatic account of events depicts a life-or-death struggle inside his squad car with the 'incredibly strong' teen – after Brown allegedly punched him in the face and reached for his gun. And, significantly, Wilson claims he shot Brown dead as the teen charged at him on the street – after the alleged attacker apparently retreated after he was shot in the hand during the struggle in the car. A grand jury decision on whether Wilson should be indicted on criminal charges is expected within weeks. A separate leaked autopsy report also appears to show Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot. The account, based on statements Wilson made after the encounter, was conveyed to the Post-Dispatch by a source familiar with the documents. Other witnesses have dismissed Wilson's version of events, and the Brown family's lawyer said 'the story doesn't even make good nonsense'. In the account, Wilson told how he was driving down Canfield Drive after dealing with a call about a sick baby  when he spotted Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of the road. He said he told them to get onto the sidewalk, and was met with abuse from the pair. The statement said Wilson then noticed that they were carrying cigarillos, and that Johnson looked like a man described in recent radio alerts as a suspect in a convenience store theft in which 'blunts' were taken. The police officer then said he parked his Chevrolet SUV, and called for assistance. But, he claims, as he tried to get out he was met with a punch in the face from Brown, who allegedly struck through the car's open window. Immediate response: In this image investigators crowd round Brown's body immediately after the shooting . Wilson said he had no choice but to draw his pistol when faced with the 'incredibly strong' teen. Brown was 6-foot-4 and nearly 300lb at the time of his death. Wilson said he couldn't use his pepper spray in the close quarters because it would have hit him too. His baton was out of reach at the back of his belt. In the statement Wilson told how Brown grabbed at the pistol and continued to hit him in the face. The officer, who said he almost passed out in the attack, then told how he felt Brown, whose strength he found remarkable, twisting the barrel towards his own body. At one point, the muzzle of the gun was pointed at Wilson's own hip. Wilson went on to describe how he jerked back inside the car, loosening Brown's grip on the gun enough for him to squeeze the trigger. Vigils: Demonstrators - pictured on October 20 - have continually held vigils for Brown since the shooting in August. They are pictured above on Canfield Street, where he died . Protests: Thousands have taken to the streets of Ferguson in outrage over the incident . But, he said, the first time nothing happened - because Brown had his finger in the gun's hammer, which stopped it from firing. Separate accounts of the events which have been made public have also claimed there was a scuffle of some sort inside the police car - citing blood and skin samples picked up in investigations. When Wilson pulled the trigger again, the pistol went off, hitting Brown's hand and sending glass cascading around the car. Evidence presented by the Post-Dispatch from the autopsy report also seems to support a close-range impact. The document told how the entry wound in Brown's hand had no 'stippling' - a feature of mid-range impacts - suggesting a point-blank release. In his account, Wilson then described firing a second shot - which missed. Brown then ran away. Response: Police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations . Wilson said he was left unable to radio for backup because his transponder had been knocked away from the right setting in the chaos. So, on his own, Wilson said he got out of the car and gave chase. It was at that point when Brown turned. Wilson said Brown then 'charged' at him and wouldn't stop when he yelled. He started firing, and hit four times. One shot, Wilson said, hit Brown's forehead and brought him down. He also denied - as many witnesses have claimed - that Brown had his hands up in a gesture of surrender. Wilson's extensive account is at odds with several others which have emerged in the wake of the killing, which has sparked widespread and ongoing protests in the Missouri town. Others have said Brown was fleeing, or had unambiguously surrendered. It has also been suggested that Wilson himself was more aggressive toward Brown than suggested in the latest account.","Officer Darren Wilson's full grand jury testimony leaked to media .

"An ISIS-linked Egyptian terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the killing of an American oil worker in August this year. William Henderson, 58, died while working for Texas-based energy company Apache Corporation in Karama, Egypt on August 6th this year. Militant organization Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which now refers to itself as the Sinai Province, has posted pictures of Mr Henderson's passport and two identification cards on its Twitter, but has not specified when or how they killed him. Claiming responsibility: ID-cards and passport of oil worker William Henderson, who died in Egypt in August this year, has been posted by an ISIS-linked militant group in Egypt claiming responsibility for his death . The ID-cards posted by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, identifies Mr Henderson as an employee of  Apache Corporation and Qarun Petroleum Co., a joint venture with Egypt. An obituary published in a local Oklahoma newspaper at the time of his death, say Texas-born William 'Bill' Byron Henderson had 'passed suddenly' while working in Egypt. The obit said Mr Henderson, a married father-of-two who had left Oklahoma for Fayetteville, Arizona in 2010, had worked for Apache for 28 years. The U.S. embassy declined to comment on the militant group's claim, and Apache could not immediately be reached for comment. Apache said in August that one of its supervisors had been killed in an apparent carjacking in Egypt's Western Desert, but did not identify William Henderson. Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has carried out scores of attacks, including a suicide bombing on a tour bus in the south Sinai resort town of Taba, that killed three South Koreans and their local driver in February this year . 'The victim was a long-time employee who works with production operations and we are deeply saddened by his death,' Apache spokesman Bill Mintz said at the time, adding that Apache was working with Egyptian authorities and investigating the death. Mr Mintz said the attack had taken place Wednesday August 6th, as the employee was driving in the desert between Qarun and Karama, southwest of Cairo and had been killed by gunfire. Egyptian security officials said the Apache worker's body was found in a car on a road outside Cairo with another foreigner who had been working with the Egyptian government-owned company Qarun Petroleum. The second person's citizenship was not immediately disclosed, nor was it made  clear if the second person was killed or still alive when the body of the Apache worker, believed to have been Mr Henderson, was found. Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based jihadi group, has carried out scores of attacks mainly targeting Egyptian security forces, particularly since the July 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Last month it pledged allegiance to ISIS, which controls vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. In a separate statement late Sunday, the Egyptian group claimed to have carried out more than 10 attacks in the past four weeks. It said it blew up six army and police armored vehicles, killed seven police officers and conscripts, and demolished the house of a man accused of being a spy for the army. The northern part of the Sinai Peninsula has been under a state of emergency since the group attacked an army checkpoint in October, killing 31 soldiers.","ISIS-linked group claims to have killed oil worker William Henderson .

"The daughter of Hong Kong's embattled leader has risked fuelling anger among pro-democracy protesters after apparently mocking taxpayers on Facebook. Chai Yan Leung, whose father CY Leung is facing calls to quit by the end of today, reportedly attacked commenters who criticised a necklace she was wearing in her profile picture. In a string of inflammatory remarks on her purported Facebook page, she sarcastically thanks her detractors by pointing out that the necklace and her other expensive clothes were paid for by public funds through her father's salary. The post goes on to berate their level of intelligence, adding: 'Most of you here are probably unemployed... it's okay - your mother still loves you.' The page has since been taken down and Chai has been unavailable for comment to verify the authenticity of the account. However, a number of respected Hong Kong newspapers including the South China Morning Post and the Standard have previously reported that the page was hers. Scroll down for video . Chai Yan Leung (above), the daughter of Hong Kong's embattled leader, has risked fuelling anger among pro-democracy protesters after apparently making a series of derogatory remarks about taxpayers on Facebook . In a string of inflammatory remarks on her purported Facebook page, she thanks her detractors by pointing out that the necklace and her other clothes were indirectly paid for by public funds through her father's salary . In a posting on the page yesterday, according to Coconuts Hong Kong, Chai said: 'This is actually a beautiful necklace bought at Lane Crawford (yes- funded by all you HK taxpayers!! 'So are all my beautiful shoes and dresses and clutches!! Thank you so much!!!!)' She adds: 'Actually, maybe I shouldn't say ""all of you"" - since most of you here are probably unemployed hence have all this time obsessed with bombarding me with messages. 'Actually considering the standard of English I've skimmed through at times I doubt you'd even understand what the term ""social media platform"" means... it's okay - your mother still loves you.' It came as China today threw its weight behind Hong Kong's embattled leader in his face-off with pro-democracy protesters who have threatened to occupy government offices unless he steps down as Chief Executive by the end of today. The People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary Thursday that the 'central government fully trusts Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and is very satisfied with his work.' A student pro-democracy activist holds up a placard at the protest site as China  threw its weight behind Hong Kong's embattled leader Leung Chun-ying in his face-off with pro-democracy demonstrators . It added that it firmly supports the Hong Kong police - criticised for using tear gas and pepper spray on the protesters last weekend - to 'handle illegal activities in accordance with the law.' The week-long street protests by thousands of demonstrators pressing for freer elections in Hong Kong are the biggest challenge to Beijing's authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997. They oppose the Chinese government's decision in August that all candidates in an inaugural 2017 election for the territory's top post must be approved by a committee of mostly pro-Beijing local elites. They say China is reneging on its promise that the chief executive would be chosen through 'universal suffrage.' Student leaders who have played a key role in organising the protests initially wanted to meet with Leung, but after Sunday's clashes with police, they have stepped up calls for his resignation and asked that the central government in Beijing heed their demands for genuine democratic reforms. Raising the stakes of the stand-off, student leaders demanded Wednesday that Leung resign by midnight Thursday. Supporters of Hong Kong's democracy protesters turned on their cellphones while gathered at a downtown park in Los Angeles  in a show of support for the thousands of people in Hong Kong who have taken to the streets to protest the Chinese government's decision not to allow open nominations for a new leader . If he doesn't, they said they would step up their actions, including occupying government buildings. That raised the specter of another clash with police, who have been guarding various government buildings. Since Monday, the protests have been peaceful. On Thursday morning, several dozen mostly student-age protesters were trying to block the road outside the entrance to the chief executive's office in the government complex. Police manned barricades at a nearby intersection, with protesters camped on the other side, huddling under umbrellas. 'We are not asking C.Y. to come talk to us. We are demanding he resign,' said May Tang, a 21-year-old student at Lingnan University, referring to Leung. 'It's too late for his government to be accountable to the people so we want a new one.' One protester disagreed with the student leaders' threat to occupy government buildings. 'Getting into a confrontation with police doesn't seem peaceful to me,' said Wilson Yip, a 22-year-old recent university graduate. 'If they try to force themselves inside and confront police, I don't see what kind of point that would make. It may make fewer people support the protests.' The Chinese government appeared to be losing patience. A student protester rests next to a defaced cut-out of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying at one of their protest sites around the government headquarters earlier this week . An editorial solemnly read Wednesday evening on state TV said all Hong Kong residents should support authorities in their efforts to 'deploy police enforcement decisively' and 'restore the social order in Hong Kong as soon as possible.' In the commentary published Thursday, the People's Daily said that the rule of law must be safeguarded 'in order to realize the healthy development of democracy and politics in Hong Kong.' 'Handling affairs without following laws, Hong Kong society will be in chaos,' it warned. The protesters, it said, had 'flagrantly violated Hong Kong's law and regulations, seriously blocked traffic and disrupted social order. They have put a handful of people's political demands above the law, even hijacked the will of Hong Kong people for their personal interests.' In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and said the U.S. supports the 'highest possible degree of autonomy' in Hong Kong. He said he hopes Hong Kong authorities exercise restraint and allow the protesters to express their views peacefully. Wang said that the protests are 'China's internal affairs' and that no country would allow 'illegal acts' against public order.","Chai Yan Leung 'made inflammatory remarks on her Facebook page'

"Thousands of students converged on a university campus in Hong Kong today, launching a week-long boycott of classes in protest against Beijing's decision to rule out fully democratic elections in the former British colony. Students from more than 20 universities and colleges streamed into the grounds of picturesque, bay-side Chinese University of Hong Kong, where they were greeted by banners that said: 'The boycott must happen. Disobey and grasp your destiny.' Some sat in a circle playing guitars, while others folded leaflets urging students to boycott classes in a protest which coincides with a trip to Beijing by some of Hong Kong's most powerful business tycoons, who are expected to talk about government policies with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Scroll down for video . Thousands of Hong Kong students gather at the Chinese University of Hong Kong to protest Beijing's decision to rule out fully democratic elections in the former British colony . Students folded leaflets, played guitars and sang freedoms songs during the mass protest . Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a high degree of autonomy, but Beijing's rejection of the right to freely choose the city's next leader has prompted threats from activists to occupy and shut down the Central finance district as part of their pro-democracy campaign. Beijing decided in August to rule out open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first-ever elections to choose the city's top leader, which have been promised for 2017. The National People's Congress, China's legislature, instead insists that candidates be vetted by an elite committee that is similar to the body of mostly pro-Beijing elites that has until now selected the city's leaders. Democracy groups reject such screening for loyalty to Beijing and demand elections that offer a genuine choice. The strike marks the beginning of a week-long boycott of university classes being backed by academics . The action coincides with a visit to Beijing by some of Hong Kong's wealthiest business tycoons to discuss government policy with Chinese leader Xi Jinping . 'I believe on August 31, when the National People's Congress made their decision, it crushed the dreams of some Hong Kong people who have been fighting hard for democracy for the past 30 years,' said third-year student Hong Yuen. Leading academics in Hong Kong have voiced support for the boycott, with some offering to record lectures and post them online for students who miss school to watch later. About 380 academics and other school staff have signed a petition supporting the students, saying they should not 'stand alone'. 'At the minimum, [the strike] can provide a wakeup call to tens of thousands of university and secondary school students in Hong Kong,' said Dixon Sing, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and one of the organisers of the signature campaign. He added that the organisers are 'trying to inspire many other fellow classmates to be aware of and be devoted to the democratic movement'. One in five people say they are considering leaving Hong Kong because of concerns over its political future . The boycott is being organised by groups such as the Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism. A survey by the Chinese University showed more than a fifth of Hong Kong residents are considering leaving the city, spurred by concerns over its political future. Residents overall feel pessimistic about the current political climate, according to the poll,  released yesterday. On a scale of zero to 10, with zero being 'extremely pessimistic', the average response was 4.22. However, about 46 per cent said they did not support the movement to occupy the Central finance district. 'Hong Kong is on the brink of another wave of mass migration,' said Sonny Lo, a professor at the Hong Kong Institute of Education who is unaffiliated with the poll. 'More and more people will leave in the next few years as the election for the chief executive approaches.' The city saw waves of migration leading up to the transfer of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997, when tens of thousands left every year. Emigration also surged in the wake of the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, when Beijing violently suppressed protests by thousands of students calling for democracy. Many went to Canada, Australia and the US, only to return later as the political and economic situation in Hong Kong stabilised. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule with freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a policy of 'one country, two systems'. China is terrified those calls will spread to mainland cities, threatening the Communist Party's grip on power.","Thousands of students gathered at Chinese University of Hong Kong today .

"A new Edward Snowden documentary has confirmed suspicions held by the Obama administration that there is a second National Security Agency whistleblower  leaking government intelligence. The revelation reportedly comes during a major scene of Citizenfour , a documentary made by director Laura Poitras that follows the former government contractor from before he leaked thousands of classified documents last year through to the present day. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Glenn Greenwald - the journalist who first brought the Snowden files to public attention and Poitras' reporting partner - is the one who reveals the news on-camera to Snowden, whose mouth gapes open in shock. Greenwald - who now runs website The Intercept, launched in the wake of the Snowden scandal, from Rio de Janeiro - attended the film's world premiere alongside Poitras in New York on Friday night. Shocked: Documentary Citizenfour by filmmaker Laura Poitras - one of only two people Edward Snowden (pcitured) trusted with his stolen government documents - reveals a second leak giving out secrets from within in NSA . Team: Journalist Glenn Greenwald (left) and filmmaker Laura Poitras (right) were contacted via encrypted email in early 2013 by someone calling themself 'citizen four' saying they were about to blow the whistle on secret government su, who turned out to be Snowden . Critically acclaimed: Citizenfour is a new fly-on-the-wall documentary 'thriller' that gives a new insight to Edward Snowden . Support: Filmmaker Laura Poitras (center) attends the premiere of her documentary, Citizenfour, in New York on Friday night, flanked by the parents of Edward Snowden, Karen and Lonnie Snowden . In August it was revealed the government suspected a second leak after a story that was published by The Intercept. CNN reported at the time that the proof was in documents obtained for the article about US government surveillance of suspected terrorists, which is dated August 2013 - months after Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia to escape spying charges. In addition to The Intercept's report, two articles in the German press had reported on US national security and spying issues without citing Snowden - adding to the theory that the notorious whistleblower is not the only leak. 'That's particularly notable given that virtually every other article using Snowden documents - including der Spiegel - specifically identified him as the source,' Greenwald said in an email to The Hill in July. Greenwald says in Citizenfour that the person is higher in rank than Snowden. However nothing else is known about the second leak who is providing secrets to journalists. The Intercept also said the government has a list of one million names collected on a database called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). It claimed there was one watchlist with 680,000 names on it that are under surveillance by the government. The site said that 40 percent of the people have no affiliation to terrorist groups. Poitras says in her documentary that she is on the list. The list has basically doubled since the underwear bomber plot to destroy a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. The justification for this is that the would-be bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab was not on any watchlists at the time that could have had a chance of preventing the attack. Concern: President Barack Obama and his administration were already convinced there is a second source leaking government secrets to journalists . Snowden is wanted in the United States under the Espionage Act. He now lives in Russia, where he was granted a three-year residency. Snowden, Greenwald and Poitras spent eight days holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room nutting out the first stories that revealed Snowden to the world, all of which is covered in Citizenfour. Snowden did not tell anyone what he was doing when he abruptly left the US. He told his girlfriend, dancer Linsday Mills, with whom he lived with in Hawaii, that he was going on a work trip. Love: Dancer Lindsay Mills, the girlfriend of Edward Snowden, has been reunited with him in Russia . Together again: Citizenfour also revealed that Snowden's girlfriend Lindsay Mills, a pole dancer, has now joined him in Russia . At the time Poitras was several years into making a film about surveillance in the post-9/11 era when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from someone identifying themself as 'citizen four', saying he was about to blow the whistle on U.S. government surveillance programs. Greenwald was also contacted, and in June 2013 he and Poitras traveled to Hong Kong to meet 'citizen four', who introduced himself as Edward Snowden. Poitras filmed a lot of the meetings, which makes up a large chunk of her film. Marketed as a 'real-life thriller,' it is the first of several films in the works about Snowden, who is wanted by the United States on charges brought under the Espionage Act. Speaking in the film, Snowden says: 'I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the risk.' Poitras, speaking after the screening, said: 'This was a film we had to make as privately and secretly as we could.' Leaker: Snowden has claimed political asylum in Vladimir Putin's Russia. He is wanted in the US . 'We very much wanted to communicate in this film that [it] was about people who take risks and come forward at huge personal sacrifice.' Poitras, an American, now lives in Berlin, Germany. She has been stopped and questioned when entering the U.S. numerous times in the past 10 years. Snowden's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits of privacy versus the needs of national security. His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties.","Citizenfour is a fly-on-the-wall documentary that gives a new insight on Edward Snowden and how he leaked thousands of government documents .

"CCTV has revealed the moment a young girl narrowly escaped death as a huge piece of glass was blasted from the side of Ukraine's second-biggest stadium. The 52,000-seat Donbass Arena was shelled yesterday as fighting raged in Donetsk between pro-Russians and Ukrainian forces, despite both sides agreeing to a ceasefire. The footage from the city, 50 miles from the Russian border, showed a small figure walking towards the entrance of the stadium and falling to the ground as a blast hit above her head. Scroll down for video . Narrow escape: CCTV has revealed the moment a young girl escaped death as a huge piece of glass was blasted from the Donbass Arena in Donetsk. The footage began with her walking to the entrance (above) Ducking for cover: The girl then fell to the ground as the huge piece of glass - pictured - crashed towards her . Impact: The video shows the debris smashing on the ground just a few feet from the young child's head . Moments later, a huge section of glass around the stadium - which was built five years ago and has hosted Champions League matches - came crashing down around the girl. Incredibly, the girl did not appear to be seriously injured and was helped to her feet by an adult before the pair ran away, a cloud of debris still in the air. The unclear figure in the video was identified as a young girl by the Reuters news agency. Donetsk has become a stronghold for the pro-Russian uprising which has gripped eastern regions of Ukraine, and the Donbass Stadium is one of its biggest landmarks. Second in size only to Dynamo Kiev's home stadium, it opened in 2009 at a reputed cost of £250million to Shakhtar Donetsk football club owner Rinat Akhmetov. Aftermath: As a cloud of debris rose into the air an adult could be seen running to help the child to safety . Shock: The girl, dressed in red, is helped to her feet in the footage as the dust settles from the explosion . Under attack: Moments later the pair can be seen running to safety. The shelling came despite a ceasefire in Donetsk, which has been at the centre of the pro-Russian uprising which has killed more than 3,000 people . The venue, which hosted five matches at Euro 2012 and has regularly staged Champions League matches, had already suffered minor shelling in the last two months. Shakhtar have moved their headquarters from the strife-torn industrial city to the capital Kiev, and home games are being played in the western city of Lviv. Vadyn Gunko, the Arena's interim executive manager, said on the club's website yesterday: 'As a result of a powerful explosion, the blast wave caused serious damage to the western and eastern parts of the arena. 'A part of the facade glass crashed, a large area of it with critical damage. The inner facilities also were hit. We are assessing the damage at the moment, blocking the dangerous areas. 'We are warning the residents of Donetsk not to approach the stadium under any circumstances as it might be unsafe.' Damage: A photo after the shelling revealed the size of the huge glass panel which was knocked out of place . Unsafe: Shakhtar Donetsk moved from the stadium as its manager warned residents the building was unsafe . Size: The stadium is the second-biggest in Ukraine, beaten only by Dynamo Kiev's home ground in the capital . The United Nations says more than 3,500 people have died in fighting since pro-Russian separatists stormed government buildings in eastern cities earlier this year. Battling has carried on despite a ceasefire being in place since September 5 between the separatists and the Ukrainian government, which has deployed its army in the region. Many residents have been left without gas or power as the cold Ukrainian winter begins to settle in. One, 50-year-old Nikolai Batyshchev, has built an oven in his basement which he powers using firewood. He told the Reuters news agency today: 'There's no sense in staying in our apartment, the windows have long been shattered. Down there it's warm and quiet, and a tree will last you three days.'","Attack happened in Ukrainian city at the centre of pro-Russian uprising .

"Hong Kong police are investigating whether the British banker accused of slaughtering two prostitutes is schizophrenic, it was claimed today. Rurik Jutting, originally from Cobham, Surrey, faces two charges of murder after police called to his flat found one woman with her throat slashed and another stuffed in a suitcase. Cambridge-educated Jutting, 29, was earlier this week sent for two weeks of psychiatric tests to determine whether he's fit to stand trial. Suspected double murderer Rurik Jutting being taken back into custody after a judge ruled he undergo two weeks of psychiatric tests. Sources close to the investigation say he may be schizophrenic . But now the police inquiry has been reshaped by the suggestion he had been receiving treatment for schizophrenia before he even arrived in Hong Kong a year ago, reports The Times. Detectives were working on an understanding that Jutting was first diagnosed with mental illness in his early 20s, said the paper, which cited sources 'close to the inquiry'. Police were said to now be investigating whether Jutting may have stopped taking medication for his illness in recent months. Hong Kong sex workers who knew him say he was a regular user of cocaine. Media reports have claimed small quantities of the drug were found in his flat. Jutting appeared in a short court hearing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, charged with the women's murders. The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out and the banker was remanded in custody. As he was taken away to a cell, Jutting - who reportedly earned £350,000 a year as a banker - was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van. Prison guards sat uneasily around him wearing surgical masks. A lawyer for Jutting, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene but did not rule out giving consent in future. Macabre: Police called to Jutting's flat in J's Residence, pictured, discovered the two dead prostitutes inside . Victims: Seneng Mujiasih, 29, left, was found by police dying with wounds to her throat and buttocks. Officers later found the body of Sumarti Ningsih, 23, right, stuffed in a suitcase on Jutting's balcony . Sumarti Ningsih, 23, was found dead in a suitcase at Cambridge-educated Jutting's apartment in the former British colony's Wan Chai district last Saturday. Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later. Both of the victims' bodies have been repatriated to Indonesia. Miss Ningsih was buried yesterday. Jutting moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the days before the incident. Before leaving he appeared to have set a sinister automatic response for his email account at the bank. The email response read: 'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody (Last line only really worked if I had followed through).'","Police believe Rurik Jutting diagnosed with mental illness in his early 20s .

"A British jihadist who has lost two of his brothers in Syria has said he wants to stay and fight until he is also killed. Amer Deghayes, 20, from Brighton, travelled to fight for al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affliated group, against the Bashar al-Assad regime in October 2013. His younger brothers, Jaffar, 17, and Abdullah, 18, joined him in Syria but both have been killed in the conflict. Family: Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) have both been killed . Amer said their deaths had made him more determined to carry on fighting until he is killed, revealing that he has no desire to return to the UK. 'I have promised Allah that I will stay on the way of jihad until I get killed,' he told ITV News. He describes martyrdom as the 'greatest success a person can attain', adding: 'It [his brothers' deaths] makes me more determined to get what they got.' Jaffar, 17, is believed to have died last weekend trying to overthrow dictator Assad's government. His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda-affiliated group. Asked how his father reacted to news that he had lost another son, Amer replied: 'I expect that he accepts Allah's will.' Brothers from East Sussex: Jaffar Deghayes (left), 17, is believed to have died last weekend after leaving home near Brighton earlier this year for Syria. His brother, Abdullah (right), 18, died in Latakia province in April . Abubaker Deghayes has urged the Government to rethink its approach to fighters wanting to return to the UK to encourage his son to come home. But Amer, a former finance student, said he is not considering leaving Syria so 'does not pay much attention' to whether he would be allowed to come back to the UK. In a film shot by Vice News this year, Amer  said: ‘My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.’ He added: ‘I'm in the Syrian civil war because I believe it's my duty to fight here ...The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.’ The Deghayes' parents had insisted their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak . However, he says a change in the law would help the fight against Assad as it would open 'the gates of support' and allow 'people that are thinking twice about coming here' to come and 'do their duty' He said he did not think returning fighters would pose a threat to the UK. The Deghayes brothers are the nephew of Omar Deghayes, who was held by the U.S. as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from 2002 to 2007 after he was arrested in Pakistan. Counter-terrorism investigators have expressed concern about aspiring British jihadis travelling to Syria and becoming radicalised. It emerged this month that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - died fighting in Kobani. Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October last year. In January alone, 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences related to Syria compared with 24 arrests in the whole of last year. Others who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack. Abdul Waheed Majeed is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February. The 41-year-old married father-of-three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.","Amer Deghayes, 20, from Brighton, wants to stay and fight in Syria .

With relatives in tears around him, Miss Ningsih's brother Mohammed Rohmat tenderly placed his hand on his sister's coffin before she was eventually laid to rest. Sex workers Miss Ningsih and Seneng Mujiasih, 28, were found murdered in Jutting's luxury apartment last week, with the British former banker now undergoing psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial on double murder charges. While Miss Mujiasih was discovered dying with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks when police arrived, Miss Ningsih's mutilated corpse was found stuffed into a suitcase a placed on Jutting's balcony. It is believed she had been dead for five days at the time of the discovery. Scroll down for video .

Sumarti Ningshi, a mother of one who left Gandrungmangu for a better life in Hong Kong, was killed and stuffed into a suitcase at Jutting's flat . Miss Ningsih's funeral took place this morning in her home village, which she left in her late teens to start a new life as a domestic worker in Hong Kong. She had earlier married and divorced, and is the mother of a six year old son who has been raised by her parents. While working in Hong Kong, Miss Ningsih was able to send large sums of money back to Gandrungmangu to help pay for her son's education, but problems with her visa meant she started struggling to find domestic and waitress work, and was forced to become a prostitute. This morning dozens of friends and relatives turned out for her funeral service, carrying her coffin in a solemn procession through the village she fled in the hope of finding a better life abroad. Her funeral took place shortly after the body of her fellow murder victim Seneng Mujiasih arrived back in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, from where it will be taken for burial to her own hometown on Indonesia's Muna Island. The bodies were returned home just one day after Jutting, 29 - who reportedly earned £350,00 a year as a banker - was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van after being sent for psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial. He had appeared at a hearing earlier in the day charged with double murder.

His lawyer, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future. Jutting, bearded and wearing black-rimmed glasses, remained impassive during the brief hearing at the Eastern Magistrate's court - his second appearance after being charged with the murders a week ago. He spoke only once to say 'I do' when the magistrate asked him whether he understood the arrangements. The case was 'adjourned... for two psychiatric reports on the defendant's fitness to plead', said principal magistrate Bina Chainrai.

Reports by two different doctors are required under Hong Kong law, said prosecutor Louise Wong who confirmed Jutting is being held at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre. He will next appear in court on November 24. Following the hearing, Hong Kong solicitor Michael Vidler, who is also acting in Jutting's defence, said it could be months before a plea is entered. Yesterday it emerged that Seneng Mujiasih sent a message saying she wanted to 'get out of here' just minutes before her death at the luxury flat. The sex worker, who was also known as Jesse Lorena, is understood to have sent a text to a friend complaining of a 'really bad' smell inside the flat at 3.25am on Saturday November 1. At 3.45am police found Ms Mujiasih dying in the apartment with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks. They later discovered the mutilated corpse Miss Ningsih on Jutting's balcony, having been stuffed into a suitcase five days earlier. Tragic: Seneng Mujiasih (pictured) was also found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Rurik Jutting's apartment at 3.45am on Saturday November 1. 25 minutes earlier she sent a message to a friend raising concerns about being in the property and complaining of a 'really bad' smell .

Ms Mujiasih was found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Jutting's apartment at 3.45am,  Hong Kong police have revealed. Just 20 minutes earlier she had texted a friend to raise concerns over her visit, saying: 'Something smells really bad – I want to get out of here,' according to The Telegraph, who quoted a source close to the victim who asked not to be named. According to witnesses, Ms Mujiasih met Jutting at the nearby New Makati Pub & Disco sometime after 1.35am. Security footage shows the pair walking in the direction of his apartment shortly after 2.15am but what happened between their arrival and Ms Mujiasih's death remains a mystery. Although it remains unclear exactly why Ms Mujiasih wanted to leave the flat and what the 'really bad' smell was, other residents in the building are said to have complained of a 'dead animal' stench in the building's corridors. They were later told the smell was from the first victim's decomposing body. Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later.

"The Turkish military has deployed tanks to the Syrian border where thousands of refugees - many of them ethnic Kurds - have gathered, fleeing from murderous Islamic State militants. The porous border is believed to be the main route for Western would-be jihadists to join up with IS and other extremist groups in the Middle East as recruits fly into airports popular with tourists in southern Turkey, before easily slipping over the border into war-torn Syria. But armed forces have rushed to control the barbed wire territory line which is now a key route of escape for Syrian Kurds. Meanwhile, Kurdish forces in northern Syria pushed back an advance by Islamic State fighters towards a strategic town on the Turkish border on Thursday and appealed for U.S.-led air strikes to target the insurgents' tanks and heavy armaments. Scroll down for video . Stand-off: A tank faces dozens of cars clustered along the barbed wire border of Turkey and Syria where would-be jihadists are believed to be entering the country . Waiting game: The border near Sanliurfa, Turkey, has long been a crossing point for ISIS recruits to get into Syria but now civilians are using it as an escape route out . Influx: An estimated 1,300 people crossed into Turkey on Wednesday alone, and the total number since the fighting began near Kobani had risen to 144,000 . Desperate: At least 140,000 Kurds have fled Kobani and its surrounding villages since Friday, crossing into Turkey . Islamic State launched a new offensive to try to capture the border town of Kobani more than a week ago, besieging it from three sides. The move appears to have sparked a state of panic within the Kurdish community. At least 140,000 Kurds have fled the town and surrounding villages since Friday crossing into Turkey, according to figures compiled by the United Nations. Turkish soldiers have been deployed to stem the relentless flow into their country - and also block Kurdish men from crossing in the opposite direction to fight against Islamic State militants. The U.N. refugee agency said the first of eight planned aid flights landed in the southern Turkish city of Adana, carrying pre-fabricated warehouses, sleeping mats, plastic sheeting and cooking utensils to help Turkey cope with the influx. Kurdish and Islamic State fighters exchanged artillery and machine gun fire in a cluster of villages about nine miles west of Kobani, where the frontline appeared not to have moved significantly for several days, a Reuters witness said. Kurdish officials meanwhile said Islamic State had concentrated their fighters south of the town late on Wednesday and had pushed towards it, but that the main Kurdish armed group in northern Syria, the YPG, had repelled them overnight.

Pleading: One Kurdish man looks tearful as he waits to be told whether he can or cannot cross into the safety of Turkish land . Exhausted: The crowds have been travelling for days with as many possessions as they could carry but by the time they reached the border, it was blocked by soldiers . Bitter-sweet: This refugee looks melancholic as he passes through the barricades into the safety of Suruc clutching his papers, leaving his entire life in Syria behind . Hydration: Turkish aid workers came out in force to hand bottles of water to the refugees as it became clear a sand storm was about to hit the region . 'The YPG responded and pushed them back to about 10-15 km (six-nine miles) away,' Idris Nassan, deputy minister for foreign affairs in the Kobani canton, told news agency Reuters by telephone. Syrian Kurdish refugees watching the fighting from a hill on the Turkish side of the border said the Islamic State insurgents had not been able to advance from positions they had taken up in olive groves west of Kobani. Turkish military vehicles patrolled their side of the border, with soldiers occasionally moving people away from the hill overlooking the fighting. Heavy weapons fire could also be heard further away from the border inside Syrian territory. The town's location has been blocking the Sunni Muslim insurgents from consolidating their gains in northern Syria. The group tried to take the town in July but was repulsed by local forces backed by Kurdish fighters from Turkey. The YPG on Thursday renewed calls for U.S.-led air strikes to hit Islamic State positions around Kobani.

Shelter: Refugees barred from crossing the border have taken to assembling makeshift homes using wood and blankets . 'Although all ISIS positions and their heavy armaments, including tanks and armoured vehicles around Kobani, are clear and within view for everyone on the front line, it is worth noting that these targets have not been bombed yet,' YPG spokesman Redur Xelil said. 'We are of the utmost readiness to cooperate with the international coalition forces against terrorism and give it detailed information about the main targets,' he said. A thin but steady stream of people continued to cross from Syria into Turkey at the Yumurtalik border crossing after it reopened on Thursday, with police carrying out security checks. An estimated 1,300 people crossed into Turkey on Wednesday alone, and the total number since the fighting began near Kobani had risen to 144,000, according to the United Nations. Turkey is already sheltering more than 1.3 million refugees from Syria. The U.N. refugee agency was helping the Turkish authorities set up two new camps to cope with the influx, UNHCR spokeswoman Selin Unal said.

Weary: This little girl is exhausted clutching her possessions after her family was forced to plead to cross into Turkey from conflict-stricken Syria . Mothers: Thousands of infants and babies were transported across the barricades by their mothers. Many women had given birth en route to the border . Turkey has been slow to join calls for a coalition to fight Islamic State in Syria, worried in part about links between Syrian Kurds and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a militant group which waged a three-decade campaign against the Turkish state for greater Kurdish rights. The PKK has called on Turkey's Kurds to join the fight to defend Kobani and accused Ankara of supporting Islamic State. Residents in the border area say hundreds of youths have done so, although Turkish security forces have been trying to keep them from crossing the frontier. Cooking: Using bits of coal they had brought with them and a small iron pot, this mother attempts to cook some food for the many children in her family .

Poor conditions: People clutch bottles of water and food packages wrapped in plastic and cloth to protect the goods from the relentless sand . Blistering heat: The crowds were forced to don coats to shroud themselves from the sand despite the blistering heat of the desert . Life changing: Limited to what they can carry, families have had to leave all their possessions behind and simply take bags of essential items . Turkey strongly denies it has given any form of support to the Islamist militants but Western countries say its open borders during Syria's three-year civil war allowed Islamic State and other radical groups to grow in power. Ocalan Iso, a Kurdish defence official, confirmed that YPG forces had stemmed Islamic State's advances south of Kobani, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic. 'As our fighters secured the area, we found 12 Islamic State bodies,' he said by telephone. Islamic State fighters also remain to the east and west of the town and fighting continues in the south. Hailing a cab: This Syrian family looks relieved at having made it across the border where they can hail a cab to reach a safe house or refugee camp to start a new life . Distraught: This woman shields her face as she is forced to wait for another bus because they rest are all filled up . All hands on: Little children are forced to carry loads of home ware to the barbed wire fence in a desperate bid to find transport to a new home . Support: A Syrian man and a soldier help to carry an elderly woman travelling alone across the rough terrain by the border, which is a mass of remote desert . Both men said they had also heard warplanes flying over Kobani late on Wednesday for the first time, but it was not clear exactly which areas they were targeting. A third night of U.S.-led air strikes on Wednesday targeted Islamic State-controlled oil refineries in eastern Syria, U.S. officials said. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said eight YPG fighters had been killed in overnight clashes.","Turkish military sent armor and soldiers to border with Syria to control influx of refugees fleeing Islamic State .

"Vladimir Putin today accused the Ukrainians of 'constantly shelling' the MH17 crash site amid steeply rising concern in the West that he has ordered massive military reinforcements to bolster pro-Moscow rebel forces. At least 21 trucks, six tanks and 14 howitzer cannons were seen driving through rebel-territory to Donetsk today, while residents reported a convoy of 12 unmarked military trucks. Ukraine alleges that recent days have seen a huge increase in military hardware, professional soldiers and AK-74 assault rifles fitted with laser pointers moving towards Donetsk from Russia. Today, scores of military vehicles were seen moving near Donetsk and farther to the east, following reports by a neutral intergovernmental watchdog of armed column without insignia in rebel territory. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and five more injured in the 'anti-terrorist operation zone' over the past 24 hours. Moving in: A Pro-Russian rebel military vehicles convoy was seen moving towards Donetsk on Monday . At least one vehicle in the convoy carried a Russian flag, and many of the of the unmarked vehicles were towing artillery. Two columns of hardware consisting of 50 tented KamAZ lorries were observed moving from Russia in the direction of Snizhne on 8 November, said spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council Andriy Lysenko. Almost every lorry was transporting an artillery system behind it, he claimed . Another column was spotted on Sunday. It consisted of tanks and self-propelled artillery systems. A shipment of new AK-74 assault rifles fitted with laser pointers was brought from Russia to Donetsk, he alleged. 'These are regular AK-74s, but they are fitted with laser pointers. We do not know for sure how many of them there are,' he said. 'They are reinforcing the terrorist forces with arms and personnel from the Russian Armed Forces. There is no doubt that professional Russian servicemen are managing this equipment,' said Lysenko. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe confirmed its own sightings by its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine in recent days. This included two convoys of 17 military vehicles each spotted on 8 November around Sverdlove, nine miles east of Donetsk . In the first convoy five vehicles 'were towing Grad multiple-launch rocket systems. Two were loaded with ammunition crates'. Taking sides: At least one vehicle in the convoy carried a Russian flag, and many of the of the unmarked vehicles were towing artillery . The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE), which operates in East Ukraine and is widely seen as neutral, also reported an unidentified armoured column in rebel territory this weekend . 'The past week was characterised by an increase in the . intensity of shelling and the transfer of additional force: . ammunition, equipment and personnel, to terrorist groups,' Lysenko said. This comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Ukranian government of delaying the investigation of the MH17 crash site by shelling rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine. Putin told Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that rebels were not hindering access to the site of the Malaysia Airlines crash, in which 298 people died in July when the aircraft came down in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. 'Of course the rebels are not shooting, that is done by the various military groups fighting on the side of Ukraine's official authorities,' Putin was quoted as saying by state news agency RIA-Novosti. 'The opposite side is constantly shelling this territory and that does not permit comprehensive working at the site of the crash,' Putin told Razak as the two met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing. Firing off: Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the Ukranian government of delaying the investigation of the MH17 crash site by shelling rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine and the West blame Russia for supplying the separatists with the Buk surface-to-air missile that shot down the Boeing 777 plane on July 17, while Moscow and the rebels have pointed the finger at Kiev. Five more coffins of passengers who were on the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight were flown to the Netherlands on Saturday for identification.

"A collection of horrific photos taken inside Bashar al-Assad's Syrian torture chambers is going on display at the US Holocaust Museum. The pictures show dozens of mangled, emaciated corpses of men who were starved, strangled, shot, beaten and tortured to death at the hands agents working for the Syrian president. One veteran civil rights prosecutor said the pictures document 'an industrial killing machine not seen since the Holocaust,' Yahoo News reports. Stephen Rapp, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes, told Yahoo that the photos are 'some of the strongest evidence we've seen in the area of proof of the commission of mass atrocities.' WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT . Never again: The US Holocaust Museum is putting a selection of photos from the Syrian massacre on display . These pictures of men who had been tortured to death were taken by 'Caesar,' a former Syrian government photographer who defected and handed over a trove of 27,000 pictures to investigators . The images are part of a cache of 27,000 pictures that were smuggled out of Syria by 'Caesar,' a photographer with the Syrian military police who defected after documenting the brutality of al-Assad's regime. 'Caesar,' who is currently in hiding in Europe, was tasked with documenting deaths in government custody by the Syrian military. His pictures show unimaginable horror. Eyes gouged out. Hands bound. Bodies so emaciated from starvation that ribs poke through the skin. Men who died from being stabbed, strangled, shot or beaten. An estimated 100,000 civilians have been killed since the Syrian people rose up against Assad, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since taking power from his father in 2000. Before the country broke into all-out civil war, the Assad regime's secret police and military abducted many thousands of protesters and tortured them to death. The pictures show that these men died from grotesque torture and abuse. Caesar has testified that they died as captives of the Syrian government . Over 100,000 civilians have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Assad has ordered brutal crackdowns since the movement began . David Crane, a former war crime prosecutor who worked in Sierra Leone and interviewed 'Caesar,' compared the atrocities in Syria to those committed by the Nazi in the Holocaust. US Congressman Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Caesar to testify in front of his committee in July. He made the same grim comparison, telling Yahoo News: 'my father had taken photos at Dachau when it was liberated, of the bodies stacked up at the ovens. This is eerily reminiscent. It's absolutely appalling.' The Holocaust Museum, which is in Washington, DC, has previously spoken out about the unspeakable human rights violations in Syria. In February, the museum sent a delegation of observers to Jordan to record the horror conditions faced by refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.","WARNING: GRAPHIC, DISTURBING CONTENT .

"He was known for his infamous hairdryer treatments, sending tremors through even the biggest Manchester United names. But it appears one man was immune from a Sir Alex Ferguson blasting - even when he kung-fu kicked a fan. This Sunday it will be 20 years since Eric Cantona stunned the world when he vaulted an advertisement hoarding and landed his studs in the chest of a Crystal Palace supporter who had been hurling vile abuse in his direction.

But he was spared from one of his manager's high-velocity rollockings - according to then team-mate Gary Pallister. 'We all wondered how the manager would deal with Eric after that,' the former United defender told the Manchester Evening News. 'He had never had the hairdryer. Virtually everyone else had, but not Eric. We wondered if finally this was it. We expected Fergie to go berserk. 'But he didn't. Hardly anything was said immediately after in the dressing room. We couldn't believe it.' Pallister also revealed that the Frenchman, who joined United from bitter rivals Leeds, was often a target of abuse from opposition fans. Cantona was among the few players who avoided Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer, according to Gary Pallister . The Frenchman was banned from football for eight months and ordered to do 120 hours of community service . 'Eric was no angel,' he said. 'We all knew that. He had a short fuse and everybody has a breaking point. That night and moment was Eric's. 'But it wasn't just the tackles and shirt pulling he had to deal with that night that pushed him over the edge. It was the culmination of a lot of abuse Eric had to put up with at every ground he went to. 'You wouldn't believe the kind of vile verbal abuse that was directed at him when we arrived at opposition grounds and got off the bus. 'Even when we went to the horse races, Eric couldn't escape it. I remember at one race meeting he was being spat on from a balcony in the enclosure above where we were standing. 'It was no wonder he cracked. For a guy with a short fuse I actually think he showed a lot of restraint up to that point.' Cantona spent five years at Manchester United before retiring in 1997 at the age of 30 .

"Michael Brown's mother has been named as one of the 'attackers' who assaulted and robbed vendors selling t-shirts commemorating the youngster's death. A report from Ferguson police identified Lesley McSpadden, 34, as one of a group of up to 30 people that ran into the tent and ransacked the stall in the Missouri city on Saturday October 18. Pearlie Gordon, 54, Brown's mother-in-law, and two men were selling 'Justice for Mike Brown' merchandise when the subjects 'jumped out of vehicles and rushed them' during what police are classifying as an armed robbery. Scroll down for video . Investigation: A report from Ferguson's police department identified Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden, 34, as one of a group of up to 30 people that ran into the tent and ransacked the t-shirt stall . According to the document obtained by the Smoking Gun, Gordon told police that McSpadden approached her and said, 'You can't sell this s****.' In response, Gordon reiterated that she was Michael's mother-in-law and said that unless McSpadden had a patent with her son's name on it, she would continue to sell the merchandise. Then McSpadden's mother, Desureia Harris, began to rip down t-shirts hanging on a line, Gordon told officers. While doing it she said: 'You don't know my grandson like that.' Then other members of the group joined in and also began 'tearing her booth apart.' Gordon told the authorities that she was repeatedly struck in the head and knocked to the ground. More than $1500 in merchandise and $400 in cash 'was stolen by unknown subjects' who managed to escape before police arrived. A witness who saw the alleged assault while waiting at a red signal said that she saw subjects 'punching' the t-shirt vendors. The investigation into the incident - which has been classed as an armed robbery - is ongoing. Two days ago it was announced that McSpadden and the slain youngster's father Michael Brown Senior would be speaking at a human rights conference in Switzerland. Embrace; McSpadden attended a get out the vote rally at Greatest St. Mark's Family Church in Ferguson, Missouri, this week ahead of the mid term elections . They are scheduled to address the 53rd Session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture in Geneva on November 12 and 13. With the help of a Saint Louis University law professor, they have set up an online page, dubbed 'Ferguson To Geneva'. It comes nearly 14 weeks after the pair's 18-year-old unarmed son, who is black, was gunned down by white officer, Darren Wilson, in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson. Activists: Two days ago it was announced that McSpadden and the slain youngster's father Michael Brown Senior (left) would be speaking at a human rights conference in Switzerland . The shooting on August 9 triggered a national debate on race relations and months of violent demonstrations, with many protesters claiming the teenager was shot because he was black. Police have said Brown, who was 6ft 4ins and 300lbs, was killed in a scuffle after Wilson told the teenager and his friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. They claim the victim was trying to go for Wilson's gun; however, witnesses, including the friend, told the press that Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. Brown Sr and McSpadden, who have campaigned since their son's death, will leave for Geneva on November 10, the family's attorney, Anthony Gray, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Activists have asked  for advance notice before prosecutors announce whether a Ferguson police officer will face charges in the shooting death of Michael Brown. Demonstration: Tensions flared again in Ferguson on Wednesday night ahead of the grand jury decision. One protester was arrested for failing to disperse following a protest . They said the can help prevent widespread violence if they have 48 hours to prepare for protests. Members of the Don't Shoot Coalition said at a news conference that they want to 'de-escalate violence without de-escalating action' once a grand jury decides whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, for the August 9 shooting of Brown, who was black. The coalition represents more than 50 organizations including union workers, clergy, anti-war activists and black empowerment groups. Its members are leaders of the protests that erupted across the region after Brown's death and have continued in the three months since. Demonstrators on Wednesday criticized the use of tear gas, riot equipment and armored vehicles by county and local police in the early days of the protests. The heavy initial response led Gov. Jay Nixon to summon the National Guard and temporarily put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson crowd control. Stand off: Police and protesters, many wearing Guy Fawkes masks, face each other at the Ferguson police station once again . Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is overseeing the grand jury investigation, met with McPhearson and attorney Denise Lieberman earlier Wednesday and said the coalition's request for 48 hours' notice of a grand jury decision is 'being considered.' The grand jury was expected to hear evidence in Brown's case until mid-November, but McCulloch said Tuesday night that its work could continue for several more weeks. Brown, 18, was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend. A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times. Witness accounts of what happened varied, with some saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrender. Defiant: A protester in a Guy Fawkes mask helps to block traffic outside Ferguson police station . 'After the verdict, no matter what it is, people are going to pour into the street — either in celebration or in rage,' said Montague Simmons, chairman of the Organization for Black Struggle. 'It's in the best interest of the public, the police and elected officials who control the actions of the police to work together to protect the rights of people to engage in civil disobedience and expression of their First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.' Organizers have created 19 'rules of engagement' they want police to follow, including calls to treat protesters as 'citizens and not enemy combatants.' County police Chief Jon Belmar earlier this week reiterated that police do not intend to impede peaceful dissent but said he wouldn't take anything off the table when asked about the use of tear gas and other tactics. 'I have a responsibility...to make sure that everybody walks out of this on the other end,' he said.

"One of the four men arrested amid fears of a Remembrance Sunday terror plot had his passport cancelled after being stopped from travelling to Syria six months ago. Police seized 19-year-old Yousaf Syed’s passport, mobile phone and computer in a raid on his High Wycombe home as part of a probe into potential jihadis. He later received a letter from the Passport Office confirming his passport had been cancelled. Yousaf Syed who has been arrested amid fears of a Remembrance Sunday terror plot. He has links to the so-called Supermarket Jihadi Omar Hussain, pictured . It read: ‘You are a British national who has been involved in Islamist extremist activity. It is assessed in 2013 you intended to travel to Pakistan for extremist purposes. 'It is further assessed that you intended to travel again for extremist purposes in 2014. It is assessed you maintain your intention to travel overseas to participate in terrorist-related activities and such travel presents a risk to UK national security.’ On Thursday evening, Syed was again arrested by armed officers. The Mail on Sunday understands that a weapon – described as a ‘substantial find’ – was recovered from the home of one of his relatives. He and three other unnamed suspects from West London, aged 22, 25, and 27, are being questioned in Central London. Police are allowed to detain the men for a further seven days. Syed, a business studies student at Amersham & Wycombe College, lives with his mother and three siblings. It is understood that he married a 20-year-old woman in May. However, last night community leaders in High Wycombe claimed that Syed was treated ‘disproportionately’ in the initial raid in April, and alleged MI5 had been regularly contacting the teenager and ‘hassling him’ over the past two years. A disturbing image of Big Ben and Parliament exploding into flames was posted on Twitter last night by a notorious jihadi. Umar Shishani, pictured on the poster, who is fighting in Syria, also put up the message: ‘Soon! In all cities of the world.’ Syed attended the same mosque as British extremist Omar Hussain, who once threatened to ‘bomb the UK’. Hussain, a 27-year-old former supermarket security guard – who gave an extraordinary interview to the BBC in which he boasted about fighting with terrorists and laughed about beheadings – managed to travel to Syria to wage war despite being known to police. Further details about the alleged Remembrance Day terror plot have also emerged. Although there had been claims that a knife attack was to have taken place during the Queen’s visit to the Royal British Legion event last night, sources suggest the target may have been military personnel attending a lower-profile event.

Pride: Young men wave pro-Kurdish banners and symbols at the Turkish border this morning as the peshmerga forces arrived . A supporter of the peshmerga holds a large Kurdish flag and a poster of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region President Massoud Barzani . The unprecedented mission comes after Ankara agreed to allow the peshmerga to cross into Syria via Turkey - although the Turkish prime minister reiterated he will not send any ground forces from his own country. After a rousing send-off from thousands of cheering, flag-waving supporters in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Irbil, the peshmerga forces landed at Ruha airport in the early hours of this morning. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the BBC sending the peshmerga was 'the only way to help Kobane, since other countries don't want to use ground troops.' The Islamic State launched its offensive on Kobane and nearby Syrian villages in mid-September. The fighting has so far killed more than 800 people, according to activists. More than 200,000 people have fled across the border into Turkey. The Sunni extremists of ISIS have captured dozens of Kurdish villages around Kobane and still controls parts of the town despite a U.S.-led coalition carrying out dozens of airstrikes targeting the militants.

A convoy of military vehicles transporting Iraqi peshmerga troops to Syria is seen snaking through the Turkish countryside . The deployment of the 150 peshmerga fighters, who were authorized by the Iraqi Kurdish government to go to Kobane, underscores the sensitive political tensions in the region. Turkey's government views the Syrian Kurds defending Kobane as loyal to what Ankara regards as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. That group has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and NATO. Under pressure to take greater action against ISIS - from the West as well as from Kurds inside Turkey and Syria - the Turkish government agreed to let the fighters cross through its territory. But it only is allowing peshmerga forces from Iraq, with whom it has a good relationship, and not those affiliated with the PKK. A separate Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga convoy of vehicles carrying cannons and machine guns crossed into Turkey this morning at the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing at Zakho in northern Iraq. The land convoy and fighters were expected to join up the Mursitpinar and cross  into Syria as one unit. A small group of Syrian rebels entered the embattled border town of Kobane from Turkey today on a mission to help Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State extremists in Syria, activists and Kurdish officials said. The group of around 50 armed men is from the Free Syrian Army, and it's separate from Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters who are also this morning en route to Kobane. Idriss Nassan, a Kurdish official from Kobani, said the FSA group crossed to Kobani through the Mursitpinar border crossing in Turkey. Nassan, who spoke in Mursitpinar, said they travelled in cars but did not have more details. A Kurdish journalist in Kobane and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that a group of about 50 FSA fighters entered the city this morning. The FSA is an umbrella group of mainstream rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad. The political leadership of the Western-backed FSA is based in Turkey, where fighters often seek respite from the fighting.

Peshmerga soldiers carrying Kurdish flags were atop some of the vehicles as they headed from Irbil to the Iraqi-Turkish border crossing. The troops made the victory sign for the cameras. An ambulance and government vehicles blaring their sirens accompanied the convoy. Scores of people waited by the side of the road in villages for the troops to pass. Thousands of people awaited them at the border. The crowd sang and chanted traditional peshmerga songs and had to be pushed back by every vehicle that tried to make its way through the masses. Many people carried colorful Kurdish flags and portraits of the Iraqi Kurdish regional President Massoud Barzani. The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focus in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries under significant threat by the militant group's lightning advance as it seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

The Iraqi Kurdish parliament voted overwhelmingly to send fighters to Kobane, underscoring the growing cooperation among the Kurds in Iraq and Syria. The action marked the first mission for the peshmerga outside Iraq. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. officials 'certainly encourage' the deployment of Iraqi peshmerga forces to Kobane. It will provide much-needed support for the Syrian Kurds, although it is not clear whether Turkey will allow the peshmerga fighters to carry enough weaponry to make an impact. Yesterday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces carried out four airstrikes near Kobani in the past 24 hours, destroying four ISIS fighting positions and a small ISIS unit.

In Berlin yesterday, Syria's neighbors urged European countries at a conference of foreign ministers and representatives from 40 nations to open their doors to more refugees, and for immediate financial and technological help as their infrastructures buckle under the massive influx of civilians fleeing the conflict. Turkey has agreed to train and equip moderate Syrian rebel forces that have for more than three years sought to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. More than 3 million people have fled Syria because of the conflict, mostly to neighboring countries. Another 6 million are displaced within Syria. The conflict began with largely peaceful protests in March 2011 calling for reform. It eventually spiraled into a civil war as people took up arms following a brutal military crackdown on the protests. Islamic extremists, including foreign fighters, have joined the war, playing an increasingly prominent role in the conflict. Thousands have died in battles between opposing rebel groups since the beginning of the year.","150 peshmerga fighters arrived at Ruha airport in Sanilufa at about 1am local time, before setting off for Syria .

"The British banker accused of murdering two women in Hong Kong was reportedly left 'devastated' when his fiancee cheated on him after she moved to New York for her job. Cambridge graduate Rurik Jutting has been charged with two counts of murder after one woman's decapitated body was found in a suitcase on the balcony of his luxury flat, and another with her throat slashed. The former public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate dated a string of beautiful girls from Asia and last year had a relationship with a stunning British fashion student. The ex-girlfriend: Banker Rurik Jutting pictured with his former partner Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie . Last night fresh claims emerged that he was obsessed with having sex with 'two or three women' and held drug-fuelled sex parties lasting for days at his flat. But it was also suggested that he had been left 'devastated' when a fellow City trader cheated on him two years ago after the pair had been engaged to be married. Fashion student: He also dated glamorous British fashion student Sonya Dyer, 29, once said to have described him as her 'hubby' And it was claimed he had vowed to kill himself because of his ongoing depression. Channel 4 News said it had spoken to a former girlfriend who claimed Jutting was deeply unhappy because of his job. The woman, who did not want to be named, dated Jutting for about two months after meeting him in July 2013 – the month he moved to Hong Kong – in a bar where she worked. 'He's a perfectionist,' she told the programme. 'He was a very nice person with me because I was his girlfriend. He was always strict with other people. 'He told me that he had financial problems and some issues with stuff. Last October he told me that he tried to kill himself. I think he tried to kill himself because he's under pressure with his job. He was depressed.' She added: 'He liked a variety of sex, two or three girls. He was never violent towards me.' An acquaintance in the banking world recalled Jutting being distraught two years ago after his then-fiancée – a fellow British trader – cheated on him with another man. The woman, named by The Telegraph as Sarah Butt, 28, had met Jutting in 2010 when they were both working for Barclays in London. However, she reportedly had kissed another man after moving to New York from London to work for Goldman Sachs last year. Although the couple attempted to rekindle their romance - even getting engaged for a short time - Jutting struggled to get over the 'affair' and ended the relationship a short time later. The source said: 'She wanted to marry him pretty fervently and he proposed, but she ended up cheating on him. It was him ultimately him who broke it off. I think he took her infidelity quite badly.' Miss Butt, originally from Bury, Lancashire reportedly joined Barclays Capital from Pricewaterhouse Coopers after studying at Imperial College London. After a year in the U.S. she is now said to be back in the UK. It is understood Miss Butt has had no contact with Jutting since the break-up. 'She's very upset, it's a lot to take in,' a source told the newspaper. Her mother, Tasheen Butt, who lives in Bury having come to the UK from India as a teenager said she did not know about her daughter's relationship with Jutting. Out with the girls: Jutting, who moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year, quit his high-earning job in the city, where expat bankers lead notoriously hedonistic lifestyles . Victim: One of the two women discovered inside Jutting's luxury apartment in Hong Kong. The woman, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, was 30 years old and originally from the Philippines . Horrific death: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after . Jutting is also believed to have dated glamorous British fashion student Sonya Dyer, 29, once said to have described him as her 'hubby'. Asked about him at her flat in West London last night, she tearfully declined to comment. After leaving £34,000-a-year Winchester College, he graduated in 2008 from Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied law and history and was secretary of the university's history society. Jutting then worked as a trader at Barclays Bank in London for two years before joining Merrill Lynch. In 2013, he moved to Merrill's Hong Kong office. He surrounded himself with beautiful Asian women and showed off his new life to friends back home in a series of online updates. Many of the pictures he posted featured young mother Ariane Guarin from the Philippines – known to friends as Yanie. Jesse Lorena (pictured posing with cash) was found by police with her throat slashed at Jutting's apartment . Butchered: Sex workers named locally as Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Jesse Lorena Ruri (right) were found dead at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment in Hong Kong after the investment banker called police . Taste for the high life: Rurik Jutting, 29, drapes an arm around Miss Guarin after moving to Hong Kong . The couple uploaded photographs of themselves to their respective Facebook pages in July and August but appear to have broken up by early September. On September 20, a friend took to Jutting's Facebook page to say she missed the couple and wished they were still together. Miss Guarin had divided her time between looking after her children in a small town in the Philippines and partying with overweight Jutting, who called her his 'beautiful honey'. Miss Guarin, whose family live in Angono, a tiny town ten miles east of Philippine capital Manila, is seen wearing necklaces and rings in shots with Jutting and appeared to come into money, with friends asking her for loans on Facebook, where she boasted of building a new home in the Philippines. Such was their lavish lifestyle together, her friends compared the couple to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie – known by the combined name 'Brangelina' – by calling Rurik and Yanie 'Ruyanie'. But Jutting's complex love life took another twist when a friend of Miss Guarin's told MailOnline she was his current girlfriend. Speaking to MailOnline from Quezon City in the Philippines, the woman said she had been in a relationship with him for two months, and last spoke to him on October 20 – 11 days before he was arrested. Court date: A handcuffed Rurik Jutting is taken to a Hong Kong court by police car after being charged with the murders of the two women . Rurik Jutting's J Residence apartment building, where the bodies of the two women were found, is seen today . She said Jutting was a 'good and intelligent' person who had never displayed any signs of violence, although he was 'very strict' with other women – a symptom of his perfectionism and his desire to 'do the right thing'. She added: 'I can say that he is a good man. A good boyfriend, sweet lover.' Jutting posted on Facebook on Monday last week that he was embarking on a 'new journey', writing: 'Stepping down from the ledge. Burden lifted; new journey begins. Scared and anxious but also excited. The first step is always the hardest.' In Britain, Jutting's stunned family are still coming to terms with his arrest. His mother Helen, 52, who was born in Hong Kong and whose father was a policeman, was not available for comment at the milkshake bar she runs in Woking, Surrey, while his father Graham, 53, a millwright engineer, has declined to comment. The couple have another son who lives in Brighton. Meanwhile the parents of murder victim Sumarti Ningshi have demanded that Hong Kong executes whoever is eventually found guilty of killing her. Ahmad Kaliman, 58, was also quoted by the BBC's Indonesian language service as saying he desperately wants Hong Kong to send his daughter's body home once the investigation into her death is completed, rather than bury her in the territory. 'I appeal to the government to help repatriate my daughter,' he said. Hong Kong formally abolished the death penalty in 1993 while still a British colony and continues to operate an entirely different legal system from the rest of China, where executions are commonplace.","Former public schoolboy Rurik Jutting dated a string of beautiful women .

"Search vessels has reached its designated site in the southern Indian Ocean to join the deep sea search and solve the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. The Fugro Discovery has arrived at Fremantle Port in Western Australia, where the  aircraft is believed to have crashed with 239 people on board. Crews are preparing to resume the sonar searches of the sea floor, more than 1,500 kilometres off the Western Australian coast on Monday with high-tech equipment and video cameras. Experts believe the plane crashed somewhere in the area after veering off course from it's Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight on 8 March. Meanwhile the Go Phoenix arrived on Sunday and will start about 12 days of sonar surveys, according to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Scroll down for video . The Fugro Discovery arrived at Fremantle Port on Sunday and is expected to join the search for MH370 in the Indian Ocean soon . Fugro Discovery (pictured), which along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix, will soon start a new  high-resolution search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . A three-dimensional model of the sea floor terrain, derived from satellite gravity measurements and some from ocean passage soundings. A bathymetric survey currently underway is focussed on gathering more detailed and higher resolution data in preparation for the underwater search phase . The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre says the vessel will conduct operations in the area for about 12 days before sailing to Fremantle to be resupplied. Fugro Equator, which is surveying the search area, is likely to be used as a search vessel when its bathymetric work finishes later this month. More than 111,000 square kilometres of the search area has been analysed and mapped so far. A massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane. GO Phoenix, the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search, departed Jakarta, Indonesia more than a week ago, after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter. Chief commissioner from the ATSB Martin Dolan says the vessel is likely to arrive late Sunday. 'When they get going, they will deploy an underwater sonar in on the end of very long cable, eight kilometres, they will tow that sonar in on a toefish, which contains sonar equipoment, close to ocean floor, 100 metres,' he said. 'They send out sonar signals, get them back, a width of about 1.5 kms, that will go up the cable to vessel and crews to look and anaylise for anything for interest.' 'It will be recorded and transferred in batches, re-anaylised so nothing to be missed.' The new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys, which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern Indian Ocean, where it's believed to have run out of fuel. The primary search area - dubbed the 'priority area' - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, roughly the size of Croatia, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. 'Three things that make it complicated is that we know aircraft will be found there but have to prioritise high probability areas,' said Chief Dolan. 'Also towing expensive equipment, we need to know closely what the ocean floor is like, the sea floor is quite complex, not just a simple matter, additional attention is needed for some areas to cover them properly.' 'Lastly data itself requires a specialised eye to understand, so we also have the capacity to review.' The chief also mentioned the weather conditions, which can be quite challenging because it is so unpredictable. Images from the bathymetric survey being conducted in the latest MH370 search area: They provide information  including the contours, depths and hardness of the ocean floor to ensure the safe and effective operation of equipment in the search . These images show remnants of volcanoes, towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named Broken Ridge, an extensive linear, mountainous sea floor structure . 'Weather is improving and the course of this month is as good as it gets, make the searching as easy as possible but still big swells, storm will come through.' Vessels will also be joining GO Phoenix including Furgo Discovery which has completed fit out works in Durban, South Africa and is en-route to Australia where it is expected to arrive in Fremantle on Sunday. Furgo Equator, the vessel currently being used to survey the search area, is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of October. 'The second vessel, Furgo will be there about the end of the third week of this month, the Equator in Perth by the end of the month to do its first underwater search. This bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level (purple) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level (red) Very few marine surveys have taken place in the MH370 search area. Previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth . 'It's not clear how long that search will take,' Transport Minister Warren Truss said, according to the ABC. `We would hope, obviously, to find the aircraft on the first day, but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact.' The chief commissioner said there are several 'high probability' areas located that will be searched in the southern arc of the Indian Ocean. 'The second vessel will go to another high probability area and the third vessel will work between those two areas,' he said. The area being searched for MH370 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc (grey) in the southern Indian Ocean, 1800km off the Australian coast . The yellow markings represent the area surveyed via bathymetric surveys . 'Until we have more solid data in flight data by boxes no one will  be able to come to form a view, people will speculate.' 'We want to givce some certainty of closure to families. The current plan is scheduled to take up to a year but we hope we won't need that.' 'There are no guarantees.' The search operation is a joint effort by Australia and Malaysia costing $57 million. There has been many theories as to what happened to the Malaysian airlines flight MH370 but there's been increased interest on the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah who reportedly used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island.","Two search vessels have arrived in Western Australia .

"Islamic State militants and sympathisers are triumphantly circulating images of a 10-year-old boy they claim has been 'martyred' while fighting alongside his father in Syria.

He is said to have died fighting alongside his father in Syria in recent weeks .

Misled: Abu Ubaidah posing with a man understood to be his father, who militants named as 'Baghdadi' Several images, which have not been independently verified, emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to YouTube in September. The original video - distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A'amaq - is understood to have since been removed, but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by ISIS militants and their sympathisers on social media. One image shows the boy standing inside a house, grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over. Another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars. Other images show him posing with a  man understood to be his father, who militants named as 'Baghdadi'. In those images the boy identified as Abu Ubaidah is seen calmly holding another large rifle while surrounded by bearded men wearing military clothing.

Smiling: Describing the child as ISIS' youngest foreign jihadist, chilling photographs taken before his alleged death show him grinning at the camera, wearing military fatigues and brandishing a huge assault rifle . ISIS - which rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after establishing a self-described caliphate in the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under its control - has long groomed children to take part in jihad. The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series. The film showed very young boys being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist when they grow up, and being forced to recite calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'. In the footage, ISIS' PR man Abu Moussa - who has since been killed - describes how every male child under the age of 15 is forced to attend a 'Sharia camp' to be taught the militant group's radical interpretation of Islam. At the age of 16 the boys are sent to a military camp, where they are given intensive training in the art of warfare. After that they are prepared for possible future as either front-line militia or suicide bombers. Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime. Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace. Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul. 'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said. Islamic State militants have carried out mass executions, set up slave markets where women are sold for sex for $10 and used child soldiers in what may amount to systematic war crimes in Iraq that demand prosecution, the UN reported last week. Investigators believe as many as 2,500 women and children have been captured, subjected to sex attacks and then sold for around $10  by extremist militants in Iraq. In August, ISIS is believed to have taken 450-500 women and girls to the Tal Afar citadel in Iraq's Nineveh region where '150 unmarried girls and women, predominantly from the Yazidi and Christian communities, were reportedly transported to Syria, either to be given to ISIS fighters as a reward or to be sold as sex slaves'. According to investigators, slave markets have been set up in Raqqa, Syria and the al-Quds area of Maturat in Iraq - partly to attract new Islamic State fighters. Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State. The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs. The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Prepared: A Kurdish fighter takes up his position to fight the Islamic State jihadists . Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today. This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes. While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre. News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group. Still flying: This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes . Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago . Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task. Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night. Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night, adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes, which have continued into this morning, Islamic State fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of Kobane and now control one third of the city.","Islamic State sympathisers share images of 10-year-old 'martyr' on Twitter .

"'The West Ham way was beating Manchester United 4-0 on a snowy December night in 2010'... Click here to read our blogger's view on exactly what constitutes the 'West Ham way' West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan has hit back at Sir Alex Ferguson’s claims in his updated autobiography that he doesn’t know what the ""West Ham way"" is. Ferguson wrote, in updated chapters of his book, that he didn't understand the phrase, before going on to claim that the West Ham squad is 'a team of very average players' helped by Sam Allardyce. But Sullivan has hit back by saying that the Hammers – who play Manchester City on Saturday and are fourth in the Premier League – are playing attacking football that fans want to see.

David Sullivan (right), pictured alongside co-owner David Gold, has hit back at Sir Alex Ferguson's claims . Writing in the West Ham programme, Sullivan said: 'I read an article this week in which Sir Alex Ferguson said he was not sure what the ""West Ham Way"" was. 'Personally I think what we are witnessing right now is exactly that. We are playing attacking football with everybody giving 100 per cent and we are getting results at the same time. 'Our strikers have scored nine times this season and given us what we sorely lacked last year - goals.' West Ham have won five of their first nine Premier League matches this season, beating Liverpool and Manchester City in the process, and are unlikely occupants of a top-four position.","Sir Alex Ferguson claims he does not understand the 'West Ham way'

"The family of the black teenager shot dead by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri, have claimed that he knew all along he would get away with it. Relatives of Michael Brown said that Darren Wilson had such ‘brazen confidence’ that he must have been thinking he would never be prosecuted when he opened fire. They claimed that he treated the unarmed 18-year-old as ‘less than human’ by shooting him six times as he had his hands raised in surrender. Scroll down for video . Killed: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown's family has claimed Wilson was 'brazen' in shooting the teenager multiple times, knowing he would suffer no consequences . 'Less than human': The family's submission, to be given to a U.N. committee tomorrow, says Wilson's disregard to Michael Brown's body after he shot him dead shows endemic racism in Ferguson's police force . Submission: Members of Brown's family, including his father Michael Brown Senior, left, and Lesley McSpadden, right, have written a report on the event for a UN torture committee . Brown’s family also called for the embattled Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson to step down because his department has targeted blacks in a ‘predatory and degrading manner’. And they demanded that all protesters who were arrested during the unrest in August be given an amnesty because they had been treated unfairly. Brown’s family will appear before the United Nations Committee Against Torture in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday to argue that what happened in Ferguson amounts to a breach of the organization’s rules. A grand jury is currently deciding whether to indict Wilson, 28, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. Leaks reported by the St Louis Post Dispatch and the New York Times suggest that he will not be prosecuted, and the community is said to be preparing itself for yet more violence. Demonstrations: Brown's death sparked protests and vigils in Ferguson, where riot police officers came toe-to-toe with furious activists accusing them of racial violence . 'Brazen': The family says the killing is part of a culture of discrimination. Above, investigators, not including Wilson, inspect Brown's body after the killing . 'Intimidation': The Brown family has also demanded that Missouri's Governor apologize for the treatment of protesters, who were met with a heavy police presence . When Brown was shot dead on August 9, Ferguson tore itself apart in two weeks of angry protests and looting that was met with a militarized response by the police which sparked a national debate on race relations. MailOnline has seen a copy of the report that Browns’ family will present to the UN, and it gives one of the starkest illustrations yet of the family’s sense of injustice. In it, Brown’s father Michael Brown Sr and his mother Leslie McSpadden speak of their anger that their son’s dead body was left bleeding in the street for four hours. They write: ‘Given the history of racial tensions in the city of Ferguson, this particularly disrespectful treatment of Brown’s body and callous disregard for the trauma it could cause Ferguson residents repeated and reinforced the longstanding degrading treatment of black racial minorities by an overwhelmingly white police force. Severe: The world was shocked by the use of heavy weaponry and riot gear in response to the protests . Severe: Ranks of armed officers faced down protesters, who were buffeted with tear gas and stun grenades . ‘Not only did the abandonment of the body convey to residents that the police officer regarded the black youth as less than human, but it also illustrated the officer’s brazen confidence that he would not be punished for such unwarranted violence’. In the document Brown’s family call for the immediate arrest of Wilson, who is in hiding at an undisclosed location. They also want the Ferguson police department to be placed under ‘federal receivership to hold it accountable for systematically targeting and harassing residents of color in a predatory and degrading manner’. Among their other calls is a demand from Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to apologize for the ‘intimidation and excessive force used against’ protesters. They also say they want an ‘amnesty to those protesters arrested while protesting the killing of Michael Brown.’ Ferguson and St Louis are currently on edge as they wait for the verdict of the grand jury amid reports that Chief Jackson will be made to step down, though he has denied the claims. Meanwhile, what actually happened on that night is still disputed, with witnesses giving wildly different accounts. What is clear is that Wilson stopped Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson as they walked along Canfield Drive in Ferguson as they were heading back to Brown’s house. Wilson drove off, then backed up and stopped in the middle of the street to talk to them again. Protests: Thousands have taken to the streets of Ferguson in outrage over the incident . Response: Police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations . In leaked reports of his testimony to the grand jury, which is held in secret, Wilson supposedly said that Brown pushed him back into his police SUV as he was trying to get out and pinned him down. At that point Wilson reached for his gun and fired two shots, one of which hit Brown, whose blood was found inside the car. The account did not explain why Wilson then shot Brown five more times in the front as, according to some witnesses, he put his hands in the air to surrender. Brown’s supporters are worried that Wilson is trying to exploit the law in Missouri which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat. Wilson’s account also flatly contradicts that of witnesses including Johnson, who was standing next to him at the time. Johnson has said that Wilson was the aggressor and grabbed Brown's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot. Another witness, whose name has been withheld, has also reportedly told the grand jury that Brown did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot him but instead they were 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' In addition to the grand jury, a separate federal prosecution into Brown’s shooting was started by former Attorney General Eric Holder - but reportedly has too little evidence to take Wilson to court. Brown’s parents' trip to Geneva is being sponsored by the U.S. Human Rights Network, a nonprofit organization. According to the Ferguson to Geneva official website, ‘the goal of this trip is not only to achieve justice in Ferguson, but is intended to unite governments around the world against the human rights violations that result from racial profiling and police violence.’","Relatives of Brown, including parents, attack police officer who killed teen .

U.S. Senator John McCain met Ukrainian opposition leaders in Kiev on Saturday and voiced support for protesters camped out for weeks in the capital, a move sure to anger Moscow for what it sees as Western meddling in its backyard. The street protests started after the November 21 decision by President Viktor Yanukovich - seeking the best possible deal for Ukraine to stave off bankruptcy - to walk away from a trade pact with Europe at the last minute and seek closer ties with its old Soviet master. The movement has since grown in size and vehemence, bringing tens of thousands onto the streets in a series of rallies, becoming an all-out protest against the president and his cabinet. Greetings: U.S. Senator John McCain waves to pro-European integration protesters during a mass rally at Independence Square in Kiev . We are with you: McCain told more than 200,000 EU supporters rallying in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, that Washington backed their desire for European integration . Face in the crowd: U.S. Senator John McCain greets well-wishers. About 200,000 anti-government demonstrators converged on the central square in a dramatic demonstration after nearly four weeks of daily protests . McCain is the latest of a string of European and American dignitaries to tour the sprawling protest camp set up behind tall barricades - prompting Russia to accuse the West of excessive involvement. McCain was due to be joined by the chairman of the Senate's Europe subcommittee, Chris Murphy, on Sunday. 'I am proud of the people of Ukraine and their steadfast efforts for democracy,' McCain told reporters after meeting the country's Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara. McCain then met opposition leaders - the ex-boxing champion Vitaly Klitchko, former economy minister Arseny Yatsenyuk and far right nationalist Oleh Tyahnybog - who are calling for Yanukovich's government to resign and for early elections. One voice: Pro-European integration protesters gather under an image of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in Independence Square in Kiev December 14, 2013 . Vocal: Supporters of Ukranian President President Viktor Yanukovich hold flags and shout slogans during a rally in central Kiev.

'I . heard he (McCain) was here. It's nice that they know of us, that they . remember us. It is great that they support us,' said Volodimir . Tarabanov, 28, who works for a delivery company in Kiev. Thousands . of Yanukovich supporters staged a rival rally in Kiev on Saturday, many . bused in from Donetsk and other cities in eastern Ukraine - the . traditional stronghold of the president's Party of Regions. Support: U.S. Senator John McCain met Ukrainian opposition leaders in Kiev on Saturday and voiced support for protesters camped out for weeks in the capital, a move sure to anger Moscow for what it sees as Western meddling in its backyard . U.S. Senator John McCain, speaks as Democratic senator from the state of Connecticut, Chris Murphy, second left, and Opposition leader Oleh Tyahnybok, right, stand around him during a Pro-European Union rally in Independence Square in Kiev . 'We are here to support the president and stability,' 18-year-old Maria Nikolayeva said, holding the Party of Regions blue flag. 'Yanukovich is our best prospect at the moment ... I don't see any alternative.' In an attempt to defuse weeks of unrest, Yanukovich on Saturday dismissed the head of Kiev's state administration and a national security aide over the violence on November 30. Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka said two more police officials involved that night were under investigation. But protesters continued to stream into the capital for the weekend protest. Talks between the government and the opposition on Friday appeared to go nowhere. Sweden's foreign minister said Russia should not feel threatened if Ukraine moved closer to the European Union. 'Ukraine has a free trade agreement (FTA) with Russia and we have nothing against that,' Carl Bildt told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Monaco. 'Why should they object that the Ukraine has an FTA with the EU? It is a win-win for Ukraine and Russia. Why they should see everything as a zero sum game? It's not,' said Bildt, who was closely involved in EU talks with the Ukraine. The proximity of rival demonstrations in Kiev - separated only by a line of riot police - raised fears of fresh violence. 'The most difficult matters should and can only be solved at the negotiating table. People should not be driven away from their work, from their families,' Prime Minister Mykola Azarov told supporters. 'Let's tell the people to go back home to their families and their business.' Sergei Bychok, a 43-year-old electrician, said he came to the pro-government rally because he wanted stability. Encouraging words:  'To all Ukraine, America stands with you,' he called out to the cheering crowd. 'The free world is with you, America is with you, I am with you... Ukraine will make Europe better and Europe will make Ukraine better' Message from America: McCain told more than 200,000 EU supporters rallying in the Ukrainian capital Kiev on December 15 that Washington backed their desire for European integration . 'I got my salary but a lot of people are here because they are afraid they won't,' he said in a whisper, referring to widespread accusations among Yanukovich opponents that the authorities paid or pressured people to attend their rally. In the square held by the anti-government protesters - now known as the 'Maidan', meaning 'Square', or the 'Euro-maidan' - the atmosphere was peaceful. For those who stayed overnight, the day began with early morning prayers followed by an aerobics session led from the stage. The crowds grew denser towards the evening with people holding up placards picturing Yanukovich and Azarov behind bars and sporting stickers reading 'Raise Ukraine!'. 'I'm here for Europe and against Yanukovich. For me it's almost the same because it's the European Union association that is our chance to rid Ukraine of corruption,' said Oleh, a 22-year-old engineering student. 'We will be here a month or as long as it takes.'","U.S. Senator John McCain visits anti-government protesters in Kiev .

"These are the injuries suffered by a political activist beaten viciously by Hong Kong police who moved into clear pro-democracy demonstrations last night. Police handcuffed Ken Tsang Kin-chiu, a member of the pro-democracy Civic Party, before dragging him into a dark corner next to a protest site where they punched and kicked him for several minutes. Hong Kong authorities said the officers had been 'removed' from their posts while an investigation was carried out after the whole incident was filmed and broadcast by local network TVB.

Caught: The whole incident involving plainclothes police was filmed and broadcast by local network TVB . Moments earlier: Mr Tsang is pictured here being taken away by police before he suffered a beating . It came amid some of the worst violence since the start of the pro-democracy rallies in Hong Kong two weeks ago, as police attacked demonstrators who had tried to occupy a tunnel. Demonstrators and police fought running battles overnight, with officers using their fists, batons and pepper spray to beat back crowds gathered near the city government headquarters. Police dragged away dozens of activists, tore down barricades and removed concrete slabs the protesters used as road blocks around the underpass in an operation they said was needed to restore public order. Police said they arrested 45 protesters in the early hours, using pepper spray on those who resisted. Four officers were injured, police said. The attack was launched hours after a large group of protesters blockaded the underpass, expanding their protest zone after police earlier cleared them away from other streets. Police said they had to disperse the protesters because they were disrupting public order and gathering illegally.

'I have to stress here that even though protesters raised their hands in their air it does not mean it was a peaceful protest,' said police spokesman Tsui Wai-Hung. He claimed some protesters kicked the officers and attacked them with umbrellas. None of those arrested were hurt, he said, despite the television footage showing six plainclothes police beating a handcuffed protester. Mr Tsui did not provide details of the incident when questioned by reporters. Alan Leong, leader of Hong Kong's pro-democracy Civic Party, identified the person in the video as Ken Tsang Kin-chiu. Civic Party legislator Dennis Kwok, a lawyer representing Mr Tsang, said police also beat Mr Tsang inside a police station. Mr Tsang had since been taken to hospital, Mr Kwok said. Mr Tsang is a social worker. The Hong Kong Social Workers' Association said it planned to march to police HQ in the evening to protest. Photographs showing Tsang with bruising on his face and body, released by democracy activists, sparked anger and condemnation. Human rights group Amnesty International said the police involved in what appeared to be a 'vicious attack against a detained man' should face justice . Prominent student leader Joshua Wong said trust between police and activists has now ebbed to an all-time low. 'The proper action police should take is to bring the protester to the police car, not to take him away and then punch and kick him for four minutes,' he told reporters.

Police had previously been criticised for firing tear gas on umbrella-wielding protesters as demonstrations began on September 28 in a move that riveted the world's attention. Demonstrators have also accused them of failing to come to their aid during frequent attacks from violent pro-government thugs, who are rumoured to be paid-off members of triad gangs. Hong Kong's security chief sought to douse tensions over the video, expressing 'concern' and promising a 'just and fair investigation'. 'The policemen who are involved in the incident have been removed from their current working positions,' Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok said without specifying how many officers were being probed. Police, again without referring to Tsang, said in a statement they had used minimum force, including pepper spray, to disperse the protesters who had gathered illegally overnight. The operation was the toughest against largely student protesters and came after demonstrators swarmed into a tunnel on a four-lane thoroughfare, halting traffic and chanting for universal suffrage.

Pro-democracy protesters hide behind umbrellas to protect themselves from police pepper spray . In intense scenes overnight, a wall of police armed with shields and batons marched before dawn on crowds who had erected new barricades in a road tunnel next to the headquarters of the city's embattled government. Clutching the umbrellas that have become emblematic of their fight for full democracy, some protesters were pulled to the ground, handcuffed and hauled away by officers. The violence was among the worst seen since the start of rallies that have drawn huge crowds calling for Beijing to grant the semi-autonomous city the right to hold free elections. A police statement said officers had warned that 'advancing against police cordon line even with their arms raised is not a peaceful act', and had appealed to the demonstrators to 'stay calm and restrained'. 'There were so many police. They punched people ... We are peaceful,' Danny Chiu, a student in his 20s, told Reuters, breaking down in tears. Ben Ng, an 18-year-old student, was with protesters near a newly built barricade when the baton-wielding contingent approached. 'Police used pepper spray without any threat or warning. Protesters were beaten by police,' he said. 'Both protesters and police, their emotions are very unstable.' The scene inside the tunnel before police moved in to clear away protesters .

The protesters used concrete blocks taken from nearby drainage ditches to block the tunnel after seizing it . As in other protest areas the demonstrators used zip-ties to bind together the parts of their barricades . Protesters have been demanding full democracy for the city. They are also calling for its pro-Beijing leader, Leung Chun-ying, to step down. When negotiating the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from Britain, China's ruling Communist leaders agreed to a 'one country, two systems' that would preserve Western-style civil liberties and broad autonomy in the territory, while promising eventual democracy. Protesters see Beijing as reneging on that promise. The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government. Organizers say as many as 200,000 people thronged the streets for peaceful sit-ins after police used tear gas to disperse the unarmed protesters. The numbers have since dwindled and their campaign, now into its third week, has caused traffic chaos and drained public support for their actions. Beijing issued its harshest condemnations yet of the protests, calling them illegal, bad for business and against Hong Kong's best interests. The central government has become increasingly impatient with the demonstrations, the biggest challenge to Beijing's authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997. A front-page editorial Wednesday in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece, condemned the protests and said 'they are doomed to fail.' 'Facts and history tell us that radical and illegal acts that got their way only result in more severe illegal activities, exacerbating disorder and turmoil,' the commentary said. 'Stability is bliss, and turmoil brings havoc,' it said. Pro-democracy protesters watch as police gather prior to the confrontation . However, there were no signs that the central government was planning to become directly involved in suppressing the demonstrations, which are pushing for greater say in choosing the territory's next leader in 2017 elections. Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. In language freighted with political symbolism, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, was quoted as telling Hong Kong legislators at a banquet Tuesday that the protest movement 'is a serious social and political incident.' Zhang said the movement challenged Beijing's authority and had caused the city to suffer huge economic losses. They had 'hurt the basis of Hong Kong's rule of law, democratic development, social harmony, international image and its relations with the mainland,' he said. Zhang called for an end to the protests as soon as possible to avoid further losses to Hong Kong's citizenry as a whole.","Ken Tsang was dragged away from protest site and beaten for four minutes .

The prominent Hisham Mubarak Law Center said in a Facebook post that five of Ms al-Sabbagh's fellow protesters who had given investigators their account of the incident were charged with assaulting police and taking part in an illegal demonstration. The interior ministry said it was investigating the death, but suggested Islamist 'infiltrators' were to blame. The Socialist Popular Alliance Party released a statement on Sunday, blaming Cairo police for  Ms al-Sabbagh's death. Today marks the fourth anniversary of the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak as part of the Arab Spring. By Sunday afternoon, Egyptian security officials said clashes between police and Islamist protesters in an eastern Cairo district have left nine demonstrators dead, taking the total death toll to 11. They say the Sunday clashes in the Matariyah area also injured 13. Authorities had tightened security in Cairo and other cities ahead of today's anniversary after Islamists called for protests against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Sunday's anniversary of the uprising against Mubarak is a test of whether Islamists and liberal activists have the resolve to challenge Egypt's U.S.-backed government once again. As mourners gathered for Ms al-Sabbagh's funeral, police shot and killed 'an armed pro-Muslim Brotherhood protester' in Alexandria. The man has been 'shooting randomly with an automatic rifle while marching with a number of pro-Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Alexandria's Al-Awayed district,' Egyptian media reports. Police also arrested another man with an automatic rifle, also in the march, along with two men who had Molotov cocktails,according to an interior ministry statement. Security forces have been stamping out dissent since the army ousted president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July 2013 after mass protests against his rule. Dozens of protesters were killed during last year's anniversary of the revolt centred in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Separately, a bomb targeted policemen stationed outside a Cairo sports club, the sources said. In the Nile Delta region of Baheira, about 170 km (104 miles) from Cairo, two militants were killed when bombs they were planting exploded, state television reported. In Cairo, riot police backed by soldiers in armoured vehicles sealed off strategic roads, including ones leading to Tahrir Square. In her honour: The funeral cortege shout slogans during Ms al-Sabbagh's funeral in Alexandria, carrying a flag with her likeness . Police claim Ms  al-Sabbagh was killed by an Islamist infiltrator, but the socialist Popular Alliance Party say she was killed by police shooting into the crowd . Tears: Large crowds of mourners ghathered in Alexandria to join the funeral cortege for the 32-year-old mother-of-one . Ms al-Sabbagh was a political activist and a well-known member of the left-wing Socialist Popular Alliance Party . The mother-of-one was shot during a non-violent protest as she visited ahrir Square to lay a commemorative wreath on the eve of the anniversary of the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak . Mursi supporters gathered near Tahrir and held up photographs of him, a witness said. Security forces rounded them up. They also used teargas to disperse a protest in Cairo's Ramses Square, officials said. In the Cairo suburb of Matariya, security forces fired teargas as around 900 people protested. Security forces were also dispatched to Rabaa Square in northeast Cairo, where hundreds of Mursi supporters were killed in August 2013 at a protest camp. Islamists have been calling for protests today,  to revive what they say was the 'revolution' that overthrew Mubarak. It also briefly brought to power Islamist president Mohamed Morsi who was toppled by the then army chief Sisi in July 2013. Morsi's supporters often hold small rallies that police quickly disperse. On Friday, an 18-year-old female protester was killed in clashes in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. Police had warned they would confront protests 'decisively.' Authorities have cracked down on the Islamists since the military overthrew Morsi after a year in power, and hundreds have been killed in clashes. Scores of policemen and soldiers have also been killed in militant attacks. Shots fired: Ms Al-Sabbagh can be seen, right, hitting the ground as a fellow protester comes to her aide .

A fellow protester carries the injured Ms al Sabbagh from the scene after she was shot . In mourning: The coffin of  Shaimaa el-Sabagh is carried out of the Zenhom morgue in Cairo, early Sunday . Bird shot is designed to be used in shotgun shells and consist of spheres of metal, or bb's, that can be packed into a shell and which separate when fired. It was originally made from lead, but is now made from steel, tungsten and other materials. The amunintion was designed for shooting birds but it can injure larger animals. In 2006 American Vice-President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a fellow hunter with it. His victim was not severely injured. Birdshot is used by law enforcement as a non-lethal alternative to shot gun pellets and is often used in riot and protest situations. Police also replace the slugs with rubber bullets. The crackdown has also extended to leftwing and secular dissidents who initially supported Morsi's overthrow but have since turned against the new authorities, accusing them of being authoritarian. Yesterday's central Cairo protest was organised by the Socialist Popular Alliance party. Party member Adel el-Meligy said: 'The party decided to hold a symbolic protest to commemorate the anniversary of the January 25 revolution.' He said police fired tear gas, birdshot and arrested the party's secretary general and five other young members. The 18-day anti-Mubarak revolt had been fuelled by police abuses and the corruption of the strongman's three decade rule, but the police have since regained popularity amid widespread yearning for stability. Activists, including those who spearheaded the anti-Mubarak revolt, have accused Sisi of reviving aspects of the former autocrat's rule. Sisi and his supporters deny such allegations, and point to his widespread popularity and support for a firm hand in dealing with protests, which are seen as damaging to an economic recovery. The anniversary will be marked just days after a court ordered the release of Mubarak's two sons, Gamal and Alaa, pending a corruption retrial along with their father. Another court had dismissed charges against Hosni Mubarak over the deaths of protesters.

"Ryan Giggs carried on former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's tradition by having a glass of wine with opposition bosses after matches, but jokes he opted for a can of Red Stripe instead. Giggs took over as caretaker manager following the sacking of David Moyes last April for the final four games of the Barclays Premier League season – winning two, drawing one and losing the other. The Old Trafford legend was a contestant for the club's Big United Quiz 2015 and answered a question about whether he kept the tradition alive: 'I did. Yes. Every one. Can of Red Stripe.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch former manager Sir Alex Ferguson swear on the Big United Quiz . Ryan Giggs carried on former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's tradition when he took charge .

One game involved the  legends trying to put 10 shirts on the fastest while Tinchy Stryder (right) looks on . Who was United's greatest-ever player? Team Rooney: Eric Cantona . The fans' answer: Ryan Giggs . Which United player do the fans think would be most likely to win X Factor? Team Giggs: Wayne Rooney . The fans' answer: Wayne Rooney . Who would be most successful on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here? Team Rooney: Wayne Rooney . The fans' answer: Wayne Rooney . Who do United fans rate as best dressed? Team Giggs: Wayne Rooney . The fans' answer: Robin van Persie . What's the best pre-match superstition? Team Giggs: Pint of beer . The fans' answer: Wearing a United shirt . The 41-year-old was a captain at the quiz and had rapper Tinchy Stryder and actor Andrew Whyment, better known as Kirk Sutherland from Coronation Street, on his three-man team. Their opposition was Wayne Rooney – taking a break from captaining United and England to lead United team-mate Juan Mata and comedian Justin Moorhouse in the  quiz aired on MUTV. There were a few awkward moments, such as when Rooney's team were asked to name which person a poll of United supporters voted for as their 'greatest-ever player'. Rooney's team picked Eric Cantona, only for the answer to be Giggs – the man sat opposite them. But Rooney wasn't given an easy ride, either. The clip of him singing with Ed Sheeran was shown in full, before host  Angus Deayton asked the 29-year-old about his ambitions outside of football. Rooney admitted he would like to feature on X Factor some day, but that he would draw the line at I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. 'Maybe when I've finished playing I would like to do something with X Factor,' he said. Other highlights included Moorhouse and Stryder trying to do keepie uppies with vegetables, and Rooney and Giggs having a race to see who could put 10 different United shirts on the fastest. In the end Rooney's team won 20-17, but he'll be more glad this year's quiz went off without any fuss like it did in 2011.

To do so, he swept back some imaginary golden locks before pointing to Ferguson, pretending to kick a boot then holding his eye. Sir Alex told him: 'That'll cost you.' But Ferguson had his moments on the annual quiz, too. In January 2013, he lost his temper during another game of charades, swearing after having to explain Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal. He turned to the production team to tell them: 'You better edit that out.' They never did.

He had been travelling to Australia to undertake a professional placement abroad as part of his university degree. His funeral came after a painstaking four-month wait before victims' bodies were released by investigating authorities. 'The last four months has been a desperate and sad time for us as a family but we are relieved to have been able to bring Ben home and accord him with all the love and respect he deserves,' his parents said in a statement before the service. 'Although we have had a very hard time as a family we are very conscious that there are still nine passengers from the flight that have not yet been identified. 'Our hearts are with their families and we hope they soon receive the news they are desperately waiting for. 'The forthcoming funeral is about Ben but we will also wish to remember all the other 297 victims of MH17, especially the 80 children and numerous young adults.

He was shown beaming at the camera clutching a sporting trophy, playing cricket and tennis, in a swimming pool and striking a Usain Bolt pose. Andrea Arlidge, headteacher of Wellsway School, which Mr Pocock attended, said the sportsman would be sorely missed.

"Heart-breaking video footage and photographs of terrified school students aboard the doomed Sewol South Korean ferry as it begins to capsize have emerged today. In footage recovered from a phone belonging to one of the passengers aboard the ill-fated Sewol ferry, a student can be heard saying: 'This is fun'. Clearly unaware of the severity of their situation, another says: 'This is like Titanic.' Moments later, as the ferry begins to tilt and shake, one young boy can be heard saying: 'I want to get off. We don't want to die.' Pictures from the phone show groups of terrified young men wearing life jackets as . they attempt to make sense of the terrifying situation. Scroll down for video . This picture, taken with a mobile phone by deceased South Korean high school student Park Su-hyeon, shows a group of students wearing life jackets and holding on to what they can as the South Korean ferry sinks. The boy also filmed the terrifying scene . A boy on the bottom bunk fixes his life jacket and the ship begins to capsize . The male students sit on the floor to avoid being flung from their beds and the ferry rocks from side to side . One of the boys shouts 'This is like Titanic' as the vessel begins to tilt and shake. Moments later, the boys begin to panic - with some saying they don't want to die and they want to get off the ship . Towards the end of the footage, found on a phone belonging to Park Su-hyeon, 17, one child can be heard documenting his last words - saying: 'This looks like the end'. Another poignantly says: 'These are pictures we need to take as our last memories,' before another boy cuts in and says: 'Mom, Dad, I love you.' The harrowing footage comes as an off-duty captain claims he warned the ship shouldn't carry too much cargo because it wasn't stable enough. He says these concerns were ignored by operators. The captain, whom prosecutors will only identify by his surname, Shin, was on vacation on the day of the tragedy two weeks ago. At the time, the ship was carrying 476 people, mostly from one high school. Only 174 people survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members. The ferry was piloted April 16 by a substitute captain, Lee Joon-seok, who is now being detained along with 14 other crew members who were involved in navigating the Sewol. One of the young males laughs says 'This is fun!' as the ship tilts . One of the students shouts 'I want to get off. I mean it'. The footage was recovered from the phone of Park Su-hyeon, who perished in the tragedy on April 16 . Another boy can be heard saying 'We don't want to die, we don't want to die.' An off-duty captain claims he told ferry operators he had concerns about the stability of the ferry before it sunk . Yesterday, heartbreaking footage emerged showing passengers trapped on board the sinking South Korean ferry desperately trying to break windows before the ship disappears beneath the surface. In the harrowing video, an arm can be seen hammering on the glass in a frantic attempt to reach rescuers who are just a few feet away on the other side. Moments later, the ferry sinks below the waves, leaving the passengers with no hope of escaping alive or the rescue boats of saving them. Today's footage was taken from the phone of 17-year-old student Su-hyeon  - who was one of about 250 high school students aboard the ill-fated ferry. After the student's body was recovered, officers returned the boy's personal items to his family - who found the footage on his phone. The boy's father released to video to local media earlier this week - saying lessons must be learnt from his son's death. When Choi . Seung-ho, South Korean television broadcaster, introduced the footage . on Newstapa, he said: 'This is by far the most heartbreaking . scene I have seen in my 27-year broadcasting career.' Some of the boys take a moment to record their final words. It is thought around 150 of the 443 passengers aboard the ship were students . The announcer tells passengers not to move from their cabins. Later, crew told investigators they thought this would be the safest place for them . Su-hyeon’s video begins at 8:52am - three minutes before ferry officials sent the first distress signal to maritime controllers on shore. As panic mounts in the cabin, an announcer can be heard telling the children to stay where they were and hold on to what they could. Ferry officials later told investigators they thought this was the safest option. Moments later, one student says: 'This is going to be a lot of fun if we get it onto our Facebook.' At 8:57, another announcement is made and, clearly panicked, one boy asks: 'Should I call Mom? Mom, this looks like the end of me.' In footage taken from another video of student Park Ye-seul, who also died on the ferry, a group of girls can be hear cheering as helicopters arrive. The off duty captain of the Sewol claims he warned the ferry company renovations had altered the balance of the ship and undermined its anti-rolling ability . However, footage of rescuers show coast guards did not attempt to save those below deck - where both student would have been trapped. The footage is being reviewed as part of ongoing investigations in to the tragedy. Meanwhile, the off duty captain's claims he warned ship owners of the vessel's instability are also being investigated. Yang . Jung-jin, a senior prosecutor on the team investigating the incident, . wouldn't say when the captain warned the company and didn't know whether . Shin made multiple warnings about stability. A . stability test report on January 24 from the Korean Register of . Shipping showed the ferry became top-heavy and less stable after a . modification of the ship from October 2012 to February 2013 that . involved adding more cabins in some of the ship's floors. This image from a video released yesterday shows passengers on the sinking South Korean ferry desperately trying to smash the windows to get to rescuers next to the ship . The windows slip beneath the surface of the water as rescuers try to save other passengers from the ferry . Senior prosecutor Ahn Sang-don, also part of the investigation team, said today that authorities detained two employees at Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., the ferry's owner, on suspicions of accidental homicide stemming from professional negligence in connection with the sinking. Ahn wouldn't identify the employees. Elsewhere, family members of high school students killed in the sinking dismissed as insincere President Park Geun-hye's apology for the government's handling of the disaster. They called for the quick retrieval of the missing. Divers have so far recovered 212 bodies from the . wreckage.

"Protesters marched through the streets of several major European cities today in an orchestrated show of support for besieged Kurdish fighters currently battling Islamic State (ISIS) forces in Kobane. The Kurdish city of Kobane on the border of Syria and Turkey has been the scene of fierce fighting for weeks now between Kurdish resistance forces and the advancing ISIS jihadists. In a show of solidarity for the embattled Kurds, protesters in France, Britain and Germany today called on their governments to provide further assistance to the city's Kurdish fighters. Demonstrators hold banners and signs in Parliament Square, London, in a show of support for the Kurds . The protests in Parliament Square, London, turned sour when angry demonstrators clashed with police . A man is restrained during a clash with police officers during the London demonstration . Another man is held by an officer attempting to maintain order during the impassioned protest . A demonstrator holds a placard in a show of solidarity with the inhabitants of Kobane, who are currently battling ISIS forces . Police officers and demonstrators line up face-to-face in Parliament Square, Westminster . Although the US has conducted air strikes on targets within the city, ISIS has tightened its grip on the town in recent days and thousands of Kurds face massacre should Turkey not open its border to allow the delivery of arms. The Kurds, an ethnic group spread across much of the Middle East  have borne the brunt of much of the war against  ISIS. In recent months Kurds in northern Iraq have defended, and in some instances successfully retaken, cities along the Iraq border from the jihadists. However, it is their attempts to halt the ISIS takeover of Kobane, in Syria, which triggered today's demonstrations. In London protesters bearing placards and flags were marshalled by police as they marched on Parliament Square, Westminster. The demonstration later became heated when the angry protesters clashed with the police force security cordons. A similar demonstration took place in Paris, with thousands marching through the city to try and force a French Government commitment to help the Kurds and pile pressure on the Turkish Government. And in Germany, more than 20,000 Kurdish immigrants undertook a demonstration in the western city of Duesseldorf. Police said the German demonstration was peaceful with people marching through the city's downtown area and waving large Kurdish flags. Similar protests in Germany last week had turned violent when Kurds clashed with supporters of a hard-line Islamic movement. The protest in Duesseldorf, Germany, comprised 20,000 people - many of whom were expatriate Kurds . Germany's large Kurdish population has been vocal in recent days with today's demonstration just the latest protest against the Turkish government's lack of assistance . Demonstrators in Duesseldorf carry a giant portrait of Abdullah Ocalan, the founder of the militant organization Kurdistan Workers' Party . Meanwhile, the Kurdish forces defending Kobane have urged the U.S.-led coalition to escalate air strikes on ISIS fighters who have tightened their grip on the border town. The Kurdish forces are now believed to face inevitable defeat in Kobane if Turkey does not open its border to let through arms - something Ankara has so far appeared reluctant to do. The U.S.-led coalition escalated air strikes on ISIS in and around Kobane, also known as Ayn al-Arab, some four days ago. The main Kurdish armed group, the YPG, said in a statement the air strikes had inflicted heavy losses on ISIS, but had been less effective in the last two days. A protest was also held in France today. The demonstrators'  banner reads: 'What are you waiting for to act? A new massacre' in reference to the potential slaughter of Kurds trapped in Kobane by ISIS forces . Thousands march the streets of Paris in an attempt to force the French Government into helping the Kurds . Two protesters, wearing bright orange jumpsuits join the demonstration in Paris. Their signs translate to: 'Islamic State killed me' and 'Kobane died, France where are your great values?' A Kurdish military official, speaking from Kobane, said street-to-street fighting was making it harder for the warplanes to target ISIS positions. 'We have a problem, which is the war between houses,' said Esmat Al-Sheikh, head of the Kobane defence council. 'The air strikes are benefiting us, but Islamic State is bringing tanks and artillery from the east. We didn't see them with tanks, but yesterday we saw T-57 tanks,' he added. While ISIS has been able to reinforce its fighters, the Kurds have not. The militants have besieged the town to the east, south and west, meaning the Kurds' only possible supply route is the Turkish border to the north. ISIS has released a propaganda video purporting to show its militants fighting in the city of Kobane (pictured) The video includes this scene of a gunman firing at Kurds while stationed on a high rooftop . The U.N. envoy to Syria on Friday called on Turkey to help prevent a slaughter in Kobane, asking it to let 'volunteers' cross the frontier so they could reinforce the Kurdish forces defending the town that lies within sight of Turkish territory. Turkey has also yet to respond to the remarks by Staffan de Mistura, who said he feared a repeat of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia when thousands died. Kurdish leaders in Syria have asked Ankara to establish a corridor through Turkey to allow aid and military supplies to reach Kobane. '(ISIS) is getting supplies and men, while Turkey is preventing Kobane from getting ammunition. Even with the resistance, if things stay like this, the Kurdish forces will be like a car without fuel,' said Rami Abdelrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organisation that monitors the conflict in Syria through sources on the ground. A member of ISIS shoots at resistance forces with a high caliber gun in the streets of Kobane . An ISIS jihadist fires a rocket propelled grenade during the street fighting in Kobane . While much of the population has already fled Kobane, 500-700 mostly elderly people are still in the town, while 10,000-13,000 are nearby in a border area between Syria and Turkey, U.N. envoy De Mistura said. The observatory said no fewer than 226 Kurdish fighters and 298 Islamic State militants had been killed since the group launched its Kobane offensive in mid-September. It said the overall death toll including civilians was probably much higher. The Kobane crisis has sparked deadly violence in Turkey, which has a Kurdish population numbering 15million. Turkish Kurds have risen up since Tuesday against President Tayyip Erdogan's government, which they accuse of allowing their kin to be slaughtered. At least 33 people have been killed in three days of riots across the mainly Kurdish southeast, including two police officers shot dead in an apparent attempt to assassinate a police chief. The police chief was wounded. A senior Kurdish militant has threatened Turkey with a new Kurdish revolt if it sticks with its current policy of non-intervention in the battle for Kobane.","Protesters in Britain, France and Germany show solidarity with  Kurds .

"Thousands gathered on Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown's death and other fatal police shootings in the St. Louis area and nationwide. The events remained peaceful but boisterous gatherings into the night. Vietnam-era peace activists, New York City seminarians and hundreds of fast-food workers bused in from Chicago, Nashville and other cities marched alongside local residents, spurred by a national campaign dubbed Ferguson October. Outside Busch Stadium in downtown St. Louis, where the Cardinals hosted the San Francisco Giants in the first game of the National League Championship Series, several dozen protesters stood on the sidewalk, chanting and holding signs.

Protesters renewed calls for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson officer, in the Aug. 9 death of Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old. A grand jury is reviewing the case and the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation. 'We still are knee deep in this situation,' said Kareem Jackson, a St. Louis rap artist and community organizer whose stage name is Tef Poe. 'We have not packed up our bags, we have not gone home. This is not a fly-by-night moment. This is not a made-for-TV revolution. This is real people standing up to a real problem and saying, `We ain't taking it no more.' Taking names: Chae, of Chicago, helps hold a banner with the names of people killed nationwide by law enforcement during a march against police violence downtown St. Louis . Amped up security: Policemen guard during a rally held by local residents to commemorate Michael Brown . Aftermath of Michael Brown shooting, Ferguson, Missouri . Showing support: Thousands gather around the stage in Kiener Plaza to listen to speakers after a march against police violence downtown St. Louis . On Saturday evening, a smaller group of demonstrators joined Brown's mother at a prayer vigil and protest outside the Ferguson apartment complex where her son was shot and killed two months ago. The group then marched to the Ferguson police department. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, who spoke to small groups of demonstrators throughout the day, said the city had enlisted extra officers and was prepared for trouble, though he hoped for the best. Earlier in the week, a small group of protesters verbally clashed outside the stadium with Cardinals fans who support the Ferguson officer. 'What I ask is if people come to have their message heard, that they do it in a respectful way,' Dotson said. 'And the same thing on the other side (from police supporters). Everybody has a right to have their message heard, whether you like it or not.' All ages: Darnell Taylor marches with his daughter, Lauren, 4, on his shoulders down Market Street to Kiener Plaza as part of a march against police violence downtown St. Louis . Strong: The mother of an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, walked with hundreds of protesters on Saturday in the St. Louis suburb . Angry: Protesters yell at a black law enforcement officer during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday October 11 . He said the city also will bolster its police presence when the St. Louis Rams host the San Francisco 49ers Monday night - the same day protesters are planning acts of civil disobedience they expect will lead to widespread arrests. The crowd early Saturday was significantly larger than the ones seen at Friday's protests. While the main focus of the march was on recent police shootings, participants also embraced such causes as gay rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Police reported no arrests or violence Saturday afternoon and early evening. 'I have two sons and a daughter. I want a world for them where the people who are supposed to be community helpers are actually helping, where they can trust those people to protect and serve rather than control and repress,'said Ashlee Wiest-Laird, 48, a Baptist pastor from Boston. The situation in Missouri resonated with Wiest-Laird. She's white and her adopted sons, ages 14 and 11, are black. ""What I see happening here is a moment in time. There's something bigger here,"" she said. Organizers said beforehand that they expected as many as 6,000 to 10,000 participants for the weekend's events. Police were not able to provide a crowd estimate Saturday, but organizers and participants suggested the march's size may have approached 3,000. Since Brown's death, three other fatal police shootings of black males have occurred in the St. Louis area. The most recent involved an off-duty St. Louis officer who was working for a private neighborhood security patrol when he shot and killed 18-year-old Vonderrit D. Myers on Wednesday night. The white officer, whose name hasn't been released, fired 17 rounds after police say Myers opened fire. Myers' parents say he was unarmed, and many speakers at a Saturday rally echoed those doubts.","Thousands gathered in St. Louis and nationwide on Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown's death .

"75 Australians with apparent links to terror groups have had their passports cancelled by the Federal Government since tough new laws have been brought in to counter the domestic threat. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that the government has also named its first 'no-go zone' under the Foreign Fighters Bill, the province of Al-Raqqa (Ar-Raqqa) in Syria, some 160 kilometres east of Aleppo. And Ms Bishop also told parliament that she was looking at declaring more parts of the region as terror zones, where Islamic State is active. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has revealed that up to 75 Australians with reported links to terror groups have had their passports cancelled by authorities . In making this announcement, Ms Bishop said any Australians now in Al-Raqqa province without legitimate purpose should leave immediately. It comes after the four El Baf brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to fight in Syria. Under the legislation, any Australian found to have travelled to a declared region without good reason can face up to 10 years jail for the offence. Only those who provide proof on humanitarian or family grounds will be granted permission. Al-Raqqa is regarded as the heartland of the Islamic State group which controls most of the province capital Raqqa. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said foreign fighters and supporters of foreign conflicts posed a significant threat to Australia and our way of life. 'Declaring Al-Raqqa province under the criminal code sends a strong message to those Australians who seek to participate in the Syrian conflict,' she said. Taha El Baf, 17, from Yagoona, and his three older brothers flew to Syria to join the Islamic State last month . About 60 Australians are believed to be still fighting with terror group Islamic State across Iraq and Syria . An Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighter fires at Islamic State militant positions, from the top of Mount Zardak, about 25 kilometres east of Mosul . This provision was enacted earlier this year to target terror tourism, making it an offence to travel to designated conflict zones. Previously, in the absence of any other evidence of offences committed, those who travelled to such destinations committed no offences under Australian law. She said the government was determined to stop Australians from supporting and engaging in hostile activities with listed terrorist organisations. IS has been enforcing a brutal rule in Al-Raqqa, including the murder of opponents, rape and enslavement of women and intimidation and subjugation of the civilian population, she said. 'It is one of the world's most deadly and active terrorist organisations and has been listed as a terrorist organisation in Australia under its various names since 2005,' she said. Fighters with the brutal Islamic State group which has been designated a terrorist organisation by the UN . About 60 Australians are believed to be fighting with Islamist terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, with the UN estimating about 200 foreign fighters joining IS every month. 'So the threat is growing,' Ms Bishop told parliament on Thursday. Ms Bishop has also refused to issue another 10 to people planning to travel to the region. Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said Al-Raqqa was the centre of gravity of IS, from where it launched attacks on Iraq and other parts of Syria. 'There are Australians in senior positions in this organisation in this area. There is no good reason for any Australian to be on the ground in this area, particularly not in the positions that we seen in this organisation,' she said. Ms Plibersek said Labor was pleased to support this extraordinary measure of declaring a whole area a no-go zone. 'We are very concerned about the increasing numbers of Australians going to this region and the broader region to fight,' she said.

"A winding maze of secret dungeons and tunnels have been discovered beneath Tokat Castle in Turkey. And these hidden cells may have been where Vlad the Impaler – credited as being the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s Dracula – was held hostage during the 15th century. Alongside 'Dracula's dungeon', builders also discovered a secret tunnel leading to a military shelter beyond the ruined citadel, and an open terrace. Scroll down for video . Two dungeons, tunnels and a military shelter were found at Tokat Castle (pictured) during restoration works on the site in northern Turkey.

In 1462, Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia is believed to have impaled the bodies of 20,000 people outside the Romanian city of Targoviste, to ward off Ottoman forces. This led to him receiving the nickname Vlad the Impaler, posthumously. Vlad the Impaler was arrested for the murders, and held in prison for 12 years, although the exact location and length of this captivity is disputed.

"Harry Redknapp believes Jose Mourinho could surpass Sir Alex Ferguson’s achievements at Manchester United and become the greatest manager ever. Redknapp takes his Queens Park Rangers side to face Mourinho’s unbeaten Chelsea on Saturday.

"The two Austrian teenage girls who became ‘poster girls’ for jihad in Syria are now desperate to come home after getting completely disillusioned with their new lifestyles. Samra Kesinovic, 17, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, who grew up in the Austrian capital Vienna, were persuaded to head to Syria and take part in the holy war in April. The girls had started lecturing schoolmates about their lifestyle and when they left Vienna in April they left behind a note telling their parents: 'Don’t look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him'. Left is Samra Kesinovic, 16, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join the Islamic State. On the right is 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic who went with her - the two are believed to now want to return home . A photo posted on the girls' social media accounts. Doubts have now been cast regarding the authenticity of the picture - it's thought pictures of other people have been posted to their social media pages . Once they arrived it is believed they were married off to local fighters and both the girls are thought to be pregnant. Police in their homeland Austria say that the girls' social media accounts were taken over and manipulated to broadcast what they now think were fake messages about the life they were having, and using them as poster girls to encourage other young girls to head to Syria. But . security service insiders have told Austrian media that the girls have . managed to contact their families to say they have had enough, and want . to come home. However . they warn that there is almost now no chance that they will be able to . leave their new lives after they became internationally famous and the . images were shared all round the world. Austrian . newspaper Oesterreich, which revealed that the girls now wanted to come . home, is known to have close connections to those investigating the . disappearance of the two girls and is in close contact with their . families. Both sets of parents had been trying to find ways to contact their daughters and it is believed some way of communicating had been established. A picture purporting to be of Samra Kesinovic and Sabina Selimovic, which was posted online sometime after they fled Austria . The . paper said that the girls are currently in the Islamic State controlled . city of Rakka in northern Syria, had been married to Chechen fighters . upon their arrival in Syria and were both pregnant. Spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Karl-Heinz Grundboeck, said however that decision may be too late. He said: 'The main problem is about people coming back to Austria. Once they leave it is almost impossible.' The news comes despite reports which surfaced last month that one of the girls may have been killed. However, these reports were never officially confirmed and the Interior Ministry could not ascertain if they were correct. The . motivations of the two Bosnian girls are unclear but before leaving, . they had contact with Chechen youths, and visited a mosque in Vienna's . second district. And . police also expressed concerns that the pair were inspiring their . contemporaries after two other teenage girls were caught attempting to . flee the country to join IS ranks. Little information was given about the copycat . pair hoping to join Islamic State apart from the fact that one was 16 . and the other was 14 and their parents were apparently from Iraq. Police . now want to find out how they became radicalised, and whether anybody . had helped them plan their trip to Syria which was apparently set to . take place via Turkey - following the same route as the other two girls. The . pair were caught when the mother of a third friend who was supposed to . be travelling with them became suspicious about the amount of luggage . her daughter was packing.

"The personal data and private online conversations that the National Security Administration is accused of mining could be stashed in a one million square-foot, $1.9 billion facility in the Utah Valley. Concerns over what the government will store at the Utah Data Center have been reinvigorated by the revelation that U.S. intelligence agencies have been . extracting audio, video, photos, e-mails, documents and other . information to track people's movements and contacts. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, . YouTube, Skype, AOL and the lesser known Internet company PalTalk are all involved with the PRISM program, which the government insists is for national security. The Utah Data Center which is being constructed on Camp Williams on the Salt Lake-Utah County line will be completed in October - but officials have been tight-lipped about what will be stored there. More:The Utah Data Center, near Bluffdale, was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the NSA was stored . Storage: An aerial photograph shows the center . Stash: The government has been tight-lipped about what will be stored in the center's four 'data halls' Plans released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is handling the construction, show the center will have four 'data halls' to store information and two substations to power the facility. The spy center is being built at . an estimated cost of $1.9 billion, and is expected to employ 100 to 200 . permanent employees after its completion. The plans note they must all be U.S. citizens. Despite the boom for the local economy, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah has expressed their fears over what will be stored at the center. 'We're mining data, we're gathering data and it's all done secretly,' ACLU of Utah director Karen McCreary told Fox13. 'We don't even know what's going on.' Plans: Sketches released by Army engineers show the massive center, which is believed to cost $1.7 billion . Will your information be in there? Another drawing shows halls where the data will be kept . Site: The center overlooks the Utah Valley and will employ up to 200 people when it is complete . 'When the NSA facility in Utah was announced, local officials praised it for the jobs it would bring,' Libertas director Connor Boyack added. 'As Americans are now learning, those jobs entail harvesting the data generated by innocent Americans not suspected of any crime, in contradiction to the Fourth Amendment.' The fears come as The Washington Post reported that for the past six years, U.S. intelligence agencies have been extracting personal information from across the country. The PRISM program was launched in 2007 with the blessing of special federal judges under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Post said that several members of the U.S. Congress were made aware of the classified data-gathering program, but were sworn to secrecy. Mystery: A close-up section of NSA's Utah Data Center is shown in Bluffdale in July . Powerhouse: These images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers, as well as data from companies including Facebook and Google . PRISM has been described by NSA officials . 'as the most prolific contributor to the president's Daily Brief' and . the 'leading source of raw material', the Post reported. On Friday, President Obama delivered a passionate defense of national security programs that secretly acquire information about Americans' phone calls, saying criticism of them is all 'hype.' 'My assessment and my team's assessment was that [the programs] help us prevent terrorist attacks and that the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration [of calls] without a name attached... It was worth us doing.' In practice, if collection managers in . the NSA's Special Source Operation Group, which manages PRISM, have . suspicion that their target is a foreign national engaged in terrorism . or a spy, they move ahead to draw in all the data which would often net in information on the suspect's contacts. President Obama has maintained that data mining 'was worth us doing' to halt national security threats . Bombshell: A leaked powerpoint slide shows how the NSA and FBI have been extracting audio, video, photos, e-mails, documents and other data from large Silicon Valley companies for six years . 'I think it’s important to understand . that you can’t have 100 percent security and then have 100 percent . privacy and zero inconvenience,' Obama said. 'We’re going to have to . make some choices as a society.' Obama said the PRISM program does not . involve monitoring the email content of U.S. citizens or anyone living . in the U.S., and he repeatedly stated that both programs - the phone . spying and PRISM - have been approved by Congress. 'You can complain about ""big brother"" and how this is a potential program run amuck,' Obama added, 'but when . you actually look at the details, then I think we've stuck the right . balance.' The . Post noted that the tech companies are knowingly taking part in PRISM, . but The Guardian, which also received a leaked NSA report, reported than . all nine pleaded ignorance of the program. The companies denied any knowledge of the program, with spokespeople saying they had not even heard of it.","Government will complete its data storing facility in Utah this October .

"A 32-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman have been arrested by anti-terror police in two separate probes linked to extremism in Syria. The man was arrested on suspicion of having visited a terrorist training camp following a series of raids in the South East today. Two houses, one in west London and another in south-west London, are now being searched by officers as part of that investigation. The man was arrested after a woman was detained and two addresses in Bedfordshire - including one in Kempston, a suburb of Bedford - were searched as part of a separate inquiry, which is also linked to Syria. A house in suburban Bedford was raided today as police arrested a woman on suspicion on terror offences . Police officers were seen searching the property throughout the day and removing computers and files . Announcing the latest arrest, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers from SO15 Counter Terrorism Command have today arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of attending a place used for terrorist training contrary to section 8 of Terrorism Act 2006. 'He has been taken to a central London police station where he remains in custody. 'An address in west London and an address in south-west London are being searched as part of the investigation under TACT. This investigation is Syria related.' Meanwhile, a uniformed police officer stood on duty outside an end of terrace house in Kempston, Bedford following an arrest in the area earlier in the day. Locals say a young woman and a man, who they believed are husband and wife, lived there, along with two small children, a boy and a girl. It is thought the occupants had been at the address for between 3 and 4 years. In the rear garden, a small child's toy bike could be seen. Neighbour Susan Robinson, 52, said she regularly saw the woman who lived in the house walking along the street with her two young children. Mrs Robinson said: 'When the lady first arrived in the street, she only had the one child. Since then, she's had another and I would see her walking past pushing a pram with her baby in and the toddler walking beside her.' The search of the property, and three others today, follows a series of similar raids in recent weeks, which have led to four men appearing in court. Today's arrests are not believed the be linked to earlier investigations . A  van was spotted outside the house, which neighbours said belonged to a man who lived in the property . Mrs Robinson added that the woman's partner had not been seen at the property for the last couple of months. She described him as bearded and she said the woman always wore black, with a veil, so that just her eyes were visible. 'She did drive when she first arrived, but I've not seen her with a car for some time,' Mrs Robinson added. Authorities believe more than 500 Britons  have gone to Syria to fight alongside extremists, half of whom may have returned. But police say that number will leap by 50 per cent within a year, despite the recent deaths of up to 30 British jihadis in the fighting. A child's bike was the only thing visible in the garden of the property, which neighbours said is occupied by a young family . The searches were the latest in a series of raids carried out by anti-terror police around the South East . Britain's top policeman, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said this week that at least five Britons a week are heading to the war-ravaged country to fight for Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists. Sir Bernard said: 'Those numbers are a minimum. There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders.' As many as 60 of the Britons who have travelled to the region are thought to be women offering themselves as so-called 'jihadi brides' to those fighting Western and local forces. The women are thought to be travelling through Turkey before they are married off to extremists they have met through the internet. Mia Bloom, from the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies in the US, said: 'ISIS is recruiting these women in order to be baby factories. They are seeing the establishment of an Islamic state and now they need to populate the state.' Scotland Yard said the two arrests, that of a woman this morning and a man later today, are not linked . It is believed around 500 Britons may have travelled to Syria to join ISIS fighters like those pictured in Raqqa . Last week, a number of terror suspects were charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings. Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, all from London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court amid tight security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot. It was alleged to have been formulated in response to a fatwa by a senior ISIS terrorist. Earlier this month, two houses in Portsmouth - including the family home of Ifthekar Jaman, a British man who died in Syria - were among properties raided by counter-terrorism police. Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (Sectu) have been granted extra time to question two men aged 26 and 23, from Portsmouth, a 23-year-old woman from Farnborough and a 29-year-old woman from Greenwich who were arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.

Part of a series of efforts to promote deals on the beleaguered airline's routes up to June 2015, its official Twitter account @MAS posted: 'Want to go somewhere, but don't know where? Our Year-End Specials might just help! #keepflying'. Followers were quick to show their outrage at the post, drawing the unfortunate connection to the MH370 flight. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, the same as the MH370 flight which went missing in March and the MH17 which was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July this year . MAS apologises for their tweet: 'Want to go somewhere, but don't know where? Our Year-End Specials might just help! #keepflying' The airline removed the original tweet but continued to suffer criticism from Twitter users . The airline's Boeing 777 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared on March 8 with 227 passengers from 15 countries and 12 Malaysia Airlines crew on board and remains missing. MAS removed the post and tweeted: 'Our tweet was intended to inspire travellers to explore deals offered. We apologize for any offence caused & have removed it!' Theresa Powell tweeted the airline on Thursday from @tpowellwow, saying: 'probably not the best choice of words for an airline that doesn't know where one of its planes is- just saying #mas370'. Malaysia Airlines has posted numerous tweets promoting their sales and its #keepflying campaign . But only when they wrote 'Want to go somewhere, but don't know where?' was it considered offensive . Others weren't so savoury in their criticism of the airline. After removing the initially offensive tweet, Malaysia Airlines responded to its critics while retweeting a post from Jonathan Wong's @jono_dubs: 'Don't understand all the haters blasting #mas for their promotions? Some people are trying' MAS replied, 'Thanks for your support'. Malaysia Airlines has been on thin ice in its bid to win over customers and repair their image after two tragedies in a year. The company is also trying to overcome millions in revenue losses following the MH370 and MH17 tragedies. This is the second social media gaffe that has struck a nerve, with the previous one promoting 'My Ultimate Bucket List' deemed inappropriate by many who connected it with light MH17, which saw the death of 289 people on board after it was shot down over Ukraine in July. MAS pulled that campaign following the backlash due to bucket list's meaning of things to do before you die. MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed on July 17, 2014, believed to have been shot down near Torez, Ukraine, killing all 298 on board. The plane’s debris landed an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists, who American and German intelligence sources say shot it down with Buk surface-to-air missile. Russia blames the Ukrainian government. MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The last message to air traffic control came at an hour after takeoff and it was last seen on radar at an hour later over the Andaman Sea, 200 miles from Penang state in northwestern Malaysia. The Boeing 777 was carrying 227 passengers from 15 countries and 12  crew.

"MH370 investigators have revealed the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight may have been in the wrong area up until now. In a flight path analysis released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday, it suggests that experts may have finally uncovered the Boeing 777's resting place. The latest report details that the plane could have ran out of fuel then spiralled into the southern part of the Indian Ocean in March. Since then, no traces of the plane nor its 239 passengers and crew on board have been found. Scroll down for video . Investigators reveal in a new report that missing Malaysia Airline flight MH370 could have ran out of fuel and spiralled into the southern part of the Indian Ocean . A refined MH370 Underwater Search Planning Map released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau . A map showing where the refined underwater search will take place, released on Wednesday . A map, released on June 24, showing where investigators searched for MH370 . The flight, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, has been missing since March 8 after veering dramatically off course. The Malaysia-contracted GO Phoenix vessel began hunting for traces of wreckage or jet fuel on Monday about 1,100 miles off the Western Australia coast, which is where experts believed the plane crashed. Later in the month, two ships sent by Dutch contractor Fugro will join the GO Phoenix as part of an operation that could last more than a year. But the latest Australian Transport Safety Bureau's detailed analysis has released information which may relate to where MH370 could have been descending at that time of disappearance. 'The simulator activities involved fuel exhaustion of the right engine followed by flameout of the left engine with no control inputs,' it said. 'This scenario resulted in the aircraft entering a descending spiralling low bank angle left turn and the aircraft entering the water in a relatively short distance after the last engine flame-out.' Fugro Discovery (pictured), which along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix, will soon start a new high-resolution search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . An image of a Fugro autonomous underwater vehicle searching for flight MH370 . This is in proximity to the seventh arc, believed to be in the southern of the Indian Ocean, where the aircraft ran out of the fuel and crashed into the ocean. Yet this comes as investigators admitted 'changes to the prioritisation and location of search activity' and further stated they will be refocusing on the refined analysis of flight and satellite data. 'The latest analyses indicates that the underwater search should be prioritised further south within the wide search area for the next phase of the search,' the report states. However there are implications that there may also be changes to the new search area. 'Although of reasonably high confidence, and relatively large, this area does not contain all the possible derived paths,' the report states. 'The ongoing refinement may result in changes to search asset deployment.' Despite an extensive search for the missing plane, no traces of it has been found since March 8. All 12 members of staff on board the flight - including both pilots - were Malaysian nationals. Of the 227 passengers, there were six Australians on board. Australia has been leading the search for MH370 at the request of the Malaysian Government.","New report reveals that MH370 could have ran out of fuel and spiralled into southern part of Indian Ocean .

"Two teenagers are dead and another three seriously injured after they were hit by a missile strike while playing football on a school sports field in Donetsk. The football pitch, located in the rebel controlled territory of eastern Ukraine, had holes blown through its fence and the turf ripped apart by the wayward bombs. Locals said the bombing occurred yesterday about 2 - 3km from Donetsk airport, where separatists have been fighting with government forces despite a ceasefire declared on September 5. The school fence was torn apart and a large crater mark left in the football pitch following the attack . Students' items are left scattered on the ground after being discarded during the scramble for cover . A teenager's shoe is left lying in the gutter at the school sports field. Three teenagers were killed and two injured after wayward shelling hit the football pitch . Kiev said on Wednesday it would halt payment of state funds in areas controlled by pro-Moscow rebels, as both sides hardened positions in what is rapidly becoming a 'frozen conflict': a long-term stalemate that the West believes is Russia's aim. A day after the rebels held inauguration ceremonies for their leaders, the separatists and the central government each accused each other of violating the September peace deal and signalled they would withdraw support for some of its terms. The past four days have seen the rebels stage elections for leadership which the government called illegal, and the government respond by saying it would revoke a law that would have granted eastern regions autonomy and sent them cash. The rebels say their newly elected leaders must be allowed to negotiate with Kiev directly; Kiev says this is impossible. And while sporadic conflict continues, both sides' positions mean they have reversed parts of the 12-point peace plan agreed in Belarus in September.

Yury Yakimenko, a political analyst at Ukraine's Razumkov political research centre, said: 'We have now realistically entered the phase of a 'frozen conflict.' The term 'frozen conflict' is usually applied to other ex-Soviet republics where separatist enclaves have been protected by Russian troops since the early 1990s. The American general who serves as the highest ranking NATO officer also said this week that the conditions for a frozen conflict were being created in Ukraine.

"A student journalist claims he was beaten up by a group of activists in Ferguson after they accused him of video recording the meeting. Chris Schaefer posted a video of himself lying in a bed at Christian Hospital Northeast in St Louis, Missouri, after he was allegedly attacked by members of the activist group Lost Voices. The 24-year-old, said he attended a meeting at Greater St. Mark Missionary Church and was targeted because they believed he was trying to live stream the event ahead of the grand jury decision over the cop who shot and killed Michael Brown. Darren Wilson gunned down the 18-year-old in August, sparking a wave of demonstrations and protests across the city. Scroll down for video . Attacked: Student journalist Chris Schaefer ended up in hospital after he claims he was beaten up by protesters at a meeting in Ferguson about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown . The 24-year-old posted a video of himself lying in a bed at Christian Hospital Northeast in St Louis, Missouri, after he was allegedly attacked by members of the activist group Lost Voices . He described the incident on his website and is now looking for $2,000 in donations to help fund his hospital treatment. 'I was attacked by protesters at a Church because they thought I was live streaming and I wasn't.' he wrote. 'When I first walked in they said live streaming was not allowed. I sat for about 40 minutes listening to the discussion and then people started to move away for the pew I was sitting in. 'I knew alot of the people their from previous interview and seeing them at the protests and thought many were nice. 'I had my phone out but it was just in my hand and all of the sudden one person shouted he is livestreaming and pointed at me. 'Then about five people rushed me and started pushing me to the door, they also ripped the phone from my hands along with the charging cable. 'Then they threw me against the exit door and I fell outside. I was then hit a couple times in the head and face. I fell to the ground. Scene: He went to a meeting at Greater St. Mark Missionary Church and was targeted because they believed he was trying to live stream the event ahead of the grand jury decision over the cop who killed Michael Brown . 'I then almost lost consciousness but looked up at five people who were punching and kicking me. I blocked many punches with my arm and hand and I got kicked severely in the stomach and sides and back. I was also kicked in the legs.' After that a group shouted 'Stop, stop' and told Schaefer to run. He claims that no one called 911 and even though he stood in the middle of oncoming traffic, no one stopped to help. Out of breath and almost unconscious he managed to make it to a Walgreens but collapsed in the entrance. Patricia Bynes, one of the movement's most active members, told the St. Louis Dispatch that the group Lost Voices was behind the attack. 'If we're going to hold police accountable for beating us, we need to hold ourselves accountable for incidents like this. I'm not saying all the Lost Voices were involved, but those that weren't need to get their group under control because they have gotten increasingly violent lately,' she said. Donations: Schaefer is now trying to raise $2,000 to cover the cost of his hospital treatment on his website . A member of the group blamed for the attack who identified himself as Bud Cuzz said he didn't see anyone get beaten up but reiterated that Schaefer was told: 'no cameras, no pictures and no recording'. Renita Lamkin, pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Charles, held a conference on Friday apologizing for the incident, adding that they 'deeply regret' what happened. The White House on Friday emphasized its commitment to defusing continued tensions over the Ferguson police shooting. The White House said President Barack Obama spoke Friday with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and Justice Department officials who stepped in after Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black. In St. Louis, the department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services met with top commanders from Ferguson, the city of St. Louis, . St. Louis County and the Missouri Highway Patrol at a two-day session that concluded Friday. It focused on how unintentional bias affects police work. The voluntary reform effort is separate from a federal civil rights investigation into the Ferguson police shooting and a broader federal inquiry into the department's policing methods.","Chris Schaefer, 24, posted a video of himself in a hospital bed after 'attack'

"A man has died during the Ferguson riots just yards from where Michael Brown was shot dead. Residents on Canfield Drive said that DeAndre Joshua, 20, was shot whilst in his car though police at the scene refused to confirm any details. DeAndre's grandmother Renita Towns said that 'somebody killed him' during the carnage.

Police did not confirm the 20-year-old's cause of death and are examining his car for clues . Devastated: Renita Towsn, the grandmother of DeAndre Joshua at the scene in the Northfield apartment complex where he was found dead the morning after the unrest following the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown in August .

Killing scene: Canfield Avenue, where DeAndre Joshua was found shot dead in his car . She said that he graduated Beaumont High School and that he was working in Wal-Mart. Family member Brian Joshua, 45, added: 'He was a good kid, he's gone to high school, he's got a job, he's not into drugs or any of that stuff. 'I only saw him yesterday morning. He was a smart guy, he spoke cleanly, he was positive'. Police took away DeAndre's white Pontiac Grand Prix and interviewed witnesses around 11am. A woman in her 20s broke down in tears and said: 'I knew him, he was my twin.' St Louis' police chief, Jon Belmar, was asked if the killing was linked to the unrest. 'I imagine there is a nexus,' he responded, the Guardian reported. From the site of the killing it was almost possible to see the site of the memorial for Brown, which is also on Canfield drive. Some 61 people were arrested in Ferguson overnight, mainly for burglary and trespassing, according to St Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman. Meanwhile in St Louis, there were 21 arrests, according to mayor Francis Slay, where some protesters broke windows of businesses. Violence flared after the decision was announced by St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch at around 8:25pm on Monday evening, and continued throughout the evening and into early Tuesday morning. As President Barack Obama appeared on television to appeal for calm, angry crowds took to the streets after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge Officer Darren Wilson with any crime for the shooting of Brown this summer.

'They only just buried another one of their relatives and that's why they're so upset, to lose two so soon'. St Louis police reported that rioters fired 150 live gunshots and more than a dozen local businesses were razed to the ground by arsonists. Some reports say that fire fighters have been tackling up to 25 structural fires caused by rioters.

"Four members of the same family are suspected forming a real-life British Muslim 'band of brothers' by travelling to Syria together to join the so-called Islamic State insurgency. Two siblings, aged 17 and 20, from Camden, north London, and their cousins, aged 19 and 22, from Wednesbury, West Midlands, are alleged to have run away from home to join the jihadists. All four are believed to have flown together from London via Milan to Istanbul, before apparently making their way across the border into Syria, The Sunday Times reports. An Islamic State fighter holds the flag of the movement and a weapon on a street in the city of Mosul, Iraq, in this file picture. Four members of the same British family are said to have travelled to join the terror group . Two of the men were named in the paper as Mejanul Islam, 22, and his brother Kamran, 19, brothers from the Black Country. They and the London pair - who are not named - are said to have travelled in September, just as a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab states started bombing Isis positions in Syria. Scotland Yard began investigating after the brothers from Camden were reported missing by their parents. Mejanul and Kamran's father, Saydul Islam, a restaurant worker, told Sunday Times reporter Dipesh Ghader his sons vanished after telling him they were off to visit relatives in London. 'We've had no news at all,' the 43-year-old said. 'I don't know where they've gone. We're very worried.' Well armed: Militant Islamist fighters on a tank take part in an Islamic State military parade through the streets of  Raqqa province, northern Syria, in this picture taken in June . More militants: All four of the British recruits from one family are believed to have flown together from London via Milan to Istanbul, before apparently making their way across the border into Syria . It is not the first time that sets of siblings have travelled together to Syria to join the Islamist-inspired Sunni insurgency over there. British medical student Nasser Muthana and his younger brother Aseel, from Cardiff, travelled to Syria over the summer. Nasser is believed to have since featured in a gruesome video showing the decapitation of Syrian servicemen. In July Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, also ran away from home to travel to Syria where they married fighters after being radicalised online, earning them to sobriquet the 'terror twins'. However, the case of Wednesbury's Islam brothers and their cousins from London is believed to be largest number of fighters from a single British family to travel abroad to join Islamic State. Another parade: The four are said to have travelled in September, just as a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab states started bombing Isis positions in Syria . The father of a suspected jihadist from Cardiff went on a daring mission to Syria to snatch his teenage son from Islamic State, the Sunday Times reports. Karim Mohammadi reportedly travelled 2,000 miles from his home in Cardiff to Turkey before travelling across the border with the help of locals. He is believed to be the first British father to have successfully rescued his child from the forces of the Islamic State. His 19-year-old son Ahmed was friends with Nasser Muthana, 20, and Reyaad Khan, 21, two jihadists from Cardiff who appeared in an IS recruiting video in June. Mr Mohammadi, who is of Iraqi-Kurdish origin, is understood to have been helped by guides from the region's Kurdish community. A police intelligence source said: 'There is a great sense of honour and family value in what Mr Mohammadi did.' Ahmed was arrested on his return to Britain in July but released without charge and referred to the government's deradicalisation programme. Security services say more than 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State, but a leading Muslim Labour MP says the true figure could be as many as 2,000. Khalid Mahmood, MP for the Birmingham Perry Barr constituency, claimed last week that official figures on the numbers of British jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem. Many Britons who have travelled to join Islamic State have made the ultimate sacrifice by choosing to become suicide bombers for the fanatically devout movement. The Sunday Times suggests the Islam brothers may have been radicalised by an extremist who turned up at a Wednesbury mosque a month ago and began extolling the virtues of holy war. An apparently 'informed source' told the paper the man was talking about war in the time of Muslim prophet Mohammed, then mentioned 'Isis' - another name for Islamic State - and 'jihad' before he was kicked out. Police were reportedly called to intervene after the man continued preaching in the street. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Two males, aged 17 and 20, from north London, were reported missing on September 4. 'Officers from the counter-terrorism command searched two addresses in London and one in Wednesbury. Inquiries continue.'","The four believed to have flown together to Istanbul via Milan in September .

"A Canadian woman has become the first foreign female to join the Kurds battling the Islamic State in Syria, a  report has revealed. Gill Rosenberg, 31, was interviewed on Israel Radio where she said she had traveled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would go into combat in neighboring Syria. The station did not name their interviewee, who spoke North American-accented Hebrew, but a source involved in the report identified her as Rosenberg. Gill Rosenberg, 31, was interviewed on Israel Radio where she said she had traveled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would go into combat in next-door Syria . 'They (the Kurds) are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,' Rosenberg said, . explaining why she joined up after contacting the guerrillas . over the Internet. Rosenberg, a civil aviation pilot, enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrested in 2009. She was then extradited to the United States where she was jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said. A source in the Kurdistan region with knowledge of the issue . said Rosenberg was the first foreign woman to join YPG, the . Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria. She has . crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited . by YPG, the source added. Syrian Kurds backed by fighters from northern Iraq have gained ground towards breaking the siege of the Syrian border town of Kobane. But they are drawing heavy fire from Islamic State insurgents and have yet to win back control. Rosenberg could not be reached by Reuters for comment. A . source provided an Iraqi Kurdistan cellphone number for her, but . it was turned off on Tuesday. A Facebook page registered to Rosenberg showed photographs . of her in settings marked as Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria. Gill, a civil aviation pilot, enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrestedin 2009 and extradited to the United States where she jailed over aninternational phone scam . 'In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's . show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means,' read a November 9 post. Yahel Ben-Oved, an Israeli lawyer who represented Rosenberg . in the US criminal proceedings, said she had no knowledge of . her joining the Kurds even though they had spoken recently. 'It is . exactly the sort of thing she would do, though,' said Ben-Oved. Rosenberg had consented to extradition and served around . three years in a U.S. prison under a plea bargain, Ben-Oved . said. A 2009 FBI statement on the case names her as Gillian . Rosenberg, among 11 people arrested in Israel 'in a phony ""lottery prize"" scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly'. Female fighters of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) prepare their weapons in the southern countryside of Ras al-Ain, near the frontline against ISIS . Israel's NRG news site reported at the time that Rosenberg . turned to crime after running short on money, that she was . estranged from her parents and had tried in vain to join the . Mossad spy service. More than 195,000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in March 2011, with successive attempts at internationally backed negotiations failing to yield a peace deal. Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and . business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, seeing in the . minority ethnic group a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. Smoke rises over the border town of Kobane in northern Syria following US airstrikes on Tuesday. Rosenberg is believed to have crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited by the Kurds . The Kurds are spread through Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq. In the latter country, the have the autonomous Kurdish Regional . Government. Israel bans its citizens from traveling to enemy states, . among them Syria and Iraq. It has been cracking down on Israeli . Arabs who return after volunteering to fight with Islamic State . or other rebels against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule.

"The 298 passengers and crew aboard MH17 will have been oblivious to the horror as a shrapnel-based missile instantly shredded the plane, experts claim. The SA-11 missile - known as a Grizzly - that hit the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight is designed to pulverise aircraft on impact. It will have perforated the plane at various points, ignited the fuel, and taken out the engines and the wings within a split second - meaning the people aboard will have been unconscious almost instantly. Scroll down for video . 'Oblivious': Experts assure that nobody on board the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight will have been aware of the horror as the cabin will have exploded instantly . What happened: The SA-11 missile which hit the MH17 flight is designed to shred aircraft on impact by letting off a ring of shrapnel that hits various points . A BUK missile system in the firing position, during an international arms fair held last year. The launcher, an armoured truck, takes up position and once its crew have acquired the target, it takes five minutes for the first missle to be launched. The surface-to-air missile hit the Boeing 777 with such force that residents in the area claim to have seen bodies falling from the sky ‘like rags’. Justin Bronk, researcher analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told MailOnline: 'An SA-11 missile is designed to shred aircraft. 'The extent at which the remains of the aircraft are spread across a large area seems to confirm that. 'The missile is programmed using a tracker to get within a metre of the target then let off a ring of shrapnel, which will enter the aircraft at various points. 'The shrapnel will have hit the wings, the engines and the fuel tanks, igniting the fuel. 'A large aircraft like that is highly pressurised to allow humans to breathe at that altitude so it will have exploded instantly. Decimated: A pro-Russian separatist looks at wreckage from the nose section of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane which was downed near the village of Rozsypne . Emergency workers, police officers and even coal miners spread out across the sunflower fields and villages of eastern Ukraine, searching the wreckage of MH17 . Out of the blue: A Ukrainian covers a body with a  plastic sheet in a field. Malaysia's prime minister said there was no distress call before the plane went down and that the flight route was declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation . All hand on deck: Coal miners help with the search effort at the crash site near the village of Rozsypne in eastern Ukraine . Disturbing: A woman walks past a body covered with a plastic sheet in a sunflower field near the site of a crashed Malaysia Airlines passenger plane near the village of Rozsypne . MH17 was believed to have been taken down by an SA-11 missile, known as a Grizzly or Gadfly in the US, or a Buk in Russia. The surface-to-air missile has a range of 1.8 to 12.4 miles and can hit targets up to an altitude of 75,000ft. It is launched from a command vehicle using a target-acquisition radar. Once a target has been selected it takes five minutes to warm up. Depending on the model, the missile would then accelerate to at least 2,790ft per second to up to 4,035ft per second. This means it would have reached MH17 at 33,000ft high just eight  seconds after being fired. 'Almost nobody on board would have . known what was happening. If not instantly, they will have been . unconscious within split seconds.' Speculation over the source of the . missile, which remains unconfirmed, has sparked a propaganda battle . between both sides of the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Officials in Kiev have made repeated statements linking the attack to pro-Russian separatists. Tonight, Downing Street supported the . claims with a statement to say it appears 'increasingly likely that . MH-17 was shot down by a separatist missile' fired from near Torez, an . area controlled by pro-Russian rebels. Naked bodies were strewn across fields in eastern Ukraine surrounded by . hundreds of possessions - including children's books, playing cards, . slippers, letters and old vinyl records - after the missile strike shortly after 1pm on Thursday. Makeshift white flags marked where bodies lay in corn fields and among the debris. Others, . stripped bare by the force of the crash, had been covered by polythene . sheeting weighed down by stones, one marked with a flower in . remembrance. One . pensioner told how a corpse smashed though the roof of her house. 'There . was a howling noise and everything started to rattle. Then objects . started falling out of the sky,' said Irina Tipunova, 65. 'And then I . heard a roar and she landed in the kitchen.' The BUK missile system, also known as the SA-11 Gadfly, was created by the Soviet Union in 1979 to engage aircraft, cruise missiles and drones. BUK - which means 'beech tree' in Russian - includes four missiles on a turntable mounted on a tracked vehicle. A separate tracked vehicle carries radars to guide the missiles. Capable of carrying 154lbs (70kg) of . highly-explosive warheads, BUK can send missiles up to an altitude of . 75,000ft (23,000 metres). It . takes just five minutes to warm up, 12 minutes to reload and 8-12 . seconds to reach its target. Once there, it has a kill probability of 90 . to 95 per cent. Yesterday's . missile is likely to have detonated within 65 feet (20 metres) of MH17, . causing critical damage to the engines and control system of the . aircraft. The explosion would have ignited the fuel onboard the aircraft, causing destruction of the wing and fuselage. ‘Inside the missile is a variety of different warheads,’ a senior defence source told MailOnline. ‘These can be fragmentation or incendiary, depending on the target you are flying at. They can cut an aircraft in half, set it on fire or provide large pieces of shrapnel that shred it apart.’ Personal belongings and luggage of MH17 passengers found at the crash site in eastern Ukraine . Disturbing: Dead bodies were found mixed in with debris, with some corpses having remained almost intact . A pro-Russian militant inspects the crash site, which stretched for over nine miles . A piece of wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Shaktarsk, the day after it crashed . Many belongings were completely undamaged, with T-shirts, suitcase . The missile - thought to be the Mach 3 . semi-active homing 9M28M - was launched from the back of what is . essentially a truck and has a range of 1.8 to 12.4 miles (3 to 20km). A 13.8-inch (35cm) ‘seeker’ on the missile would have received information on the trajectory of the passenger aircraft from a radar station on a separate vehicle. A typical battery to launch the missile is made up of command vehicle housing computers and displays. The system used to determine whether a target is a friend or foe would not warn an operator that the target was an airliner - only that it was not a friend. A tracked variant of the BUK missile launching system on display last year at celebrations in Red Square for the anniversary of the end of World War II. Both tracked and wheeled versions of the launcher can fire a volley of four missiles in quick succession, each targeting a different aircraft. A video released today by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry shows a tracked BUK missile launcher which the Kiev government claims was used to bring down Flight MH17. One of the missiles on the launcher appears to be missing as it was driven through the town of Krasnodon, towards the Russian border.","Shrapnel-based SA-11 missile, known as a Grizzly, will have 'shredded' the plane on impact, expert says .

"A pregnant Syrian Kurdish woman who fled ISIS and made it safely to Turkey named her newborn Obama out of gratitude for US-led airstrikes. Sultan Muslim, her husband and their children were on the run for a month after fleeing the besieged border town of Kobane. When they arrived at a refugee camp in Suruc, Turkey, the family welcomed their newest addition and Muslim named him after the American president, because of the US's air campaign against ISIS. Newborn: Sultan Muslim, a mother of seven, named her four-day-old child Muhammed Obama Muslim to offer thanks for US assistance in fighting ISIS . 'I gave my son this name from my heart. I will never change this name,' Muslim told Agence France-Presse, having given birth on Wednesday. 'He dispatched planes, aid for us. Because of his help maybe we will get rid of this cruelty and get back to our homes,' she added. 'We named him Muhammed Obama Muslim,' said Mahmut Beko, the boy's father. 'We want Obama to help us so that we can get back home. We are also human beings. We, the Kurds, attacked whom, fight against whom?' he asked incredulously. Brutal fighting between the Islamist extremist group ISIS and Syrian Kurdish militias known as the YPG has engulfed the border town of Kobane as ISIS militants attempt to rout YPG fighters. A US-led coalition has attacked ISIS forces with airstrikes, which has weakened but not destroyed ISIS fighting power. Airstrikes: Smoke billows above Kobane after US aircraft launch a strike against ISIS militant positions in the town . Gratitude: Kurds facing down ISIS have expressed the sentiment that the US has been the only country offering assistance . Refugees: Turkey has accepted hundreds of thousands of Syrian Kurds displaced by violence in border areas of Syria . A spokesperson for the ministry overseeing peshmerga militia units in Iraqi Kurdistan announced Friday that up to 200 reinforcements would be heading to Kobane through Turkey. Muslim's family was among around 200,000 Kurds that have made the trek into Turkey after being displaced from Kobane. 'We were stranded at the border for days, without water or food,' said Muslim. 'We did not take any clothes to wear. We did not have any blankets. I was pregnant and had no chance of taking a bath.' Many Kurds view American aid as crucial in keeping out the tide of ISIS extremists. 'Like the Americans, the whole world should help the Kurds in Kobane. We have no true friends other than the Americans,' said Turkish Kurd Selami Altay. Along with many other Kurds in the region, Altay watched the fighting in Kobane from a hilltop overlooking Syria. At the sight of new airstrikes, which have so far reportedly killed more than 500 ISIS fighters, the crowd erupted in cheers and chanted, 'Obama, Obama.'","Sultan Muslim and her family escaped ISIS's siege of Kobane and fled to Turkey .

"It all began three weeks ago, when several hundred pro-democracy students stormed the Hong Kong government headquarters demanding a free and fair vote in the upcoming elections. Since then the so-called Umbrella Revolution - named after the umbrellas demonstrators have been using to defend themselves against police pepper spray - has spiralled out of control, with tens of thousands of students engaged in violent running battles with officers. Tonight has proved no different, as the activists' ranks have swollen once more. While some are digging in for the long-haul in city's finance district, where main thoroughfares remain closed, others have gone on the offensive to recapture old protest zones from the police. Scroll down for video .

A man is restrained after he confronted people standing next to a pro-democracy protest barricade in the district of Mong Kok . Despite pictures emerging of demonstrators bloodied after battles with police armed in riot gear with truncheons and shields, the sheer weight of numbers has allowed the pro-democracy movement to overwhelm police lines in areas such as Mong Kok, which the activists recaptured on Friday. Officers have been using surprise pre-dawn raids to scatter demonstrators that have set up smaller fringe camps away from Admiralty, where the main protest is taking place. But as quickly as they tear down the camps, the demonstrators move back in. In fact, rather than break their will, the violence being used against the demonstrators has drawn more to their cause. The police tactic of using tear-gas brought tens of thousands out on to the streets initially, and a video of cops beating a handcuffed protester weeks later rallied yet more to the cause. It appears - for the moment at least - that the police have no idea how to deal with the worst unrest seen in Hong Kong in the last decade. But equally they cannot back down, as the Chinese leadership will not allow it. Their splintered efforts have not been helped by the city's highly unpopular leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying - known as CY - who angered protesters when he abruptly called off scheduled talks last week, saying a constructive outcome was unlikely. He then revived the proposal for talks a week later, amid soaring tensions and public anger.

Holding shields and batons, Hong Kong police officers stand guard against pro-democracy protesters gathered in Mong Kok . Police stand guard next to a pile of broken umbrellas used by protesters - supporters of the so-called Umbrella Revolution . Even if the talks materialize, they are unlikely to resolve the deadlock. Leung has repeatedly said that Beijing will not give in to the students' demand to open up nominations for the city's inaugural direct election in 2017, and he has little wiggle room to offer compromises. 'At this stage, Beijing is running the show. Beijing is dictating ways and means that it hopes the Hong Kong government will take to defuse the crisis,' a source said. The only crumb of comfort the authorities can take from recent events is that, as the demonstrations drag out, the groups within the protest camps have become divided as to their aims and means of achieving them. From the start, a key feature of the protests has been their amorphous and organic nature. Three groups at the heart of the movement have rallied the crowds and led efforts to negotiate protesters' demands with the government, but there's no central leadership. Many taking part say the groups, headed by students and a law professor, do not represent them. That spontaneity appealed to many supporters, but it's become clear that the movement is unraveling at the edges and losing its unity of purpose.

As the standoff drags on, factions of more radical protesters are breaking off from the peaceful sit-ins at the main protest zone.

Others responded to calls on social media for flash mobs and what police condemned as 'guerrilla tactics,' sporadically rushing into traffic to dump barriers in the road before running away. Most protesters say they want the movement to stay peaceful, and some are frustrated by the divisions among activists. While many things remain uncertain about the increasingly violent standoff between protesters and police, one thing remains certain: this will not be over anytime soon.

"Customers who signed up for a pre-Christmas cruise for Christians to Turkey, Greece and Israel are still waiting for a refund after the holiday was cancelled 10 days before departure. New Malden-based LivingSun Holidays sold a 10-day break leaving on October 13 but called it off less than a fortnight before setting off citing 'political instability' in the region for leading to a drop in numbers. Company director Bob Fleming said the tour to iconic religious destinations was booked through Thomson Cruises who had yet to refund money paid in advance, meaning LivingSun couldn't pass on the almost £2,500 paid by holidaymakers. The LivingSun Holidays cruise was to take in iconic religious landmarks including Istanbul's Hagia Sophia . Mosaic of the Virgin Mary with baby Jesus, flanked by Emperors Justinian and Constantine, at Hagia Sophia . However, Thomson Cruises say they have had no such dealings with LivingSun. Thomson Cruises said: 'Thomson Cruises is extremely concerned that LivingSun Holidays has been engaging in promotional activities using the Thomson Cruises trademark, as no permission has been granted for this use. 'Thomson Cruises does not have, and has never had, any association with LivingSun Holidays and no booking for this cruise was passed to us by LivingSun Holidays.' One customer, Gospatric Home, 81, who planned to take the trip with his wife Diana, told the Surrey Comet that he was still waiting for a refund of £2,490 from LivingSun Holidays. 'It is a crazy saga,' he told the local paper. 'The money we all paid was not held in an escrow account. If it had been, then he could have repaid it all to everyone.' Gospatric Home, 81 (right) had planned to take the Christian cruise with his wife Diana (left) The homepage of LivingSun Holidays website, which promises 'excellent Christian holidays' Mr Fleming said in a letter to customers that while his company wants to refund customers it simply doesn't have the funds to do so. The letter said: 'The cancellation of the cruise has left us in a difficult financial situation - we have considerable costs which are irrecoverable for us and while we fully accept this is our problem to resolve, it means we simply do not have enough cash at the moment to start the refund process.' He said the company aims to pay 'about 18 people a total of £20,000' by the end of the month. In response to the statement from Thomson, he said: 'We did successfully take a group to Israel with Thomson in April so I should be sorry if they have forgotten about us so soon.' LivingSun's website promises 'excellent Christian holidays for people to enjoy God's creation together' and 'with no disruption from noisy non-Christian neighbours'. Another location for the cancelled cruise was Olympia, home of the Ancient Olympic Games . 'Our aim is to give you a holiday where you can be fully refreshed, mentally, physically and spiritually and we believe it is the presence of God and His living Son at the centre of our holiday operation that makes the difference,' says the website. 'We know what a benefit it is to be surrounded by like-minded people, in an environment which is safe for all. Safe for families, those travelling by themselves and anyone who is looking for a high quality and hassle free holiday.' The company also offers 'special rates for Clergy and Church Workers'. A page entitled Tours lists no products, but states: 'Our tours are all filling up faster than we can list them!'

"The body of a woman has been found in the wreckage of ferry that sunk off the coast of South Korea six months ago. This is the first body to be found in three months, increasing the official death toll in the  Sewol ferry disaster  to 295, officials said.

The Sewol capsized and sank some 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon, South Korea, during a routine voyage on April 16 . Searches of the ferry wreckage have been ongoing since the disaster, and nine people are still missing. The body found on Tuesday was discovered around a women's toilet on the sunken ship, a government taskforce said. The badly decayed body was being pulled up to the surface and DNA tests were planned to identify the victim, according to task force officials.

"Ukraine is on the brink of anarchy and revolution tonight as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators demanded the resignation of pro-Russian authoritarian president Viktor Yanukovych. There were deep fears that the popular uprising could spark a bloody crackdown and state of emergency from the frightened authorities. 'A revolution is starting in Ukraine,'  declared opposition leader Oleh Tyagnybok, as a national strike was called for tomorrow in support of early presidential and parliamentary elections.

Protesters try to break through police lines near the presidential administration building using a bulldozer . Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Kiev as opposition leaders declared there was a revolution . 'The government and president must resign,' demanded world boxing champion turned opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, as he urged police to disobey orders from the authorities. 'Do not work against the people,' he demanded. Former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko told more than 300,000 protestors in central Kiev: 'Our plan is clear: this is no longer a rally or a protest. This is a revolution.' Police used tear gas, truncheons and stun grenades in a bid to halt protesters who used a bulldozer seeking to storm Yanukovych's presidential administration. Outrage erupted in Ukraine, the largest country in eastern Europe with a population of 46 million, after hardline president Yanukovych was accused of obeying a strong-arm demand by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and vetoing a pact for closer ties with the EU. Today's protests defied a government ban on demonstrations on Independence Square and in the biggest show of anger over the president's refusal to sign an agreement with the European Union .

As many as 100,000 demonstrators chased away police to rally in the centre of Ukraine's capital today . People climb up onto a gate near the presidential administration building during the rally . Many pro-Westerners see the move as a step back to Ukraine's bleak Soviet past preventing it one day joining the European Union. A bloody riot police crackdown on 1,000 peaceful protesters in central Kiev in the early hours of Saturday morning led to even more fury against the Ukrainian leader, even though he publicly distanced himself from the violent crackdown, and law enforcement chiefs apologised. The people power protest today - which saw some public offices including the Kiev mayor's HQ occupied by demonstrators - was in defiance of a court order banning  gatherings in Independence Square, iconic scene of the Orange Revoution of 2004 against vote-rigging by Yanukovych's henchmen. Opposition activists claimed the security forces were deliberately staging violent provocations to give  excuses for the authorities to stage a crackdown.

Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko vowed to 'harshly' crackdown on 'mass disturbances'. The embattled president is due to fly to Russia this week to sign a 'roadmap' of new co-operation with Moscow. Coming just days after Ukraine rejected closer ties with the EU, this is likely to provoke further anger among protesters who believe their country will fall under Kremlin subjugation. Main opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko remains in jail on what Western governments deem to be bogus political charges. She urged Ukrainians to maintain their protests against Yanukovych. Lutsenko urged Ukrainians from the regions to surge on Kiev.  'We are not changing the president. We are changing the system of governance. We are changing Ukraine,' he said. Klitschko demanded Yanukovych's toppling, warning of a government deaf to democracy which 'use police to beat people instead of protecting the law'.

US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called on Kiev authorities to respect Ukrainians' right to free expression and assembly, which are 'fundamental to a healthy democracy'.

"Naomi Campbell is without a doubt one of the fashion industry's most famous faces. Scouted at the tender age of 15, Naomi is still one of the world's most in-demand models despite working in the industry for nearly 30 years; it's no she's dubbed a 'super'. Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house -  Naomi, 44, admits that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance. Scroll down for video . Still a super: Naomi Campbell may have broken into the industry nearly thirty years ago but at 44, she's better than ever - and proves it in this glossy shoot for The Edit . Speaking to Net-a-Porter's The Edit, she said: 'I still get scared. I cross myself before I go onto the runway. I pray my dress isn’t going to fall off.' Her biggest fear, she says, is fear itself. 'If you feel fear, fear will come to you. Fear is a terrible thing to have and I’ve been aware of that since I was a kid. It can stop you doing things in your life. I don’t want fear to get hold of me.' High fashion: She's worked for every major fashion house but Naomi admits that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance .

Luckily for Naomi, she's been able to share the experience with her 'fashion family' - a starry host of models, designers and photographers, who have helped nurture her along the way. 'I definitely spent more time around them than around my own blood family as I was traveling and working so much… Azzedine [Alaïa] is more like a papa; Gianni [Versace] was more like a brother,' she said. As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has rocked and rolled between extremes but she is, above all, a survivor.

"Two prostitutes allegedly murdered by a British investment banker in Hong Kong had travelled from their homes in Indonesia to seek a better life, their friends said today. The mutilated bodies of Sumatra Ningsih and Jesse Lorena were found in Rurik Jutting's flat in the early hours of Saturday morning. Miss Ningsih, whose decomposing body was stuffed in a suitcase on the balcony, had travelled to the former British colony only a month ago from her home in the central Java city of Cilacap. Miss Lorena, who is believed to have been officially living in Hong Kong as a domestic helper, was said to be building a house back home and planned to return there soon. Jesse Lorena (pictured posing with cash) was found by police with her throat slashed at Jutting's apartment . Seeking a better life: Miss Lorena is thought to have been among the thousands of young Indonesian women who set out into the ‘outside world’ to take up a variety of jobs, many of them in the domestic service industry . The pair are believed to have been brought up as Muslims. MailOnline understands that her real name is Seneng Mujiasih and that she comes from the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi, joining the many thousands of young Indonesian women who set out into the ‘outside world’ to take up a variety of jobs, many of them in the domestic service industry. She has told friends that she had earned enough money in her years in Hong Kong to be able to have a house built for herself and her family in Indonesia. Hours before her murder, Miss Lorena gleefully told friends she was going to a Halloween party, adding: 'I'm going to have fun.' Dutch DJ Robert van den Bosch, who has known Miss Lorena for four years, said he heard her talking to two friends outside a pub in Wan Chai’s red light district at around 8.45pm. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'She said ""I’m going to have fun. I’m going to a Halloween party"" 'Those really were the last words. Those are the two things repeating in my head.' Mr van den Bosch, who works at the pub, said it was a 'shock' when he learned of her brutal death the following day. Victim: One of the two women discovered inside Jutting's luxury apartment in Hong Kong. The woman, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, was 30 years old and originally from the Philippines . Horrific death: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after . He said Miss Lorena had lived in Hong Kong for at least eight years after moving from a small island in Java to 'find a better life'. Miss Lorena was regularly seen in the pubs and shops in the notorious red-light district, according to locals. But Mr van den Bosch denied reports that she was a prostitute, saying she was a domestic helper who had been sending money back home to Indonesia where she was building a house. 'The terrible thing is that her house... was just finished and she said she would leave Hong Kong and go back to Indonesia to enjoy life, he added. Eight hours after her body was found, during a forensic examination of the flat, police officers spotted a suitcase on the balcony which had two feet protruding. Butchered: Sex workers named locally as Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Jesse Lorena Ruri (right) were found dead at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment in Hong Kong after the investment banker called police . 'Insane psychopath': British banker Rurik Jutting has been charged with the murder of two prostitutes found butchered at his Hong Kong flat. He is pictured here with Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie, who is believed to be one of the trader's former girlfriends . Inside was the decomposing naked body of the second prostitute, 25-year-old Indonesian Sumarti Ningsih. According to a spokesman for Indonesia’s Head of Development and Productivity Placement Miss Ningsih had approached a private ‘placement company’ in Cilacap, which found her a job in Hong Kong, although it was not immediately known what that work was. Officials from several welfare and workers’ organisations said they were still trying to trace family members of both women who might not be aware of the grisly murders. Referring to the 25-year-old, a spokesman for the Department of Social Welfare and Manpower, said: 'We are trying to trace the address of Miss Ningsih,’ Court date: A handcuffed Rurik Jutting is taken to a Hong Kong court by police car after being charged with the murders of the two women . Investigation: Forensics check the crime scene at the luxury £2,000-a-month apartment in Wan Chai district . Grisly discovery: One of the bodies is carried out of the flats after the banker was charged with double murder . Calacap, a south coast port town lying nearly 200 miles south east of Jakarta, has a population of more than a million and competition for work is said to be intense. It was cut off from air travel when the airport closed several years ago and travellers are now faced with a tedious journey along roads jammed with motor scooters. Tourists are put off from visiting because the town’s most well known beaches have become fouled from leakage from shipping vessels that dock nearby. Despite the authorities' efforts to clean up the area, it is filled with hotel rooms that can be rented by the hour. One user wrote on the internet: 'The more expensive ones almost seem like normal business hotels – the cheaper ones are like mental hospitals.' Robberies and money-laundering are also rife and Chinese gangsters are said to run many of the bars. Wan Chai – where Rurik Jutting is thought to have picked up £200-a-night prostitutes – is Hong Kong's notorious red light district. Just two blocks away from his apartment, hundreds of bars and clubs are teeming with mainly south-east Asian sex workers, who offer 'lady drinks' to potential customers before discreetly negotiating prices for sex. The area was made infamous by the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong, about a Chinese prostitute. Prostitution is legal in Hong Kong, but many women working as 'freelancers' are doing so illegally as they are there on tourist visas – including Miss Ningsih. Officials who take responsibility for foreigners in the colony said that was not her real name.","Sumatra Ningsih and Jesse Lorena 'killed by British banker Rurik Jutting'

"A family has been left distraught after it was revealed four brothers slipped out of Australia last week to join the fight with the Islamic State in the Middle East. As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists  from leaving the country, the latest recruits from Western Sydney have been labelled 'cleanskins' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence. It is thought that the four brothers made their way to Syria after they told their parents they were going on a trip to Thailand, according to the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. 1 . Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, the Daily Telegraph reports. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late. 'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph. It follows after 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video. According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports. This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph. Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere. 'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head . Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan speaking at the investigation into new legislation in Canberra on Thursday . Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism. He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months. Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia, reports suggest .

"A young mother who loved the TV show The Only Way is Essex has run away to Syria with her baby son after becoming obsessed with extremist propaganda she found online. Tareena Shakil, 25 – a one-time Spice Girls fan, school prefect and Girl Guide – was so fascinated with the ITV reality show that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. Yesterday her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria, lying to her family that she was taking her 14-month-old son on holiday to Spain. 'We can't come back': Tareena Shakil, 25, pictured with 14-month-old Zaheem, has run away to Syria after becoming obsessed with extremist propaganda she found online . In terrifying messages home, she told them ‘so many people died’ when they ‘got shot at the border’ but that she and her son Zaheem made it because she ‘ran across’. It is feared Miss Shakil plans to marry a jihadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, in the latest case of a British Muslim woman joining the group that murdered UK hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. Her father Mohammed Shakil, 42, said: ‘We are absolutely distraught that our beautiful, bright, intelligent daughter has chosen this path. I have never cried so much in my life and would do anything to have her and our grandson back in our arms.’ It is feared Miss Shakil plans to marry a jihadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa . Miss Shakil grew up in Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire. ‘Tareena did drama and was in the Guides,’ her father told The Sun. ‘She loved the Spice Girls and TOWIE.’ Mr Shakil said she did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced. But around four months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the IS black flag, and calling herself a ‘slave to Allah’. Last week she set off with Zaheem, telling her family she was going to Spain. In reality she bought a ticket to Turkey, from where she crossed the porous border into Syria. ‘There was no reason to suspect,’ her father said. ‘She left wearing jeans and a top she bought in a shop owned by one of the TOWIE stars. My little grandson shouldn’t be going through this.’ Miss Shakil has told her family she is in Raqqa and can never return. One message reads: ‘I can’t come back there now … we can’t. Tell her don’t cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!’ Of her journey, she wrote: ‘So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.’ At their housing association home in Burton-on-Trent yesterday, Mr Shakil and his wife Mandy, 47, were too upset to discuss the news. But in a statement, her father said: ‘We brought Tareena up in a Western environment, while respecting the culture of Islam, and hoped that she would take the best of both worlds.’ The 25-year-old grew up in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire (pictured) and loved Towie and the Spice Girls . Mr Shakil, who has served a prison sentence for dealing drugs, said: ‘I, myself, have made mistakes in the past but it never affected that close, deep bond that exists in special father-and-his-daughter relationships. Like any father, I just want the best for my daughter. ‘We want her to know how much we love her and want her back safely as soon as possible.’ Mr Shakil was jailed for 28 months in 2011 after police stopped his car and found crack cocaine, heroin and mobile phones he used to deal drugs. He admitted possessing a knife. His son Tazeem, 22, featured regularly in a local paper which dubbed him ‘Burton’s most prolific persistent young offender’, with 20 convictions and an Asbo by age 14. Around four months ago, Tareena Shakil set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages . One of the posts featured on the Facebook page featuring the chilling black flag of terror group ISIS . This photo of a sunset was also posted onto the young mother's Facebook site . Aged 17, it reported he had ‘turned over a new leaf’ and started work at a local firm, but three years later he was jailed for crashing a car into a house and fleeing the scene while banned from driving. The couple have two younger children. Local MP Andrew Griffiths said he would do ‘whatever he could’ to help the family. ‘I think this news will have shocked everyone across Burton,’ he said. ‘We now need to ensure this does not happen to others.’ Miss Shakil’s disappearance is being investigated by West Midlands Police as she is thought to have been living in Birmingham. Yusra Hussein, 15, who left her home to join ISIS in Syria. Right, police leave Yusra's home in Bristol, where she fled telling her parents she was off on a school trip . Salma (left) and Zahra Halane (right), have reportedly married ISIS fighters. They left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border . A spokesman said: ‘A 25-year-old woman from Sparkbrook was reported missing by a member of her family on October 24. 'We have since been working to establish the woman’s whereabouts and that she is safe and well. One of our lines of enquiry is that she may have travelled to Syria via Turkey.’ She is the latest young woman to travel to Syria to join Islamic State, apparently as a ‘jihadi bride’. X-Factor fan Yusra Hussien, 15, flew to Turkey in September with a 17-year-old girl she met online. They are thought to be in Syria. Twins Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, who hoped to become doctors, also ran away from their home in Manchester to Syria, where social media posts show them learning to use assault rifles.","Tareena Shakil, of Burton, crossed into strife-hit country from Turkey .

"Cradling his baby in one arm and brandishing an assault rifle in the other, this is the British jihadist who skipped bail to fight for Islamic State. Siddhartha Dhar posted the photograph online to taunt the police and security services whose blunders allowed him to flee the UK. The 31-year-old – one of hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s top henchmen – is apparently living in Syria almost a month after he went on the run with his pregnant wife and family while under investigation by Scotland Yard. The fugitive, also known as Abu Rumaysah, posted the image on his Twitter social media account which bears his Muslim name with the hashtag Generation Khilafah – a reference to the so-called caliphate. Sickening: This morning Siddhartha Dhar uploaded this image of him posing with a gun and his newborn baby boy in Islamic State-held area of Syria . Siddhartha  Dhar, circled, disappeared only 24 hours after being released on police bail, the follower of Anjem Choudary, centre, took a coach to Paris with his family before travelling on to Syria . Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists. He wrote: ‘Alhamdulillah [all praise be to Allah], Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he’s definitely not British. Will try to post a pic of him soon.’ In a picture posted yesterday, Dhar was standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. He cradles the baby against his chest with his left arm, his son’s face peeking out of a tightly-knitted babygrow. Dhar holds an AK47-style assault rifle in his other hand, with the barrel pointing toward the sky and away from his child. The black IS flag is the Twitter account’s profile image. Dhar, a father of four from Walthamstow, was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting radical cleric Anjem Choudary and the banned militant group al-Muhajiroun. He is believed to have met, and possibly mentored, Michael Adebolajo, one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Taunt: Dhar - who goes by the name of Abu Rumaysah - apparently tweeted these messages on Monday . Dhar was released on bail and ordered to hand in his passport. But less than 24 hours after walking free, he took a coach from London to Paris and headed to the Islamic State war zone with his young family. Prior to posting the photo, Dhar taunted the police on Twitter for clumsily allowing him to slip through their fingers: ‘What a shoddy security system Britain must have to allow me to breeze through Europe to the Islamic State.’ He also boasted how he had fooled MI5, the British intelligence service: ‘My Lord (Allah) made a mockery of British intelligence and surveillance. ‘Make hijrah (flight) Muslims. Place your trust in Allah.’ Proclaiming his love for Islamic State and the importance of the fight against the West, Dhar wrote: ‘The Islamic State will punish the tyrants in the West. The army of Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is coming. Rejoice O Muslims.’ Dhar, who has been courted by broadcast media and repeatedly given a platform on the BBC and Channel 4 to promote his radical views, had publicly stated that he wanted to live under the Islamic State in Syria. A few weeks before his arrest, he told one interviewer that he was willing to renounce his British citizenship if it meant he was allowed to travel. Dhar was also interviewed by CBS News’s 60 Minutes programme about radicalisation in the UK earlier this month, telling presenter Clarissa Ward that he was unable to love his mother because she was not a Muslim. Titled ‘Campaigning for ISIS in the West’, the episode focused on Choudary’s band of London-based radicals. It is understood that Dhar is of Indian origin and was brought up a Hindu before converting to Islam. He was a key member of al-Muhajiroun and offshoot groups such as the Shariah Project, masterminding ‘roadshows’ in London that aimed to recruit troubled youngsters to Islam. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said last night: ‘Dhar was bailed to a date in January next year with bail conditions. Police are now working to establish his whereabouts.’ Dhar was among  nine men including Choudary, right, held and questioned by police in September . Yesterday a woman in her twenties who is believed to be Dhar’s sister spoke of how her family had been trying unsuccessfully to contact him since he left the country. Speaking on the doorstep of her terraced home on the busy North Circular road at Edmonton, north London, she said: ‘We ourselves are trying to reach out to him and haven’t found a route.’ As she spoke, a second woman, thought to be Dhar’s mother, appeared cradling a baby. More than 500 Britons are feared to have travelled to Syria, with many joining Islamic State. Around half are suspected to have returned already.

"A girl aged around 12 years old is being hunted by police over the theft of a diamond necklace worth £3million from under the noses of staff at a luxury jewellery shop. The heist - which detectives have described as 'very well planned' - also involved two women and a man, all aged between 30 and 40, who posed as big spenders at the store in Hong Kong. Well-dressed and speaking Chinese, the adults distracted staff at the Emperor Jewellery shop while the girl stole a key from a drawer, opened a cabinet and slipped the necklace into her pocket, according to police.

Detectives say she may have quickly changed her appearance after leaving the shop before jumping into a taxi to escape. Shop staff did not notice the 100-carat gold necklace embedded with more than 30 diamonds was missing until shortly before 5pm. Her adult accomplices remained inside the shopping mall as if nothing had happened.

"A teenage British Muslim whose brother died fighting in war-torn Syria has also been killed, their father said today. Jaffar Deghayes, 17, is believed to have died at the weekend after leaving home near Brighton earlier this year in a bid to overthrow dictator Bashar Al-Assad's government. His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda-affiliated group. Scroll down for video . Brothers from East Sussex: Jaffar Deghayes (left), 17, is believed to have died at the weekend after leaving home near Brighton earlier this year for Syria. His brother, Abdullah (right), 18, died in Latakia province in April . From Britain to Syria: Jaffar left his home (above) near Brighton in Saltdean, East Sussex, earlier this year . Yesterday the pair's brother, Amer, 20, who also travelled to Syria, relayed news of the death of Jaffar to their father, Abubaker Deghayes, 45, back home in Saltdean, East Sussex. Mr Deghayes said: ‘Amer sent me a message via the internet. All I know is that (Jaffar) was fighting against Assad and was killed in battle. ‘I don't know much else. I can only hope and pray to God to accept him and have mercy on him.’ The Deghayes brothers are the nephew of Omar Deghayes, who was held by the U.S. as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from 2002 to 2007 after he was arrested in Pakistan. He wrote in Arabic on Facebook confirming the boy's death, saying: ‘As you grieve, know that we are remembering you and honouring the memory of a sincere and truthful young man (deceased).' BBC Newsnight reporter Secunder Kermani also said on Twitter: 'I spoke to Jaffer [sic] Deghayes a few times whilst he was in Syria, very polite and friendly person with me... Poor family.' Following the death of Abdullah, counter-terrorism officers raided the Deghayes' family home in May and seized material after a warrant was issued under the Terrorism Act 2000. There was no answer at the family home today and all but one pair of curtains remained drawn. Grieving father: Abubaker Deghayes (pictured), was told of the death of his son yesterday at home in Saltdean . 'Truthful young man': Omar Deghayes, uncle of Jaffar and Abdullah, posted on Facebook following the death . A woman who lives nearby, but did not wish to be named, said: ‘To lose one son is awful, but to lose two so close together is unimaginable. The family must be going through a terrible time. 'I don't understand why these teenagers are putting their lives at risk like this.’ Related: The Deghayes brothers are the nephews of Omar Deghayes (above), who was held by the U.S. as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay until 2007 . Sussex Police urged anyone who has concerns or information about anyone locally planning to travel to Syria or Iraq to contact the force. A police statement said: ‘The south east counter-terrorism unit and Sussex Police are aware of recent social media postings reporting the death of a man who may have come from Brighton during fighting in either Syria or Iraq. ‘Whilst we will not comment on individual cases, reports like these remind everyone that the situation in Syria and Iraq is unsafe and that risk of injury, death or abduction remains for anyone travelling to that area. ‘The Government advice continues to be that no one should travel to these war zones and that the most effective way to help the affected population is through humanitarian support. ‘Anyone locally who has concerns or information about someone who is planning to travel to Syria or Iraq for whatever reason or are hearing or seeing negative tensions within communities can contact the Sussex Police prevent engagement team.’ Abubaker Deghayes has previously said that his three sons could have helped the cause in Syria from the UK by lobbying the government. But in a film shot by Vice News this year, Amer Deghayes said he had no intention of returning to Britain, adding: ‘My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.’ He added: ‘I'm in the Syrian civil war because I believe it's my duty to fight here ...The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.’ Speaking in June Mr Deghayes, said: 'Amer, Jaffar, if you see me or this interview please, please come back home. Enough. This war has taken away Abdullah already. Family: Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after . The Deghayes' parents had insisted their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak . 'I'd like to see you live longer. I said [to them] ""why are you going there, it's not worth it? You have to stick to helping in the refugee camps and doing the humanitarian work"". I am scared for my children. I don't want to lose them obviously. But they are becoming men now.' After Abdullah died in April, his father described him as a 'martyr' and revealed he only learned of the death when he saw tributes on Facebook. Mr Deghayes said at the time: 'He was a youngster who didn't communicate a lot. With parents, once they grow, they don't tell you much about their lives.' And asked whether he believed Abdullah was a martyr, Mr Deghayes replied: 'Of course I think, as a Muslim, that my son is a martyr. Anyone who dies for a just cause is a martyr.' Counter-terrorism investigators have expressed concern about aspiring British jihadis travelling to Syria and becoming radicalised. It emerged this month that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - died fighting in Kobani. Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October last year. In January alone, 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences related to Syria compared with 24 arrests in the whole of last year. Spotted leaving Gatwick Airport: Three other men from Portsmouth - including Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (right) - have also been killed after travelling to Syria last year . Another death: A fourth man from Portsmouth-  Muhammad Mehdi Hassan (above) - died in Kobani, it emerged . Father-of-three: Abdul Waheed Majeed (pictured at a refugee camp on the border of Turkey and Syria), from Crawley, West Sussex, is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February . Others who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack. Abdul Waheed Majeed is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February. The 41-year-old married father-of-three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. A Foreign Office spokesman said today: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria. The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended. 'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.' Around 25 Britons are believed to have died in the conflict in Syria and Iraq, and they are being killed at a rate of more than one every three weeks, according to researchers at King’s College London. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said last week that five British extremists are joining ISIS every week, with more than 500 already having travelled to join the conflict.","Jaffar Deghayes died at the weekend after leaving home in East Sussex .

"Rene Meulensteen has questioned Sir Alex Ferguson over United's failure to win the Premier League in 2012 and their 2009 Champions League Final defeat. The former first-team coach queried Ferguson's decision to drop Paul Scholes for their defeat at Wigan in a match they lost 1-0 which he believes handed the title to cross-town rivals City three years ago. And he also queried the Scotsman's starting XI for their clash with Barcelona in Rome in which they were beaten 2-0. Rene Meulensteen (right) believes Sir Alex Ferguson's tactics cost Manchester United more silverware . Meulensteen believes Ferguson's decisions saw United miss out on the 2011-12 Premier League and 2008-09 Champions League to Manchester City and Barcelona respectively . Meulensteen (left) worked as part of Ferguson's first-team coaching staff between 2007-2013 . Meulensteen, who enjoyed two spells at Old Trafford before leaving when David Moyes was appointed in 2013, made the comments in an interview with fanzine United We Stand. Referring to the 2012 title race, which saw City pip their rivals to the post, the Dutchman highlighted the April night match at the DW Stadium as the one in which United blew it. 'That's where we lost the league,' he said. 'The manager thought that Paul Scholes, our key player and the one who could change the rhythm of the game, wasn't right to play two games in a week (United had beaten QPR on the Saturday, a match Scholes scored in) and for that reason he wasn't in the squad and we missed him.'

Meulensteen, who was sacked after a short stint in charge at Fulham following his departure from United, added: 'We couldn't score and we should have had a penalty at the end but Phil Dowd didn't give it.' The 50-year-old, now with MLS club Philadelphia Union, also revealed what happened on the last day of the 2011-12 season at Sunderland where, following their victory, United were top of the table and set to become champions before Sergio Aguero's late winner for City against QPR snatched the title away from them.

"A sickening photo has emerged social media showing a toddler kicking the severed head of a dead soldier in Syria. The toddler's father is believed to be an avid Islamic State supporter and is wearing a camouflage military style baseball cap on his head. The father can be seen smiling with delight in the photo as he watches his innocent child kick the severed head. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Shocking photo has emerged showing a suspected ISIS supporter encouraging a toddler to kick the severed head of a dead soldier . Leaning over, the bearded man, wearing a short white thoub, appears to be helping his young child to raise their small leg and kick the rotting head of the dead body. At least one person, wearing three quarter length jeans can be seen watching the horrific scene. The severed head, which is too gruesome to show in full detail, appears to be several days old. It appears to be the head of a dead prisoner, although it is hard to distinguish his features due to the heavy decomposition of the face. The face has also suffered a deep wound, suggesting the victim had been militated with a knife. The horrific photo comes just hours after 'Raqqa is being Slaughtered silently', a Syrian activist group based in the ISIS stronghold posted photos of the latest barbaric execution carried out by IS. A photo of children crowding around the body of a crucified and beheaded Syrian rebel member has emerged . The photo shows a crowd of young boys, standing around a wooden gallows. There appears to be at least ten boys in the photo, but few are focused on the gruelsome scene nearby. At the center of the photo is the body of a Syrian rebel member, who has been crucified and beheaded. It is believed he was the relative of Zahran Alloush, the renowned leader of Jaysh al-Islam, one of the groups which is part of the Islamic Front and fighting to form their own Islamic State in Syria. Zahran Alloush shot to fame for surprising reasons in early July when Islamic Front released a video showing the imposing figure of Alloush delivering a rousing speech to denounce Islamic State. However, it was his notebook which attracted a bigger talking point rather than the words of his speech. On his desk, a Hello Kitty notebook appears to have been used by Alloush whilst making notes for his speech. Zahran Alloush (right) shot to fame after delivering a rousing speech to denounce Islamic State with a Hello Kitty notebook on his desk . The Japanese brand, which celebrated its 40th birthday the other day, is better known to be the trusted diary for teenage girls rather than fearsome rebel leaders, leading many Islamic State supporters to mock Alloush on social media. It is unknown exactly how closely related the dead prisoner in the photo was to Zahran Alloush. However due to the age of his body, it is likely he was possibly a distant, younger cousin. The photo shows how he was subjected to a brutal death as his arms are bound to the scaffolds in an outstretched crucifixion pose. The head has been severed from his body and placed on his lap, with blood still dripping from the open neck wound. The horrific scene, which appears to have been openly witnessed by children, underlines the brutality of Islamic State. Their interpretation of Shari'a law has meant that public executions for crimes like 'cursing God' and 'sorcery' have become a fixture in the city's public square. Young boys appear to be openly encouraged to witness these appalling scenes without any consideration by adults. 'Raqqa is being slaughtered silently' has developed a reputation for providing a shocking insight into life in Raqqa. The secret activist group, whose members risk their lives to document the atrocities happening in the IS held city of Raqqa, have previously published other photos of public executions and general oppression. Several of the groups members have been imprisoned and executed, whilst attempting to document the crimes being carried out by Islamic State militants.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Toddler encouraged to kick severed head .

"Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Turkey has been forced to file for bankruptcy after only 14 months of operation. The Jamie's Italian in Istanbul's $2.5billion Zorlu Center Mall was unable to reach targets due to a tough economic climate, it was reported. A bankruptcy hearing was told the chain, which is the Italian eatery's largest branch abroad in the summer when it can accommodate almost 200 diners on its outdoor terrace, planned to cut staff and put in more capital after experiencing financial difficulties. Scroll down for video . Jamie Oliver's Istanbul restaurant filed for bankruptcy after only 14 months of operation. Pictured, the celebrity chef, 39, at Jamie's Italian in Manchester . Jamie's Italian in Istanbul's $2.5billion Zorlu Center Mall, pictured, was unable to reach targets due to a tough economic climate, it was reported . The restaurant suffered due to the lower prices offered to compete in the city and a a lower than forecast footfall, the Hurriet Daily News reported. A spokesman for Jamie Oliver told MailOnline the restaurant will not be closing. He said: 'Jamie's Italian Istanbul is trading well but is currently in some negotiations with regards to its operations and it is standard practise to request protection from the Court from its creditors whilst those negotiations are ongoing.' He added: 'Jamie's Italian is working closely with its Turkish partners to resolve the current situation in Istanbul. In the meantime, the Jamie's Italian restaurant brand remains hugely successful across the world. 'In Australia, the Sydney Jamie's Italian had record numbers of customers through the door in the run up to Christmas while the Perth restaurant still has queues out of the door almost two years after opening.' The company cited the country's tough economic conditions had been a factor as Turkey's growth fell from 8.8% in 2011 to just 1.7% in the last quarter of 2014. But Ozgur Altug, chief Turkey economist at BGC Partners, said 'almost all other restaurant and chains are going fine'. He added restaurants in Istanbul are a 'lucrative business' and 'this has nothing to do with the economy'. 'Turks do not hesitate to eat out even in tough times.' Jamie’s Italian has been rapidly expanding since it was founded in Oxford in 2008 - with more than 30 restaurants worldwide, including Singapore, Dubai and Russia. Cleared out: The former Recipease store on Western Road, Brighton, was pictured boarded up last year . Early in 2014, all bar one of Oliver's nostalgic Union Jacks restaurants, including the Chiswick branch, pictured, were shut down . But other business ventures haven't fared as well. In October last year, the 39-year-old chef unexpectedly closed two of his cookery class shops - and failed to tell staff until they were abruptly cleared out of the premises during a shift. He shut down his Recipease branches in Clapham Junction and Brighton after five years of operation - with a spokesman claiming they were 'focusing energies on their flagship Notting Hill branch'. But MailOnline reported that one customer, who called to complain about a cancelled booking, said a despondent former employee temporarily posted to customer services admitted the stores were 'making no money'. Early in 2014, all bar one of Oliver's nostalgic Union Jacks restaurants were shut down amid financial troubles. The television chef's company cited a 'challenging climate' as the reason for closures of branches in Holborn, Chiswick and Winchester - with only the branch in Covent Garden remaining open. An employee from the store claims a woman from head office came into the shop during the day to close the place down without warning . A worker from the Clapham branch, pictured with windows boarded, says she she turned up for work to find the doors were locked . After leaving school at 16 years old with just two GCSEs, Jamie Oliver has built a £240million business empire and is one of the most recognised chefs in the world. Here are some of his biggest hits, along with a few of his recent failures. TV PROGRAMMES AND BOOKS . The Naked Chef, 1999: He became a household name after launching the hit TV show in 1999. Jamie's 30 minute Meals, 2010: Channel 4 series of 40 episodes focused on home-cooked meals that could be put together within the titular timeframe, using simple techniques. Jamie's 15 Minute Meals, 2012: A re-vamp of his previous show - now for people with even less time. Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, 2014: Jamie and best mate Jimmy Doherty join forces at their end-of-the-pier caff in Southend to make feasts for the weekend. CRUSADING CAMPAIGNS . Jamie's School Dinners, 2005: The rising star hit headlines with his campaign against unhealthy school dinners in this four-part documentary. Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution, 2010: After his UK crusade, the chef met resistance in the USA and was barred from entering any public school in LA - with his ABC show also getting cancelled. BUSINESS VENTURES . Jamie’s Italian: The brand has become hugely successful with chains opening up around the world. Fifteen Restaurant: Initiative designed to give young people the chance to turn their life around with apprenticeships - it recently met controversy for employing a convicted paedophile. Recipease: After opening in 2009, two of the three stores were shut down last year. Union Jack's: The high-priced British-themed venues were hit by bad reviews and complaints and three out of four branches closed in January 2014.

"Counter-terror police have arrested a 27-year-old man accused of financing extremists in Syria. The suspect was held this morning in Slough, Berkshire, under Section 17 of the Terrorism Act after an investigation by specialist officers. A top police chief once again sounded a warning against travelling to Syria, where hundreds of British extremists are fighting with Islamist groups. The arrest in Slough (pictured) comes a month after the same unit held six people across the South East . The South East Counter Terrorism Unit carried out the investigation as officers from Thames Valley Police moved to reassure locals. Superintendent Simon Bowden said: 'I would like to reassure the community that this investigation should have very little impact on local residents. 'The arrest was pre-planned and was not made in response to any immediate threat to public safety in Slough. 'We will continue to work with our partners and community in the interests of public safety . 'I would ask that we all continue to discourage anyone from attempting to travel to Syria or other areas of conflict.' Thames Valley Police Superintendent Simon Bowden said: 'I would ask that we all continue to discourage anyone from attempting to travel to Syria or other areas of conflict'. Hundreds of Brits are fighting abroad . There have been a string of arrests after Home Secretary Theresa May warned hundreds of Britons were travelling to fight with jihadis in Iraq and Syria. The arrest comes less than a week after four men were held in London on suspicion of a terror plot. The men aged between 19 and 27 were detained in west London and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on Thursday and Friday - days before Remembrance Sunday. Scotland Yard refused to comment on suggestions that the commemorations could have been the target of any plot. Today's arrest is the latest in a string of raids by the South East Counter Terrorism Unit. A 26-year-old man was held in Slough in July accused of financing terrorist acts. Two Slough homes were also raided in September as part of inquiries into seven terror suspects arrested in Holyhead, North Wales, but they were later released without charge. Crackdown: There have been several arrests in Britain over the rise of groups like ISIS in Syria (pictured) And six people were arrested across the region on October 14 on suspicion of terror crimes in Portsmouth, Hampshire, Greenwich, London and Farnborough, Surrey. Tuhin Shahensha, 26, and Mustakim Jaman, 23 - both from Southsea, Portsmouth - were charged with preparing terrorist acts. Two suspects remain on bail and two were released without charge. There is no indication the arrests are directly related to the one carried out today, but they are all part of the same wide-ranging bid to stop Brits causing unrest in Iraq and Syria. Chief Inspector Gavin Wong said previously: 'I would ask that we all continue to discourage anyone from attempting to travel to Syria or other areas of conflict. 'While the motive may be honourable, the reality is that these areas are hugely dangerous, and it can be an opportunity to radicalise vulnerable people.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Arrest was for 'conflicts overseas' as officer sounded warning over Syria .

"A Utah lawmaker concerned about government spying on its citizens wants to cut the water supply  to a National Security Agency data storage facility outside Salt Lake City. Republican representative Marc Roberts told a legislative committee meeting that he was concerned about privacy and surveillance conducted by the centre, and a number of residents who spoke at the meeting agreed. But his plan didn't get the backing of lawmakers who didn't back his bill. However, they did agree to study the facility. A Utah lawmaker concerned about government spying on its citizens wants to cut the water supply to a National Security Agency data storage facility outside Salt Lake City . Republican Representative Marc Roberts told a legislative committee meeting that he was concerned about privacy and surveillance conducted by the centre; lawmakers said they aren't considering shutting down the $1.7 billion facility, but the committee chair acknowledged the concerns and said there might be another way to get the point across . Web developer Joe Levi said: 'This is not a bill just about a data center. This is a bill about civil rights. 'This is a bill that needs to be taken up and needs to be taken seriously.' Pete Ashdown, founder of Salt Lake City-based Internet provider XMission, called the center a stain upon the state and its technology industry. He said: 'I do encourage you to stand up and do something about it.' Lawmakers said they aren't considering shutting down the $1.7 billion facility, but the committee chair acknowledged the concerns and said there might be another way to get the point across. Republican senator David Hinkins said: 'We may look at some type of a strong message to give our representatives to take back to Congress.' The NSA's largest data storage center in the U.S. was built in Utah over 37 other locations because of open land and cheap electricity. The center sits on a National Guard base about 25 miles south of Salt Lake City in the town of Bluffdale. NSA officials said the center is key to protecting national security networks and allowing U.S. authorities to watch for cyber threats. Beyond that, the agency has offered few details. Interest in the center and its activities soared last year when it was revealed the NSA had been collecting millions of U.S. phone records and digital communications stored by major Internet providers. Cybersecurity experts say the nondescript Utah facility is a giant storehouse for phone calls, emails and online records that have been secretly collected. Outside the computer storehouses are large coolers that keep the machines from overheating. The coolers use large amounts of water, which Bluffdale sells to the center at a discounted rate. Interest in the center and its activities soared last year when it was revealed the NSA had been collecting millions of U.S. phone records and digital communications stored by major Internet providers . City records released earlier this year showed monthly water use was much less than the 1 million gallons a day that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers predicted the center would need. This led to speculation that the center might not be fully operational. NSA officials have refused to say if the center is up and running after its scheduled opening in October 2013 was stalled by electrical problems. City utility records showed the NSA has been making monthly minimum payments of about $30,000 to Bluffdale. The city manager said that pays for more water than the center used. The state of Nevada shut off water to the site of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas in 2002, after months of threats. The project didn't run dry because the Energy Department built a 1-million-gallon tank and a small well for the site. Department officials said the stored water, plus 400,000 gallons stored in other tanks at the Nevada Test Site, provided time for scientists to continue experiments and design work at the site.","The centre is the National Security Agency's biggest U.S. storage facility .

"The mother of two British teenagers who are believed to have travelled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters after becoming radicalised online was taken by the group as she tried to rescue them, it has been reported. Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, are thought to have married in the war-torn nation since disappearing  overnight from their home in June. Their father Ibrahim, 52, and mother Khadra Jama, 45, who are originally from Somalia, travelled to the region to try to bring them home but Khadra was detained by fighters. Scroll down for video . Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, are thought to have married ISIS fighters in Syria. Their mother Khadra reportedly travelled to the region to try to bring them home . She was later released and returned to Britain after her daughter insisted that Allah had 'chosen' for them to be in Syria. The parents made their rescue attempt in July, first flying to Turkey to link up with a Muslim charity worker from Denmark, reports the Sunday Times. The charity worker made contact with sources inside Syria and one of them knew the ISIS chief in al-Bab, where one of the girls is believed to live, who gave him safe passage. A source told the paper: 'He talked to her for a long time but she didn't want to return. She said she had been exclusively chosen by Allah to come to al-Sham (Syria).' He then crossed back into Turkey before travelling to the Syrian town of Manbij, where the other sister lives. This time Khadra accompanied him, but the pair were arrested on suspicion of being Danish and British spies before they could see the daughter. Details are murky about how, but the pair were freed in September and Khadra returned home. A number of  British Muslims have travelled to Syria to marry jihadis and settle in the Islamic State. File picture . Greater Manchester Police said: 'It is not a criminal offence to travel there' when asked if they had questioned the mother. The twins had previously vowed never to return home after going to Syria and social media updates suggest the pair are training to use grenades and Kalashnikov rifles. Previous tweets from Zahra included messages such as ‘I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It’s self defence’ and pictures of machine guns alongside the Koran. The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Ibrahim and Khadra have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. A senior member of the Somali community in Manchester said  they were ‘appalled’ at the sisters' actions . ‘Everyone is really shocked the twins are still in Syria with these so-called jihadi fighters who are carrying out such atrocities,’ he said. 'We, as a Somali people, are all appalled by their actions but we are also desperately sad for their family.","Khadra Jama is believed to have tried to rescue her two daughters .

The decomposed remains of a number of victims  still lie at the crash site of MH17 in east Ukraine after it was blasted out of the sky by pro-Russian separatists in July. And, as these grim pictures show, next to nothing has been done to clean up the area in a region still rocked by war. Chilling: Lined up beside a mangled piece of aircraft wreckage, four cuddly toys sit where they have sat for three months - a chilling reminder of what happened here on that tragic day . Bodies: The decomposed remains of a number of victims - possibly even the teddies' owners - still lie at the crash site of MH17 in east Ukraine - 88 days since it was blasted out of the sky by pro-Russian separatists . Of 298 passengers who perished aboard the Malaysian Airlines flight on July 17 this year, 26 are still there, unidentified and left to rot in the grass. Many of their belongings - the personal effects looters could not sell - are still strewn across the field - including books, toothpaste tubes, playing cards, a plastic watch and a stick of antiperspirant. Most of the rest, like the bodies still here, are too badly burned to be identified. But finally today, four Dutch experts arrived to help recover the belongings of victims despite fighting between government troops and separatist rebels nearby. The experts said they were on hand to advise a local Emergencies Ministry team combing the wreckage in the fields where the plane was brought down on July 17, killing all 298 passengers and crew, a Reuters correspondent on the scene said.

"Abu Rahin Aziz, 32 (pictured), from Luton, skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End. He has since fled to Syria to join ISIS . A radical Islamist who stabbed a football fan in the head with a pen has skipped bail and fled Britain to join ISIS in Syria. Abu Rahin Aziz, 32, from Luton, skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End. He told his followers on Twitter that he 'stabbed a kafir [non-believer] in the back of a head (sic) with a pen in London for insulting the prophet Mohammed.' The former credit control operator, who is an associate of the radical cleric Anjem Choudary, has since posted a picture of himself dressed in a military vest and posing with an AK-47 rifle. He was once part of a radical hate group called Muslims against Crusaders, who set fire to a large poppy on Armistice Day in 2010. The group also reportedly targeted Andrew White, who had been watching the League Two play-off final, before chanting 'f*** the Queen' after allegedly assaulting him. On Saturday, Aziz contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK. He wrote: 'Still deciding to what to do with my British passport, could burn it, flush it down the toilet.' It is unclear whether he took his wife and two children with him when he fled via Amsterdam to Turkey and crossed over the Syrian-Turkish border. The jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 38, captioned: 'This is us breaking our bail conditions being together in UK.' The photo shows the two bearded radicals, dressed in matching white thobes and pakol hats. Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, a former NHS surgeon, fled the UK in 2013, after he was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally. Scroll down for video . He fled to Pakistan, only recently emerging to announce he had become a senior member of the Pakistani Taliban. In a recruitment video released late last year, he appeared and urged other Muslims to travel to Pakistan and join the terror group. Aziz, who also refers to himself as Abu Abdullah al-Britani, boasted how Ali had been arrested because he 'smash (sic) the head of a filthy shia' in London. The news of Aziz joining Islamic State comes after another of Anjem Choudary's associates fled to Syria in November last year. Siddhartha Dhar, who converted from Hinduism to Islam, posted a photo of himself holding an AK 47 rifle and his newborn baby in Islamic State territory. The former credit control operator, who is an associate of radical cleric Anjem Choudary and has a wife and two children, has posted several photos of himself on Twitter dressed in military clothes and holding a rifle .

Aziz, a former credit control operator, also contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK. He suggested he could 'burn or flush it' Also known as Abu Rumaysah, Dhar had been made to hand over his travel documents to police, in an attempt to prevent him from leaving the country. Less than 24 hours after he was released on bail, Dhar took a bus to Paris with his wife and four young children. He travelled on to Syria before joining Islamic State. The Londoner said: 'What a shoddy security system Britain must have to allow me to breeze through Europe to the Islamic State.' Dhar, 31, was one of nine men who were held under suspicion due to their alleged links with Anjem Choudary and the banned radical group, al-Muhajiroun, in September. Like Aziz, Dhar was close friends with  Ali, and said how he was 'delighted my dear brother' had fled Britain and joined the Pakistani Taliban. In an interview just a couple of weeks before his escape to Syria, Dhar publicly stated how he was desperate to live under Islamic State and wanted to denounce his British citizenship. Prior to fleeing to Syria, Dhar had previously posted several tweets, proclaiming his love for ISIS, writing: 'The Islamic State will punish the tyrants in the West. The army of Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (ha) is coming. Rejoice O Muslims.' He later boasted how he had made a 'mockery' of MI5, the British intelligence service: 'My Lord (Allah) made a mockery of British intelligence and surveillance. Make hijrah (flight) Muslims. Place your trust in Allah.'","Abu Rahin Aziz, 32, skipped bail before he could be given 36-week jail term .

"A Canadian woman who flew to Syria to join the fight against ISIS has reportedly been captured. Gill Rosenberg, 31, left North America to join the ranks of the Kurdish Peshmerga fighting force, which has elite all-female units. Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border. Scroll down for video . 'Captured': Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian with dual Israeli citizenship, was reportedly taken with other female fighters at the Turkish-Syrian border . On the attack: Rosenberg uploaded pictures of herself, above, dressed for war in Syria in recent weeks . Before: Rosenberg, who went to Syria earlier this year, is pictured above before she left . Military history: Rosenberg, pictured in uniform, was formerly a member of the Israeli Defense Force . She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault. Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role. But, according to the Times of London, militant sources have written online that Rosenberg was captured, along with several other female Peshmerga fighters. She was reportedly taken hostage on Friday, when ISIS members hit Kobane with several suicide car bombs. A spokesman for the Canadian foreign ministry said the government is 'aware of reports that a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in Syria.'

According U.S.-based jihadist monitoring group SITE, militants were messaging one another online about whether it would be better to execute Rosenberg or attempt to trade her for prisoners held by the West. However, some sources have cast doubt on the idea that she is in the area at all. IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq. At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces, have held back the group.","Gill Rosenberg, 31, left to fight in Syria with all-female Peshmerga unit .

"A British family is taking legal action claiming their holiday at a five-star Egyptian resort was ruined when three of them became seriously ill. Kay Taylor-Baldwin, 37, from Doncaster, was left on an IV drip after suffering symptoms associated with gastric illness after eating at the Thomson Sensatori Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh. And her 35-year-old husband and one of their two sons - who have not been named - also fell ill. Kay Taylor-Baldwin was placed on an IV drip after she fell ill at the Thomson Sensatori Resort in Egypt . The family allege they witnessed unsafe food handling standards during their £5,000 holiday to the all-inclusive Red Sea hotel last August, which they booked with Thomson Holidays. Kay, her husband and their eldest son had diarrhoea and stomach cramps, while she and her husband also suffered vomiting. When she visited the hotel clinic, Kay was placed on an intravenous (IV) drip, prescribed antibiotics, and received an injection. Kay, an NHS worker, said: 'We had been looking forward to the holiday for months, but it was absolutely horrendous as myself, my husband and our eldest son became very ill. I'm still suffering symptoms now. Popular: Every year thousands of British families flock to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt for all-inclusive trips . 'On occasions some of the food was served uncovered and I noticed food was sometimes served lukewarm when it should have been hot.' She added: 'I also saw food that was undercooked a couple of times which included chicken and beef. 'At one of the sittings I saw one of the chefs touch raw meat and then touch cooked meat without changing their gloves.' Since returning home to South Yorkshire, Kay claims she has continued to suffer from symptoms of the illness, according to solicitors Irwin Mitchell. The family has hired the law firm's international personal injury team to investigate the cause of the illness. Sharm el-Sheikh is one of Egypt's most popular destinations thanks to its beaches and diving spots . The family alleges they met other holidaymakers who fell ill with similar symptoms at the beachfront resort on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Kay said: 'We have stayed in other hotels in Egypt which were classed as four-star resorts so when we booked this we were expecting a good hotel with good food and the room we wanted and paid for. 'However, we would not rate the Sensatori as a five-star hotel and would never return there. 'It was not just us who were affected by illness during our stay, as many other families and holidaymakers staying at the hotel were suffering similar symptoms.' In a statement, Thomson Holidays said ‘a very small number of guests’ reported that they had been unwell with symptoms similar to a virus. The tour operator said: ‘These guests were offered the appropriate support and advice by our overseas holiday advisors. ‘All of our hotels are subject to stringent monitoring and audits and this hotel achieved an extremely high score in its audit carried out this summer. We are unable to comment further as we understand the family has instructed a solicitor.’","Kay Taylor-Baldwin and family stayed at the Coral Sea Sensatori Resort .

"Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who left her Glasgow home for Syria after becoming radicalised, has written a guide on how to be a war widow, sparking rumours her Islamic State fighter husband has been killed . A British jihadi bride who fled to Syria to marry an Islamic State fighter has written a guide on how to be a war widow, sparking rumours her extremist husband has been killed. Privately-educated Aqsa Mahmood, who left her privileged life in Glasgow to join ISIS militants in Syria, has taken to social media to hit out at jihadists for 'failing to tell their wives what will happen to them after they die'. The 20-year-old, who was taught at Glasgow's £3,500-a-term Craigholme girls' school, has also demanded fighter wives to read-up on how long they need to wait before remarrying under strict religious laws. In one recent post, she said: 'You already knew you wanted to marry a Mujahid [a person who is engaged in jihad] so why did you not read up on what will be the rulings for you after his departure? 'Sisters, it is very important you read up on all the information you can find on your Iddah [period of waiting], it's rules and regulations.' It is not clear from her online posts whether the militant husband she flew to the war-torn country to marry has been killed. The former medical student, who now calls herself Umm Layth, also warned women that they need to learn the proper dress etiquette for widows. She added: 'Be prepared for what you can and cannot wear. 'Most importantly know your rights as a Muslimah [single muslim woman].' 'Don't let anyone tell you you can't do such and such when you are allowed. Don't live in ignorance, ukhti [my sister].' It is not the first time the former Scottish schoolgirl has taken to social media. Last year, she wrote on Twitter how would-be jihadis could follow in her footsteps. In another outburst, she urged extremists to carry out 'another Woolwich', referring to the barbaric murder of soldier Lee Rigby. She has also previously advised wannabe Islamic State wives to bring clothes, books and cosmetics to Syria. Scroll down for video . The former Glasgow medical student, 20, also warned women that they need to learn the proper dress etiquette for widows and hit out at jihadis for 'failing to tell their wives what will happen to them after they die' Mahmood (pictured) travelled to Syria to join ISIS extremists and marry a fighter after dropping out of a diagnostic radiotherapy degree course in Glasgow. She reportedly became radicalised by 'online material' In 2013, she travelled to Aleppo after dropping out of a diagnostic radiotherapy degree course. It is believed she went on to marry an Islamic State fighter. Her parents Muzaffar, 51, and wife Khalida, 44, have previously begged their daughter to come home and said she had 'betrayed' her family. In a statement released after their daughter fled, they said: 'We still love you but we now have to put your family, your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step. 'All parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we feel nothing but sorrow and shame. You have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever, please come home.' In a message to Aqsa, her parents Muzaffar (right) and Khalida (left) said she had 'betrayed them' and added: 'You have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever. Please come home' Abu Muthanna al-Yemeni, believed to be Nasser Muthana, who fled to Syria from Cardiff, Wales . Jihadists from Cardiff who fled to Syria were 'talent spotted' by a secret Islamic State agent in Wales, a leading security expert has claimed. Professor Anthony Glees, a former Home Office adviser who has published six books on national security, said 'recruiting sergeants' for the terrorist group were roaming Welsh cities in search of new recruits. He said Cardiff brothers Nasser and Aseel Muthana, as well as their friend Reyaad Khan, were all likely to have been groomed by Islamic State after meeting undercover agents in Wales. The trio all travelled to Syria last year to join extremist fighters. Sleeper agents for the group would 'talent spot' intelligent or charismatic young people who expressed a 'resentment' towards British foreign policy, the Buckingham University professor warned. He said: 'I would be very sure that this was the case [with the Muthana brothers and Khan] and I think many Muslim community leaders would say the same thing. 'I believe Islamic State has people on the ground who are acting as recruiting sergeants who look out for people like this and then approach them to begin the radicalisation process. 'People are not just radicalised online. They are approached by what we might call Islamic State's recruiting sergeants - people who deliberately go around schools, campuses and Islamic community centres looking for people like this. 'Their friends may see them as idealistic and interested in politics and that's the kind of person Islamic State is looking to recruit. It has been like that for a very long time. 'They will play on the resentments they may have about Palestine, or about the Iraq war, and they will look out for people who are up for it because they are disillusioned. 'They know that if you get them while they are young then you have them for ever.' Professor Glees said the Muthana brothers and Khan could have been groomed by a secret Islamic State agent who passed them instructions on how to join jihadists in Syria. 'You cannot just get on a plane and walk to the Islamic State. You have got to find a way to cross the border from Turkey and you need to have made personal contact with people who will know how to do that,' he said. He called for teachers to be vigilant about 'disillusioned' pupils who could be seduced by Islamic State's 'sophisticated' propaganda machine. 'We must make sure these people don't sit and brood. That's what teachers are there for, to discuss these issues in a democratic fashion,' he said. Professor Glees also warned that once young Britons joined the terror group they were on a 'path of no return' and could never rejoin British society because they were so severely brainwashed. 'When they join the Islamic State they are lost for ever. Once they become extremists they are always extremists. 'I don't believe there are significant number of people going out to fight with the Islamic State who get there and say, 'Oh, this is terrible, and we were so wrong about believing in this.' Former medical student and Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State with friend Khan - also from the Welsh capital - sat alongside him (together above) in June last year . 'There is nothing we can do about them once they have gone out there. They can certainly never be allowed to come back because once they are radicalised there is no way of bringing them back to British democratic values. 'It is also undeniably the case that these people coming back from the Islamic State represent a real and present national security threat to the United Kingdom. 'There are some who say that on the one hand it is extremely wrong to go and fight for Islamic State but on the other almost 100 years ago people went to fight the Spanish Civil War and that was seen as a noble thing. 'But my view would be that they fought for democratic values against totalitarianism. 'With Islamic State it is the other way round - they are fighting for totalitarianism against democratic values.' Last June, former medical student Nasser Muthana, from Cardiff, appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State with friend Khan - also from the Welsh capital - sat alongside him. The pair, both 20 when they fled for Syria, were later joined by Nasser's teenage brother, Aseel. The brothers - who both attended a Cardiff primary school - left behind their stunned family in the city. Their father, 57-year-old Ahmed, said: 'I feel very sad. It's devastating. Not only shocking - devastating.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We are working in communities across the country to challenge terrorist ideology, including disrupting extremist speakers and removing material online, and intervene when people are at risk of being radicalised and exploited. 'But we are clear that we will take the strongest possible action against those who have travelled to Syria or Iraq and return with the intention of doing harm - both through our existing powers and by introducing new ones through the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill - to make sure we can defend ourselves against the serious and rapidly changing threats emerging from the region.'","Glasgow-born Aqsa Mahmood, 20, fled Britain to join ISIS fighters in Syria .

"A pensioner has been left trapped on a life support machine in a Turkish hospital after insurers refused to pay his medical bills. Dennis Gittins, 88, was on holiday in Marmaris earlier this summer when he tragically suffered a stroke that has left him in a coma. His family are now being prevented from flying him home after insurers said they would not pay for his care because he didn't fill in travel insurance forms correctly. Dennis Gittins and his wife Jean were on holiday when Mr Gittins suffered a stroke. He is now stuck in a Turkish hospital after insurers refused to pay for his medical care following a row over forms . Mrs Gittins (pictured, left, and, right, with her husband) says she wants her husband to be returned to the UK so she can visit him in a local hospital . Mr Gittins and his wife Jean, 91, flew out to Turkey more than two weeks ago, but their holiday turned into a nightmare when Dennis collapsed from a stroke in a shop. Mrs Gittins has been forced to fly back to the couple's home in Whiston, Merseyside because she could not afford hotel bills to stay at his bedside. Mr Gittins has meanwhile been left potentially brain dead and his family fear he may not come out of a coma. They want him to be cared for in a British hospital and to end his life here if he does not pull through. But the family have been left angry after Mr Gittins's insurance company, Ageas, said they would pay to fly Mr Gittins home, but would not pay for his care. They claim Mr Gittins did not declare a previous stroke he had suffered when arranging travel insurance, despite Mrs Gittins insistence that he did make the company aware of the issue. Mr Gittins suffered the stroke in a watch shop the couple had visited on a previous holiday (pictured) Mr and Mrs Gittens were visiting the resort of Marmaris (pictured) when he suffered the stroke. His family want him moved back to his local hospital in Whiston, Merseyside but the hospital is refusing to let him leave . The £30,000 bill for the retired policeman's care is now rising by £1,500-a-day, with the hospital refusing to let him leave until the sum is paid. Mrs Gittins said: 'I don't know what to do. They want £30,000, but we don't have that kind of money. They even told his sister to take out a loan to pay for it, but she's 78 and has cancer - we can't do anything.' She added: 'It's very hard, Whiston hospital is only round the corner and I could visit him. We just don't know what's going to happen, and no one will help us. 'We've called MPs, but they haven't called back and the consulate have called but are doing nothing.' Mr Gittins' brother-in-law, Alan McKie, added: 'It's an absolute nightmare, we don't know what to do. My sister is being amazing and keeping so strong, especially considering she's 91. The couple have been married for more than 50 years but the insurance row means they are now hundreds of miles apart . Mrs Gittins (pictured, left, with her husband and, right, on holiday) says does not have the money to pay . 'She realises that he's not going to get better, that he's not going to live. But she wants him to die here. We've contacted the embassy, who told us it was a private matter so they couldn't help us. 'He's been in that hospital for over a week now, everyone's worried sick. We need someone to help us, the bills are just going up every day and the situation's getting worse.' A Foreign Office spokesman said it is providing consular assistance and the hospital confirmed it is speaking with British officials. A spokesman for assistance company Intana Insurance Group, who are handling the claim for Ageas, said: 'As key information relating to Mr Gittins' medical history was not disclosed when purchasing the policy it was not possible to make an accurate assessment of his medical circumstances. 'We are therefore settling this claim based wholly on the medical declarations provided to us.' Mrs Gittins wants her husband flown back to Whiston Hospital, not far from their home, so she can visit him .","Elderly couple went on holiday to Marmaris in Turkey two weeks ago .
