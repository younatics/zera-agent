"A racist 22-year-old woman has been fired from her job and reported to the Secret Service after writing on her Facebook page her hopes that President Obama is assassinated in his second term in office. 'And another 4 years of the n*****. Maybe he will get assassinated this term..!!' Denise Helms of Turlock, California wrote immediately after the president's re-election on Tuesday. It didn't take long for her post to circulate, angering enough readers to report her to authorities who accuse her of threatening the president's life. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Denise Helms has been fired from her job at an ice cream shop and reported to Secret Service after writing this post on her Facebook page hoping the president is assassinated . I'm innocent: Speaking about the incident on Thursday Ms Helms, 22, was visibly shaken by it but said she was surprised while believing she hasn't done anything wrong . 'I didn't think it'd be that big of a deal,' she told KTXL on Thursday while visibly shaken up, but unapologetic and unsure of what she did wrong. 'The assassination part is harsh and I'm not saying that I would go and do that or anything like that by any means but if it was to happen I don't think I would care one bit,' she said. Now fired from her job at a local Cold Stone Creamery on Thursday, the post was described as disgusting by the store's director who told the Modesto Bee that when he arrived to work he had more than 20 angry voice messages on his company’s machine directed toward Ms Helms. ‘We made the decision because of her comments, but also the community feedback,' said Director Chris Kegle who had employed Ms Helms for less than one year. Standing alone: Cold Stone Creamery called her action disgusting and no reflection of their own views after receiving angry calls to their store . Not taking it back: Ms Helms, seen behind the ice cream counter, had worked for the company for less than a year before being fired for something she hasn't apologized for . 'We are very into working with the community and doing community service. So when your community does not like you because of an employee, that's bad. We have a business to run.' Despite all this, she said she wouldn't take her comments back. Not registered: Ms Helms said Obama hasn't done anything for the U.S. while according to state records she is not registered to vote . 'He has done absolutely nothing for this country,' she explained. The Modesto Bee reports Ms Helms being a fan of Republican rival Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan’s campaign according to her Facebook page but report her not registered in the state’s registry to vote. Asked by KTXL if she’s racist after additionally using the N-word in referring to Obama, she defended herself as not, but also didn't disagree with herself using it. That disagreement was in sharp . contrast to Twitter users across the country, however, who angrily . branded her Facebook post among a list of others titled: 'Yes, You're . Racist.' Some even shared their own hinted threats against Ms Helms as well. ‘I . jst [sic] got a sweet tooth! how does ice cream from Cold Stone in . Turlock California in the month of November sound?’ one woman wrote. Secret Service Agent Scott Gillingham in Sacramento says Ms Helms’ post is being investigated with threats against the president having the potential to lead to felony charges.

"Louis van Gaal appears to have ignored the desperate pleas of Manchester United fans to strengthen his central defence and midfield in favour of bringing Radamel Falcao to Old Trafford. The Colombian striker will undoubtedly improve United's attacking options this season, but where does he fit in the Dutchman's preferred formation? Falcao, who will put pen to paper on a season-long loan deal for a fee of £12million before the transfer window closes, isn't a versatile player. He must play centrally and Van Gaal knows that. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neil Ashton: Radamel Falcao is obsessed with scoring goals . New boy: Striker Radamel Falcao is joining Manchester United on a season-long loan for £12million . Busy: United boss Louis van Gaal is attempting to build his own squad after arriving at the club this summer . Goal-getter: Falcao will be looking to continue his fine record in front of goal in the Premier League . Click here to read about Falcao's move to Old Trafford and here for his latest movements . But how about senior forwards Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie? And where does former club record signing Juan Mata now stand? The Red Devils look suspect at the back, but going forward they have enough firepower to trouble anyone. The challenge now facing United's manager is fitting that talented quartet on the same pitch in a system that he not only likes, but which brings the best out of each individual. With his 3-5-2 failing to deliver a victory in four games so far this season, Van Gaal may consider utilising a new formation to put his summer acquisitions to good use. The 63-year-old has experienced success - most notably at this summer's World Cup with Holland - using three central defenders, but he lacks the necessary quality in that area of the pitch at United to persist with it. With Luke Shaw and Rafael being more accustomed to traditional full back roles too, a 4-3-1-2 system looks a more likely option as Van Gaal settles in at Old Trafford. Phil Jones and summer signing Marcos Rojo should fill the central defensive berths. Going forward: Robin van Persie (left) and Juan Mata (right) are two of Louis van Gaal's attacking options . Going nowhere: Club captain Wayne Rooney appears to be a vital part of Van Gaal's plans at Old Trafford . How Manchester United could line up with Falcao . That would give United a midfield three of Ander Herrera, Daley Blind and big-money buy Angel di Maria - an attractive mix of pace, passing ability and defensive nous. That leaves four players - Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie and Mata - battling for three spaces at the top end of the pitch. Unfortunately for the Spaniard, he appears to be the odd one out. As shown by his promotion to club captain, Rooney is seen as a central figure by Van Gaal. He has played as a striker in each of United's three league games so far, but remains the most adaptable of the former Bayern Munich boss' options. Dropping the England skipper back into the No 10 role would give him the regular football he craves, while allowing Falcao to play in his natural position - up-front alongside Van Persie. It would, however, leave £37m Mata as a peripheral figure. Van Persie - like Falcao - is at his most dangerous when played in the middle as the furthest man forward. The pair of them together have the potential to become the top-flight's most dangerous partnership, helping negate any shakiness in the new-look back four with the promise of goals, goals and goals. Whether Rooney will be content to drop further back remains to be seen, but he may have no option given the excessive loan fee executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has allowed to be spent on a man who was also a target for rivals Manchester City and La Liga giants Real Madrid. Prolific: Falcao celebrates a goal for Monaco against Nantes during a Ligue 1 clash last season . VIDEO Falcao completes dramatic Old Trafford move . Odd one out: Juan Mata (right) faces a battle to start for United after the arrival of Falcao . Mata left Chelsea in January in search of regular football but after struggling in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Burnley, it already looks like he'll have a fight on his hands to nail down a regular spot in Van Gaal's first XI. Rooney will play as captain, Van Persie is one of his manager's most trusted players and you don't sign one of the world's best strikers to let him sit on the bench. With Di Maria also providing attacking thrust from midfield, United fans will be excited at the prospect of their revamped attack helping turn around a disappointing start to the campaign. Unfortunately for Mata, the arrival of Falcao could well mean he is no longer a part of it.","Radamel Falcao will seal a season-long loan move to Manchester United .

"Manchester City left themselves with only three senior strikers to defend their Barclays Premier League title after selling Alvaro Negredo to Valencia. The Spanish club agreed a loan deal for the 29-year-old and confirmed they plan to trigger a £23.8m release clause in his City contract next summer. Negredo, who cost City £20m when he arrived from Sevilla a year ago, began last season with 12 goals in his first 20 appearances but began to struggle and started only three Premier League games after January. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Negredo scoring with spectacular scissor-kick in Spain training . Done deal: Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo has signed a season-long loan with Valencia . His departure came as City also allowed Micah Richards to move on a season-long loan to Fiorentina. It made it an entirely different transfer deadline day for City from six years ago, when the ‘noisy neighbours’ announced their arrival as major players in English football by breaking the British transfer record to sign Robinho on the new owner’s first day. Monday night was more about the impact of financial fair play, with City pulling out of the bidding for Radamel Falcao and allowing him to go to Old Trafford while leaving themselves with only Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic up front. Come in, No 7! Valencia tweeted the shirt number that 'The Beast' would be wearing at the club . Looking ahead: City allowed Negredo to leave the club even though they're down to three strikers . Richards’ departure meant the last remaining outfield player from the pre-Abu Dhabi era has left. The defender, who signed for City as a 14-year-old in 2002 when the club had just won promotion to the Premier League, was frustrated by a lack of first team opportunities. Fiorentina paid £3.5m to take him and will have to find another £4.7m if they want to make the move permanent next summer. Although expected, his departure will sadden many City fans who saw the 26-year-old defender as a link to the club’s more modest roots before Sheik Mansour took over in 2008. Goalkeeper Joe Hart is the only survivor from before the takeover, having signed from Shrewsbury in 2006. Arrival: Micah Richards pictured after landing in Florence on Monday morning to seal his loan move . Target: West Ham were interested in Richards but have been put off by his wage demands an a £1m loan fee . Richards never lived up to the promise that saw him win his England debut as a teenager and go on to earn 13 caps. And with City forced to reduce the size of their Champions League squad for breaking UEFA financial rules, manager Manuel Pellegrini had no hesitation in letting him leave. Richards flew to Italy to complete his move and was pictured smiling as he concluded negotiations to become the 24th English player to join a Serie A club. A deal to send unwanted midfielder Scott Sinclair to Stoke fell through, as did efforts to find a club for defender Matija Nastasic.","Valencia are obligated to sign Alvaro Negredo permanently next summer .

"Rupert Murdoch has opened up for the first time about his divorce from Wendi Deng, and the moment he learned she had spent secret weekends with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair at his family's California ranch. The Australian media mogul also revealed he was 'shocked' when he first read his ex-wife's diary entries in which she described having 'warm feelings' comparable to a 'crush' on Blair, who allegedly stayed at the ranch with Deng in October 2012 and April 2013 while the 83-year-old was overseas. In an interview with Fortune magazine, the News Corporation boss explained that he first heard of the encounters while in Australia and immediately traveled back to the ranch to quiz the staff - and then he scrambled to find a lawyer. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Rupert Murdoch, left, has opened up for the first time about his divorce from Wendi Deng, right, and the moment he learned she had spent secret weekends with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair at his ranch . 'Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything... But then I was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch [where Deng had been staying],' he said. 'I was in Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked the staff, and it opened up. That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer.' The couple divorced last November after 14 years of marriage. Murdoch said he wasn't given Deng's . diary entries until after he filed for divorce. He said he was 'shocked' by . the love notes, but didn't read them. Crush: Deng reportedly wrote of having 'warm feelings' for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, pictured . He . said the revelation made him feel he'd made the right decision, but he . regretted the fact the diary entries made worldwide headlines. 'I regret the whole Vanity Fair thing. I wish we just could have got divorced quietly,' he told Fortune. Details of lovestruck Deng's note, in . which she praised Blair's 'good body,' his 'really, really good legs' and even his 'butt' were revealed by Vanity Fair in February. It said staff at Murdoch's home were uneasy when Blair arrived and tried to find her. The . magazine claimed they told him Deng had gone to the master bedroom, but . 'by the time they could tell her, Blair was looking for her, they found . Blair walking into the master bedroom and closing the door behind him.' On another occasion 'they were feeding each other during dinner, which made the staff uncomfortable.' Blair, . who is godfather to one of Murdoch and Deng's daughters, has always . denied he had an affair with Deng and there is no evidence to suggest . that is the case. The Middle East . envoy, 60, is married to barrister Cherie Blair. As well as the 'multiple' overnight stays at the expansive Carmel ranch, the pair are also believed to have met on a super-yacht owned by music industry billionaire David Geffen. It was earlier reported that Murdoch learned of his ex-wife and Blair's encounters after she inadvertently sent an email to the wrong person, including details of his trip to the ranch. That's when Murdoch went to Carmel and asked the household staff if it was true. Ranch: Murdoch revealed he asked his staff at the Carmel, California, ranch, pictured, about the rumors and then scrambled to find a lawyer . They told him Blair had stayed there with Deng on two weekends in October 2012 and April 2013. Five . months on from the divorce, Murdoch said he's 'turning over a new . leaf,' buying a new California ranch and a lavish apartment in New York. He said he bought 13-acre vineyard, Moraga, for $28.8 million after he saw a story in the Wall Street Journal Mansion section about the owner, Tom Jones who was a former CEO of Northrop, and remembered he'd met him 25 years ago with President Reagan at a social party. 'He was dying because he was 93 and had very bad emphysema,' he told Fortune. 'And he wanted to sell it to someone who said, ""I will keep it going and not subdivide this land.""' Murdoch said he's now decorating the property, in the hill above Bel Air, after Jones passed away. 'I expected him to live a bit longer, but I said he could stay in the house,' he said. 'I've now taken possession of the house. I have hired a modest decorator. I just want it to be rustic.' Embarrassing: Details of lovestruck Deng's note, in which she praised Blair's 'good body,' his 'really, really good legs' and even his 'butt' were revealed by Vanity Fair in February . In addition, Murdoch has snapped up a . lavish New York apartment, which is also in the process of being . decorated. He paid $57.25 million for the 10,000-square-foot pad in One . Madison Park, a slender, 60-story glass tower on E. 23rd St. He said his . chief of staff Natalie Ravitz found the apartment. In the interview, the billionaire also describes a fall in San Francisco, which saw him suffer a hair fracture across his spine. 'I had a very bad month in January and February,' he said. 'I had a fall in San Francisco. I fell on my head. It was just stupidity in a hotel room. I'd put on some boots to go for a hike around San Francisco to be shown by Natalie, and I went down and hit my head very hard. 'And I got, I guess you'd call it, a hair fracture across my spine. I landed on a carpet, but on my head. I've never had such pain in my life. A friend of mine sent a friend of his, a neurosurgeon, down to see me, who quickly said I didn't have any concussion.

'I . assume that my two daughters will each have their own rooms for the . first time in their lives. And they're decorating them, they think,' he . said. He claims the apartment 'will be fairly modest, to start with.' 'I'm not going to put in great antiques or have major things that take a long time to do,' he told Fortune. 'I'll buy nice, not-too-modern furniture. But it's a modern place. It's very high.' Murdoch also discusses his elder daughter Elisabeth, in the interview, whom he had a public disagreement with over the News Corp. phone-hacking scandal. Elisabeth, who chairs London-based TV production company Shine Limited, criticized the company's handling of the scandal in a speech in Scotland known as the MacTaggart Lecture. Murdoch told Fortune Liz won praise from everyone on the talk 'except me' and that he thought she was hurt that he didn't like it. But he hopes the pair have since put their troubles behind them. 'I had a long an warm and loving hour with her on the phone yesterday,' he said, adding that they talk mostly about her children not the business.

"Gemma Moss from Bouremouth, Dorset, is believed to have become the first woman in Britain to die directly from cannabis poisoning . A young mother of three died after she was poisoned by the cannabis she smoked to help her get to sleep. Gemma Moss, 31, was killed by the level of the drug in her blood, an inquest heard. The . regular churchgoer, who was found dead in her bedroom, is thought to be . the first woman in Britain known to have died directly from cannabis . poisoning. Her death was caused by cannabis toxicity, and a coroner . recorded a verdict of death by cannabis abuse. The inquest was told that Miss Moss smoked half a joint a night to help her sleep. The devout Christian had  been a frequent user but stopped for two years before her death last October. Her . family say she started using the drug again to help her sleep after . becoming depressed when she split up with her boyfriend. A female friend . told police Miss Moss smoked as much as £60 worth of the drug a week, . although her family disputed this. On . the night of October 28  last year Miss Moss, who had two sons, Tyler, . 15, and Tessiah, eight, and a daughter who lives abroad, went to bed . after rolling a joint. She . was found the following morning by Tyler’s girlfriend who called an . ambulance to the flat in Bournemouth. Miss Moss was pronounced dead at . the scene. Half a joint was . found underneath her body and a wrapper containing brown and green . leaves of the class B drug was discovered in her handbag. Scroll down for video . The mother-of-three gave up cannabis for two years, but had recently turned back to the drug in an effort to beat her insomnia . Her friend said she and Miss Moss smoked cannabis worth about £20 together in the week before her death . A . post mortem examination revealed that there were no obvious signs of . abnormality in Miss Moss’s body. Pathologist Dr Kudair Hussein told the . inquest in Bournemouth there were ‘moderate to heavy’ levels of . cannabis-related chemicals in her blood. Bournemouth . coroner Mr Sheriff Payne asked Dr Hussein: ‘You are satisfied it was . the effects of cannabis that caused her death?’ Dr Hussein replied: ‘Yes . sir.’ In 2004 a 36-year-old man from Pembrokeshire became the first known person in the UK to die from cannabis toxicity. A . spokesman for the National Drug Prevention Alliance, David Raynes, . said: ‘It is extremely rare and unusual for a coroner to rule death from . cannabis abuse. ‘This case . serves as a warning that cannabis can cause immense harm. Cannabis is . known to increase heart rate and blood pressure. Cannabis these days is . designed to be much stronger to meet demand of users who want a stronger . hit.’ Tests of her vital organs found nothing wrong with them although it was suggested she might have suffered a cardiac arrest triggered by cannabis toxicity . Cannabis use can lead to significant increases in heart rate and a lowering of the blood pressure. For this reason patients with a history of angina or other cardiovascular disease could be at risk . Miss Moss regularly attended the evangelical Citygate Church in Bournemouth and was baptised there last year. One minor toxic side-effect of taking cannabis is the short-term effect on the heart and vascular system. This can lead to significant increases in heart rate and a lowering of the blood pressure. For this reason patients with a history of angina or other cardiovascular disease could be at risk. In Britain, official government statistics listed five deaths from cannabis in the period 1993-1995, but a House of Lords Report from 1998 reports that on closer examination these proved to have been deaths due to inhalation of vomit that could not be directly attributed to cannabis. Cannabis impairs psychomotor performance in a wide variety of tasks, and fatal accidents, such as from car crashes or from operating heavy machinery, have been recorded. However, several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids for nausea and vomiting in the advanced stages of illnesses such as cancer and AIDS. An active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, has been available by prescription for more than a decade in the USA. Other therapeutic uses of cannabinoids are being demonstrated by controlled studies, including treatment of asthma and glaucoma. Her . mother, Kim Furness, told the inquest her daughter struggled to sleep . and had admitted that she had started smoking  a ‘small amount’ of . cannabis  at night. Miss . Furness said: ‘It was one half of a joint to get to sleep. She never . smoked in the day. She was really honest about cannabis. She was trying . to stop again. She wasn’t excessively smoking.’ In recording a verdict . that Miss Moss died from drug abuse, Mr Payne said: ‘Gemma had been a . long-term user of cannabis. ‘She . suffered from depression and was on prescription drugs to try and deal . with that although it would not appear she was taking them at the time . of her death. ‘She usually used it (cannabis) in the evenings to try and help her to get to sleep and did not use it in the daytime. ‘The . post mortem could find  no natural cause for her death with the balance . of probability that it is more likely than  not that she died from the . effects of cannabis.’ Carolyn . Stuart, a coroner’s officer, said: ‘It is very rare to have cannabis . toxicity as a cause of death. She was a healthy 31-year-old woman who . had nothing wrong with her.’ Russell White, a leader at  the Citygate Church, said: ‘Gemma was a good mother  and brought up her children mainly on her own. ‘She . was full of fun and loved life and loved coming to church. She was a . committed member of the church and brought her children along. 'She is . very much missed and her death was a real shock to us.’ Miss Moss lived with her sons but it is believed her daughter lives with her father in Jamaica.","Gemma Moss had moderate to high levels of the drug in her system .

Icon: Vicious made an angry stand against the Establishment and died of a heroin overdose in 1979 . He moved to a rented flat with his mother Anne and spent around six years in the area long before he was famous. His school still exists, renamed as The Skinners' Kent Academy. Now his name has been put forward among those of 32 other famous former residents who could receive a plaque on their former homes. Volunteers won funds from Tunbridge Wells Borough Council for 20 of the plaques, which cost around £300 each. They defended their choice of the punk star - but said he will face stiff competition from war heroes and historians to make the final cut. Alastair Tod, chairman of the Royal Tunbridge Wells Civic Society, told MailOnline: 'We're all prepared to argue the case if necessary. Genteel: Royal Tunbridge Wells is the only spa town in the south east of England and has gained a reputation for 'disgusted' conservative letter-writers - even if most residents say the stereotype is unfair . Punk star: Sid Vicious kicks a London black taxi in 1977. He lived in Tunbridge Wells before moving aged 14 . 'We would be prepared to defend the inclusion of any of the names on our list. 'It's only a longlist, though, and I think Sid Vicious is probably an outlier. It's not for me to make the final decision.' Vicious died from a heroin overdose aged 21 in 1979 . after being arrested over his lover Nancy Spungen’s murder in New York. His fame came from his anti-establishment behaviour and he routinely spat beer at fans, . sneered at rivals, beat people up, swore non-stop and user . razors to cut swear words into his body. But he was also widely credited with changing the face of British music forever, opening the doors to the jarring electronic creativity of the 1980s, and galvanising one of the 20th Century's biggest shifts in pop culture. The plaques will be dark red and round, and follow 15 which were put up in 2006 on the town's 400th anniversary. The only criteria for the people to be featured was they had to have a genuine link with the town and have been dead for some time. Among the local heroes being considered are soldier William Vidler, who died two days after the start of the First World War after his ship was hit by a mine. History: Other names on the longlist include soldier William Vidler, who died two days into the First World War . Troubled couple: The mystery remains over whether Vicious (right) killed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (left) Other plaques under consideration are airwoman Pauline Gower, who headed the female branch of the Air Transport Auxiliary during the Second World War, and historian Richard Cobb. Some residents of the town were angry. One, Peter Campbell, 49, said: 'Nobody wants to be reminded that Sid Vicious lived here - he was a vile man who died as he lived, surrounded by filth and misery. 'He hardly has anything good to be said about him and it would be best is his name was scattered to the four winds.' Another, Claire Fenwick, said the people of Tunbridge Wells were ‘not interested’ in the Sex Pistols, adding: 'The Sex Pistols were a passing fad that had nothing to do with Tunbridge Wells. 'They might have made it big in London, but nobody here cares about, or wants to be reminded, about them.' The civic society plans to meet in less than two weeks to make their final decision - but their final choices will also have to be signed off by the local council.","Singer among 33 people nominated for one of £300 council-funded plaques .

"One of the oddest aspects of Cyril Smith’s sinister reign in Rochdale was how well-meaning parents came to connive in the abuse of their own children. As whispers of his penchant for doling out corporal punishment spread across the town, he would offer his services to give boys ‘a bloody good hiding’ if they stepped out of line. Parents on Rochdale estates would often use his name to try to frighten badly behaved sons. ‘He was a kind of bogeyman,’ recalls Stephen Moore, a Labour councillor in the Seventies. ‘Parents would say: “If you don’t start behaving, we’ll call for Cyril Smith.” Talking politics: Cyril Smith on the campaign trail . ‘And sometimes they would. Cyril would make his way round, tell the parents he was happy to help, then go upstairs and spank boys till they screamed. He saw it as a kind of public service.’ One such victim was a 16-year-old scooter-riding Mod with a taste for amphetamines and all-night clubbing. He’d spent three months in a detention centre for possession, and relations with his parents were very strained. ‘My dad would scream in my face about how I was causing my mum to worry. The tension was unbearable. ‘Then I came home one night from work and this man was sitting on the settee with my parents on either side of him. He was enormous. Acres of flesh packed into a pinstriped suit. ‘My dad said: “I want you to meet Cyril Smith. He’s the Mayor of Rochdale and is very important. We’ve told him about the problems we’re having and he’s going to have a little chat with you.” ‘My mum and dad left and Smith and I sat staring at each other. “I don’t like your attitude,” he snarled. “Things are going to have to change.” ‘Then he lunged at me, lifted me off my feet, and threw me over his knee. He pulled my trousers and pants down and hammered my flesh with his bare hands like a man possessed. When he’d finished, he dropped me to the floor and stood above me while I lay with my face down trying to forget about the pain. I never made a noise. I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing he’d hurt me. Cyril Smith at Buckingham Palace in November 1988. Parents on estates in Rochdale would use his name to scare badly behaved children . ‘My skin was on fire and I could feel the welts forming, but I pulled my trousers up, sat up and stared insolently back at him. “Is that it?” I said. ‘He was still panting but a nasty little smile formed on his face as he knelt next to me and pushed his face close to mine. “Your bad behaviour is going to stop,’ he hissed, “or I’ll kill you.” I thought he was a psycho.’ The teenager hoped he’d seen the last of Smith. He was wrong. When he went back to his job at a local factory, his boss sidled up to his workbench and asked what he was doing at the weekend, adding: ‘I was thinking that maybe we could go camping together in the Lake District.’ When the lad said he’d rather not as camping wasn’t his thing, he suggested they get a caravan instead. The boy said no again. Later that day, his boss called him in and fired him. It was clear this was to be his punishment for having turned down his advances. And worse was to come. ‘You won’t be out of a job,’ he smiled. ‘I’ve seen to that. There’s a friend of mine who runs a spring manufacturing company across town and takes on lads with criminal records. He helps them back on the straight and narrow. ‘I’ve called him and he said he can give you a job at his factory. His name’s Cyril Smith.’ On the boy’s first day there, Smith put his arm around him and said: ‘I’m going to look after you now.’ The boy shuddered. ‘And so began the strangest time I’ve ever known. All week I worked for Cyril, and at weekends he’d be round our house beating the living daylights out of me. ‘I sometimes wondered if it was all a bad dream. I worked for an enormous fat man who’d wink at me all day and tell me he was going to be my dad — then, when the weekend came round, he’d be knocking on our door itching to get my trousers off and start spanking my backside. ‘Cyril tried everything to intimidate me. He told me all the important people he knew. He boasted of his relationship with the chief constable. I wasn’t impressed. ‘I asked him once why he had such a fixation with smacking my backside. Did my parents know he was doing this? He backhanded me and told me I had an attitude problem. ‘After a few months, I think Cyril realised he wasn’t going to win this battle. He wasn’t going to batter me into submission. He got his business partner, Geoff, to sack me. He didn’t have the guts to do it himself. He told my parents I was a lost cause and that there was no hope for me. It was the best day of my life. I got another job soon after and things started to look up. ‘I never told my parents what Cyril had done to me, though I suspect they’d known what was really going on. I was more than relieved to have escaped Cyril’s clutches — but I soon came into contact with boys who hadn’t. ‘Because I’d spent three months in a detention centre, I still had to report to a probation officer, so every few weeks I’d make my way over to their office on Drake Street in Rochdale. ‘That’s where I met other boys who told me that Cyril Smith had seriously sexually abused them. We’d all sit in the corridor waiting to be seen, and the conversation would quickly turn to Cyril. ‘As I listened to their stories, I started to realise I’d got off lightly. These were damaged kids. They had no confidence and came from broken homes. Some had been in care. ‘Most had been in the Cambridge House boys’ hostel that Cyril had opened. That’s where he’d abused them. Their stories sent shivers down my spine. ‘I asked one lad why he’d put up with it. He had nowhere else to go, he said. He couldn’t bear to sleep on the streets. ‘There were other boys I’d bump into in town who told me Cyril had abused them, too. I remember one lad who worked in the cinema as an usher. He had a hollow look in his eyes, as though his future had been ripped out of him. All he had left was a deep sense of loss. ‘I still wonder what happened to those lads. ‘Once I no longer had to meet the probation officer, that world began to recede and I moved on to different things. I worked hard, got married, and ended up going to work in Australia. ‘I returned to Rochdale many years later and no longer thought about Cyril. Then, one day in 1990, the police knocked on my door. They were investigating claims that Cyril Smith had abused young boys. Smith in the Commons. One victim says the MP smacked him after his parents told him he was badly behaved . ‘I had no idea how they’d got hold of me. Perhaps some of the lads who I met at the probation office had mentioned my name. ‘I told them what had happened in the 1960s and made a statement. Cyril was still the town’s MP, and I hoped it wasn’t too late for his past to catch up with him. ‘I never heard anything more from the police, and it wasn’t until his crimes were publicly exposed after his death in 2012 that I realised there had been a number of investigations into Cyril that had gone nowhere. ‘I thought back to what he’d said to me at the time. The threat that he would kill me; the talk of how close he was to the chief constable. I’d laughed it off. But how would other less assured boys have reacted? They’d have been terrified. And that was his aim. Finding vulnerable young boys, striking fear into them and breaking them. ‘I tried to talk to Mum about it, before she got Alzheimer’s. She just shook her head and I could see the tears forming in her eyes. I put my arm round her and didn’t say any more. ‘She knew calling him in was a mistake, but I guess they were at their wits’ end. I didn’t blame them. How could they have known what a real monster he was? ‘But plenty of people did know what a real monster Cyril was. He wasn’t acting on his own. We used to laugh when we saw groups of men getting off the train and coming into Rochdale because we all knew what they were up to. The dirty mac brigade, we called them. ‘Cyril couldn’t have abused all these boys on his own. He had a team of people behind him. They were all in on it. ‘It took the police long enough to knock on my door. I hope there’s still time for Cyril’s cronies to get a knock on their door.’ n Extracted from Smile For The Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith by Simon Danczuk and Matthew Baker, published today by Biteback, £16.99. © 2014 Simon Danczuk and Matthew Baker.

"This is the chilling hand-drawn building plan of the RMS Titanic that was used to describe how the 'unsinkable' ship met its fate. The design, prepared exclusively for the official British enquiry, features a number of illustrations showing why the luxury liner sank after striking an iceberg on April 14, 1912. It is among hundreds of artifacts linked to the doomed ship to be sold at auction later this month. 'Unthinkable': This chilling hand-drawn building plan was used to describe how the 'unsinkable' RMS Titanic met its fate. It was prepared exclusively for the official British enquiry and is marked with a date of May 1, 1912 . Tragedy: The design features a number of illustrations showing why the luxury liner (pictured) sank after striking an iceberg on April 14, 1912. It is among hundreds of artifacts to be sold at auction later this month . The . original cross section and building plan, drawn to . a scale of 1/32 inches to one foot, is rubber stamped by manufacturers . Harland and Wolff, with a handwritten date of May 1, 1912. It was used to demonstrate to . the world what had happened just before midnight . on April 14 when the largest passenger ship ever assembled struck . an iceberg - sparking the biggest maritime disaster in peacetime. Among its most remarkable features are a hand-drawn gash in the side of the ship . at Boiler 6, where the iceberg hit, and extensions drawn over the . watertight bulkheads that were not built high enough for such an . occurrence. It clearly shows why the 'unsinkable' ship succumbed to a direct . hit that night in the ice fields of the North Atlantic, claiming the lives of more than 1,500 people. Valuable: The Titanic-themed collection includes a sterling silver 'Loving Cup' presented to Captain Arthur Rostron (left) of the Carpathia, which helped pluck survivors from the ocean, by Margaret 'Molly' Brown (right) The cup: Brown, a wealthy socialite, became . famous for surviving the disaster, and was known after her death as 'The . Unsinkable Molly Brown,' celebrated in the 1960 Broadway musical of the . same name . The location allowed water to enter the ship right at the point at which she could no longer stay afloat. The plan is one of around 240 Titanic-themed objects to be put on sale by RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts - which specialises in documents, manuscripts and historic artifacts - more than a century after the doomed liner sank. The collection includes a sterling silver 'Loving Cup' presented to Captain Arthur Rostron of the Carpathia by Titanic survivor Margaret 'Molly' Brown. A dedication engraved on the front . reads: 'In grateful recognition and appreciation of his heroic and . efficient service in the rescue of the survivors of the Titanic on April . 15th 1912, and of the generous and sympathetic treatment he accorded us . on his ship. From the Survivors of the Titanic.' Tragic note: Another item to be sold at auction is what is thought to be the last postcard Titanic hero Jack Phillips ever wrote before he set sail on the doomed voyage, never to return. Above, the tragic postcard . The cup has the highest starting price - and is expected to fetch more than $200,000 (£120,500) at auction. Brown, a wealthy American socialite, boarded the Titanic as a first class passenger . at Cherbourg, France, the vessel's first stop after leaving Southampton. Five . days later, when the mammoth ship struck the iceberg, she unselfishly . leapt into action and loaded others into the lifeboats, willing to face . the chilling danger of the deep to save as many people as possible. She was eventually put into lifeboat six, where she helped to keep spirits up as they awaited an unknown fate. Hero: The postcard is a note of affection from Phillips (above) to his sister, letting her know he is safe and well . She later became famous for surviving the disaster, and was known after her death as 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown,' celebrated in the 1960 Broadway musical of the same name. Bobby Livingston, vice president at RR Auction, said: 'The Loving Cup is one of the most valuable pieces of Titanic memorabilia in private possession today.' The . official enquiry by the British Wreck Commissioner into the sinking of . the Titanic was convened in London on May 2, 1912, and presided over by . High Court Judge Lord Mersey. Spanning . over two months, Lord Mersey, lawyers, experts in shipbuilding and . marine law questioned and listened to testimony from over 100 witnesses. Survivor: Second Officer Charles Lightoller was the most senior officer to survive the disaster as the last person taken on board the Carpathia. His letter sent word that the ship's assistant surgeon was lost at sea . 'Good bye, old man': A two page typed letter on . 'Titanic' letterhead, dated April 9, 1912. The ship's highest ranking . surviving officer recounts his final words with Dr. Simpson and other . officers: 'We merely exchanged the words ""Goodbye, old man."" This . occurred shortly before the end . Concluding on July 3, 1912, the final report was issued on July 30, stating that the sinking was the result of the ship's collision with the iceberg - not due to any design flaws with the ship - and the collision had been brought about by excessive speed in icy waters. The report stopped short of condemning White Star's Captain Smith for the accident. Along with the American hearings, the British enquiry would result in several safety changes including 24 hour manned radios, distress rockets, ice patrols and sufficient lifeboats on board each ship. The original building plan was discovered at the old Cunard Line office, which merged with White Star Line in 1934. Gold: This 18k gold ring was recovered from the body of Titanic steward Thomas Hewitt, who was buried at sea . Originally sold in London in 1987, it then went on display at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. It was then offered at auction, at which time it became a part of a distinguished private collection. It has since been on display at the Titanic Museum in Branson, Missouri. Mr Livingston said: 'Items of this magnitude used in the official inquiry are virtually unobtainable, this being one of only two plans that have ever come to market.' Another item to be sold at the auction is what is thought to be the last postcard Titanic hero Jack Phillips ever wrote before he set sail on the doomed voyage, never to return. Written on board the 'Unsinkable Ship' as it waited in port, it is a note of affection from a brother to his sister, letting her know he is safe and well. The card, which has a photograph of the Titanic on its front, reads: 'Thanks . very much for your letter. Having glorious weather, went to Cowes . yesterday. Will write later before we sail. Love all, Jack.' Dated April 2 1912 Phillips, a maritime operator, added in the address panel, 'Miss Elsie Phillips, 11 Farncombe St., Godalming.' Other objects to be put up for sale include survivors' belongings, a fragment from the Titanic's grand staircase, and copies of newspapers which published front page reports about the . catastrophe, including the New York Times, The Illustrated London News . and The New York Evening Post.

"A convoy of vehicles carrying 'dummy' obese women could be used to help smuggle Baby P's mother out of prison, it emerged today. Tracey Connelly, who has ballooned to 22st in a Durham jail, was this week granted parole despite allowing her boyfriend and his paedophile brother to torture to death her son Peter. After five years behind bars, prison and probation bosses are likely to use subterfuge to stop the 32-year-old being photographed, traced and attacked by vigilantes when she leaves 'within days'. Connelly has gained at least a stone for every year she has been in jail, having previously admitted 'I put on a lot of weight when I came to prison' by gorging on pizza and jam tarts in solitary confinement. Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to leave prison this . week and having put on weight decoy women of a similar build could be used to sneak her out. She was jailed in 2009 . over the death of her son Peter, right . Sources have said a plan is in place to hide Connelly inside a car within the prison walls before being swept to a secret location to start a new life. Meanwhile extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could also be used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent. The same ploy was used when the girlfriend of Soham murderer Maxine Carr left prison. In . 2004, when Carr left Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire, she was stowed . in the footwell of a car at the same time as several similar vehicles also left. 'It . will be difficult to get her out without being seen, but there are ways . and means,' a Probation Service source told the Daily Mirror. 'She . may not be freed straight away, but when she is, they will use tactics . to ensure she is not photographed, just as they did with Maxine Carr.' Let out: Connelly has left Low Newton jail (pictured) in Brasside, County Durham and was released after five years there for allowing her son's death . Connelly will also be given detailed . advice on how to hide who she is when she leaves jail in the coming days . to avoid being found. Ploy: Maxine Carr was smuggled out of jail in the footwell of a car in 2004 when she left prison . She will leave Low Newton jail near Durham for a . parole hostel to start her reintegration back into society. She is already said to look markedly different from her notorious mugshot, having put on weight while in prison. But . probation officers will also advise her to change her name by deed . poll, change the colour of her hair and have it cut differently. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'The release of life and other indeterminate sentence prisoners is directed by the independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community. 'The IPP licence lasts for a minimum of 10 years, and an offender on an IPP licence may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions. Additionally, they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them.' After . just five years in jail experts believe she poses ‘no danger to the . public’, despite committing a crime that horrified Britain. Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing . nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend . Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter was just . 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his . mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate . injuries, including a broken back. The case provoked a national . scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a . series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life.

"Claims: Labour MP Simon Danczuk - who says the BBC has shown extraordinary bias in its coverage of the affair . The Labour MP who lifted the lid on Cyril Smith’s crimes has accused the BBC of 'extraordinary bias' in is coverage of the affair. Simon Danczuk, whose biography of the 29-stone sex abuser is being serialised by The Daily Mail, is sending a formal complaint to the Director General, Tony Hall. BBC News completely ignored Saturday’s front-page revelations about the book, only to change tack 24 hours later, when Smith’s family announced that they were 'saddened and concerned' by its publication. In a hostile report, the BBC website declared that the family believed Danczuk to be 'motivated by political and financial gain.' The Labour MP says he was 'flabbergasted' by the report, particularly since he wasn’t contacted for comment by the BBC prior to publication. ‘Here we have a book showing that Cyril Smith was a paedophile for more than forty years, and the BBC’s first reaction is not to ask why it was covered up, or to look at the horrors his victims went through and the lives he ruined. ‘Instead, they ask whether the bloke who wrote it is biased. I’m flabbergasted. The BBC have a track record of being blasé about child abuse. Look at how Jimmy Savile was swept under the carpet. Have they not learned anything from history?’ Mr Danczuk said he believed the organisation’s coverage of the affair is being coloured by a pro-liberal bias. ‘I believe the fact that this story is being led by the Daily Mail has driven the BBC to take a particular view. It’s hugely disappointing. 'If this book had been serialised by the Guardian, it would be leading their news bulletins.’ A BBC spokesman said: '[Cyril Smith] is an ongoing story that we have covered extensively in the past, and will continue to report on as and when there are developments that warrant it.'

"Clamour: Nick Clegg claims that he was too young at the time of Smith¿s vile acts to have known about them . Nick Clegg was facing a growing clamour last night to reveal what he knew and when about the Cyril Smith paedophilia scandal. The Lib Dem leader, who had issued glowing tributes to the 29-stone MP, said yesterday that he was too young at the time of Smith’s vile acts to have known about them. But politicians and child protection campaigners said his denial was not credible given the evidence that Smith’s activities were widely known in Westminster and his Rochdale constituency. And senior Lib Dem Vince Cable conceded last night there could have been an establishment cover-up of ‘paedophilia on a very large scale’. Allegations against Smith were published in magazines in 1979 and aired publicly at an election hustings in 1987, while prominent Liberals confirmed they had heard the rumours over many years. Yet Mr Clegg described Smith as a ‘beacon’ and an ‘inspiration’ on his 80th birthday in 2008, and said he was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death two years later. He tried to withdraw those remarks yesterday when faced with the Daily Mail’s revelations about how the predatory MP’s serial abuse of vulnerable boys as young as eight was covered up. The Lib Dem leader said: ‘I would never have dreamed of saying the things that I said if I was aware of the truly horrific nature of the actions which he is alleged to have undertaken over a long period of time.’ He added: ‘Cyril Smith stood down as an MP 13 years before I became an MP. Many of the actions, the repugnant actions, which we now learn about took place well before the party I now lead even existed – in fact, took place before I even existed. ‘Given those facts and that chronology, it is – as my party has made quite clear – not surprising that the Liberal Democrats, who were founded in 1989, two or three years before Cyril Smith stood down, were not aware.’ But critics rejected Mr Clegg’s bizarre defence, pointing out that his party evolved out of the old Liberal Party and most Liberal MPs and activists became Lib Dems. Scroll down for video . The Lib Dem leader said: 'Cyril Smith stood down as an MP 13 years before I became an MP.' However, critics say the abuse was well known in Westminster and in his Rochdale constituency . John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, . said: ‘That’s a pathetic excuse – as pathetic as you can get. They are . the same party. Clegg really needs to show some leadership on this. ‘I don’t believe that they knew nothing. The Liberal Democrats need to hold their own investigation into what they knew and what they covered up.’ Business Secretary Mr Cable told ITV’s The Agenda: ‘It is horrific, it is really horrible. Let’s remember this was a very long time ago. We’re talking 40-50 years ago. 'This is the (Jimmy) Savile era. I was actually a member of the Labour Party when all of this happened. I’ve no personal recollection of it.’ Asked whether the case was an establishment cover-up, he said: ‘That’s the suggestion. These are allegations. They are very serious. This is criminal paedophilia on a very large scale.’ Peter Saunders, chief executive of the . National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘I would have . thought that somebody of the stature of the leader of the Liberal . Democrats would at least find out what they needed to find out before . making a statement about such a controversial figure. 'I have lost count of the number of people I have spoken to in the last 24 hours who said it was well known how dodgy Cyril Smith was.’ He added: ‘It is incredible that they should be denying this now – what that will be doing is rubbing salt in the wounds of his many victims as well as survivors generally.’ Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said Mr Clegg could not ‘wash his hands’ of Smith’s abuse because it happened before he took over the Lib Dems. He added: ‘If you’re leader of an organisation, you have got a responsibility to know what is going on in it. You can’t simply hide behind history and say it was none of your business.’ A devastating new book by Rochdale . Labour MP Simon Danczuk discloses how politicians, police and the . security services left Smith free to molest children for four decades. Fresh revelations from the book serialised in today’s Daily Mail . include: . Smith was a . leading figure in a paedophile ring which carried out sickening abuse at . Knowl View, a school for boys with learning difficulties in Rochdale. The MP called for police to raid the home of a whistle-blower who went public with claims that pupils as young as eight were being subjected to extreme sexual abuse. In 1979, the Rochdale Alternative Press newspaper printed allegations that Smith had abused  young boys, which were repeated by the national satirical magazine Private Eye. David Steel, then Liberal leader, was told about the claims. His spokesman responded at the time: ‘All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms.’ Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who lifted the lid on Cyril Smith’s crimes, has accused the BBC of ‘extraordinary bias’ in its coverage of the affair. BBC News ignored the Mail’s Saturday front-page revelations, only to change tack 24 hours later, when Smith’s family said they were ‘saddened and concerned’ by its publication. In a hostile report, the BBC website said the family believed Mr Danczuk was ‘motivated by political and financial gain’. The Labour MP, who is sending a formal complaint to Director General Tony Hall, said: ‘Here we have a book showing that Cyril Smith was a paedophile for more than 40 years, and the BBC’s first reaction is not to ask why it was covered up, or to look at the horrors his victims went through and the lives he ruined. Instead, they ask whether the bloke who wrote it is biased. I’m flabbergasted.’ Mr Danczuk added: ‘The fact that this story is being led by the Daily Mail has driven the BBC to take a particular view. It’s hugely disappointing. If this book had been serialised by the Guardian, it would be leading their news bulletins.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘[Cyril Smith] is an ongoing story that we have covered extensively in the past, and will continue to report on as and when there are developments that warrant it.’ Smith’s alleged abuse of boys was also publicly raised during the 1987 general election campaign by his Labour opponent, David Williams. Mr Williams told the Mail: ‘Everyone in Rochdale had heard rumours about him, and I believed they should be properly investigated. Perhaps it was dirty politics on my behalf, but Cyril Smith was a dirty politician, so I decided to do it.’ Mr Danczuk says that Smith’s ‘penchant for boys’ was an ‘open secret’ and widely discussed in bars around Parliament. Michael Meadowcroft, a Liberal MP from 1983 to 1987, has said  that ‘whispers’ that Smith ‘liked boys’ circulated in Westminster.  Liz Lynne, Smith’s successor as  Lib Dem MP for Rochdale, said  she heard ‘inklings of rumours’  but defended Smith to her friends and colleagues. She added: ‘I never saw any evidence of impropriety – if I had,  I would have gone straight to  the police.’ Despite clear evidence that Smith’s sickening activities were well known, a string of senior Liberal Democrats have insisted they had were taken by surprise when his abuse was exposed after his death. A spokesman for Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, said he ‘absolutely and categorically denies any knowledge of any such allegations’. Baroness Shirley Williams, a founding member of the SDP and now a Lib Dem peer, added: ‘I went to Harvard in 1986 as professor at the Kennedy School and did not return until 1996, so I cannot comment on rumours about Cyril Smith or what actions if any were taken in those years.’ Lord Steel, who put Smith forward for his knighthood, has not commented on the revelations. Solicitor Alan Collins, from law firm Slater and Gordon, who is representing a number of Smith’s victims, said there was a discrepancy between the mounting evidence that the MP’s abuse was widely known and the Lib Dems’ claims of ignorance. He added: ‘The story I don’t think is going to go away because there is this mis-match that doesn’t make sense.’","Nick Clegg says he was too young to know about Smith's vile acts .

"MasterChef host Gregg Wallace faces a grilling by ‘very senior’ BBC staff after his recent bar fight, leaving his future on the show in doubt. The Mail on Sunday understands high-level managers at the Corporation are ‘very concerned’ following the incident in which he struck magazine publisher Paul Bates five times during a £225-a-head function at a Worcestershire hotel last weekend. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he was out of job after all of this,’ said one insider. Punch-up: Gregg Wallace's latest brawl at a hotel could cost him his job, insiders say . Wallace, who enjoys a six-figure salary for his role on MasterChef, claimed afterwards that he did ‘what any man would do’ saying his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini, 27, was ‘disrespected’. Mr Bates insists the pair were simply ‘chatting’ and says he was attacked ‘out of the blue’. Trigger: Wallace claimed that he did 'what any man would do' because his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini, pictured, had been 'disrespected' Wallace has a history of aggressive behaviour in public, which is likely to concern BBC bosses further as they prepare to speak to the TV chef. In 2007 the 48-year-old Londoner accepted an official police caution after a row over  a taxi, which left nurse Tony O’Ceallaigh ‘incredibly bruised’. Sources close to the presenter this week told The Mail on Sunday how the cookery expert has a tendency to ‘get jealous easily’. The close friend said: ‘There was no surprise to me when news of this latest fight came out this week. It’s not the first time something like this has happened.’ Another source told how he was once ejected from a Surrey hotel after he became embroiled in a row. Wallace’s spokesman said after the latest incident: ‘I can confirm Gregg was involved in a disagreement. The situation was swiftly resolved.’ He said yesterday: ‘About 15 years ago, Gregg was staying at a huge hotel where a Freemason event was taking place. At the end of the night, he had trouble finding his room. ‘After three attempts, Gregg became very frustrated and pulled a member of staff from behind a desk to help direct him to his room. Before lunchtime the next day, hotel staff asked him to leave.’ Wallace has been married three times and has two children from his second marriage. His second and third wives have previously labelled him ‘difficult’, while another recent girlfriend, model Carla Franco, told how he criticised her over her weight.","High-level managers at Corporation 'very concerned' following incident .

"Notorious warlord Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year jail term in a British prison, ministers announced today. The former president of Liberia was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) on 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including terrorism, murder, rape and using child soldiers. UK justice minister Jeremy Wright said today: 'The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice.' Convicted: Former Liberian president Charles . Taylor, left, at the Special Court for Sierra Leone for his . appeal judgment at The Hague today, where judges confirmed his 50-year . sentence for crimes against humanity . The controversial decision to send Taylor to Britain could cost the taxpayer up to £80,000-a-year to keep him in in a maximum security prison. Last month Taylor lost his appeal against his convictions, which made him the first former head of . state convicted by an international court since Nuremberg trials of Nazi . leaders after the Second World War. The court's ruling came more than a decade after Taylor helped rebels go on a murderous rampage across war-torn Sierra Leone, raping, murdering and mutilating tens of thousands of innocent victims. Taylor had aided and abetted crimes . committed by Revolutionary United Front and Armed Forces Revolutionary . Council rebels, while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were . committing. Presiding Judge . George Gelaga King said: 'Their primary purpose was to spread terror. Brutal violence was purposefully unleashed against civilians with the . purpose of making them afraid, afraid that there would be more violence . if they continued to resist.' Charles Taylor aided rebels in Sierra Leone during a brutal civil war in the 1990s which left 50,000 people dead. Thousands more were left mutilated in the conflict that became known for the extreme cruelty of rival rebel groups who hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their initials into opponents. Taylor helped to plan attacks in return for 'blood diamonds' mined by slave labourers in Sierra Leone and political influence in the volatile West African region. He was convicted not only of aiding and abetting Sierra Leone rebels from Liberia, but also for actually planning some of the attacks carried out by Sierra Leone rebel groups, the Revolutionary United Front and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council. The trial opened in June 2007 in The Hague. Taylor boycotted the initial proceedings and dismissed his legal team. He pleaded not guilty to all 11 charges. Witness testimony began in January 2008, and ended in November 2010. Closing arguments took place in February and March 2011. The court heard live testimony from over 90 prosecution witnesses, and received written statements from four additional witnesses. The defence presented 21 witnesses. Court hearings included testimony from supermodel Naomi Campbell about a gift of diamonds from Taylor. 'Governments . and the international community were also afraid that unless the RUF . and the AFRC demands were met, thousands more killings, mutilations, . abductions and rapes of civilians would follow.' Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in jail in May last year, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence on September 26 this year. The head of the SCSL then requested that Taylor now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve his sentence. In a statement to MPs today, Justice minister Mr Wright said: 'The United Kingdom’s offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes.' The International Tribunals (Sierra Leone) Act was backed by all parties in 2007 knowing it could mean Taylor would serve his sentence in the UK with the taxpayer picking up the bill, he said. 'International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation. 'The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice. It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity.' During Taylor's four-year initial trial, judges heard accounts from Sierra Leone civilians who had been mutilated by rebels or who had seen their close relatives murdered. They also heard evidence from supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room. She described the objects she received as looking like 'dirty pebbles.' The court found Taylor provided . crucial aid to rebels in Sierra Leone during that country's 11-year . civil war, which left an estimated 50,000 people dead before its . conclusion in 2002. Thousands . more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its . extreme cruelty, as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their . victims and carved their groups' initials into opponents. The . rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations, offering victims . the choice of 'long sleeves' or 'short sleeves' - having their hands . hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow. Prosecutors . said he used the proceeds from so-called blood diamonds mined in the . conflict zone to finance Taylor's activities, which included advising . and helping the rebels. 'Dirty pebbles': Naomi Campbell is seen holding the bible being sworn in at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, where she was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room . Civil war: In this June 10, 1997 file photo, soldiers from the Revolutionary United Front supported by Taylor ride in a pick-up truck at their base on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone . Morris Anyah, Taylor's lead . defence lawyer, complained that Taylor had been prosecuted because of a . lack of friends in high places. Referring . to the diplomatic row over action against the regime in Syria, Mr Anyah . said: 'But for two powerful nations, two members of the Security . Council - Russia and China - Bashar Assad would have been charged and . indicted by the International Criminal Court. That is not happening . simply because of political reasons. 'Had . Charles Taylor had as friends any of the five permanent members of the . Security Council ... this case I dare say would probably not have had . the sort of traction it had.' Because . Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court, only the . Security Council asking the court to investigate could trigger . jurisdiction there. The reaction back home: Men gather at a popular downtown Monrovia tea shop known as a hotspot for political debate to watch the announcement of today's appeal verdict . And Taylor's supporters in Liberia remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country's president. The very idea of international courts has come under fire across Africa. The ICC has been accused of neo-colonial meddling in Kenya as it pursues cases against its president and deputy president. 'This is complete international gangsterism,' said Cyril Allen, former secretary general of Liberia's National Patriotic Party. 'The ICC was set up for Africans, to intimidate them and get their resources.' Taylor's brother-in-law Arthur Saye said he was not surprised by the verdict. 'From day one my position has been that the trial of Mr Taylor was orchestrated by the powers that be - the Western powers,' he told the Associated Press. 'This was an international conspiracy.' Several African states are considering withdrawing from the ICC, which has only ever prosecuted Africans.","Former Liberian leaders convicted on 11 counts of war crimes .

"A tiny workman uses a crowbar to try and lever open the ring pull of a Coca-Cola can, while a miniature skier prepares to make his way down a mountain of granulated sugar. Such surreal scenarios are commonplace in the world of little people captured by artist and 'macro photographer' David Gilliver who specialises in extreme close-up photography. The Guernsey-based finance worker, 34, spends hours scouring the internet to source his figurines, which are mainly intended for use on model railway sets.

A little person tries to open a cold drink can of fizzy drink in his art work, Ring Pull (l) and a couple make their way through a landscape filled with shells in his work, Walking On Eggshells (r) 'The little people fascinate me,' he said. 'I enjoy finding new figures frozen in a particular pose - it almost feels like I have to then find a task for them to complete or be involved in, helping them fulfil their purpose. 'More often than not, I place the figures inside scenarios where they have a gargantuan task to complete which sometimes invokes a sense of sympathy inside me for them. 'I guess I am a hard taskmaster.' Each image takes around an hour and a half to pose and shoot, and the Channel Islands artist says he is constantly on the hunt for new scenes.'It is actually quite tricky to make the scenario feel convincing, and so a lot of thought goes into the placement of the figures and the props, and the nature of the scenario itself,' Gilliver said.

However, the artist has used figurines in his photography as far back as 1999, during his Fine Art Photography degree at the Glasgow School of Art, where he was inspired by photographers like American artist David Levinthal. 'I always joke with people, saying that I obtained my degree by playing with toys, which on the face of it, is difficult to argue against,' the artist said.

"AC Milan are eyeing up a move for Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado as the Serie A side prepare for life without Mario Balotelli.

"The health effects of what is described as 'the symbol of a bad diet' are to be examined by scientists in Glasgow. The deep-fried mars bar has long been a staple of the Scottish chip shop menu board. But despite its reputation as the ultimate unhealthy snack, no research has ever been done to investigate how it affects the body. The symbol of a bad halth: Deep-fried Mars bars have been said to represent the 'high-fat, high'sugar' diet of so many Scots . Students at The University of Glasgow are keen to find out, and have launched a project which compares the effects the bizarre delicacy has on blood vessels to those of porridge, another national favourite. Leading the study is Professor Matthew Walters, the head consultant for stroke at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, and the director of the Scottish Stroke Research Network. He said: 'In this student project we will look at what happens to blood vessels in the brain and compare the effects of fried chocolate with another traditional Scottish delicacy, porridge.' Porridge has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in the past, while eating chocolate has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke. But the effect of either food on blood flow to the brain has never been examined. Another Scottish favourite: Porridge has been known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease . The study will include 24 volunteers under the age of 40 with a BMI between 18 and 30 who will eat the porridge or deep-fried mars bars regularly. They are then required to attend the hospital twice for 90 minutes at a time, where their blood flow will be monitored by ultrasound technology. The deep-fried delicacy has been a Scottish favourite since it first appeared in Aberdeenshire in the 1990s. Since then chippies across the country have received off requests for deep-fried treats such as ice-cream and bananas . William Dunn, a student at The University of Glasgow who will perform the scans told the Independent: 'We hope the results will shed more light on the links between diet and stroke and allow health-conscious Glaswegians to make a more informed choice in the chip shop.' It's thought the deep fried mars bar first appeared in Aberdeen in 1995, but soon became a Glasgow favourite. A 2004 survey found that 22 per cent of fish and chip shops in the city sold the snack. The trend has continued with chippies hearing requests for other deep-fried goods such as Snickers bars, bananas, Creme Eggs and even ice-cream.","Study will have volunteers eat foods regularly and compare their blood vessels .

"Roberto Mancini wants to get back into the Champions League with Inter by winning this season’s Europa League – but insists his new team must become more attacking. The former Manchester City manager has returned to San Siro, where he won three Scudettos between 2004 and 2008, and earned a 1-1 draw with city rivals AC in his first match back. Mancini admitted he does not know a good number of his squad aside from watching television but that he must get results quickly.

Inter are currently ninth in Serie A, five points behind Napoli in third, but four points clear at the top of group F in the Europa League.

The attitude was right so I’m happy about that,’ Mancini said after the draw against AC. ‘We have a lot of things to do.

We have tried different tactical schemes but I changed them at the very last, it has been very engaging in the last two days. ‘For what comes next we’ll do our best as soon as we can, football has narrow times.’ Mancini kept Nemanja Vidic on the bench throughout. ‘I know Vidic very well even if he plays on the other side of Manchester,’ said Mancini. ‘He will be very helpful to this Inter side soon.’ Inter are currently in ninth place after just four wins in 12 games in Serie A .","Inter are currently in ninth place after just four wins in 12 games in Serie A .

"The fashion world might be obsessed with youth but it seems no one has told 75-year-old Jean Woods, who has a trendy Hoxton haircut and loves DMs. Or Daphne Selfe, who, at 85, is the world's oldest model - and one of the most stylish, with a wardrobe cool enough to leave the likes of Cara Delevingne looking on in envy. Or Gillian Lynne, who says she will wear mini-skirts at 87 if she wants, adding that her legs are her 'best asset'. And they are not alone, as new Channel 4 documentary, Fabulous Fashionistas, reveals. The film follows six spectacularly well-dressed pensioners - none of whom is letting age get in the way of looking stylish. Glamorous granny: Jean Woods, 75, reinvented herself as a fashionista after being widowed at 70 . Rock n' roll gran: Jean Woods, who lives in Bath, says she had always been passionate about fashion . Teenage kicks: Jean says her style inspiration comes from local youngsters - hence her love of DM boots . Fashion rebel: Jean says that she wears whatever she fancies and has no intention of toning things down . One of the most adventurous is Sue Kreitzman, 73, who has turned dressing into an art form - quite literally. An artist by trade, she frequently designs her own clothes, which she describes as a release 'from the tyranny of fashion'. With her bold red frames, chunky bangles and penchant for black, she bears a striking resemblance to the fashion world's grandmother-in-chief, Rosita Missoni, another 70-something still making her mark on the fashion world. Then there's Jean Barker, Baroness . Trumpington, 91, a Conservative peer who has made a point of refusing to . go quietly into the fashion night and can regularly be spotted . intently, but stylishly, listening to debates from the comfort of the . Lords' iconic red benches. 'She snuck in under the wire but I . couldn’t resist because she is such a character,' says Sue Bourne, the . director behind the documentary. 'She is terrifically well put-together and she  shops from catalogues. Actually she has a bit of an addiction to them.' Advanced style: Bridget Sojourner, 75, (left) gets her clothes in charity shops while Daphne Selfe, 85, is a model . Fashionable: Jean Barker, Baroness Trumpington is 91 and stylish while Sue Kreitzman, 73 is a fashion rebel . Fabulous: (Left to right) Sue Kreitzman, Daphne Selfe and Jean Barker, Baroness Trumpington . Age-defying: Gillian Lynne, 87, started working life as a dancer in the 1940s . For Bridget Sojourner, 75, it is not catalogues but charity shops that fuel her passion for fashion. Despite subsisting on a pension of just £100 a week, she cuts a striking figure in her crimson turban and chunky jewels. On . her shopping list are flowing dresses vibrant scarlet and black, which . she combines with eye-catching costume jewellery, uber-glamorous hats . and her most recent purchase, a £4 pair of Doc Marten boots. 'Style, . as one gets older, is more noticeable,' she explains. 'How I look is to . do with my identity and the fun of it. It’s nothing to do with looking . younger.' It might not be about looking younger, but you'd never know it when looking at Gillian Lynne, 87. A former ballerina, Lynne, who looks at least 20 years younger than she really is, exercises every day and still wears both mini-skirts and leggings. 'You just mustn’t allow the ageing process in,' she reveals. Her other secret for eternal youth is that she is married to a man 27 years younger than her. 'My friends thought it was positively indecent when we started to see each other, but since we are still together now, how silly they look now!' Her main gripe with women 'giving up' at a certain age is that they let their posture go. 'You . see them hunched over, looking downward. Everything seems to sag. They . look dejected. My training as a dancer always taught me that you stand . up straight and get those shoulders back. 'To . be crude about it, the nipples should lead – and how can they do that . if they are pointing down towards the floor somewhere.' Looking good: Jean Woods, Gillian Lynne and Bridget Sojourner show how to pose like you mean it . She has no issues about wearing short skirts. Even minis are OK. 'I know people probably look at the face and go ""oh dear"" but my legs have always been my best asset. Why should I stop showing them off.' It's a philosophy with which Woods can identify, although she admits that after a knee operation, mini-skirts are not for her anymore. 'Oh no. I don’t really go above the knee . with a skirt. Once you do that, at my age, you have to start thinking . about the scars from my knee replacement op.' Resplendent in her favourite scarlet T-shirt and grey-checked skirt, she's got hair that owes more than a little to Mary Quant - and the attitude to match. Widowed at 70, she filled the hole left by her husband with a job at Gap before taking herself - and her considerable styling skills - off to work at a boutique in Bath. 'I'm leading a different life,' adds Woods, who also runs three times a week, despite having had her knee replaced. 'It's more adventurous.' Fabulous Fashionistas, Tuesday 17th September, 10pm, Channel 4 . With her sharply cut fringe and penchant for Doc Marten boots, Jean Woods is no one's idea of a frail old grandmother - and the glamorous septuagenarian says she has absolutely no intention of changing. 'I have always been interested in fashion, but more so as I have got older,' explains Jean. 'I like to dress as I want to dress. When I put something on, I don't think ""will anybody think I look good?"" 'I just decide in my own mind whether I look good - I don't really care about other people.' Jean became Gap's oldest employee six years ago and has gone on to work at many of the big high street names, including current employer Bloomsbury & Co. She says young people are impressed with her look and don't have any issues with her buying similar clothes to them. Cool: Jean says that teenagers love her look, although other pensioners can be scared to try trendy clothes . High street: Jean became Gap's oldest employee six years ago but now works for another boutique . Jean hopes her TV appearance will help to persuade older people than life doesn't stop the day you pick up your pension. 'If it shows older people that life is there for the grabbing and that you have to take that plunge, then I will be happy,' adds Jean. 'I don't think youngsters think about it in the same way. When I go into Topshop, they are used to seeing me now and just accept that I am buying their clothes.' One of Jean's two sons, Alec, 49, said the whole family supports her fashion-savvy style. He said Jean's grandchildren, who are all in their teens, regularly ask their grandmother for tips on how to look cool. Alec said: 'She has always dressed like that, so to us it doesn't look any different. The kids accept the way she looks as normal, but when their friends come round they say ""I wish my gran could dress like that"". 'We all know that the way she dresses, and her personality, means she stands out.'

"The death of a grandmother on a hospital ward is being investigated by police today after her family expressed their fears she had been neglected by medical staff. Grandmother-of-eight Susan Evans, 75, was found dead in a ward just days after being admitted to Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. Mrs Evans's family believe she took her own life, and said that hospital staff should have been aware she had depression and needed to be closely monitored. Tragedy: The death of grandmother Susan Evans, 75, on a hospital ward is being investigated by police today after her family expressed their fears she had been neglected by medical staff . Prior to her death, Mrs Evans had also been receiving care at the  Bro Cerwyn psychiatric unit in Haverfordwest. 'We have some very real serious concerns about the standard of care she received at the hospital and the possibility of neglect,' said Mrs Evans's son Bill, 51. 'She took her own life on the ward while under the care of the health service and serious questions need to be answered. 'We particularly want to know if the type of security she had at Bro Cerwyn was imposed at the hospital. 'We are confident that the police will investigate this thoroughly and the hospital and health authorities will co-operate openly and fully.' The police inquiry is likely to centre around claims that Mrs Evans, who was a known suicide risk, had been left unchecked for a number of hours prior to her death on November 17. Hospital: Mrs Evans was found dead in a ward just days after being admitted to Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire (pictured) 'One thing that I think my mother would want to come out of this is a result that makes it less likely that it will happen to other families in the future and we have that closely in mind at present,' said Mr Evans, a solicitor at a firm in London. 'My mother was a gentle, kind lady who because of her problems did a great deal for mental health charities.' Mrs Evans had campaigned tirelessly for an improvement in mental health services in the area, had helped set up the psychiatric unit at Bro Cerwyn and worked with Pembrokeshire MIND. Her funeral at St Mary’s Church at Hakin near Haverfordwest was so well attended that there was an overflow of mourners outside the church. Police said that Dyfed-Powys officers are investigating the circumstances surrounding Mrs Evans’ death. A police spokesman said: 'As there is an ongoing investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further.' Hywel Dda University NHS Health Board is also carrying out an internal investigation, as well as assisting with the police probe. Chief operating officer Paul Hawkins said: 'We offer our deepest sympathies to the family for their loss. 'We are fully cooperating with the ongoing police investigation so no further comment will be made at this time. In any incident such as this, we conduct a thorough internal investigation.' Pembrokeshire County Council confirmed that Mrs Evans had been supported by its social services department in the past, but said it had no involvement with her after 2011. 'A death in these sort of circumstances is very sad and a cause for great concern,' he added.","Susan Evans, 75, was found dead on ward at Withybush Hospital .

"If there were any doubts that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney wants back into the public spotlight, an opinion essay published Thursday afternoon castigating President Obama for shrinking America's military footprint should dispel them. The Republican Party's 2012 presidential candidate opened up with both barrels on the White House, warning that 'bullying, invasion and regional wars' will ultimately become the norm if the U.S. withdraws from its historical role as the sole superpower capable of knitting together the world's fragile detente. 'The most ludicrous excuse for shrinking our military derives from the president’s thinking, he charged: ""Things are much less dangerous now than they were 20 years ago, 25 years ago or 30 years ago"".' 'The ""safer world"" trial balloon has been punctured by recent events in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, Gaza, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria and Iraq.' Scroll down for video . Tanned, rested and ready? Romney is thrusting himself directly into the line of political fire with a full-throated complaint about the Obama administration's foreign policy and military readiness strategy . Under Obama, Romney claims, the US Army will soon shrink to its 1940 size and the Navy to its 1917 levels . In a direct reference to the central conclusion of the 9/11 Commission, he noted that '""Failures of imagination"" led to tragedy 13 years ago; today, no imagination is required to picture what would descend on the United States if we let down our guard.' Obama told an audience of Democratic donors in July that he believes Americans are concerned by 'the sense that around the world, the old order isn't holding, and we’re not quite yet to where we need to be in terms of a new order that's based on a different set of principles, that's based on a sense of common humanity, that’s based on economies that work for all people.' That, Romney claimed in The Washington Post, is dangerous hogwash stemming from the belief that '[t]he old order ... where America’s disproportionate strength holds tyrants in check and preserves the sovereignty of nations, is to be replaced.' And putting 'common humanity' on a pedestal, he wrote in a thinly veiled reference to the Middle Eastern turmoil pitting the self-proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) against the West, 'ignores the reality that humanity is far from common in values and views.' 'Humanity may commonly agree that there is evil, but what one people calls evil another calls good,' Romney warned. Obama and his spokespersons have framed ISIS and other global threats as a challenge to be marginalized through the collective work of aligned nations with no one at the forefront. His oft-mocked foreign-affairs principle of 'leading from behind' is the most commonly cited summary of the idea. But if a 'multipolar world' were to replace 'one led by a strong United States,' Romney wrote, the other alpha dogs wouldn't necessarily be friendly nations. 'With emerging poles being China, Russia and Iran, the world would not see peace,' he predicted; 'it would see bullying, invasion and regional wars. And ultimately, one would seek to conquer the others, unleashing world war.' The Middle Eastern turmoil unleashed simultaneously by an aspiring nuclear Iran and a mass-murderous ISIS – coupled with a Russian invasion of Ukraine – drew a dramatic crescendo from Romney, with rhetoric that sounded more like a campaign speech than a thought piece. The U.S., he wrote, would never be left alone if it walked away. 'The history of the 20th century teaches that power-hungry tyrants ultimately feast on the appeasers,' according to Romney. 'We would be paying the cannibals to eat us last.' He attributed that phrase to former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who also once chaired the Republican National Committee. The coinage, however, dates back to Winston Churchill. Do-over: Rep. Paul Ryan, who ran as Romney's vice presidential nominee in 2012, has said he hopes the former Massachusetts governor takes another shot at winning the White House . Obama spent Thursday at a NATO conference in Wales, building bridges to a 'multipolar' approach to global conflict that Romney says would be a disastrous replacement for American supremacy . Romney used the same line in a December 2011 Fox News Channel interview, lambasting China for flooding global markets with cheap goods at the same time it devalued its currency. 'Right now, they're discounting their products on a very dramatic basis, and in doing so, closing down American businesses, killing American jobs,' he told host Greta Van Susteren during the peak of the presidential primary season. 'And we can say, ""Oh, it's great, we're getting these products cheap."" It's little like saying we're paying the cannibal to eat us last. It doesn't make sense.' 'That's paraphrasing Winston Churchill, by the way,' Romney added then. 'His line, not mine.' Romney's recent reappearances on political talk shows and bloggers' front-burners comes at a time when Obama is being pilloried for failing to take action against ISIS; playing a tone-deaf round of golf after the first of two Americans were beheaded on video in Syria; and arguing that international coalition-building, not U.S. military firepower, has the best chance of restoring order in the Arab world. If the former governor is planning to run for president again in 2016, his timing couldn't be better. One mid-July poll from CNN and ORC International found that if the 2012 election were held again, Romney would beat Obama handily, by a 53-44 margin. Buoyed by the changing political winds, he said two weeks ago during a West Virginia political rally that the Obama presidency has been 'a good deal worse than even I expected.' Last week another poll found he would crush the GOP competition in a hypothetical matchup in Iowa, the hyper-important early caucus state. Days later, he told a conservative television host that while he doesn't plan to run again, 'circumstances can change.' But he would still lose in a national election against Hillary Clinton – by 13 points – according to the CNN/ORC poll. Horror: When US photojournalist James Foley was executed by an ISIS jihadi on video, an aloof Obama drew jeers by rushing to play a round of golf as soon as he finished delivering a public condemnation . More hawkish than thou: Romney must stake out political territory more aggressive than Hillary Clinton's if he wants to run again, and she has swung decidedly to the right since leaving the Obama State Department . Clinton, the former secretary of state has made her own headlines in the last month by courting friction with the Obama White House over foreign policy issues during a wide-ranging interview in The Atlantic. Obama's 'failure' to arm Syria's rebels, she said, 'left a big vacuum, which the [ISIS] jihadists have now filled.' 'There is no such thing' as Iran's 'right' to enrich uranium, Clinton insisted. And Israel 'did what it had to do to respond to the rockets' lobbed in its direction by the Hamas terror network, she added. 'Israel has a right to defend itself.' Faced with an increasingly hawkish Hillary, Romney staked out his own political turf on Thursday in case he needs it two years from now. And in the same breath, he managed to paint Mrs. Clinton with the same broad brush he wielded to tar the Democratic Party. Obama and liberal voters, Romney wrote, have become so enamored with domestic spending that they're willing to sacrifice national security to sustain it. 'Politicians, and many of the people who elect them, want to keep up spending here at home,' he claimed. 'Entitlements and programs are putting pressure on the federal budget: We either cut defense, or we cut spending on ourselves. That, or raise our taxes. To date, the politicians have predictably voted to slash defense.' Current and future U.S. leaders, he concluded, will have to 'choose whether to succumb to the easy path of continued military hollowing or to honor their constitutional pledge to protect the United States.'","GOP's 2012 presidential also-ran wrote in the Washington Post that the White House is setting the US up for chaos by hollowing out armed forces .

"Adidas has come under fire for creating a pair of trainers with ‘shackles’. Critics have compared the ‘JS Roundhouse Mids’, to be released in August, to the chains worn by black slaves in the 19th century. The firm unveiled the trainers on its Facebook page. They feature plastic orange ‘shackles’ attached to the ankles by chains in the same colour. The shoes have sparked an angry debate online. More than 2,000 Facebook users have commented, with many calling the design ‘offensive’ and ‘ignorant’, saying the firm has ‘sunk to new lows’ with its ‘slavewear’ product. Outrage: Adidas has sparked anger and been accused of 'promoting slavery' by creating a new pair of trainers which have bright orange 'shackles' that fit around the wearer's ankles . Controversial: Many have said the shoes have connotations of the slave trade (left) and prisoners (right) One, ‘Kay Tee’, said: ‘It’s offensive . and inappropriate in many ways… How would a Jewish person feel if they . decided to have a shoe with a swastika on it and tried to claim it was . OK in the name of fashion?’ Dr Boyce Watkins, writing for Your Black World,  said: 'Shackles. The stuff that our ancestors wore for 400 years while experiencing the most horrific atrocities imaginable. 'Most of which were never documented in the history books and kept away from you in the educational system, all so you'd be willing to put shackles on your ankles today and not be so sensitive about it.' The Professor at Syracuse University said he accepted some people would accuse him of overreacting. But he added: 'There is always a group of negroes who are more than happy to resubmit themselves to slavery. Anger: More than 2,000 people have labelled the design 'offensive' and 'ignorant' and say the firm has 'sunk to new lows' in its 'slavewear' product . 'I'm offended by these shoes as there is nothing funny about the prison industrial complex, which is the most genocidal thing to happen to the black family since slavery itself.' Others have likened the shoes' orange 'bracelets' to the shackles worn by prisoners across the America, or said the firm is 'promoting slavery'. Kay Tee added: 'Regardless if the company was saying the shoes are so hot you have to chain them to you, or they were capitalising on the whole prison style popularity. 'But corporate business has a social responsibility above all to consider these perceptions before releasing a product like this. Adidas has not yet commented. It seems Adidas did not want to be outdone by fierce competitor Nike in the controversial shoe design stakes. Controversial: Nike has provoked outrage by launching a new Black and Tan line of trainers for St Patrick's Day . In March, Nike was accused of 'huge insensitivity' for launching a £70 'beer-themed' trainer called 'The Black and Tan' in time for St Patrick's Day. The firm apologised, saying it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy celebrations for Ireland's patron saint. To others, however, it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a British unit sent to Ireland to suppress revolt in the 1920s. That is because the Black and Tans was the nickname given to the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, which became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war. One outraged Irish American claimed it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ‘the Al Qaeda’. The trainer is officially called the Nike SB Dunk Low, but has been nicknamed The Black and Tan for its colourings. An advertisement for the shoe says: ‘Tis the season for Irish beer and why not celebrate with Nike. Crackdown: British police, known as Black and Tans for their mix-and-match military outfits of dark wool and khaki, hold a suspected Sinn Fein member at gunpoint and search him for weapons . ‘The Black and Tan sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass.’ Others Irish Americans criticised Nike for being ‘oblivious’ to the historical connotation. Six years ago ice cream firm Ben & Jerry’s caused a furore when it launched a Black and Tan flavour. The product was quickly withdrawn. Athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922, nationalist Ireland still associates the Black and Tans with murder, brutality, massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern Ireland's independence . Historians say there is no dispute that 'the Tans' killed and destroyed on a large scale, and recorded that when a Tan was killed in Cork, they burnt down more than 300 buildings. The Catholic cardinal of the day called them 'a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves'.","JS Roundhouse Mids have bright 'shackles' that fit around wearer's ankles .

"It's hard to compete with the stunning footage taken by astronauts orbiting Earth. Now, Nasa plans to make the videos even better by showing a series of tours around the International Space Station in 3D. In a newly-released video, crew members submerge a GoPro camera in a water bubble which then floats around the ISS in microgravity. Scroll down for video . Separate 3D footage, shot by astronaut Don Pettit in 2012, takes the viewer on a journey through the ISS. The best views come when Pettit holds the camera towards a window to capture views of a Russian Soyuz capsule docked to the station . The footage was taken by astronauts Steve Swanson, Reid Wiseman and Alexander Gerst while they attempted to explore the phenomenon of water surface tension in space. Separate footage, shot by astronaut Don Pettit in 2012, takes the viewer through a tour of the topsy-turvy world of the ISS. In the gym area for example, the treadmill sticks out from the wall while to reach the viewing station you have to float upside down. The most impressive views come when Pettit holds the camera towards a window to capture views of a Russian Soyuz capsule docked to the station. A stunning view of Earth from the ISS captured by astronaut Don Pettit using a £13,000 ($21,000) 3D camera . To view both videos in 3D you need to use red-blue stereoscopic vision glasses. Nasa says these are the first in a series of 3D tours of the ISS, as the cameras they use to take the footage fare better in space. This is because radiation in space damages ordinary cameras, burning out thousands of pixels - enough to make them fail every eight to 12 months. But the £13,000 ($21,000) 3D camera brought aboard ISS in 2011 has remained largely undamaged through the years. A UFO photobombed astronauts making repairs to the International Space (ISS) last month - setting off a wild frenzy of speculation online. The spooky incident happened on 7 October, when Flight Engineers Reid Wiseman of Nasa and Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency conducted a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to fix an electrical problem. In video shot by Nasa and uploaded to YouTube, the UFO can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts, before the camera cuts to another angle. As always, the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course, the footage appeared grainy. The UFO appears during the video at around the 1:50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts. According to the the Examiner, one possible explanation for the UFO is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the ISS. But most experts agreed it was just the sun's glare glinting in the camera. 'Shooting in 3D hasn't changed much in 50 or 60 years,' said Rodney Grubbs, manager for Nasa's Imagery Experts Program. 'The camera still has two distinct left and right lenses, but now we record to two separate flash memory cards, one for the left camera eye and one for the right. 'We don't have to transmit taped footage and re-record it here. We can simply download an exact copy of those digital files to the ground, merge them in our editing software here, and create the same 3D image they had in orbit.' Mr Grubbs and his team are now planning to send up a camera that could shoot nearly six times the resolution of a HD camera, encouraging the crew to record more video to share with the public.

"Raheem Sterling has been 'outstanding' ever since he broke into the England team and Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson believes there is no limit to his potential. Four and a half years ago the Reds beat the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal to the signature of QPR's nippy Jamaican-born attacker. Sterling, like so many preciously-talented teenagers, was hailed as a wonder kid but is one of few to look as if he is getting anywhere near to fulfilling the hype. Oustanding: Raheem Sterling has been a stand-out performer for England this summer . At the age of 19, he has established himself as a first-team regular at Liverpool as well as an increasingly important member of the England team. He was one of few players to impress during the summer's disastrous World Cup campaign and has started the season wonderfully, following up a man-of-the-match display in Liverpool's 3-0 win at Tottenham by winning the same award just days later as England defeated Norway 1-0. 'I think Raheem has been outstanding since he's come into the England first team,' Liverpool and England team-mate Henderson said after the match. England: In a flat performance against Norway, Sterling was comfortably England's best player . 'I thought he was outstanding in both games at the World Cup. For a 19-year-old to play on the world stage like that I thought he was magnificent. 'He continues to do it every week for Liverpool and he got man of the match again against Norway, so he's a very level-headed for a young lad his age. His football brain is not as young as that. 'He's really clever with his positioning. He drives forward the ball. Hopefully he can continue improving and working hard. 'Raheem plays with no fear. He just wants to get the ball run at people and take them on.' Henderson hopes Sterling continues that fine form  when England begin their European Championship qualifying campaign with arguably their toughest match of Group E in Switzerland. Team-mate: Jordan Henderson was impressed by Sterling's developmentat the World Cup . A similarly impressive display may well tip the balance in England's favour at St Jakob-Park and would only see his star rise further. Henderson believes Sterling will thrive under such scrutiny and, having seemingly sorted out some off-field issues, backed him to kick on. 'I think he was 16 when I first saw him training with us,' he said. 'You could see he had the mentality to be a top player, but we try to keep his feet on the ground. 'He's got the right people around him at the club and off the field as well. If he keeps working hard, with the players and the manager he has at Liverpool he can really kick on. Environment: Henderson believes Sterling has the right people around him at the moment to help him grow . 'I don't think he's going to get carried away by it. He's got the right people around him off the field for Liverpool and England. I'm sure he'll keep his feet on the ground.' But as a young millionaire doing a job you love, how hard is it to not get distracted? 'It's not that difficult,' Henderson said with a wry smile. 'It just depends what type of person you are. 'You have to concentrate on your football and not let anything outside affect you, enjoy playing and work as hard as you can in training, try to improve your game all the time. 'I think that's really important as well.'","Raheem Sterling has been 'outstanding' for England .

"Dried-out southern California got a much-needed sprinkling of rain on Sunday, but at the cost of rockslides which trapped more than a dozen cars in mud and shut down 10 miles of the Pacific Coast Highway. No one was injured, but the slides raise fears that more damage could be in store when heavier rains arrive on Tuesday as part of a storm that has already started hitting northern California. Downtown Los Angeles received 1.4 inches of rain on Sunday, which led to slides in nearby Malibu. A stretch of the highly-trafficked Pacific Coast Highway was closed Sunday after it became covered in a few inches to a foot of debris and led 10 to 15 vehicles to become stranded in the muck. Scroll down for video . Closed: A 10-mile stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California was shut down on Sunday after rains caused a rockslide on the highly-trafficked road . Impassable: More than a dozen vehicles became stuck in the debris on the road, but no one was injured . All of the drivers and occupants of the impacted vehicles were able to safely exit their vehicles without injury. Some of the vehicles were extricated, while others were abandoned until the rains stopped.  Officials said the road may not be fully cleaned up and reopened until Tuesday. Now southern Californians are bracing for Tuesday's storm, which is expected to be the biggest rainfall to hit the region since last February. That storm system is expected to start Tuesday morning bring 1-2 inches of rain to the coastal and valley areas, and 2-5 inches in the foothills and mountains. While the heaviest rain will happen Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, light showers will continue on Wednesday and into Thursday. Next round: More rain is expected to hit the drought-plagued southern California region on Tuesday, with 1-2 inches falling in the coastal and valley areas, and 2-5 inches in the foothills and mountains . Eighty per cent of California is currently experiencing a state of extreme drought, so the rain comes as a godsend for the state's reservoirs which have been withering the past three dry years. However, the drought has also sparked several disastrous wildfires recently which create soil conditions hazardous to mud and rockslides when rain does fall. There were more than 5,500 wildfires in 2014, which is 1,000 more than usual. Road conditions are also a concern, since dry weather causes oil to accumulate on the road and it can become slick when hit with rain. Residents in the areas of the recent Colby and Springs wildfires, which burned up several thousand acres each in the areas of the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Monica Mountains respectively, were put on notice Sunday that the rain could cause damage. No evacuations have been ordered yet, but residents are being asked to remove vehicles, trash bins and other obstructions from the roadways. In Glendora, which was hit with mudslides just last week, residents stacked sandbags in anticipation for Tuesday's rains, and concrete barriers were set up outside the homes. Preparations: Tuesday's rains bring the chance of further mud and rockslides, especially in areas where wildfires have recently happened. Above, residents in Glendora, California have lined up sandbags outside their homes . Shield: Concrete barriers are lined up outside a home in Glendora, California to protect it from potential mud and rockslides this week . Downtown Los Angeles has only seen a half of inch of rain this year, which is 1.5 inches lower than usual. The rain on Tuesday could bring the year totals up to normal, but climatologist Bill Patzert told the Los Angeles Times that 'one storm is not a drought buster'. 'Hopefully it is a small down payment and is a preview of the coming attractions in the next few months. Southern California has been experiencing unusually warm temperatures recently, which may predict an El NIno weather pattern. An El Nino is the warming of the Pacific Ocean which causes more rain, but climatologists believe if an El Nino happens it will be relatively weak. Currently, the estimates of an El Nino happening stand at 58 per cent.","Southern California was hit with showers on Sunday, causing rockslides which shut down parts of the Pacific Coast Highway .

"At every turn there was a test for Mario Balotelli’s temperament. As usual he struggled with the warm-up bibs and when Liverpool finally got underway at White Hart Lane he was cut in half by Eric Dier. Modelling his flame-red No 45 shirt for the first time since his £16m move from AC Milan, Balotelli passed them all. Good for him. On another day, in another shirt, he would have had a cob on when Dier sized him up and went through him with a vicious, two-footed lunge 24 minutes into Balotelli’s debut. No booking. No reaction. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Rodgers say today was first time Balotelli ever marked at corner . Part of the family already: Mario Balotelli made an impressive start to life as a Liverpool player . Well done, son! Brendan Rodgers was pleased with his new signing's efforts at White Hart Lane . He was entitled to say something, to turn to referee Phil Dowd to demand an explanation when Dier got away with it scot-free. This was Balotelli on his best behaviour, doing everything asked of him by his manager and team-mates as Liverpool romped to an impressive 3-0 victory. His day ended in the 60th minute when his lungs finally gave up and he reluctantly trudged towards the dug-out to be replaced by Lazar Markovic. ‘Well done son,’ mouthed Rodgers as Balotelli raised the obligatory high-five with his new manager and headed for the bench. This was a promising debut. ‘He could be the difference as to whether we can compete,' Rodgers said. By then Liverpool’s work here in the Barclays Premier League was done for another season after tearing Tottenham apart with this bracing performance. Balotelli has already asked to take the penalties for Liverpool, but there was never any question of Gerrard relinquishing that responsibility when Joe Allen’s shirt was tugged by disaster-man Dier. Gerrard scored his 43rd from the spot, breaking the previous record set by the great Danish midfielder Jan Molby. Balotelli was one of the first to congratulate him. That’s maturity. Oops! Balotelli did miss a glaring opportunity to score his first goal for the club during the 3-0 win . Putting himself about: Balotelli got involved in the physical side of the game against Spurs on Sunday . ‘He asked me who was on the penalties – he's scored 26 and only missed one – but Steven Gerrard is the penalty taker I nominated when I came in,’ added Rodgers. His Liverpool debut was about integration, to learn his role alongside Daniel Sturridge. Liverpool were eye-catching here, far better than they were when they lost 3-1 at the Etihad against the defending champions Manchester City last Monday. When Rodgers reviews the tape of this game, he will be impressed with Balotelli. He worked hard and did the dirty work. Yes, he should have scored, notably when Raheem Sterling found him with a cross in the opening minutes. Lloris saved and Balotelli dabbed the rebound wide. Next time it will be in the back of the net. Then there is the unseen side, carrying out tactical instructions for the benefit of the Liverpool team. When Tottenham won their first corner of the game midway through the first half, he ran at three-quarter pace to make sure he was back in time to mark Younes Kaboul. Impressive stuff. ‘For the first time in his life, he marked at a corner - seriously,’ claimed Rodgers. ‘He’s an international player who has won three titles in Italy – a league title, the Champions League and we were doing corners in training and he said: “I don't mark at corners”. Well, he does now. ‘He had a great header today. Treat him like an adult and it'll bring the best out of him.’ To be part of this team, to stitch himself into one of the best teams to watch in English football right now, he will need to retain that discipline. He had the right attitude here, that’s for sure. Rising above the rest: Balotelli is already laughing and joking with his new team-mates . Holding it up: Younes Kaboul paid close attention to the former Manchester City man . Balotelli is already part of the Liverpool family, sitting neatly into the environment Rodgers has created for this expressive team. ‘He’s already changed the music in the dressing room and he’s on the back of the bus pulling the strings,’ joked Gerrard. That will always be Balotelli’s way. This was a decent start for the Italy striker, particularly after word filtered out that he has been overlooked by the national team for Thursday’s friendly against Holland and the European Championship qualifier in Norway. Under Cesare Prandelli, the previous coach, Balotelli had someone to protect him. Antonio Conte, the new man in charge, sees it differently. Perhaps, when Balotelli settles into a routine of life at Liverpool and starts knocking in the goals again, he will wear the shirt of the Azzurri once again.

"A video of the 13-year-old who was found behind a false wall after going missing for four years has surfaced - purportedly showing him sweeping the roof of the house he was held captive in. Footage recorded by neighbors reportedly shows Gregory Jean Jr on top of his father's house in Jonesboro, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. They told ABC that they would watch as the boy did yard work but decided to film what was going on when they saw him getting close to the edge of the house off the ground. The youngster was rescued over the weekend after going to visit Gregory Jean, 37, in 2010. He has been charged with false imprisonment and cruelty alongside the boy's stepmother, Samantha Joy Davis, 42. On Monday, he revealed how he used his phone to contact his mother while he was being kept in the house. Scroll down for video . Concerned neighbors recorded footage of Gregory Jean Jr, who was help captive in a house in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, for four years, allegedly sweeping the roof . The residents said they would watch as the boy did chores in the backyard, but only started recording when he was working dangerously close to the edge above the ground . Reunited: Gregory Jean Jr,  is pictured being reunited with his Florida-based mother after he was found imprisoned behind a false wall in the linen closet of his father's Georgia home four years after going missing . Captors: Father Gregory Jean, 37 (left), and stepmother Samantha Joy Davis, 42 (right), appeared in court Sunday morning on charges of false imprisonment, obstruction and cruelty to a child after Jean's son was found hidden behind a linen closet at their home . Gregory Jean Jr. said: 'I just went on [Google] Play Store and I downloaded an app called Magic Jack and I called my mom.' It is not clear how the teenager managed to get hold of the phone, but once downloaded the App allows users free calling to the US and Canada. Gregory went missing in 2010, when he went to visit his father Gregory Jean, 37, and his stepmother Samantha Joy Davis, 42 - the pair are both charged with the false imprisonment and cruelty against Gregory at their home in Jonesboro, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. Davis is on probation for punishing her biological son by cutting his tongue with a pair of hot scissors in 2004. Today his biological mother, Lisa Smith told CBS46 she had talked to her son a few times during the four-year period he was missing and said their emotional reunion 'feels good.' She said she now has custody of Gregory and added that she was a U.S. citizen but refused to comment on why she had not  reported her son missing. A press conference today revealed that the 'hidden compartment' where Gregory was found, was an attic space connected to a garage by a crawl-through in a linen closet. First appearance: Jean (left) and David (right) take the stand in Clayton County, Georgia court on Sunday. They were remanded . When police attended the home at 11pm on Friday they could originally not find the boy, but Gregory then gave them more details and they returned - he was found behind the 'access panel' at 2am. 'The victim had signs of physical assault and was very emotionally distraught,' Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said, reports NBC News. The police supervisor who found him said that after he calmed down, Gregory kept repeating his thanks and gratitude. Police said Gregory had been in the attic area 'temporarily' and actually shared a bedroom with one of the other juveniles in the home. In court on Sunday, a judge revealed that Davis allegedly hit the boy on his buttocks and legs with a stick. Arrests: The boy went missing in 2010, when he went to see his father and never returned. His mother allegedly never informed police since she is an immigrant and unfamiliar with the system. Above, the house where he was held captive . No clue: Neighbors in the Jonesboro neighborhood said they often saw the boy outside the house, and never thought he was being held prisoner . He denied a bond after learning that Davis is currently on probation in Henry County for child cruelty. The judge also denied a bond for Jean and said a fugitive of justice case appeared on the record of Jean, who is a U.S. citizen from Haiti. 'They dismissed the case,' Jean insisted. 'That was not me. They had the wrong person.' Judge Richard Brown refused both suspects bail and they were remanded to Clayton County Jail until their next appearance on December 9. There is no indication Gregory attended school, and neighbors have said they often saw him doing yard work. Neighbors in the Atlanta, Georgia suburb  have spoken out to say they saw the boy often and never knew he was being held against his will. Investigation: CID officers are pictured arriving at the house on Saturday morning. An investigation is ongoing . Jean's neighbor's in the Atlanta suburb of  Jonesboro were shocked to hear that the Gregory was a prisoner. They say they often saw him outside the house, sometimes doing yard work. 'It was a shock to all of us. They were really nice people, very open they said come over anytime you want,' neighbor Julie Pizarro, who lives across the street told WXIA. 'The young man didn't seem under any distress. I guess you never know what's behind closed doors.' 'Gosh, it was right under our nose,' neighbor Akono Ekundayo said. 'We could have done something.' Proud: Police Chief Greg Porter (left) said: 'The police department did an excellent job coming out here and responding to the 911 emergency call.' Right, one of the boy's relatives weeps after being reunited with him . Scene: Police have now requested a search warrant for the property in Duke Court (pictured) In heart-wrenching scenes on Saturday morning, Gregory was pictured clinging on to his weeping mother, who had traveled to Georgia, as another female relative sobbed uncontrollably nearby in an emotional reunion. Sergeant Joanne Southerland, of Clayton County Police Department, told the news station: 'We came here to the home and were able to get inside and talk to the people inside. 'After several minutes of denying that the child was here and that there was ever any assault or anything like that, we were able to find him in the linen closet.' Officer Daniel Day added: 'I just couldn't believe it. We found him, we saw him. To say it was a great feeling is an understatement.

"The wife of a man who drowned two years ago after a swan attacked him is suing his employer and the condo complex where he cared for the birds. Amy Hensley filed the lawsuit last week, claiming the attack caused or contributed to the drowning of her husband Anthony Hensley. She also contends that the defendants 'knew or should have known that mute swans are strongly territorial with a dangerous propensity to attack'. Anthony Hensley, a father of two young daughters, tragically died in April 2012 after he toppled out of a kayak and into Bay Colony Pond in Des Plaines, Illinois, when the swan attacked. The big bird continued to lunge at him as he tried to swim to shore, before he was dragged under water by the weight of his boots and clothes. Fatal attack: Anthony Hensley, 37 (pictured with his wife Any) drowned after he was attacked by an aggressive swan at a Chicago pond in 2012 . Devoted father: Family described Anthony Hensley as a loving father to his two young daughters (pictured left and right) He was pronounced dead at a hospital after dive crews scoured the 50-foot-deep pond to find him. The Cook County Medical Examiner's office concluded he drowned and ruled his death an accident. His father Raymond Hensley said at the time that his son was a good swimmer but didn't stand a chance against the aggressive bird. 'It's tragic for him to have to spend the last few moments like that,' he told CBS Chicago. 'He’s going to be remembered as one of the most wonderful fathers in the world. A very good father, a very good husband; there wasn’t a mean bone in his body.' Scene: Hensley drowned in this pond at the Bay Colony Drive condo complex in Des Plaines, Illinois, where he had tended to swans for 10 years . 'Upside down': Hensley fell out of the kayak (pictured) when he was attacked . For about . 10 years, Anthony Hensley regularly tended to the swans at Bay Colony . Drive condo complex. The swans were used to keep the geese away. Police . said he was checking on the mute swans near the condominiums when one . of the swans moved towards him, causing him to roll off his kayak . and into the water. According to the suit, a 'mute swan is one of the heaviest flying birds, with males averaging about 24 to 26-pounds'. The birds are also extremely aggressive and 'attack by smashing at their victims with bony spurs in the wings, accompanied by biting with their large bill,' the suit added, according to Chicago Tribune. Tragic loss: Anthony Hensley, pictured with one of his daughters, had tended to the swans for 10 years before he died .

"After a testing week in which his managerial methods were scrutinised and his Watford ‘family’ looked close to a break-up, this was a satisfying afternoon for Beppe Sannino. Finding himself on the receiving end of a volley of abuse when Lloyd Dyer scored at Rotherham in midweek, the Italian was forced to admit that as ‘father’ to a squad of ’24 brothers’, he couldn’t possibly keep everyone happy with enough game time. It led to rumours of a widening rift within the squad but, with Dyer dropped and unity restored on the pitch at least, it was very much a happy home at Vicarage Road on Saturday as woeful Leeds United were comfortably beaten. Opener: Fernando Forestieri (left) scores the opener for Watford against Leeds at Vicarage Road . Watford: Gomes; Tamas, Angella, Hoban; Paredes (Anya 55), Abdi (Andrews 82), Tozser, Munari, Pudil; Deeney (c), Forestieri (Ighalo 76) Substitutes not used: Bond (GK), Doyley, Fabbrini, Vydra . Scorers: Forestieri 20, 67; Deeney (pen) 58; Tozser 90 . Booked: Tozser, Angella . Leeds United: Silvestri; Byram, Bellusci, Pearce (c), Warnock; Austin, Murphy, Bianchi, Tonge (Poleon 76); Sharp (Cooper 62), Antenucci (Smith 82) Substitutes not used: S Taylor (GK), Wootton, Cook, Norris . Scorer: Tamas own goal 32 . Booked: Murphy, Austin . Sent off: Bellusci, Byram . Referee: James Linington (Isle of Wight) Attendance: 15,674 . Two wonderful goals from Fernando Forestieri, a free-kick from Daniel Tozser and a Troy Deeney penalty after debutant Giuseppe Bellusci had been dismissed brought back the Hornets’ harmony and, as Leeds hover above the Championship relegation places, turned up the pressure on Dave Hockaday. Watford’s opener was a thing of beauty. From Tozser’s inswinging corner, Deeney and Gianni Munari whisked the ball between statuesque Leeds defenders to free Forestieri. He saw his initial low shot blocked by Marco Silvestri but the ball popped up obligingly for Italian-Argentine to head home. But after such a moment of such quick minds and swift feet came a lapse in concentration and a clumsy boot that gifted Leeds an equaliser. Billy Sharp found space to cross low from the right and, though the ball was heading for nobody in particular, it was diverted beyond Heurelho Gomes by Tamas’s outstretched leg. It was pretty much all Leeds created. Sharp was lively, as was Michael Tonge, but debutant striker Mirco Antenucci, signed from Serie B outfit Ternana in the week, struggled to keep pace. Performance: Forestieri (right) scored twice and won a penalty which Troy Deeney converted . The other new boy Bellusci, the centre-back known as ‘The Warrior’ by fans at his previous club Catania, wasn’t exactly heroic when he allowed Tommie Hoban a free header from Almen Abdi’s corner. Luckily for Leeds, he put it over the bar. But that was just the beginning of Bellusci’s problems. Shortly before the hour, Forestieri burst into the Leeds box and the Italian hacked him down. Referee James Linington had little choice but to show a red card. Deeney had impressed most for Watford. His vivid orange boots acted as a beacon for pretty much every attack. Always willing, always running, he was adept at holding the ball up and sparking his team into life. He proved reliable at penalty taking too, sending the ball straight down the middle to restore Watford’s lead. From then on, it was one-way traffic and the livewire Forestieri, collecting the ball on the left-hand side of the box, skipped past challenge after challenge before seeing his shot trickle in off the inside of the post for his third of the season. Surely it couldn't get any worse for Leeds? It certainly did. Tozser fired home a lovely free-kick in injury time, before Sam Byram saw red for a senseless head-butt on Daniel Pudil.

"Anti-semitism campaigners have described a Turkish shampoo commercial featuring Hitler as a 'deplorable marketing ploy'. The 12-second advert for Biomen shampoo shows the Nazi leader gesticulating wildly during a speech, before the commercial urges customers to buy the '100 per cent male shampoo'. Underneath the footage of Hitler from an undated speech, there is a caption which translates as, 'If you are not wearing a woman's dress, you should not use her shampoo either'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial: The advert for Biomen shows Hitler and tells viewers, 'If you are not wearing a woman's dress, you should not use her shampoo either' The advert by the Turkish firm ends by claiming the shampoo is for 'real men' The controversial ad finishes with the strapline, 'Here it is, a real men’s shampoo, Biomen.' Jewish organisations and anti-semitism groups have urged Turkish firm Biofirm to pull the advert, but the company have so far refused to withdraw the campaign since it first aired last week. The Turkish Jewish Community said in statement: 'It's totally unacceptable to make use of Hitler, the most striking example of cruelty and savagery.' Other groups were also quick to condemn the short commercial. The Anti-Defamation League has written to Turkey's Ambassador to the U.S., Namik Tan, after saying it was 'repulsed' by the commercial. Abraham H. Foxman, the League's National Director, said on the ADL website: 'The use of images of the violently anti-Semitic dictator who was responsible for the mass murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others in the Holocaust to sell shampoo is a disgusting and deplorable marketing ploy. Popular: Hitler's autobiography, Mein Kampf, became an unlikely bestseller in Turkey in 2005 . 'This video is just the latest example of the use of Holocaust imagery in some countries to sell commercial products, which has contributed to the trivialization of and desensitization to the unparalleled horrors of the Holocaust. 'There can never be any justifiable purpose for using the images of Hitler, Nazis or any other depiction of the Nazi killing machine to sell products or services.' Turkey has long had an apparent fascination with Hitler, as the Nazi leader's autobiography Mein Kampft, became a bestseller in the country in 2005. The country itself has a Jewish population of between 18,000 and 20,000, most of whom live in Istanbul.","Biomen ad uses Hitler to promote 'real men's shampoo'

"NASCAR champion Tony Stewart was given a standing ovation on Sunday night as he returned to the track for his first race since he struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr three weeks ago in upstate New York. Stewart, 43, walked out during driver introductions to a chorus of cheers - the loudest and longest for any driver - before the Oral-B 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday. The response even drowned out the public address announcer's introduction of Stewart. Scroll down for video . Hero's welcome: Tony Stewart's introduction received the loudest cheers of the night at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday night as he took his customary lap around the track in the back of a pickup truck . Stewart waved a couple times and shook hands with each person on the stage before taking the customary lap around the track in the back of a pickup. Starting the race in twelfth spot, Stewart ran in the top 10 early in the race, getting as high as fourth. Then, on lap 122 after a restart, Kyle Busch's No. 18 machine got loose coming out of turn two and banged into Stewart, sending both cars against the wall. Stewart carried on but dropped back to 21st. 'We just got run over big-time!' Stewart radioed his crew. 'I hit the wall pretty hard there.' In the half-hour before the start of the race, Stewart, standing beside his No. 14 Chevrolet, was visited by sponsor representatives Johnny Morris of Bass Pro Shops and Rusty Rush of Rush Enterprises, who earlier on Sunday had told USA TODAY Sports 'We stand by Tony'. Also in the crowd were Eddie Jarvis, Stewart's long-time business manager; Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Brett Frood; and Mike Arning, Stewart's public relations director. The crowd's response at Atlanta on Sunday drowned out the public address announcer's introduction of Stewart, left. He hadn't raced since the death of Kevin Ward Jr, right, three weeks ago . Arning motioned for a member of a network camera crew to remove a boom microphone from near the heads of Stewart and his associates. The group gathered in a circle and prayed before Stewart climbed back into his car for the first time after skipping three races. On Friday, NASCAR granted him a waiver to participate in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. So despite him missing time in the car during the regular season, Stewart will make the 16-driver championship field if he wins next weekend at Richmond International Raceway. ‘This is a sadness and a pain I hope no one has to experience,’ Stewart had said in his return to the track on Friday. During a brief news conference, Stewart read a statement that his team said he wrote himself, his voice quivering and eyes glassy. He declined to take questions, saying he couldn't comment while law enforcement was still investigating and wasn't sure he was up to discussing what happened even if he could. While NASCAR requires its drivers to compete in every event to make the playoff, Stewart was granted a waiver that is normally applied to a driver who misses a race for medical reasons . ‘This is something that will definitely affect my life forever,’ Stewart said. ‘That being said, I know that the pain and mourning that Kevin Ward's family and friends are experiencing is something that I can't possibly imagine.’ About the time Stewart was speaking on Friday, authorities in New York said that their probe into Ward's death will last at least two more weeks. No decision has been made into possible charges. While NASCAR requires its drivers to compete in every event to make the playoff, Stewart was granted a waiver that is normally applied to a driver who misses a race for medical reasons. Mike Helton, president of the governing body, said NASCAR made the decision after consulting with third-party experts who ‘were relevant under these circumstances.’ He would not elaborate. ‘We want to join everybody in racing in welcoming Tony back,’ Helton said. ‘He's a great asset to NASCAR. He's a great champion, a great participant in our sport.’ Stewart and his team gathered in a circle and prayed before the driver climbed back into his car on Sunday for the first time after skipping three races . Asked if NASCAR was making the proper decision in giving out a waiver, rival driver Denny Hamlin wavered a bit. ‘It's a very vague thing,’ he said. ‘It's tough to say what's considered medical and not.’ There was no word from Ward's family on Stewart's return. A woman who answered on Friday at the home of Kevin Ward Sr. said the family would not be commenting. During an August 9 sprint-car race in Canandaigua, New York, Stewart and Ward bumped while racing into a turn, sending Ward's car spinning. The 20-year-old climbed from his wrecked machine and wandered onto a darkened track in a black racing suit, clearly wanting to make his displeasure known to the three-time NASCAR champion. One car appeared to swerve to avoid Ward, but he was struck by the back right tire of Stewart's car. The 43-year-old Stewart pulled out of the race at nearby Watkins Glen the next day, and then skipped events at Michigan and Bristol. His team said he needed time to grieve; some wondered if he was feeling guilty, that perhaps a driver known for his short fuse wanted to frighten a young competitor who had the nerve to call him out over a racing crash. Ward Jr climbed from his wrecked machine and wandered onto a darkened track in a black racing suit, center, clearly wanting to make his displeasure known to three-time NASCAR champion Stewart who hit him . ‘I've taken the last couple of weeks off out of respect for Kevin and his family and also to cope with the accident in my own way,’ Stewart said. ‘It's given me the time to think about life and how easy it is to take it for granted. I miss my team, my teammates and I miss being back in the race car, and I think being back in the car this week with my racing family will help me get through this difficult time.’ He mentioned Ward's parents and three sisters by name, saying he wanted them ‘to know that every day I'm thinking about them and praying for them.’ Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Brett Frood said the driver sent flowers and a card to Ward's family around the time of the funeral. He hopes to meet with them at some point. ‘He's been very respectful of them and their time to grieve,’ Frood said. ‘It's important for Tony to spend time with the family. I do think that will happen at the appropriate time.’ In the meantime, it's back to racing. ‘Being in that car,’ Harvick said, ‘cures a lot of problems for a short time.’","Tony Stewart returned to the track on Sunday for the first time since he struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr three weeks ago .

"A couple shared a bittersweet moment this morning when they welcomed the birth of their son Shane, who lived just a few hours before dying in their arms from a rare terminal condition. Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, were devastated when, 13 weeks into the pregnancy, their baby-to-be was diagnosed with a neural tube defect called anencephaly, which is the absence of part of the brain and skull. Despite Shane's slim chances of survival, the devout Catholics decided to make the most of the pregnancy and birth, even compiling a 'bucket list' of activities to complete while he was still in the womb. Tragic: Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, shared a bittersweet moment this morning when they welcomed their son Shane, who lived just a few hours before dying in their arms . Illness: 13 weeks into Jenna's pregnancy, Shane baby-to-be was diagnosed with a neural tube defect called anencephaly, which is the absence of part of the brain and skull . Miraculous: Shane Michael Haley was born on Thursday morning, and his family were all there to meet him and witness him being baptized into the Catholic faith. Four hours after his birth, he died in his mother's arms . Shane Michael Haley was born early on Thursday morning, and his family members were all there to meet him and witness him being baptized into the Catholic faith. But at 6:15am Thursday morning, just four hours after his birth, Shane died 'peacefully in his mother's arms,' according to a post on Facebook. 'Shane spent his entire life in the arms of people that loved him unconditionally, and I don't think you could ask for a more beautiful life then that,' reads the tragic post. 'He is home now with the Lord and will forever be our little miracle!' Proud parents: Even after learning that Shane would likely not survive very long, Dan and Jenna continued to prepare for his birth and celebrate his existence . Have hope: 'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing,' Dan wrote on Facebook prior to Shane's birth . Adventures: The couple even compiled a 'bucket list' of activities to complete while he was still in the womb . The couple shared pictures of Shane's brief life, including one of him being cradled in his mother's arms. In another photo, Shane is surrounded with stuffed animals and blankets, his tiny hands clutching onto a holy Rosary. Babies born with anencephaly, which occurs in one or two of every 10,000 births, have a life expectancy of a few hours to a few days, with a few cases where children have survived for more than a year. For tragic Shane, life was just a few hours, but his parents made sure to celebrate him as much as possible while they could. Arts and crafts: They painted Jenna's baby bump to look like a Jack-o'-lantern, knowing that Shane might never live to celebrate Halloween . Support: The couple documented all their adventures on a Facebook page, Prayers For Shane, where friends were invited to share their support and blessings. It has more than 700,000 'likes' Milestones: Jenna celebrated her first Mother's Day while still pregnant with Shane . Making the most: 'We knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him,' says Dan . As part of their bucket list before Shane was born, Dan and Jenna, who are in their early 20s, took him to baseball games, brought him on a tour of New York City and painted Jenna's baby bump to look like a Jack-o'-lantern. Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. 'We are asking for your prayers and support and that God grants us as much time as possible with our beautiful son,' reads the page. The couple documented all their adventures on a Facebook page, Prayers For Shane, where friends were invited to share their support and blessings. It has more than 700,000 'likes'. 'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing. Follow us through our various adventures as we take Shane to some of our favorite childhood places.' Thousands of people pored out support for Jenna and Dan throughout the pregnancy and birth. One person wrote: 'Please read Psalm 139 - Shane is being knit together in your womb and God makes no mistakes. We were created to glorify Him. Little Shane is doing that. He's being used to cause many people to pray!!!' Others describe instances in which babies have miraculously lived for years despite being born with terminal defects. Dan announced Shane's birth via the Facebook page, writing: 'Baby Shane is here!! .. Mom and Baby are doing well! .. more details and pictures to come!' The post has had more than 115,000 'likes'. Even though Dan and Jenna were not able to share much time with Shane, it's clear they're happy to have made so many memories with him. Family matters: The new parents pose with their newborn son after his birth this morning . Paying tribute: Dan wrote on Facebook: 'He is home now with the Lord and will forever be our little miracle!' 'Most families wait until their baby is born to start making memories and traveling to places with them,' Dan told ABC 13 in September. 'We understood what it was and knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him.'","Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley, both in their early 20s, learned 13 weeks into Jenna's pregnancy that their baby would be born with a rare terminal birth defect .

"A small neighborhood in California have been left anxious and on high alert for an extremely dangerous snake that was let loose in the area. Authorities in Thousand Oaks say they became aware of the exotic animal after one resident, Norma Stull, reported seeing the snake attack her dog. The incident occurred on the 300 block of Rancho Lane on Monday night. Mrs Stull's daughter managed to get a photo of the snake, which has now been identified as an albino monocled cobra. Scroll down for video . On the loose: This photo - taken by a Thousand Oaks resident - shows the albino monocled cobra that is loose in the area . Although he was not bitten, Tiko was rushed to animal hospital with injuries stemming from the attack but has since recovered . Search: L.A. County Animal Control officers have been scouring the neighborhood since Monday in search of the snake . The dog, named Tiko, was taken to an animal hospital in a critical condition with injuries sustained when he tried to escape the attack. L.A. County Animal Control officers have been scouring the neighborhood since in search of the snake. At least five officers were on hand looking in bushes and shrubbery on Wednesday, according to ABC 7. Jules Sylvester, a professional snake wrangler, was also called in by authorities to appease locals. However Mr Sylvester said it would be hard to locate the cobra. 'It's mostly terrestrials, they stand on the ground,' he told ABC 7. 'But you wouldn't want to surprise it.' Residents of the leafy suburb have been warned to keep an eye on their children and be careful in areas they think a snake could hide . However Mr Sylvester said the search had been aided by one important factor. 'The good thing about it: He's pure white, so he'll glow in the dark, almost.' Residents have been told to keep a watchful eye on their children and to use common sense when in areas a snake may hide, such as pipes and under logs. The monocled cobra can be active at any time of day, but officials say it more likely to be seen in cooler times, such as the morning or evening. Anyone who sees the snake has been asked to contact Los Angeles County Agoura Animal Care Center at (818) 991-0071 or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife at (909) 899-0659.","Albino monocled cobra attacked a dog in Thousand Oaks on Monday night .

"A devoted husband is keeping his wife's fading memory alive by reading from the diary he has kept for more than 70 years of their marriage. Jack Potter, 91, visits Phyllis, 93, who suffers from dementia, every day at her care home and shows her photographs and recalls fond memories of their courting days and holidays. The couple's love story is reminiscent of the romantic drama The Notebook. Jack and Phyllis Potter pictured today at the Coppers Beech care home in Rochester, Kent . Jack and Phyllis Potter celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary last weekend - and Mr Potter visits his wife every day to tell her tales from their marriage . In The Notebook, James Garner and Gena Rowlands, right, play a couple in a nursing home where he tells her the story of their relationship, while their younger selves are played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, left . Since Jack Potter met wife Phyllis, he has kept every keepsake in his diary, noting down every dinner, holiday and conversation the couple have shared . Phyllis Potter, in 1947, with her dogs. Her husband Jack likes to show her old photographs to help her memory since she was diagnosed with dementia . In the 2004 film, the character Noah, played by James Garner, tells his wife Allie, played by Gena Rowlands, the tale of how they met, were separated and reunited. Allie, a dementia sufferer, is gripped by the tale - told in flashback with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as their younger selves - and has a brief lucid moment where she realises the story is about her and her husband. The character wrote the story down herself and instructed Noah to read it to her so she would 'come back' to him. In real life, Mr Potter first met Phyllis at a wartime dance - and instantly fell in love. He dashed back to his barracks, while serving as a Royal Engineer, to write in his diary that October 4 1941 was a 'very nice evening. Danced with [a] very nice girl. Hope I meet her again.' The couple married 16 months later and Mr Potter kept on recording their lives together, carrying on the habit he began as a boy. Last weekend the Potters celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary at the care home in Rochester, Kent, and received a card from the Queen. Mr Potter still jots down little things to tell his wife when he visits her. He said: 'I remember it like it was yesterday the first time I met her - she came up to me and asked me to dance. 'She was an excellent dance partner and an older woman - I thought she was wonderful and I still do. 'It was definitely love at first sight, everything fell into place. It was uncanny really.

The marriage certificate showing that Jack and Phyllis Potter married in 1943 - and Mr Potter reads to his wife to remind her of their relationship . 'I remember going home and scribbling down that I had met her in my diary, it sticks in my mind because I suppose it was a life-changing moment.' Mr Potter said: 'We've been together ever since, I wrote down in my diaries all of our stories and our in-jokes. 'We have been together forever, we had no children it was just us two. The couple were presented with flowers and a cake to celebrate the milestone anniversary . 'Phyllis struggles to speak and I will often read to her and chat to her but she struggles to respond. 'I often take the diaries of our time caravanning and show her the pictures, she enjoys that. 'Whenever I turn up to see her she stretches her arms out to hug me - she is very affectionate - despite being so unwell. 'I take her pictures of her dogs she's had in recent years to keep her up to date with everything around her.' After leaving the Army Mr Potter worked in the building trade before retiring in 1982. He and Mrs Potter, who worked as a typist, shared the same house in Rochester for more than 50 years until she moved into the Copper Beeches care home nearby. Mr Potter said: 'We celebrated our 70th wedding anniversary last weekend at the care home. 'I was absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of people there to celebrate with us, I didn't know what to say. 'We usually celebrate our anniversary quietly with a glass of wine and a piece of cake, but they wanted to do something a bit special. 'People always ask what is the secret to success in marriage and I just say what will be will be. 'We never aimed to reach this anniversary, it just came along. 'Our lives have been together and they have been everything a person could ever want. 'Our motto is Que Sera Sera, whatever will be, will be (taken from the Doris Day song in the Alfred Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much).

But today, many of the bargain Blaupunkt TVs have already been placed on eBay and are struggling to get any interest. Lots of Polaroid TVs have also been placed on the auction site, with one writing: 'Black Friday deal polaroid TV in box not been opened. Purchased 29/11/14 from Asda.' Another enterprising punter is even trying to just sell the television box but has attracted no bids so far. The seller has written: 'Empty polaroid 40 inch TV box brand new as from black Friday, complete with polystyrene.'

"A former justice of the peace accused of killing a North Texas district attorney and his wife had a 'treasure trove' of evidence in a storage shed, prosecutors said during opening statements Monday. Eric Williams faces a possible death sentence for the 2013 slayings of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and the prosecutor's wife, Cynthia, at their home in Forney, just east of Dallas. Williams also is charged with fatally shooting assistant prosecutor Mark Hasse two months earlier. Brought to justice: Eric Williams, left, listens to testimony as he sits in court during his capital murder trial at the Rockwall County Courthouse in Rockwall, Texas, on Monday, December 1 . Prosecutor Bill Wirskye told jurors that the storage shed's contents pointed to Williams being the alleged gunman. Wirskye also said 20 rounds were fired inside the McLellands' home in less than two minutes. An investigator provided early testimony on what authorities discovered at the home, where the couple was dead and dressed in their nightwear. Friends reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their home on March 31 2013, having not heard from them in almost 24 hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds. Couple behind bars: Former Justice of the Peace Eric Williams (right) and wife Kim Williams (left) were indicted on three capital murder charges . Caught on camera: An exhibit photo is on display in the courtroom during the capital murder trial of Eric Williams, who faces a possible death penalty . Expert's verdict: Texas Ranger Rudy Flores explains a crime scene photo to the jury . Authorities contend Williams was upset because the prosecutors' office had pursued charges against him in 2012, saying he stole county-owned computer equipment. His subsequent conviction cost him his law license and job. Williams' estranged wife, Kim, is accused of helping him carry out the slayings and is expected to testify against him. The trial was moved from Kaufman County to nearby Rockwall County. Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood told The Dallas Morning News that residents were 'anxiously awaiting' the case. 'People are ready to let justice prevail, so we have put this behind us,' he said. 'Not that we'll forget.' Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March 2013 . Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January 2013 as he walked toward the Kaufman County courthouse for work . Hasse was gunned down in January 2013 as he walked toward the Kaufman County courthouse for work, while the McLellands were gunned down in their home two months later. Authorities allege that Eric Williams was the gunman in both cases. Prosecutors say they have a gun linked to Hasse's death and a mask believed to have been worn by the gunman. The items were found by a dive team in a North Texas lake. Wirskye filed court documents in September alleging that Williams intended to target other law enforcement officials. Defense attorneys have declined to comment on the charges against Williams. Williams practiced law in Kaufman for more than a decade, specializing in family-related cases. He was elected to his judicial post in 2010, but he lost the $53,000-a-year position and his law license when he was convicted of stealing computer monitors. During the highly contentious trial, McLelland and Hasse portrayed Williams as a dishonest public official with a dangerous streak. At sentencing, they presented evidence indicating Williams had made death threats against another local attorney and a former girlfriend. Although the two prosecutors sought prison time for Williams, he ultimately received probation. The murder case is being prosecuted by two Dallas attorneys, Toby Shook and Bill Wirskye. Shook and Wirskye, criminal defense attorneys who both previously served as Dallas County prosecutors, were appointed after Hasse's slaying on McLelland's recommendation. A neighbor told the Dallas Morning News that he knew Williams to be a 'nice guy' who was known in the neighborhood for riding around town in his Segway. Eric Williams' wife, Kim, was arrested at their home in Kaufman, Texas, on a capital murder charge . Search and seizure: Police searched Williams' storage facility in Seagonville, where they found 20 weapons . Once a respected attorney, a justice of the peace and a member of the chamber of commerce, Williams had lost everything following his conviction. Williams could no longer practice law in the state and his peace officer license was revoked, leaving him unemployed and on the brink of financial ruin. Prior to his sentencing, Williams told prison officials that he had taken the computer equipment to test a video system that would allow him to hold hearing online and insisted that he did not steal anything.

Review: Matthew Seymour of the defense looks over exhibit photos as Bill Wirskye, left, holds them . Day one: Prosecutor Bill Wirskye, left, verifies photos from the scene with Charles Tomlinson of the Dallas Police Department . The disgraced lawyer said the case against him had put tremendous stress on his ailing wife and elderly in-laws. One month before Hasse's death, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a warning to authorities statewide that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could retaliate for an October indictment that targeted some of its leaders. McLelland's office was involved in that investigation. In the months after Hasse was killed, McLelland began to carry a gun everywhere and took extra caution when answering his door. He told The Associated Press in an interview shortly before his death that he was warning his employees that they needed to be more cautious as well.","Eric Williams, 46, was charged with killing DA Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia, and ADA Mark Hasse .

"Manchester United have named more homegrown players in their 25-man squad than Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City - despite losing five British first-team players during the summer.

"They have been using Facebook and Twitter to devastating effect - even hijacking people's innocent tweets to spread their message of propaganda. And now social media users are giving ISIS a taste of its own medicine -  by mounting a series of campaigns poking fun at the group. In recent weeks, a wave of tongue-in-cheek virals ridiculing the terrorist organisation have been sweeping across the internet. Scroll down for video . Lee Hurst began the hashtag #AskIslamicState, which thousands of Twitter users had soon employed to poke fun at ISIS . Under the hashtag, one user asked: 'Did you cry when Patrick Swayze died in GHOST?' While some criticise the trends as insensitive, others say it is a way to intimidate the extremist group . Recent attempts to mock the jihadists include the Twitter hashtags #ISISmovies - which saw users come up with spoof film titles ridiculing the group  - and #AskIslamicState, which saw users pose satirical questions to the group in the manner of a political Q&A. As the group continue their brutal offensive, while promoting their actions online - including posting sickening footage of beheadings and crucifixions - some have criticised the humorous take on the group as insensitive. But others say it is a way to fight back at the Islamic State and make a small dent in their overwhelming social media presence. As the #ISISmovies trend swept over Twitter, Libyan-American writer Hend Amry wrote: 'Sometimes, you have to mock, to belittle. Because sometimes, belittlement is your enemy's greatest fear.' The  hashtag #AskIslamicState - which trended last week - was started by comedian Lee Hurst who wrote: '#AskIslamicState When do you expect the Caliphate to be opened up for tourism?' He later tweeted: '#AskIslamicState I'm thinking of visiting, but hate the idea of missing Celebrity Big Brother. Do you show it?' Earlier this month, under #ISISmovies, users re-wrote famous film titles using an Islamic State undertone . 'Return of the Jihadi' (above), based on the Star Wars movie and 'Stoned' (below), the 2005 film about the Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones, were also tweeted by several users to mock the group . The spoof cover of Vogue which surfaced online was poking fun at the group's own magazine . Soon, thousands of Twitter users had joined in with tweets.

She said: 'It is a thrill, a pleasure and a true honour to be voted Waterstones' Book of the Year 2014. 'It's particularly special as the title was chosen by booksellers, and I am indebted to their passion for The Miniaturist and their desire to spread the word to readers. 'It's all any writer could wish for. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Waterstones has played a large part in changing my life and I will always be grateful for this incredible award.'

"Police have arrested three people for the kidnapping, rape and torture of an Ohio woman who was found clinging to life on the side of a highway. Celeste Fronsman, 29, died two days after she was discovered by a passing motorist, and now two women and one man are being held in Stark County jail for the crime. LaFonse Darney Dixon, 33, and Monica Jean Washington, 24, were charged with aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggrevated arson on Tuesday. The third attacker, Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, was arrested for the same charges last week. Police have yet to explain why they believe these three people were involved or what, if any, relation they have to the victim. Makeshift memorial: A cross has been erected at the rural Ohio site Celeste Fronsman, 29, (right) was found screaming for help after being kidnapped, tortured, raped and left for dead . 'It's just too sensitive a case right now to divulge any information,' Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz told The Columbus Dispatch. The authorities have revealed that they believe Fronsman was only spotted by a motorist after she had crawled about 1,500 feet from the crime scene to the road. At the time, she was so badly burned that the motorist didn't even know if she was a human being. Doctors determined she had second, third and fourth degree burns over 80 per cent of her body. The only facts known about the three suspects is that they- as well as the victim- have a long list of prior offenses. Two of the three: Monica Jean Washington (left) and LaFonse Darney Dixon (right) were both charged with aggravated kidnapping and murder on Tuesday . Culberson, who was the first to be arrested, has at least six prior charges to her name in the last two years. Those charges include soliciting for prostitution, theft and burglary. In the prostitution case, Culberson pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two months in jail. Charged: Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, was arrested with the same charges last week . As for the newly-arrested suspects, Washington was arrested twice for disorderly conduct, and Dixon has drug possession, felony endangerment of children. Police records received by MailOnline show that Ms Fronsman had an extensive criminal history, including a rap sheet with 25 arrests over the past nine years. Since 2003, she was arrested for a plethora of crimes including prostitution, drug possession and five counts of domestic violence. Her most recent arrest occurred on May 28 for having drug paraphernalia. Her sister, Sarah Gulosh, told the Zanesville Times Recorder that despite her trouble with the law, Fronsman was a loving mother and a good sister and never failed to tell her grandparents how much she loved them. 'She was a good person,' she said, adding that Fronsman had a heart of gold. Gulosh said her sister was left tortured by the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Jordyn, in 2005, and the death of her mother in 2009. 'We always told her she needed to stop what she was doing and ask God for forgiveness,' Gulosh said. 'But she loved God, and she told us she had asked him for forgiveness.' Desolate: The victim was found by a truck driver on this stretch of Keyes Road in Muskingum County . Horrific end: Celeste Fronsman, pictured after . two separate arrests, was found by an unnamed truck driver naked and . covered in burns . Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators . Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly. The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning. 'This is a vicious animal. They ought to be taken off the street and put away,' he said. The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite. 'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said. 'I can't imagine the pain that this lady went through.'

"The billionaire owner of the Indianapolis Colts has been fined $500,000 and suspended for six games by the National Football League after pleading guilty today to driving under the influence of prescription drugs. Jim Irsay was sentenced to one year of probation by a judge in Hamilton County, Indiana, and must undergo random drug tests. Police arrested him near his home in Carmel, Indiana, in March after pulling him over when they spotted his car swerving in the road. According to a police report, he was so high on oxycodone and hydrocodone that he fell over when he tried to stand and could not recite the alphabet - telling a cop that I-N-G came after the letter Z. Guilty: Jim Irsay pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was given one year of probation and a suspended jail sentence on Tuesday . Officers also found numerous bottles of prescription pills and $29,000 cash stuffed into a leather briefcase and a laundry bag. The 55-year-old NFL was initially charged with four counts of possession of a controlled substance, felonies that carry up to three years in prison each. However, Hamilton County prosecutors eventually dropped those charges and pursued a single count of driving while intoxicated. Irsay couldn't even recite the alphabet when he was arrested, police say . Andre Miksha, chief deputy prosecutor for Hamilton County, said after months of investigation, authorities determined that Irsay had a prescription for all the pills cops found in his car. Irsay, worth an estimated $1.6billion, was today sentenced to one year of probation. He must stay away from drugs and alcohol and will be drug tested during his probation. He will also have to attend a 'victim impact panel' about the dangers of drunk driving. After Irsay entered his guilty plea, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Irsay would be suspended for six games and fined a half million dollars. 'I have stated on numerous occasions that owners, management personnel and coaches must be held to a higher standard than players,' Goodell said in a statement. Irsay also issued a statement after the ruling, calling his addiction to prescription pills 'a disease' that must be treated by 'understanding, committed hard work, and spiritual growth.' 'I acknowledge the mistake I made last March and stand responsible for the consequences of that mistake, for which I sincerely apologize to our community and to Colts fans everywhere,' he said. Shortly after his arrest, Irsay left Indiana for a stay at an in-patient drug treatment facility, the Indianapolis Star reports. During his suspension, Irsay may not visit the stadium or any other Colts facility, he is not allowed to attend practices or games and may not promote or represent the team on social media or at events. Irsay, seen here on an episode of the hit TV show 'Parks and Recreation' with Amy Poehler, inherited the Colts from his father .","Jim Irsay was arrested in March so high on oxycodone and hydrocodon that he couldn't recite the alphabet, police say .

"Senseless: 'True gent' Luke Fitzpatrick was stabbed to death after a hooded gang stormed a north london pub on Saturday . A gang of 20 hooded youths stormed a pub after the Champions League final before dragging away a 25-year old man and stabbing him to death in scenes 'like a horror film', friends said today. 'True gent' Luke Fitzpatrick was killed and his father Bernard, who threw himself on top of his son in a desperate attempt to shield him, remains in a critical condition in hospital after being stabbed four times. The pair were attacked when a gang armed with bats and knives stormed the north London pub after father and son had watched Chelsea win the cup together at on Saturday. A forensic tent remained at the scene of the tragedy just yards from the pub near his Dollis Hill home. A female friend, 22, who asked not be named, said: 'Luke was one of the nicest guys around, always looking after people, he actually cared about people, a really nice, funny guy. 'The amount of flowers that are here just shows how loved he was, this has ruined this community. 'I was there on Saturday and it was like something out of a horror film. 'There were about 20 young black guys all with their hoods up armed with sticks and bats and knives. They just ran in the pub and started trying to attack people. 'It was really frightening. But it should not have happened to Luke, it shouldn’t have happened to anyone, but he was a complete innocent.' His mother Constance, 56, and brother Ryan, 21, were in Majorca and had to rush home. Scene of the tragedy: The Ox and Gate pub in Dollis Hill, north London, where the gang began the attack that ended in the murder of Luke Fitzpatrick . Forensic team: Police comb the area for any evidence that might help convict the mob who attacked Luke and father Bernard . Bernard, 56, is out of intensive care and has mumbled a few words but is not fully conscious, Miss McKeon said. She added: 'He was just watching the football, but it had nothing to do with the game - Luke was an Arsenal fan. 'Everyone in the pub knows each other, we all grew up together, we are a really close community. 'It was such a good atmosphere in the pub then within a minute it was changed by a minority just looking for trouble. 'A couple of them had tried to start an argument with someone in the shop about two hours before this happened, but it was nothing to do with Luke. 'Then they rounded all their mates up and stormed the pub. I didn’t see exactly what happened to Luke, but at 17 why have they got knives? It is disgusting. He was a true gent.' Three people including two 17-year-olds were arrested and have since been bailed. Today a fourth man remained in custody after being arrested an address in Wembley yesterday. The gang of youths often hung around the shops where the argument took place and three weeks ago an elderly man had been punched in the face as he got off a bus, she said. Luke’s best friend, Ricci Whiteside, 25, said: 'There was an argument in the shop opposite the pub at half-time. Life and soul: The community in Dollis Hill, north London, has been devastated by the brutal murder of popular Luke Fitzpatrick, with his father Bernard still in a critical condition after trying to protect his son . 'Luke wasn’t anything to do with it, but we all heard that something had gone on. 'A group of black guys arrived at the door of the pub with bats and knives and they were looking for someone who had been outside the shop earlier. 'People were throwing chairs at the door to try and stop them from coming in. 'There was a lot of confusion. They got Luke and dragged him outside. They were pulling him up the road. 'His dad was running after them. But by the time he got to Luke he was already on the floor. Bernie threw himself on top of Luke. He was trying to protect him, but it was too late.” Tess Fitzpatrick, Bernard’s sister, said: 'The men who came for Luke were like a pack of wolves. My brother ran after them as they were dragging Luke up the street. 'He covered him with his body, but they had already stabbed Luke all over.' Pal of the roofer Michael O’Rourke, 25, added: 'There is not one person who would say one bad word about him, he was one of the most loved people here. 'He had never done a bad thing in his life but he can’t even go to the pub with his dad and have a pint without getting murdered. Luke was just the nicest guy you could imagine, an absolute gent. 'Bad things happen to good people. None of the scum bags who did this could ever live up to our friend. It is heartbreaking, absolutely heartbreaking.'","20 hooded youths stormed pub with knives 'like a pack of wolves'

"Brett Cayzer, 52, has been banned from carrying bricks by magistrates after drunkenly attacking a police station and emergency cars . A man who smashed up a police station and three emergency vehicles in a drunken rampage has been banned from carrying bricks by magistrates. The bizarre criminal behaviour order, a new form of Asbo, has been handed to Brett Cayzer, 52, after he wrecked three 999 vehicles - just three days after facing court for attacking a police station. Cayzer hurled two bricks through glass partitions at the police base in Ipswich, Suffolk, but was given a conditional discharge on Monday November 24. But, just three days after that hearing, he then used another brick to smash the windows and wing mirrors of two police cars and a paramedic's rapid response vehicle. He said later that he'd only targeted the medical emergency vehicle because he thought it was a police car, South East Suffolk magistrates' court, Ipswich, heard. Ian Devine, prosecuting, said that shortly after midnight on Thursday police and a paramedic were treating a victim of an assault in the town when Cayzer bricked their vehicles. He told officers after discovering that one of his vendetta targets belonged to the ambulance service: 'The reason I smashed them was because they were police vehicles. 'I didn't actually realise it was a paramedic's car otherwise I wouldn't have touched it. 'I thought it was a police car.' Mr Devine said Cayzer was drunk both when he smashed up the emergency service vehicles and the police station on November 6. Sue Threadkell, defending, said he bitterly resented police after they upset him as he cared for his elderly dementia-stricken mother. She said Cayzer had gone to get fish and chips for her lunch one day when an officer spotted him and wanted to talk to him. The serial offender asked to go home first to make sure his forgetful mother would not wander off, said Mrs Threadkell.

Cayzer trashed three 999 vehicles - just three days after facing court for attacking a police station . But he said the policeman took Cayzer straight to the police station instead. Mrs Threadkell said: 'He wanted to go home to ensure the door was locked but that wasn't done and that made him bear a grudge.' Cayzer's seriously ill mother died five weeks ago, magistrates heard. The former continental lorry driver is now homeless because he left his bedsit to move into his mother's rented bungalow in Ipswich. 'When his mother passed away he wasn't entitled to remain in the accommodation and because he had given up his flat to care for his mother he had made himself intentionally homeless so he ended up on the streets,' added Mrs Threadkell. Magistrates jailed Cayzer, who admitted criminal damage, for 18 weeks.He was also made subject to a criminal behaviour order which bans him carrying bricks or open containers of alcohol in Ipswich .

Ipswich-based Ch Insp Steve Denham, of Suffolk Police, slammed Cayzer after the case as he branded him 'senseless'. He said: 'This behaviour towards the police is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. 'Not only have his senseless actions affected the police officers present but have also had a major impact on equipment, services and police time, which could have been used dealing with other community issues.'","Brett Cayzer, 52, trashed three 999 vehicles - just three days after he faced court for attacking a police station in Ipswich, Suffolk .

"Boss: BG Group had been planning to pay chief executive Helge Lund (above) a £12million 'golden hello' on top of his annual pay of up to £13million . The major energy firm which proposed a £25million pay package for its new boss has scaled back the deal following shareholder outrage – to around £18million. BG Group had been planning to pay chief executive Helge Lund a £12million ‘golden hello’ on top of his annual pay of up to £13million. But following mounting criticism and the prospect of a revolt over the deal, the firm has been forced to cut this back. Because of new targets tied to the firm’s financial performance against industry peers such as BP and Shell, the company estimates that he will now receive around £4.7million from the welcome package instead of £12million. A vote on the deal, which had been planned for two weeks’ time, has also been scrapped because the new package is in keeping with the company’s existing pay rules. Had the vote gone ahead, it was likely the company would have suffered an embarrassing defeat. Four of its largest investors had criticised the deal publicly, with several major pension advisory groups also coming out against it. ‘The board should never have put shareholders in this position,’ said Martin Gilbert, chief executive of fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management – one of BG’s top ten investors. ‘We were very surprised the board chose to give him these awards in the first place.’ Pressure is now increasing on the company’s pay chief, Sir John Hood, to step down. Sir John, the former Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, concocted the original pay package. He gets £153,000 a year for his part-time role, which includes leading the remuneration committee. BG has admitted it used ‘expert’ pay consultants when setting pay levels, but a source added: ‘The remuneration committee is ultimately responsible for pay matters, including this package.’ Major energy firm: BG Group proposed a £25million pay package for its new boss, but has scaled back the deal following shareholder outrage - to around £18million . BG, which was demerged from British Gas in 1997, admitted it had been forced into the decision. A statement said: ‘The board believes that Mr Lund is an exceptional candidate. 'However, a significant number of shareholders questioned the structure of the package. Both the board and Mr Lund recognise and wish to respond to shareholder concerns.’ BG was previously accused of ‘blackmail’ by shareholders after warning that Mr Lund was not obliged to join the firm if investors did not support the £12million package. Yesterday it confirmed that he would be joining, despite his awards being scaled back. The move was widely welcomed by business leaders who had previously criticised the pay deal. The Institute of Directors applauded the climbdown after describing the initial package as ‘excessive and inflammatory’. Simon Walker, the IoD’s director general, said: ‘While substantial, the total remuneration now falls within proper limits for a company of BG’s size and international importance.'","Energy firm BG Group was planning to pay new CEO Helge Lund £12m .

Germany's Chancelleor Merkel has promised Jewish and Muslim communities that they will be free to carry out circumcision on young boys despite a court ban.

European rabbis descended on Berlin this . week to lobby against what they see as an affront to religious freedom - . with the backing of Muslim and Christian leaders in an unusual show of . unity, as well as the support of many German politicians. A spokesman for the chancellor said: . 'For everyone in the government it is absolutely clear that we want to . have Jewish and Muslim religious life in Germany. 'Circumcision carried out in a responsible manner must be possible in this country without punishment.' Scroll down for video . President of the Conference of European Rabbis, Pinchas Goldschmidt (right), has furiously condemned the decision by a German court to ban circumcision . Ruling in the case of a Muslim boy . taken to a doctor with bleeding after circumcision, the Cologne court . said the practice inflicts bodily harm and should not be carried out on . young boys, but could be practiced on older males who give consent. This is not acceptable under Jewish . religious practice which requires boys to be circumcised from eight days . old, nor for many Muslims, for whom the age of circumcision varies . according to family, country and branch of Islam. 'It is well know that in the Jewish . religion early circumcision carries great meaning, so it is a matter of . urgency that this right be restored,' said Seibert, adding that Merkel's . own office would be involved in efforts to resolve the problem. 'We know a quick decision is needed . and that this cannot be put off. Freedom of religious practice is a very . important legal right for us,' he said. Germany is a close ally of Israel and . its ambassador there has promised parliament's Diaspora Affairs . Committee to defend the rights of Germany's growing Jewish community. The father of a baby boy reads a prayer before giving the Mohel the blade for a circumcision . European rabbis ended their meeting in . Berlin on Thursday in a defiant mood. They plan talks with German . Muslim and Christian leaders in Stuttgart next week to see how they can . fight the ban together. The ruling by the Cologne Regional . Court applies to the city and surrounding districts with a total . population of just over 2 million people. The total population of . Germany is about 82 million. Cologne is home to about 120,000 Muslims, . whose plans for a new central mosque has stirred anti-immigrant . sentiment. The head of the Conference of European Rabbis urged Jews in Germany to continue carrying out circumcision despite the ban. But the German Medical Association, . while opposing the ban because it could drive circumcision underground . with greater risk of infection through poor hygiene, advised doctors not . to carry out the operation until the legal situation is cleared up as . they could risk prosecution. Pinchas Goldschmidt, the Swiss-born . chief rabbi of Moscow who organized the meeting, said the ban was a . fresh example of creeping prejudice in European law against . non-Christians, after a Swiss ban on minarets, French and Belgian bans . on Islamic veils in public and an attempted Dutch ban on halal meat. 'Circumcision represents the basis for . belonging to the Jewish community. It has been practiced for 4,000 . years and cannot be changed,' said Goldschmidt. Germany is home to about 120,000 Jews . and 4 million Muslims. Many of the latter originating from Turkey, which . has also condemned last month's court ruling.

"Irish artist Duncan Campbell has been named winner of this year’s Turner Prize for a video that tackles African art and colonialism. Mr Campell’s video, ‘It for Others’, was inspired by a 1953 documentary about African art, featuring a dance sequence created with choreographer Michael Clark. However his £25,000 win comes following criticism this year’s nominees have turned the event into one that is ‘sober, respectful, polite, middle aged’ and lacks the fun and excitement of previous entries. Irish artist Duncan Campbell has been named winner of this year’s Turner Prize for a video that tackles African art and colonialism but there is criticism the event has become ‘sober, respectful, polite, middle aged’ Mr Campell’s video, ‘It for Others’, was inspired by a 1953 documentary about African art, featuring a dance sequence created with choreographer Michael Clark . Speaking to the Today programme yesterday, the BBC’s Arts Editor Will Gompertz said: ‘I think actually it’s quite a weak year. I have to say I don’t think it’s a classic year.’ He said this year’s shortlist of three videos and one instillation featuring different prints, was tame comparied to the controversey stoked by artists such as Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. He said: ‘The Turner Prize has been going for 30 years and it’s well beyond it’s rebellious, anti-establishment, attention-seeking attitude of its teenage years – the Damien Hirsts and the formaldehyde cows and Tracey Emin’s bed and Martin Creed’s lights going on and off. ‘All that fun and games has gone, and it’s a much more sober, respectful, polite, middle aged prize. And it is full of introspection and frankly it isn’t quite as exciting.’ Ciara Phillips's 'Things Shared', 2014, during the press preview of the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain, London.

Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. In 1999 Emin won the prize for My Bed, which featured stained sheets surrounded by cigarette butts and condoms. Four years earlier Hirst’s winning entry included a cow and a calf cut in half and preserved in formaldehyde. Damien Hirst’s winning 1995 entry included a cow and a calf cut in half and preserved in formaldehyde . Winners have also included Grayson Perry’s pots tackling subjects like death and child abuse, and Martin Creed’s work featuring a light going on and off . Mr Campbell was presented with his award by 12 Years a Slave actor Chiwetel Ejiofor at a ceremony at the Tate Britain in London last night. Accepting his prize, Mr Campbell dedicated his win to his family including his parents and son. The artist joked: ‘A friend of mine was reminding me recently about the poet W B Yeats, who, when a journalist phoned him to tell him about to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first question he asked was “how much?”. 'I already know how much. This money will make a huge difference to me.’ In 1999 Emin won the prize for My Bed, which featured stained sheets surrounded by cigarette butts and condoms . Previous winner artist Grayson Perry and his artwork 'Pot 1 - Mr Sh*t Sex' Other artists to be shortlisted for this year’s prize included James Richards for his video featuring censored, erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library. The Turner Prize 2014 exhibition runs to January 4 at Tate Britain in central London. Work by the nominees has been on show at the gallery since late September. Duncan Campbell, 41, was born in Dublin, and studied at the University of Ulster, Belfast. The film-artist now lives in Glasgow, where he graduated from the Glasgow School of Art as a Master of Fine Art. Campbell is the fourth graduate from the university to have won the Turner Prize in the last 10 years. Accepting the prize, Campbell paid tribute to his family, including his parents Paddy and Veronica, who watched the ceremony. He also spoke of his son, who was not able to be there.","Iriah Artist Duncan Campell’s video, ‘It for Others’, took top prize .

"Dozens of women were abandoned unconscious in a field after being sterilised at a rural health centre in India. Two doctors carried 106 sterilisation operations in a single day at government-run Manikchak Rural Hospital in West Bengal as part of mass 'health drive'. The patients should have been kept under observation for at least three hours, but with only 30 beds at the hospital reserved for women, they were left on the pavement with no medical assistance or protection against infections. Scroll down for video . As many as 110 women were dumped on an open field for hours after a mass sterilisation programme in West Bengal's Malda district . The doctors at the government-run hospital are now under investigation and at least one health officer has been suspended. The ill-equipped hospital has a total of 60 beds, only half of these are available to women, the rest to men. The hospital's two doctors - Dr Amal Krishna Pal and Dr Joydip Majumder - carried out the procedures on over 100 women with the help of a gynaecologist, Dr Purnendu Rang, who was called from the nearby Ratua rural healthcare centre. The sterilisation drive broke a number of rules regarding health and safety procedures, drastically overstepping the limit of 25 sterilisations per day and ignoring the three hours of observation. After the surgical procedure, the doctors asked the helpers to move every patient to the adjacent field, a majority of the women were still unconscious. Disgrace: The image show women lying in a field outside the hospital with no medical aids and with only their relatives to help . The patients were carried out and casually dumped under the open sky in the hands of their relatives. Unable to bear the pain in the absence of proper care, some of them fainted. Many of the patients were sent off on rickshaws, though they were not in a state to make any journey. A district health official said the hospital has no ambulance. 'We all know there is a severe risk of morbidity during sterilisation and the question whether this has been taken care of or not,' health activist Ratnaboli Ray told NDTV. One of the patients, Pinki Mondal of north Chandipur village, fell off the rickshaw as it collided with a matador. She was rushed back to the centre with critical injuries and was referred to the district hospital. Risk: The images from NDTV show an unconscious woman being lifted onto a blanket outside the hospital after her surgery . No care: Hospital workers have lifter a woman off a stretcher and are placing her on the pavement, leaving her unaided post-surgery . Local health officials acknowledged that the patients' treatment was shockingly insufficient, and a full report has been requested from the hospital. Malda's chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Bidhan Mishra, said: 'We have come to know about the incident. It is not acceptable. We have ordered an inquiry and asked the hospital authorities to submit the report in the next 48 hours.' Mishra, however, claimed that the Manikchak health centre has six doctors, including Dr Rang. Bengal's women and child development minister Sabitri Mitra, who is also the local MLA, said: 'This irresponsible act will not be tolerated. The CMOH is looking into it and necessary action would be taken.' Mitra said a section of doctors were deliberately trying to malign the government's image.","As many as 106 women were sterilised in a single day in a Bengal hospital .

"Education Secretary Michael Gove last night stepped into a bitter race row raging over an inner-city school’s plan to open its own boarding school in an affluent rural area. The top-performing Durand Academy in Stockwell, near Brixton, South London, wants to transport 600 youngsters to a site with stunning views over the South Downs every Monday morning for lessons and bring them back on Friday  evenings, free of charge. It says the scheme will provide them with ‘an Eton-style experience’ and help keep pupils safe from drugs and knife crime. Row: A disused school in the town of Stedham, West Sussex, is earmarked to be filled with boarders from London's Durand Academy, causing fury among residents who fear an influx of ethnic pupils will cause social problems . Apple of his eye: The academy, in Stockwell, is one of the best in London and is a favourite of education secretary Michael Gove . But the plan has been fiercely criticised by people living near the site – a disused boarding school in  the quiet village of Stedham, West Sussex. They have raised concerns about the number of black and Asian students and claimed that youngsters would need to be searched daily for drugs and weapons. They have also accused Durand’s ‘super-head’ Greg Martin – who  has been described as a ‘hero’ by  Mr Gove – of ‘spoiling a tranquil place’ by ‘bringing Brixton to the countryside’. But last night Mr Gove's spokesman hit back and attacked those ‘trying to obstruct an inspirational project’. His intervention came after a local Tory county councillor expressed fears about the number of ethnic minority students who would attend the school. John Cherry, 73, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Ninety-seven per cent of pupils will be black or Asian. It depends what type of Asian. If they’re Chinese they’ll rise to  the top. If they’re Indian they’ll  rise to the top. If they’re Pakistani they won’t. ‘There are certain nationalities where hard work is highly valued. There are certain nationalities where they are uncertain what this hard work is all about. ‘If the children are not allowed out of the site then it will make them want to escape into the forest – it will be a sexual volcano. ‘Has anyone asked whether these children want to be plucked from their natural surroundings? They have never done boarding before, so they won’t know how it works. Shock: Durand Academy chief Greg Martin has described the attitude of residents as 'shocking' but has vowed to press on with the scheme . ‘The trauma of taking the children out of their natural surroundings is going to be considerable.’ He added: ‘Stockwell is a coloured area – I have no problem with  that. To be honest, I would far rather Durand took over a secondary school in London rather than  shoving everybody here.’ Anne Reynolds, chairman of a  steering group which has been set up in the area to fight the plans, also questioned whether inner-city children would feel comfortable in such a rural environment. She said: ‘It might raise tensions in their community. Their peers might say, “Why have you been chosen to go to a special, smart school in West Sussex but I haven’t?” ‘The whole thing is a massive experiment and I think it will be  disastrous. There’s no evidence it will increase their attainment  levels. When you’re a teenager, isn’t it too late to start appreciating the countryside? I don’t know if it’s the right environment.’ At a public meeting in the nearby village of Milland, where actor Hugh Bonneville has a home, one unnamed resident said: ‘You must be wary because you are talking about students who will have to be searched daily for weapons and knives.’ Chichester MP Andrew Tyrie is also ‘extremely unhappy’ with the way the project has been handled and has written to Mr Gove asking him to rethink the idea. Mr Martin, Durand’s director  of education, last night described some of the comments from residents as ‘shocking’ but vowed to press on with the scheme. It is  hoped the boarding school will open next year. He said: I’ve heard a few comments made about pupils escaping and I said I’m not building a prison. ‘It’s sad but it makes us want to fight harder for it, and when this councillor sees the hard work and commitment from ethnic minorities I’m sure he will change his tune. ‘At the moment, so many children are leaving our school well educated only to be utterly failed by the secondary system. ‘We want to get pupils away  from hanging around the streets of Brixton and Stockwell, where we have stabbings and a constant threat of trouble. It will be very hard to maintain a negative view when you see students working hard and contributing. You will soon realise these are frankly nothing more than baseless prejudices.’ A spokesman for Mr Gove said: ‘Durand has a superb record of helping some of our most disadvantaged pupils achieve brilliant results thanks to a rigorous curriculum, great teaching and sky-high expectations for all pupils. ‘Durand’s boarding school is a bold experiment and a chance to give inner-city youngsters a truly world-class education.’ And leading black Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng urged locals  to drop their opposition to the plan. Mr Kwarteng, whose parents came to Britain from Ghana and who was educated at Eton, said: ‘This school is a very good idea. ‘Obviously, the locals will have some concerns about it, but we have to give these children the chance to get a good education and a well-run boarding school in the English countryside is a perfect way to do that. Opposition: Local Tory councillor John Cherry is aghast at Durand's plans to move to West Sussex . ‘If the school is a success, as I am sure it will be, it will be a great credit to the pupils, teachers and the local community itself. When that happens everyone will wonder what all the fuss was about.’ Durand is a primary school that has been rated as outstanding by schools watchdog Ofsted. But staff and governors are so concerned  about standards at local secondary schools that they used the proceeds from Durand’s leisure and student accommodation business to buy St Cuthman’s School, a Grade II listed building, for £3.4 million in 2010. They want to open it as a boarding school for pupils aged 13 to 19. Mr Martin has said the idea stemmed from a desire to keep youngsters away from the ‘stabbings and constant threat of trouble’ in South London. It secured a £17 million handout from the Government to help finance the project. As an academy, Durand is outside local authority control, meaning it runs its own budgets and can even change the length of terms and the school day. St Cuthman’s, which occupies 20 acres in an area of outstanding natural beauty, used to be run by the local county council for children with special needs but closed in 2004 and has remained empty since. At his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference in 2011, Mr Gove backed the idea of opening the boarding school. He also praised Mr Martin as a ‘hero’ after for transforming Durand.","Top-performing Durand Academy in Stockwell wants to open boarding school in Stedham, West Sussex .

"Tess and Chris Giddings knew when they started a family they would be making an inevitable contribution to multicultural Britain. What they didn’t expect was that they’d start their own melting pot. For the children produced by the blue-eyed blonde and her black-skinned husband cover just about every spectrum of the inter-racial rainbow. Melting pot: Chris and Tess Giddings with, from left, Jacob, Amiah, Savannah and Zion . Or, as Chris proudly describes it: ‘We’re like a box of chocolates – dark ones, brown ones and white ones.’ The couple’s remarkable brood includes a daughter who shares mum’s fair skin and eye colour; her golden complexioned sister; their olive-skinned big brother; and the latest arrival, a button-nosed, black baby boy who looks just like dad. Precisely how they ended up with four such different children is doubtless of great interest to geneticists, but it came as a surprise to Tess, a former model, and Chris, a store supervisor. At one stage they even wondered whether daughter Amiah, the palest on the Giddings family colour chart, might have been switched at birth with another child at Colchester General Hospital. Yet the couple’s attitude to  rainbow family life is refreshingly black and white. ‘We couldn’t care less what colour they are,’ said Tess, 24. ‘They are  a great joy to us and we couldn’t  be happier.’ Dark-skinned Zion (left) is just like his father while Amiah (right) has taken after her mother . After their first child, Jacob, now six, was born at Southend General Hospital in Essex, Tess and Chris, from Colchester, watched him develop into a perfect blend of his parents – with olive skin, blue eyes, and soft, curly brown hair. Savannah, now four, was born at the same hospital and looked almost identical to her big brother as a baby, but is growing up with slightly paler skin and lighter hair. Then along came Amiah. ‘When she was born we only got a quick glimpse of her because her blood sugar level was so low, and she was whisked away for treatment before a wristband could be put  on her,’ said Tess. ‘When she came back an hour  or so later, and I got a proper  look at her, I couldn’t believe how white she was. ‘I said to Chris: “Do you think they’ve given us the wrong baby?” Chris never for one moment thought I’d cheated on him. He was my first boyfriend, we’re happily married and there was never any doubt about that. 'It's so nice having children who are all a bit different. They are all gorgeous and we love them all the same', said Tess Giddings . ‘The question was: was she switched? We knew it was unlikely but you do hear about it. ‘People kept coming up to me in the street asking if my children had different fathers. I’d never ask anyone that, but people were very blatant.’ To rule out any doubt about a hospital mix-up, the couple agreed to a DNA test. It proved Amiah was 100 per cent Giddings. But baby Zion was about to make the mix even more diverse. He was born a year ago with dark skin, black curly hair and brown eyes. ‘When we first saw him, Chris nearly fell over,’ said Tess. ‘He took one look at him in the delivery room and said: “Oh my god, he’s black!” The midwife just stared at him in astonishment and said: “You do know you’re a black man, don’t you?” ‘We were laughing and Chris said: “You don’t understand – I have one child who is completely white!”.’ Chris, 33, was born in Britain two years after his parents emigrated from Nairobi, Kenya. Tess said: ‘Zion has got darker and is the only one with brown eyes. He has completely got Chris’s genes, whereas Amiah has got whiter. She has straight, blonde hair and light blue eyes. ‘It’s so nice having children  who are all a bit different. They  are all gorgeous and we love them all the same.’ Aside from an occasional raised eyebrow, the family has never encountered racism. ‘Thankfully, most people are  colour blind these days,’ added Tess. ‘Our children are living proof of that.’ It is unusual for children with the same parents to have dramatically different skin colours, but – as the Giddings family prove – it’s far from impossible. Several different genes control skin colour, in a similar way to eye and hair colour. Each child gets half of their genes from each parent. A black person can possess one or two genes for lighter skin, while a white person may have some for darker skin. A child’s skin colour will depend on which combination it inherits – and in siblings whose parents have both dark and light gene variants, the results can be dramatically different. Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, said: ‘People think it is a black and white issue, but this case shows it clearly isn’t. Although it is unusual, it happens perhaps more than people think. ‘There is no single gene  that determines skin colour, but ten or so. It is luck which mixture a child gets.’ A spokesman for the British Society for Human Genetics added: ‘Like many human traits, skin colour is influenced by several different genes. ‘If both parents have a combination of “light skin” and “dark skin” gene variants, then their children can have a skin colour anywhere in between, depending on which combination of variants they receive.’","Tess and Chris Giddings have four children that cover just about every spectrum of the inter-racial rainbow .

"Five members of Francois Hollande's personal staff have lost their jobs after photos were taken of the president and his 'secret' lover at the Elysee Palace. The French president ordered the transfer of the officials following the publication of the hugely embarrassing images in gossip magazine Voici. Taken last month, they showed the 60-year-old Socialist with Julie Gayet, the 42-year-old TV actress. Sarkozy spies? Francois Hollande, left, transferred five staff members after pictures were leaked of him and his girlfriend at the Elysee Palace. Four were originally appointed by his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, right . Their long-term affair was uncovered in January, leading to Valerie Trieweiler, Mr Holland's 'official' girlfriend being kicked out of the Elysee Palace. She suffered a brief nervous breakdown, and then went on to write a lucrative kiss-and-tell book which she was promoting in Britain last week. Ms Gayet, a divorced mother of two, disappeared from public view for months, but the blurry photographers of her on a private terrace of the Elysee with Mr Hollande appeared last week. The French presidency today confirmed that five members of Mr Hollande's presidential staff were being sent to different jobs away from his 'private service.' There was no possibility of paparazzi having got into the highly secure presidential home in Paris, prompting the speculation that the pictures were taken by staff. 'Five were immediately placed in the frame, and they are the ones who have been moved on to other duties,' said a governmental source in Paris. He said investigators did not know the exact person who had taken the snaps, so all five were 'being let go'. To add a further twist to the soap opera, four were originally appointed to their prestigious jobs by Nicolas Sarkozy, the former conservative president. He is desperate to retake the presidency from Mr Hollande, leading to speculation that he had engineered the latest drama to embarrass his detested rival. The photos – which are thought to have been taken with a simple phone camera – were distributed by an agency with close links to Mr Sarkozy's third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni. Sour grapes: Valerie Trieweiler, left. Mr Hollande's 'official' girlfriend until the affair with Julie Gayet, right, was revealed, has published a new book which portrays her ex as a cheating liar who hates the poor . The images of Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet were the first ever of them in public together, and appeared as Ms Trierweiler portrayed the president as a cheating liar. Not only did she say he was a cynical love cheat, but insisted he was a hypocritical Socialist who secretly despises the poor and refers to them as 'the toothless'. Ms Trierweiler's best-selling book, 'Thank You For This Moment', has been translated into 12 languages and has just come out in the UK. It is likely to end any hope Mr Hollande has of retaining the presidency following the 2017 elections. His current approval rating is less than 13 per cent.","Smartphone pictures showed president at the Elysee with his girlfriend .

"The treatment of a 16-year-old girl who was kept in a police cell due to a lack of mental health beds has been called ‘unacceptable’ and ‘appalling’. Over the weekend, a senior police officer disclosed how the schoolgirl had spent two nights in custody because there were no beds in NHS facilities anywhere in the UK. And last night, Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘It’s appalling that any patient should be taken into police custody due to a lack of mental health beds. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘It’s appalling that any patient should be taken into police custody due to a lack of mental health beds . ‘It’s particularly unacceptable that it should happen to a 16-year-old. The severe pressures on mental health services are leading to shocking situations across the country.’ He said that over the last four years there had been a drop of 1,500 mental health beds and 3,300 specialist nurses, despite the number of patients requiring care increasing by 30 per cent. He added: ‘These cutbacks are having a devastating impact on those who desperately need care and support. It’s a terrible indictment of this country’s inadequate mental health provision.’ Over the weekend, a senior police officer disclosed how the schoolgirl had spent two nights in custody because there were no beds in NHS facilities anywhere in the UK. File picture . Paul Netherton, assistant chief constable at Devon and Cornwall Police, had taken to Twitter to reveal that the girl had been held in a cell since Thursday, and added: ‘The 16-year-old was detained on Thursday night, sectioned Friday lunchtime and still no place of safety available. This can’t be right! Speaking later to BBC News, he said: ‘We shouldn’t have children, a schoolgirl, staying overnight in a custody block.’ She was arrested at Torbay Hospital, Torquay, after a breach of the peace and sectioned under the Mental Health Act. A bed in a local mental healthcare centre was later made available and she was moved on Saturday night. Labour health spokesman Luciana Berger MP said: ‘This sad situation is becoming worryingly common. People shouldn’t face the indignity of being kept in police cells when they are at their most vulnerable. ‘The Government promised parity for mental health services, yet we’re going backwards. ‘This is an appalling reflection of the crisis in mental health services and the Government must get to grips with it.’ Mark Winstanley, chief executive of mental health charity Rethink, said: ‘Each year thousands of people with serious mental health problems are being held in police cells, including many children and teenagers, because the right services either don’t exist in their community or are completely overstretched. ‘As a result, people end up being held in police stations, or are simply left to fend for themselves. This has to change, as it is costing lives.’ The most recent figures show that up to 9,000 patients with mental health issues are detained in police cells a year, the youngest just 14 years old. Mr Netherton said that in Devon alone, 750 patients had been held in custody so far this year. On hearing that a bed had been found for the girl, he tweeted that it was a ‘good result’. A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘After details were provided to NHS England about the girl and her condition, a place was found locally within a few hours. ‘We are grateful for the help of the NHS in the area in identifying the place. It is worth noting that mental health crisis services have been expanding so that the number of people ending up in police cells is in fact down – but clearly more needs to be done.’","The schoolgirl had spent two nights in custody because there were no beds in NHS facilities anywhere in the UK .

"Peers were given a bizarre inducement to persuade them to back ‘odious’ plans for secret courts. And, appropriately, it involved Britain’s most famous fictional secret agent. Instead of having to sit through the House of Lords debate on the controversial Justice and Security Bill on Tuesday night, they were offered the chance to watch the James Bond film Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig and Berenice Marlohe, as they waited to vote. Offer: Daniel Craig with his Skyfall stars Berenice Marlohe (left) and Naomie Harris (right). Lords were offered the chance to watch the latest Bond film while waiting for a vote on the Justice and Security Bill . Disaster: Civil liberties campaigners said the final approval for the Bill marked a ¿disastrous day for British justice¿ . The ploy helped the Government win a crucial vote that paves the way for closed hearings in court cases which ministers say involve issues of national security. A key Opposition amendment, which would have allowed secrecy only where a judge decided a verdict was impossible by any other means, was lost by only 18 votes, with 26 Liberal Democrats, new Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and dozens of Labour peers voting against the Government. Civil liberties campaigners said the final approval for the Bill marked a ‘disastrous day for British justice’. They were enraged when it emerged that, to entice peers to remain at Westminster for late votes, Government whips had laid on screenings of Skyfall and the Helen Mirren film The Queen, billing them as a ‘welcome distraction’ from the issue. Distraction? As well as Skyfall, starring Berenice Marlohe (pictured), peers were also invited to a talk by former BBC and ITV chairman Lord Grade - with 'refreshments' provided . A note circulated to Tory and Lib Dem members of the Lords also offered peers the chance to attend a lecture by Lord Grade, former chairman of the BBC and ITV – with ‘refreshments’ provided. Donald Campbell, of campaign group Reprieve, said yesterday: ‘It is appalling that, instead of listening to a debate of major constitutional importance, many peers slipped off to watch Skyfall between votes. ‘The Government should be particularly ashamed of itself for this cynical approach to packing the lobbies with Lords who clearly couldn’t care less about the British tradition of open and equal justice. ‘The public pay the Lords an attendance allowance so they can hold  the Government to account, not to watch films.’ Sophie Farthing, policy officer at civil rights group Liberty, said: ‘Last night was a dark moment for British justice as odious Government plans for secret courts moved to the brink of becoming law. 'Not only are secret courts infesting our civil law system, minor restrictions making them slightly less deplorable have also been dismissed. That the Government failed to make the case for secret courts is beyond debate.

Criticism: Donald Campbell, of campaign group Reprieve, said yesterday: ¿It is appalling that, instead of listening to a debate of major constitutional importance, many peers slipped off to watch Skyfall (pictured) between votes' ‘There wasn’t a shred of evidence suggesting they were necessary.’ The Daily Mail has led criticism of plans to extend the use of secret hearings. Defendants . or claimants will not be allowed to be present, or know or challenge . the case against them, and must be represented by a security-cleared . special advocate, rather than their own lawyer. Such procedures are used in tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings, but the Government wants to allow them in any case deemed to involve national security. The legislation has been drafted in close cooperation with the security services, which have claimed other countries may stop sharing intelligence with Britain if the information risks being disclosed in open court.

"Engaged: The honourable Nicholas Knatchbull, with fiancee Raz Tedros by his side. The pair plan to marry in August . There is little about this casually dressed couple to suggest that you’re in the presence of aristocracy. But the shaven-headed man in the hooded top is the honourable Nicholas Knatchbull, godson of Prince Charles and heir to the £100million Mountbatten fortune. And the woman by his side is nurse Raz Tedros – who, as his new fiancee, is set to become the 9th Baroness Brabourne when he one day inherits the family title. Eton-educated Nicholas, who currently has the courtesy title of Lord Romsey, is a former drug addict who once risked being disinherited because of his battles with crack cocaine and heroin. Now, after almost two years free from drugs, the 32-year-old is steadily rebuilding his relationship with father Lord Brabourne, grandson of Lord Mountbatten. He has proposed to Miss Tedros, whose family originate in Eritrea, and is planning a ‘simple’ wedding in August. The couple became engaged shortly before Christmas and have moved into a plush flat in a gated building in a fashionable part of East London. Miss Tedros, 28, who works at a private hospital in Chelsea, is said to be a steadying influence on Nicholas who is attempting to start a career as a digital artist. Her family are so impressed by Nicholas – who was a mentor to Prince William at Eton – that he became a godfather to her niece at Easter. One friend said: ‘Nick is absolutely lovely and everyone is very happy for them both, they want to do things quickly and are planning a wedding in August. ‘I don’t think it will be a big affair as Raz likes to keep things very simple. When Nick told us about his background none of us believed it because it doesn’t really matter. He is already an important part of Raz’s family.’ The couple have been dating for almost a year and were photographed together at last year’s Notting Hill Carnival. Miss Tedros, whose real name is Rahel, also appears arm in arm with 6ft Nicholas in photographs on his Facebook page. Another friend said: ‘Raz makes Nick very happy and keeps him on the straight and narrow. Worlds away: His family's 60-room stately home at Broadlands, in Hampshire . ‘They met on the clubbing scene and were friends before going out together, and their relationship has developed from there. Now he seems to have left his wild days behind him and is more interested in producing his digital art work with the support of Raz. ‘Everyone is thrilled for them. She doesn’t care what background he is from and he is the same about her.’ This is Nicholas’s first serious relationship since the end of his engagement to Anglo-Jamaican single mother Zeaphena Badley. After the break-up Miss Badley, 31, said: ‘I’m not someone you could think could become a lady. I’m not like Kate Middleton.’ Younger days: Nicholas Knatchbull (centre) with his parents at Ansty Polo Club in 1998 . Miss Badley, who was brought up on a south London council estate, knew nothing of her lover’s privileged background when they first shared a rented room in a London house. She realised the scale of his family wealth only when she visited the 60-room stately home on their vast country estate at Broadlands in Hampshire. In the darkest days of his addiction Nicholas, who was a techno DJ under the name ‘Safe as Milk’, was at serious risk of being disinherited from the family fortune as his parents were worried about leaving the 5,000-acre ancestral estate in his care. But in the last two years he has been steadily rebuilding his relationship with his father. The Knatchbull family was  devastated in 1979 when Lord Mountbatten was assassinated  by an IRA bomb planted on  his yacht during a holiday in the Irish Republic. Lord Brabourne’s beloved younger brother Nicholas, 14, was among the dead. Lord Brabourne named his eldest son after him.","The honourable Nicholas Knatchbull has proposed to nurse Raz Tedros .

"An African migrant who lured a vulnerable schoolgirl to a house for sex cannot be deported – because he is a member of a  ‘persecuted tribe’. Jumaa Kater Saleh, 24, was convicted as part of a predatory sex gang for the ‘deliberate, targeted abuse of a young and vulnerable girl’, who was aged 13 at the time. But he was allowed to remain in Britain under human rights law because he faced mistreatment if sent back  to Sudan. Saleh was a member of the Zaghawa tribe, which was subject to widespread persecution (not pictured here) He claimed he was a member of the  Zaghawa tribe, which has been persecuted by government forces and Arab tribe militia. And it has been ruled he can stay . indefinitely, unless a court decides the ‘threat’ diminishes and it is . safe for him to return to Africa. Details of the case emerged as Saleh . went to court to demand compensation from the Government for locking him . up. He claimed he was unlawfully detained following his prison . sentence, when he was kept behind bars to protect the public. But the judge rejected his claim . saying he had posed a ‘substantial’ risk to the public and keeping him . locked up was necessary. Deputy High Court judge Philip Mott QC rejected Saleh's claim, but the decision has been overturned . The decision to allow Saleh to stay . sparked outrage. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘I take the very simple view . that if someone comes to this country and then breaks the law then he . should be sent back to where he comes from. 'Any arguments about his . human rights disappear when he has violated, violently, the rights of a . young girl.’ Saleh arrived in the UK in November . 2004 hidden in the back of a lorry. In January 2005 he claimed asylum . but this was rejected. However, because he was under 18, he was allowed . to remain until he reached adulthood in October 2006. He was still in the country in May . 2007, when arrested and charged with the sex offences. In February 2008, . he was convicted of two charges of sexual activity with a 13-year-old . girl. He was in a group of five immigrants who lured schoolgirls – . including three aged 13 and one aged 14 – to a house for sex. The judge at the trial had remarked . that all three girls were ‘clearly disturbed and vulnerable, far from . mature for their years and had been targeted by the group’. Saleh was . jailed for four years on the basis that the offences were planned and . that he knew the girl’s age. The judge also recommended him for . deportation. However, at the end of his sentence . immigration officials deemed that he should not be released as they . tried to deport him ‘for the public good’. He was let out in May 2011 . after it was decided that he would face persecution if returned to . Sudan, under protection against ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ and . risk to life. He now lives in Leicester. Ruling against him yesterday, deputy High Court judge Philip Mott QC said he had not been unlawfully detained. The judge, sitting at the High Court . in London, accepted that Saleh was a member of the Zaghawa and so it was . ‘not possible’ to return him to Sudan. Jumaa Kater Saleh, 24, who arrived in the UK in November 2004 hidden in a lorry, cannot be deported because he is part of a 'persecuted tribe' in Sudan . But he ruled there was no evidence of . Saleh being held unlawfully or unreasonably at any time and his case . failed ‘on all grounds’. The judge said: ‘It was deliberate, . targeted abuse of a young and vulnerable girl. The risk that the . claimant, in his early-20s, would commit a further sexual offence if . released … had to be considered as substantial.’ A UK Border Agency spokesman said: . ‘We believe those who break our laws should be returned home and are . extremely disappointed with the court’s decision. ‘We did not believe that this  individual needed or deserved refuge in this country.’ More than 100,000 members of the Zaghawa tribe have been made refugees following the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. The semi-nomadic people live in large swathes of the desert and plains of Chad and Sudan where they herd cattle, camels, sheep and harvest wild grains. The tribe converted to Islam en masse in the 1940s following their exposure to passing Muslim missionaries from West Africa who were travelling to Mecca. They have become known for their religious piety and are still very superstitious, with a strong belief in the ‘evil eye’. Most Zaghawa villages also contain mosques, which are used for prayer. But despite being Muslim, they were deemed ‘African’ by ‘Arab’ tribal militia who along with the Sudanese Government forces targeted them during the Darfur crisis in 2003. Rebel forces recruited child soldiers from the Zaghawa and thousands were forced to flee to neighbouring Chad or moved to UN refugee camps on the border.

"From his battalion of female guards to his penchant for pitching tents on the lawns of the Élysée Palace, deposed Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi was as strange as he was dangerous. Now the plastic surgeon the despot shared with Italy's Silvio Berlusconi has revealed his bizarre taste for cosmetic enhancement - done without anaesthetic in the early hours of the morning. 'He wanted lipo filling because a desert man gets bad skin and we did the hair implant too,' explained Dr Liacya Ribeiro, a breast augmentation specialist based in Rio de Janeiro. Scroll down for video . Surgery: Dr Liacya Ribeiros told the BBC that Gaddafi was fond of late night surgery done without sedation . 'The operation was performed with local anesthetic only. No sedation.' He added: 'He [Gaddafi] was afraid that somebody might kill him.' The Brazilian appears in a new BBC documentary, Mad Dog: Gaddafi's Secret World, which delves into the peculiar lifestyle enjoyed by the late dictator. It also looks at the darker side of life in Gaddafi's Libya and goes inside the palace where the dictator kept his 'harem' of girls, some as young as 14, and raped them repeatedly. Many were virgins kidnapped from schools and universities and kept prisoner for years in specially designed secret sex lairs hidden within Tripoli University or his many palaces. Speaking to the Mail On Sunday, one teacher at a Tripoli school recalled how the girls were all very young. Ruin: The remains of the Tripoli palace where Dr Ribeiro conducted operations on Libya's Colonel Gaddafi . ‘Some were only 14,’ she said. ‘They would simply take the girl they wanted. They had no conscience, no morals, not an iota of mercy even though she was a mere child.’ The teacher also feared for her own daughter who was attending Tripoli University, who had told her mother that the community around the university lived in fear when a visit from the colonel was announced. ‘The girls he wanted would be rounded up and sent to him,’ she said. ‘One just disappeared and they never found her again, despite her father and brothers searching for her. 'Another was found three months later, cut, raped and lying in the middle of a park. She had been left for dead.’ Dr Ribeiro, by contrast, told filmmakers that his memories of Gaddafi are largely good but complained of his insistence on completing procedures in the small hours. Bizarre: According to Dr Ribeiro, Gaddafi insisted on having procedures without anaesthetic . Bodyguards: Many of Gaddafi's famous battalion of female guards had also been abused by the despot . Surgery fans: Along with Gaddafi, Dr Ribeiros also counts Italy's Silvio Berlusconi among his clients . 'He was a very nice man, he was a television man,' says the doctor. '[But we would do operations at] 2am in the morning.' The facilities, however, did please Dr Ribeiro, who carried out the operations on Gaddafi in the tunnels beneath his Tripoli palace. 'It was like a big hospital,' he remembers.'The surgery room in the bunker was very good.' But while Ribeiro seems unscarred by his encounters with the evil Gaddafi, not everyone was so lucky. As one former inhabitant of the dictator's harem, who spoke to the BBC, revealed: ‘I will never forget that first time, that moment. 'He  violated my body and pierced my  soul with a dagger. That blade will never come out.’ Mad Dog: Gaddafi's Secret World, Monday night at 10pm on BBC4 .","Gaddafi's Brazilian plastic surgeon has spoken of treating the dictator .

"A young woman who fell into a coma last year after getting breast augmentation surgery has been allowed to go back to her home but is still unable to move on her own and can only say a few words. Linda Perez now has to be under constant supervision as she has dropped to a skeletal weight. Doctors fear that the now-19-year-old may never recover, but her mother is holding out for a recovery, citing the fact that she is now off of her feeding tube as a good sign. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Linda Perez has to be carried by her father Fernando Izquierdo because she can still barely move her limbs after complications during her August 2013 breast augmentation surgery . Questions: Perez, pictured with her father, paid around half the price of a typical breast implant surgery . 'I still have hope because she is alive and she's home,' Mariela Diaz told The Miami Herald. While she may be remaining upbeat, her daughter has not come to terms with her inability to move her own limbs. 'She goes into depression and crying,' Mrs Diaz said. 'She sees that she cannot walk, and when she realizes what happened to her, she cries.' Linda suffered brain damage in the hour after the breast augmentation finished but now the doctor who performed the surgery is filing to have access to her earlier medical records because he feels she hid key facts from him. She allegedly had a complication from anesthesia that she was given during the birth of her son, and if she had told the doctor about that incident he would have approached the procedure differently. Serious: Linda Perez was in a coma for two months after the August 2013 cosmetic surgery and still has not recovered fully as her doctors fear that she may have permanent brain and heart damage . For months following the August 2013 operation, the then-18-year-old's toddler son was not told about his mother's illness. She first showed signs of life in a coma in October and was allowed to go back to the family home in November. Now her parents have told The Miami . Herald that they plan to petition a court in order to become the . now-4-year-old boy's legal guardians- as well as getting the same title . for their daughter. They also are in the process of gearing up for a court battle as they are planning on filing a lawsuit against the doctor who put in their daughter's breast implants. While the medical explanation for what exactly happened is still being debated, it is visible that something terrible has happened to the girl because she is so thin. Before the worst: Linda's parents described her as vivacious and spirited before the August 2013 surgery . Changed roles: Now Linda's parents are considering filing to be considered the legal guardians of both their 19-year-old daughter (right) and her now-4-year-old son (left) since she can no longer care for herself or the boy . Linda had the breast augmentation surgery at The Coral Gables Cosmetic Center in August 2013 after paying $2,800, which is believed to be about half of the normal price of the procedure. Her family were told that her heart stopped during the operation and she was 'effectively' dead when she was transported to hospital. She suffered brain and heart damage during the procedure. Perez was admitted to Mercy Hospital following her procedure and her family's attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, said that finding out what went wrong will require litigation. Questions: Her doctor now believes that she left critical information about her medical history out of their pre-operation consultations . Dr Jacob Freiman, who performed the surgery, has a clean record and is a board certified plastic surgeon, according to the Florida Department of Health. Dr Freiman is calling for an investigation into her medical history because he claims that the girl knew she had suffered complications when she gave birth to her son. 'They put a spinal aesthetic, and she needed to be intubated,' Dr Freiman said in a report filed by the medical center to gain access to her earlier records. He says that the information was purposefully kept from him in order to keep him from calling off the plastic surgery. She told the doctor during one of their consultations that she had a history of seizures eight years before the breast augmentation but had stopped taking medication as the seizures stopped and had no known history of lung or heart problems. She also said that she had stopped smoking. Young mom: Linda was 15 years old when she gave birth to her son . While Dr Freiman has a clean history with the medical board, it later emerged that the anaesthetist Dr Mario Alberto Diaz had previously served time for illegally selling pain pills over the internet. Dr Diaz served time in federal prison in 2006 for illegally dispensing at least 53,000 doses of pain pills over the Internet. He also had his Florida medical license suspended for six months . 'What they gave me is essentially a vegetable,' her mother Mariela Diaz told NBC 6. Perez . was admitted to Mercy Hospital following her procedure and her family's . attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, said that finding out what went wrong will . require litigation. 'How . does an 18-year-old healthy young lady go in to have a simple routine . cosmetic procedure and come out in a vegetative state?' he asked as he . spoke to NBC 6.

"A woman has been arrested by police officers investigating claims that a black woman made racist comments about white people on a London bus, Scotland Yard said today. The Metropolitan Police said a 34-year-old woman was arrested this afternoon at an address in Hackney on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and is being questioned at an east London police station. A force spokesman said the arrest came after they began examining video footage of a woman making comments on a bus. Scroll down for video . The woman, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, begins her tirade of racist abuse looking directly at the camera . The middle-aged black woman remains seated at first, then stands up in anger as she shouts expletives directed towards white people . The footage, recorded by a fellow . passenger, was posted to video sharing website YouTube and has been . watched by more than 19,200 people as of this evening. It showed a middle-aged black woman . telling passengers on the bus how she 'hates white people' who 'all want . to be f****** black'. She begins the tirade of abuse by shouting: 'I'm so glad. I'm born black and I'll die black. I was born African and I'll f****** die African.' The foul-mouthed woman then goes on to tell the passengers: 'The only reason I was born in this country is because you f****** people brought my people here.' 'My parents are f****** African, born in Jamaica. And I’m f****** African, born in England and I can’t stand you white people, I tell you.' She screams at a passenger on the bus and points her arm at them in anger . Holding her mobile phone with her mouth wide open, she looks both in shock and disgusted as she continues her tirade of abuse sitting down . Footage of the incident emerged on . YouTube on August 17 after a string of similar public rants by women . were made on various forms of London transport earlier this year and . last year. It shows the woman, whose name is not known, sitting on a crowded bus shouting at the top of her voice.

The woman, who could face prosecution, then becomes increasingly more aggressive, stating: 'They all want to be f***ing black, they all put fat in their lips and their bottoms and sit down on the sun bed to be black.' She answers her mobile phone and can be heard describing those around her as 'f****** doughnuts and puppets on the bus' As the woman becomes increasingly more aggressive, she repeatedly gets up and down . She then turns her attention to . another passenger and asks 'Am I lying, am I lying?' Answering the . question with: 'No I aint f****** lying.' The woman repeatedly gets up and down during the video as she hurls the abuse while astonished onlookers try to ignore her. She . finally finishes her rant by complaining about the Queen’s Diamond . Jubilee, and states that 'the same f****** diamond she has in her head, . my people suffered for that. 'Free speech. I hate white people. I can’t stand none of you.' And then looking at the camera, she adds: 'Strictly black, the more black the happier I am.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'On Monday, August 20 MPS officers began to assess footage of a woman that was brought to our attention. It shows a woman making comments on a bus. 'Officers are continuing to try and establish when and where the footage was taken.

"The toddler abandoned on a stranger's doorstep while wearing an 'Auntie Loves Me' t-shirt has been identified leading to her parents' arrest across state lines. Alonzo Brown, 31, and Tongela Denise McBride, 37, were arrested and charged with unlawful neglect of a child in Georgia on Friday night after allegedly leaving the toddler outside a South Carolina home on Tuesday. Authorities publicly identified the 4-year-old girl as Zoe Brown of Marietta, Georgia after a four-day, nation-wide hunt for her parents. Identified: Four-year-old Zoe Brown of Marietta, Georgia has been identified by the Anderson County Sheriff's office as the toddler abandoned outside a stranger's home in South Carolina late Tuesday night . Parents: (left to right) Alonzo Brown, 31, and Tongela Denise McBride, 37, were arrested and charged with unlawful neglect of a child in Georgia on Friday night . The girl, found wearing clothes made for a 24-month-old, had only a note pinned to her diaper reading 'call DCAF please' referring to the Georgia Department of Family and Children. The child's photo was shared more than 2 million times from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page alone, authorities said. 'Just putting the story out there and all over the country, it was the media that led to the individuals that called us,' Public Information Officer Chad McBride told ABC. 'For a couple days we didn't have anything.' Zoe is now in foster care and will remain there until a family member can prove their ability to offer her a safe home. National attention: The child's photo was shared more than 2 million times from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page alone, they said . Found: Roy Campbell found her on his porch late on Tuesday night after someone rang the doorbell and ran . The sheriff's office has refrained from offering a possible motive for the parents' crime stating it being 'in the best interest of pursuing justice for Zoe.' South Carolina law allows a caregiver to drop a child under 30 days old at a state-sanctioned 'safe haven' without facing prosecution. Those consist of a hospital, church or school. On Tuesday Roy Campbell went to answer his door on Brook Forest Drive after the doorbell was rung around 11pm. He found the child outside in a stroller and said he had no idea where she came from. 'I heard the neighbor’s dogs barking so I went around the back of the house to see if they might have gone there,' he said. Clues: The girl was wearing an Auntie Loves Me t-shirt, left, with other size 24 months clothing . 'When I didn’t see anyone, I went back to the front door and noticed that there was a baby in the stroller.' The girl was found wearing an 'Auntie Loves Me' t-shirt and a Dora the Explorer hat. She also has surgical scars on her chest and neck, according to officers, who believe she may have had to undergo recent heart surgery. They were  fearful she may have health issues which they couldn't fully establish without knowing her medical history. 'Obviously it’s against the law what has happened here,' Anderson County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Chad McBride told the Independent Mail at the time. 'But we need to know more. If the girl was kidnapped, the parents or guardians are not to blame. We don’t know what exactly happened.' They put out a series of photographs of the girl and the clothing she was found in for help across several states to try and track down her family.","Alonzo Brown, 31, and Tongela Denise McBride, 37, were arrested in Georgia and charged with unlawful neglect of a child .

"Critics are claiming that After Earth, the new action film starring father and son team Will and Jaden Smith, which had meager earnings at the box office, bears striking similarities to the teachings of Scientology. The film opened to poor reviews and only earned $1M on opening night at the box office. Film critics have pointed out several similarities between the film's themes and L. Ron Hubbard's religious teachings. Critics have compared After Earth, starring Will Smith, to teachings of the Church of Scientology. The film's final scene (pictured here) features a volcano erupting, an iconic image from the religion founder, L. Ron Hubbard's book, Dianetics . After Earth, directed by M. Night Shyamalan, . tells the story of General Cypher Raige (played by Will Smith) and his . 13-year-old son Kitai (Jayden), who crash land on a Earth 1,000 years . after it has been abandoned by the human race. A former Scientologist Marc Headley reviewed the film for Hollywood Reporter and agreed that many of the themes are similar to Hubbard's teachings. Headley said he 'escaped' from the organization which he was a part of for 15 years in 2005. After seeing the film he wrote for the magazine. 'While most of the movie involves following Jaden Smith’s character as he faces off against apes, a large, angry bird and a leech, (none of which have much to do with Scientology -- besides maybe the leech), most of the Scientology influences play out in the film’s dialogue. 'Will Smith’s character, Cypher Raige, tells his son, Kitai: 'Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Now do not misunderstand me: Danger is very real. But fear is a choice'. 'L. Ron Hubbard’s teachings insist that emotions and fear are triggers and are part of the reactive mind. Through Scientology, one is supposed to 'rid oneself of your fears'....Besides the film's dialogue and its direct similarities to Scientology teachings, there are also some other clues in After Earth that cannot be ignored. 'The movie’s climax takes place on a volcano that could have been ripped right off the cover of Dianetics, the look is so similar. In Scientology, the volcano is a common thread through many different teachings. 'Will Smith’s character is pretty much devoid of all emotions for the entire movie. While this may be part of his character or something that was directed in the script, in Scientology, one goes through great amounts of training and counseling to control one’s emotions and 'mis-emotion' as described by Hubbard.' Now . overrun by aliens who feed on fear, Kitai must fight through the . planet's dangerous terrain to find the wrecked ship's rescue beacon and . save his father who was wounded in the crash. Several film critics have dissected the plot and found numerous similarities to the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology. The most glaring similarity is that the iconic image of a volcano erupting, featured on the cover of Hubbard's Dianetics, is the final climactic shot of the film. Delving deeper, critics cite the film's value on the self, derived from Scientology, Vulture . noted. One of Hubbard's . teachings was that people must set aside their doubts and conflicts and place . unquestioned value on the self. In . the film Kitai is plagued by fear and self doubt as he travels through . the alien terrain and tries to measure up to his General father. Conversely Cypher, the superior . solider, is able to 'ghost' or suppress his emotions. Cypher . classically embodies Hubbard's theory of 'thetan,' or the pure human . soul unburdened by emotion, whereas Kitai is a 'misguided theatan,' struggling to escape his fear. It . is only as Kitai learns to overcome his emotions over the course of the . film that he experiences a Scientological triumph of the self and . success over the alien planet. Critics also note the use of . 'auditing' in the film, which . is the Church's practice of ridding its members of painful emotional . memories. Scientology teaches that people are plagued by 'engrams,' mental images similar to memories which can cause emotional pain. The . Church rids people of engrams through the use of an E-meter, commonly . used in free Scientology stress tests, that measures electrical . resistance and pinpoints where the engrams live. After . Cypher is wounded in the spaceship crash he audits Kitai from a far, . helping him to move past his painful memories and find inner strength. Cypher even has a equivalent of a 31st century E-meter with Kitai's 'Smart Fabric' suit that tracks his health stats. A third similiarity is that the . predominant . theme in the film is man-versus-nature, a basic Scientology concept. In . Scientology life is divided into eight 'urges of survival,' commonly . known as dynamics. The . first dynamic is self, the survival of the individual against all odds. In the film Kitai outruns Earth's harsh environmental elements and . dangerous wildlife hoards. The film suggests that he is able to overcome his external circumstances due to self-actualization and not an actual skill set. The film's villains, blind aliens who both inspire and feed off of human fear are representative of Hubbard's condemnation of psychiatrists, who Hubbard wrote, 'advertise man as a push-button stimulus-response robot' In the film Will Smith's character 'audits' his son from afar, a Scientological precept where someone helps you erase painful memories in order to find inner strength. In this scene Smith coaches his son from a video screen on the spaceship . Similar to an E-meter, used in Scientology stress tests, the character's 'Smart Fabric' suit (worn here) allows Smith to track his son's health stats and locate areas of stress in his body and mind . Finally critics noted that the film's villains, monstrous aliens who feed off of people's fears, are representative of Hubbard's aversion to psychiatry. Hubbard was famously outspoken against psychiatrists, writing in his paper Crime and Psychiatry . that they 'advertise man as a push-button . stimulus-response robot' and use inhumane methods to manipulate people's moods. In After Earth the blind, murderous aliens are akin to psychiatrists, feeding off people's fear while also provoking them. Religious overtones aside, After Earth failed to do well financially at the box office and opened to poor reviews. The Hollywood Reporter reported that . on its opening night the film only grossed $1M, and may only debut at . $35M, the lowest opening for Smith in his recent film history. The Los Angeles Times summed up the movie in their review's title stating, ''After Earth' crashes on take-off.' Will Smith and son Jaden pose together at the premiere of their new summer action flick, After Earth. The film has been called a parable for Scientology by critics. Smith has donated money to the church in the past, though he denies being a Scientologist . The New York Daily News also condemned the film saying, 'Summer 2013 has its first bomb, and sadly, it’s landed right on Will Smith.' However the harshest review came from The Atlantic who . criticized the film's actors with a back-handed compliment for its . director. Reviewer Christopher Orr wrote, 'On the upside, this may be . the first terrible movie by M. Night Shyamalan that's not primarily his . fault.' This is not the first time that Smith has been closely associated with Scientology. In 2007 he donated $122,500 to church charities. Then two years later Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith opened the New Village Leadership . Academy in California, a private school based on Hubbard's teachings. Despite Smith's philanthropic efforts involving the church he . strongly denies being a practicing member. Instead, in several . interviews Smith has labeled himself as a 'student of world religion.' For their part the Church of Scientology says that ""the subject of the film has no similarities with Scientology whatsoever"".","Critics are calling Will Smith's new action film propaganda for The Church of Scientology's teachings .
Amongst the similarities are a focus on the self, themes of man versus nature, and 'auditing'

"Convicted: Adnan Syed was convicted of the January, 1999, murder of his ex-girlfriend, Haw Min Lee . A 15-year-old murder case that landed a popular teenager from Baltimore County behind bars for life is being revived in a podcast that offers more questions than answers about the crime and its fallout. Ultimately, a Maryland appeals court will decide the man's fate - ending years of speculation as to where Adnan Syed was for an hour after school on January 13, 1999. Millions of listeners are anxiously awaiting the next installment of Serial, a podcast from the creators of 'This American Life' that tells the story of Syed, a Woodlawn High School student who was found guilty in 2000 of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. The podcast is the brainchild of longtime radio producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter Sarah Koenig, who spent more than a year digging into Syed's case and reporting her findings in almost real-time in hour-long segments released online every Thursday (with the exception of Thanksgiving). Nine episodes in, the podcast has attracted more than 1.5 million listeners per episode worldwide and turned Syed into something of a household name, inspiring a dedicated fan base, re-cap blogs and even spin-off podcasts, not to mention heated debates around countless water coolers and dinner tables about Syed's guilt or innocence. But although the buzz surrounding the case is new, Syed has been trying to prove his innocence for years - so long, in fact, that his case is now in its final stages of appeal. A hearing scheduled for January represents what Syed's lawyer, C. Justin Brown, said is the man's 'last best chance' at freedom. Missing hour: Syed claims to have an alibi for his whereabouts on January 13 - although he says he cannot remember exactly where he was at the time of Lee's death - but he has always denied killing her . 'I joke that when I was hired to do Adnan's appeal I was a free-wheeling single man and now I'm married with two kids. It's been a lengthy process,' said Brown, who has represented Syed for more than five years. 'There are three parts to the legal process: a trial, then an appeal, then you have post-conviction relief. This is the last step.' Syed, now 34, was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery and false imprisonment in 2000 and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors said Syed strangled Lee after becoming inconsolably jealous when the two broke up and she began dating someone else. The primary points Brown makes in his appeal are some of the same reasons Koenig told listeners in her podcast's first episode that she decided to investigate the case: there were no eye-witnesses tying Syed to the crime, and Syed's attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to interview a witness who said she was with Syed at the time Lee was killed. Gutierrez, a high-profile Baltimore-area criminal defense attorney, was disbarred in 2001 when client funds went missing. She died in 2004 of a heart attack. The podcast is the brainchild of longtime radio producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter Sarah Koenig, who spent more than a year digging into Syed's case and reporting her findings in almost real-time in hour-long segments released online every Thursday . Brown in his appeal says Gutierrez knew about Asia McClain, a classmate of Syed's who saw him in the library around the time prosecutors say Lee was killed. But Brown says the attorney failed to pursue her alibi during trial. 'The entire trial depended on whether Syed could prove where he was at the time of the murder,' Brown wrote. 'Meanwhile, a credible witness - an honors student who had no obvious bias in favor of Syed - had come forward unsolicited with a recollection that she had been with Syed around the time of the murder ... Yet the lawyer did absolutely nothing.' Brown also wrote that Gutierrez erred when she did not seek a plea deal for Syed, who asked her several times whether a plea option was available. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals asked prosecutors to respond to the post-conviction appeal in September to see if they too believed Syed had ineffective counsel in a move Brown said is highly unusual. Ultimately, as millions of listeners try and parse the evidence for themselves, what happens next is up to the judges. 'It's an unusual phenomenon,' Brown said. 'The Court of Special Appeals has shown some interest in the case and asked the state to respond to our application, which is more than they usually do in this procedural posture. But I truly think the appellate courts make their decisions based on the merits of the case, and not the popularity of a podcast.'","Adnan Syed convicted of murdering his ex, Hae Min Lee in 1999 .

"This remarkable footage shows a hypnotist having her wisdom tooth removed without any pain relief. Sharon Waxkirsh, who works in north London, said she felt no pain during or after the procedure. Two incisions were made using a scalpel and she had one stitch, as well as having the tooth removed. But the hypnotist said she felt nothing after putting herself into a trance while she was in the dentists chair. Scroll down for video . Sharon Waxkirsh had a wisdom tooth removed using nothing but hypnotherapy to deal with the pain . Ms Waxkirsh says she was also able to stop the bleeding using the power of her mind and that she experienced no swelling or bruising. She told MailOnline: ‘I hypnotised myself and it is so effective. ‘It didn’t ever become painful, not once, and I didn’t have any blood loss at all. ‘The beauty of it is that it allows you to have complete control over your body and you lose that when you have an anaesthetic.’ She added: ‘I just decided to completely relax my body – it is all about getting in the zone.’ Ms Waxkirsh said anyone can learn to hypnotise themselves and that it can also be beneficial in many other circumstances, including during childbirth. Ms Waxkirsh (pictured as the tooth was removed) says she put herself into a trance-like state . She added that there are many benefits to using hypnosis instead of an anaesthetic during dental treatment. Ms Waxkirsch said hypnotherapy can offer an alternative for people who are scared of needles, claiming it results in less blood loss, a lower rate of infection and a greater sense of control. She says she was able to eat again immediately after the treatment and that she felt no pain afterwards. She added: ‘Once you can do that, you can do anything.’ Ms Waxkirsh believes that the technique could save the NHS millions of pounds by reducing the need for anaesthesia during surgery and by speeding up recovery times. She argues that all hospitals should have a hypnotherapy specialist on duty. ‘It . has the potential to save the NHS millions of pounds every year and get . people out of hospital much quicker than with conventional recovery . programmes,' she said. She says she felt no pain during or after the procedure and that she was also able to stop her gum bleeding . ‘Hypnosis can over-ride the chemicals in the brain that cause us fear and tension. It can also allow us to subdue pain and let the body concentrate on healing itself. ‘It is most obvious in dental work where patients with fear of either the dentist or needles can be prepared for pain-free treatments. This makes it easier for the dentist and the patient.’ Ms Waxkirsh believes that for some patients even major surgery could be performed without anaesthetics. She said: . ‘It is possible to have it with all kinds of surgery to reduce the level . of anaesthesia but people are often more open to using this technique . for dental work and operation recovery time. ‘We should have highly trained therapists at every hospital to consult with patients. ‘Research . has shown us that infections are less likely, blood loss is less, the . immune system is boosted and therefore patients are up and about much . quicker than normal. Ms Waxkirsh says the technique can be particularly beneficial for people who are scared of needles so do not want to have a local anaesthetic. She also claims it reduces the risk of infections . ‘The NHS is fantastic but it can take away our responsibility for our own bodies making us totally dependent on the hospital staff when we have power within ourselves that we can harness.’ Ms Waxkirsh is not the only person to have had a tooth removed with no pain relief other than hypnosis. She says she has accompanied many of her clients to the dentist while they had teeth removed, or fillings put in, without an anaesthetic. However, she does acknowledge that if people want to try this, they do have to choose their dentist carefully to find one who is on board with hypnosis. She says hypnotherapy can also help women through childbirth and that she has many clients who have come to her seeking help with pain relief before giving birth.","Sharon Waxkirsh says she felt no pain during or after the procedure .

"The Air Force's former chief prosecutor has claimed he was 'put out to pasture' after he criticized top commanders for overturning a high-profile sexual assault conviction. Colonel Don Christensen says he was transferred to a less meaningful role and given a 'downgraded' personnel report after he spoke out against the military's handling of a 2012 case. Christensen, who served as the top prosecutor for four years, decided to step down and join a victim advocacy group, Protect Our Defenders, last month - explaining that the military criminal justice system was 'fundamentally broken' and could not be fixed from the inside. Now the retired colonel has spoken to Yahoo! News about the case that ended his military career. Battle: Colonel Don Christensen stepped down as the Air Force's chief prosecutor last month after claiming he was downgraded for criticizing commanders who overturned a sex assault conviction . In November 2012, Christensen, who worked on 300 sexual assault cases in the Air Force, successfully convicted Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkerson of aggravated sexual assault. Wilkerson, a F-16 pilot and the inspector general of Aviano Air Base, Italy, had been accused of sexual assault by civilian physician Kim Hanks five months earlier. Hanks and other workers had gone to Wilkerson's house for a small party after a concert at the base, and when Hanks was stranded without a ride, Wilkerson and his wife, Beth, suggested she stay in their guest room. She was awoken at 3am by pain between her legs and realized Wilkerson was touching her. As she attempted to get him away, his wife appeared at the door and shouted: 'Get the hell out of my house.' She left immediately. After Wilkerson was convicted, he was sentenced to a year in jail, dismissal and pay forfeiture. He protested his innocence and just three months later, Lieutenant General Craig Franklin, a base commander, quietly concluded that the evidence was insufficient and threw out the verdict. Attack: Kimberly Hanks, left, a civilian physician, said she woke up to find herself being sexually assaulted by Air Force Lt. Col. James Wilkerson, right, in 2012 and he was sentenced to a year behind bars . Denial: Wilkerson, a married father, denied that he had assaulted Hanks and three months after his conviction, it was quietly overturned by a commander. Christensen called it 'the final straw' Christensen, who said that Hanks was one of the most credible witnesses he had ever worked with, said that neither he nor Hanks were not notified about the decision. 'My reaction was that this was the final straw, that we were going to lose military justice, that Congress would be outraged, I was outraged, and that this was the death knell to the justice system as we knew it,' Christensen told Yahoo! News. Decision: Lt. General Craig Franklin, pictured, decided to throw out the pilot's conviction . After his complaints, he received a 'downgraded' personnel report before he was removed from his position, he said. He was given a role as a judge on an Air Force appellate court. He said this was a less meaningful position and he had never applied for it, Yahoo! reported. 'When I got my performance report, I knew they were sending me a message that - they didn't want me in the Air Force anymore,' he said. His bosses at the Air Force have denied this is the case, insisting that the change in positions was part of the normal rotation. Wilkerson's lawyer has also accused his alleged victim of lying about aspects of the case. Franklin had called the pilot a 'doting father and husband' when he threw out the conviction. Christensen counters that the victim's account was '100 per cent consistent'. 'I felt like I was going to pay a hell of a price' for speaking out, he said - which he just doesn't understand. 'I feel like I'm being loyal to the Air Force by helping us solve a huge problem,' he said. When he stepped down last month, he released a statement detailing his decision, the Air Force Times reported. 'I watched at least 30 commanders come to the defense of Wilkerson ... and blatantly attack the prosecution, judge, investigators, and the jury,' he said. 'I realized that in order to see substantial change, I would need to leave the Air Force, breaking a military tradition that has been a part of my family for over 150 years.' Support: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand speaks in support of the passage of the Military Justice Improvement Act last year. Christensen is now supporting her bill for an independent prosecution office in military cases . Wilkerson was later reduced to the rank of major and he was then kicked out of the service when officials learned he had fathered a child with another woman while he was married. Franklin, the commander who overturned the conviction, retired in January. In the aftermath of the case, the law changed and now convening authorities like Franklin cannot overturn sexual assault convictions. But commanders still make the decision as to whether sex crimes should be prosecuted. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has now proposed legislation to create an independent prosecution office in the military and remove commanders from taking part in prosecution decisions. Christensen will appear at a Capitol Hill press conference on Tuesday to support Gillibrand's bill.","Colonel Don Christensen was given a 'downgraded' personnel report and pushed out of his position after he spoke out against the military, he said .

"A Knight Rider fan spent 10 years transforming a his run down car into a replica of Kitt - the car driven by David Hasselhoff in the classic 80s TV show. Scott Bainbridge, 30, spent £18,000 converting an unloved Pontiac Firebird into a car that looks - and sounds - like the hi-tech original. The postman, who fell in love with Kitt when he first saw it on screen as a child, spends three nights a week working on his car - which needed new carpets, wheels and a custom-made dashboard. Scroll down for videos . Ready to ride: Knight Rider fan Scott Bainbridge (pictured with his car) spent 10 years transforming a his run down car into a replica of Kitt - the car driven by David Hasselhoff in the classic 80s TV show . Iconic: David Hasselhoff starred as Michael Knight in Knight Rider. Kitt had numerous special features such as Turbo Boost (which allowed quick bursts of speed or jumping over obstacles), the ability to drive 'himself' Detailed: Mr Bainbridge spent more than £18,000 converting an unloved Pontiac Firebird into a car that looks - and sounds - like the original. Above, the custom-built dashboard inside his car looks like the original . Intelligent: The original Kitt interior. The 'brain' of KITT, essentially a supercomputer on wheels, allowed the car to think, learn, communicate and interact with humans. It was voiced by actor William Daniels in the show . He also carried out extensive welding on the 25-year-old vehicle, and added new wings,   new suspension and brake parts. One of the final touches was a coat of black paint. But he insists, his work on the car is still not finished. Mr Bainbridge said: 'Knight Rider is sort of a combination between technology and a cool car, so when you bring those two together I fell in love with it. 'All the lights on the dashboard, the scanner lights and the car they used was a great looking car to begin with so it really won me over.' The reincarnated Pontiac has the full Knight Rider dashboard and has been extensively altered to match the on-screen vehicle. Kitt, which stands for Knight Industries Two Thousand, was voiced by actor Michael Daniels in the original series. Committed: The father-of-two had to install a new engine (seen above) as part of the project. He wants to recreate the car so that it looks like the vehicle seen in the second series of the 80s TV programme . Stripped down: Mr Bainbridge spends at least three nights a week working on his project in his garage in Newcastle. Above, the 25-year-old car is pulled apart before the new engine is added . Passionate: Mr Bainbridge took this photo of the car while he was working on the the wiring, accessories, fuel lines and radiator of his Kitt. The hi-tech vehicle was finished off with a coat of black paint . The vehicle - a supercomputer on wheels - had the ability to drive itself and interact with humans, including its driver, Michael Knight, who was played by David Hasselhoff. Mr Bainbridge, father of two from Newcastle, said he is aiming to recreate the car as it appears in the second series of the original TV show. He said: 'I first got the car back in 2004, and it arrived on a low loader and it was in a very, very sorry state. 'It's taken me ten years to get it from what it was originally to what you see now - the whole interior has to be redone, all new dashboard, new carpets, new wheels, and that's just to get it to look like the Knight Rider car.' Mr Bainbridge's Kitt said that the car attracts a lot of attention wherever he goes. At weekends he takes the vehicle to shows around the country where Knight Rider fans can take pictures with the iconic car. Work to do: Mr Bainbridge said that although to the general public the car (above, on the road) may look perfect - to Knight Rider fans there are many differences between his car and the original Kitt . Attention: Mr Bainbridge said that he gets a lot of attention when he takes his car out on the roads. The enthusiast thinks that it is because the vehicle brings back childhood memories for a whole generation . He said: 'I get quite a lot of thumbs up and people flashing lights on their cars and people taking pictures of me. 'I think it brings back a lot of memories for people when they see Kitt cruising down the road.' But Mr Bainbridge insists he still has a lot of work to do on the car. He said that although to the general public the car may look perfect - to Knight Rider fans there are many differences between his car and the original Kitt. He said: 'All the dashboard needs to come back out soon when I get my new set of electronics - that will take a while. 'There's other bits on the body work that need to get sorted out it so it will probably be getting painted for a third time and I've got new interior panels to put in as well. 'The plastics are a tan colour but mine aren't quite right so I've got a new set which need to go on which will make it look a bit more accurate.'","Scott Bainbridge spent £18,000 converting 25-year-old car into Kitt replica .

"Teenagers from across the country have dreamed up inventions from play parks that generate power to wardrobes that choose an outfit, in a bid to make life ‘better, simpler and easier’ in the future. Whimsical ideas entered for The Teen Tech Awards include a pen that spots spelling mistakes, and a way to grow your own clothes. Other designs, which have been presented at The Royal Society in London today, aimed to solve some of society’s more pressing problems and give people suffering from dementia, for example, extra care. Teenagers have dreamed up inventions of the future, including a pen that spots spelling mistakes, for The Teen Tech Awards.

The . awards is part of a drive by scientists and educators to increase the . number of teenagers obtaining qualifications in science, technology, . engineering and mathematics – known as Stem subjects. A total of one hundred teenagers from across the UK were picked to present their work to a team of judges, who included Top Gear’s James May, Stephen Fry, TV presenters Kate Russell and Maggie Philbin, as well as academics. The 'spellomatic pen' was the brainchild of three girls from Oldfield School in Somerset. It was designed to detect handwriting and point out if a word is spelt incorrectly. While it could be used by anyone, the smart pen is intended to help dyslexic people, in particular. Pupils from The Hayfield School, Doncaster, created Snap-Wrap, which is an idea for a smartwatch that tells people if they have eaten their five-a-day. A team of three girls from Hampton School in Greater London, came up with Scanner-Planner, which is a magnet that ‘solves all your best before date worries’. The magnet would clip to a fridge and set off an alarm when an item inside is out of date. In order to use the device, people would need to type the date into the device – before promptly forgetting to eat it. Say cheese! A total of one hundred teenagers from across the UK were picked to present their work to a team of judges, who included Top Gear's James May, seen posing here for a selfie . Year 8 pupils at Sandbach High School in Cheshire created a project called Grow Your Own Clothes. 'Trends moves so quickly these days, that as people try to keep up with fashion, their old clothes just get wasted...We wanted to create a biodegradable material that was affordable and on-trend and could be grown by anybody,' they said. To do this, the pupils mixed green tea with sugar and cider vinegar to create a culture that creates thin layers of fibres. It takes up to a month to develop and the resulting fabric can be dyed naturally with beetroot juice. Sarah Griffin, 15, a student from Loreto Grammar School, Cheshire, come up with the idea for ’Dementiago,’ a waterproof anklet that can be worn by dementia sufferers and allows family member and carers to track them using a smartphone app. Pupils from The Hayfield School, Doncaster, created Snap-Wrap, which is an idea for smartwatch that tells people if they have eaten their five-a-day. Alessia Coe, Thomas Cerenko and Drew Budtz are pictured left to right wearing their design . It would contain a microchip with the person’s name, age, address, next of kin and medical information on it, which could be scanned by medical professionals in the event of an emergency. Griffin designed the anklet to give people with dementia more freedom and family members peace of mind that their relative is safe. She won the healthcare category in the competition last year with a blood glucose monitor for diabetics, and is currently raising money to put it into production. A team of students from Stocksbridge High School, South Yorkshire, invented the MicroGlove for deaf people. Using built-in microphones, the glove would translate speech into text, which is displayed on a touchscreen. The person using the glove could either speak back naturally or even use the glove to reply in another language of their choice. All the inventions are intended to change the future of Britain and there are winners of each of the 15 categories, as well as an overall champion. The Duke of York also attended the competition. Sarah Griffin,15, (pictured) came up with - 'Dementiago' - an waterproof anklet that can be worn by dementia sufferers and allows family member and carers to track them using a smartphone app. Here, she explains her invention to Stephen Fry .

Breivik broke off cooperation with Christensen just before her death, . saying she did not want the book published. Publishers Aschehoug went . ahead, arguing it was in the public interest. Jens . Breivik, father of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, . spoke out today against a book about his late ex-wife in which he is . negatively portrayed. He is described in the book as a 'domestic tyrant', according to Norwegian Daily Dagbladet. Speaking . to Norwegian radio station P4, Breivik said the description of him in . the book was fictional, and stressed that the author did not contact him . while she was writing and researching the book. He said: 'It's completely made up. Almost nothing is rooted in reality.' Both Jens Breivik and his former wife are controversial figures in Norway. Grief: A woman touches a Norwegian flag as people gather around thousands of flowers and tributes laid outside the Oslo Cathedral in Oslo, in memory of the victims of July 22 bomb attack and shooting rampage committed by Anders Behring Breivik . When . told that his son had massacred people in cold blood, Breivik, a former . diplomat who lives in France, told reporters that Anders had ruined his . plans for a peaceful retirement. The . marriage ended when the couple's son was only one year old, and .

Wenche Behring Breivik was due to speak at her son's trial, but pulled out at the last minute.

Breivik, a right-wing anti-Islamic fanatic now aged 34, is serving Norway's maximum sentence in jail for the attacks, which were aimed at the Labour-led government and its youth wing. At the release of her book, Christensen told reporters it was unclear what caused Anders Breivik to become a killer. She said it was probably a blend of factors including genetics, family background, and social and political influences. Before the attacks, Wenche Breivik believed her son's explanation that he had become interested in hunting when she questioned why he had a rifle and a shotgun in his bedroom. A year after the killings she considered - but did not make - an appeal, to say: 'Dear fellow citizens, he who caused the tragedy also struck me. If I go out, someone will shoot me! I am the saddest mother in the world today.' '(I) have been terribly sad and cried a lot. In addition to the grief of losing a son the sense of guilt weighs heavily on me.

"Betting on high-stakes machines does cause harm by impairing players' ability to make decisions, according to a report yesterday. Academics tested a roulette-style game similar to controversial Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - and found that playing at higher stakes may fuel gambling problems. Gamers who staked £20 were more likely to make poor decisions afterwards, such as continuing to gamble regardless of the consequences, than those gambling £2. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals: Gamers who staked £20 were more likely to make poor decisions afterwards, such as continuing to gamble regardless of the consequences, than those gambling £2 (file picture) The research is published in a long-awaited report funded by the major bookmakers, who promised to reveal the ‘whole truth’ about whether the betting machines are harmful. But the study does not recommend cutting the stake on what have been dubbed ‘crack cocaine’ machines. Instead, the authors conclude that more research is needed in ‘real gambling environments’ to understand the full effects. Campaigners branded the report, which has been handed to ministers, a whitewash as researchers were not asked to study actual FOBT machines on which players can lose £100 per spin. The study is one of several published by the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT), an industry-funded charity. Its chair Neil Goulden, the former boss of Gala Coral, said in March last year: ‘Betting machines have long been blamed for problem gambling but that has never been backed up by evidence. ‘I have the backing of the Gambling Commission and the Government. I want this study to deliver the whole truth.’ In one of the studies, which looks at the impact of how much people stake, University of Lincoln researchers asked 32 regular gamers to play virtual roulette with no money, £2 or £20. Former Gala Coral boss: Neil Goulden, chair of the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT), an industry-funded charity, said in March last year that he wanted the study to 'deliver the whole truth' Afterwards the participants did questionnaires designed to test their decision-making ability. Those who had staked more, whether they won or lost, made more ‘impulsive and poor quality decisions’. The researchers said: ‘It was demonstrated that gambling on a virtual roulette simulation at higher stakes impairs decision-making quality, which in turn may reduce self-control when gambling.’ Problem gambling, they explain, is ‘characterised by a lack of control and impaired decision-making performance, with a disregard for future negative consequences of gambling.’ They said the effects they saw may also be ‘muted’ by the fact players were not spending their own money, but were given it for the experiment, and could not choose the stake themselves. But they concluded that the study, which they said was carried out in a laboratory to control all the other variables, needed to be undertaken in a betting shop to understand the effects. Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which calls for the stake on FOBTs to be slashed, said: ‘Whilst this research did not focus solely on FOBTs and why they are addictive, the one strand that is relevant to this debate clearly shows that the £100 stake is harmful. ‘If this type of research is necessary why was it not included in the initial study? It is looking increasingly likely that the Responsible Gambling Trust is once again being used to try to kick this issue into the long grass.’ Unimpressed: Sir Robin Wales (above), the mayor of the London borough of Newham - which is also calling for curbs on the machines - said it was clear that the report 'only has the interests of the industry at its heart' Sir Robin Wales, the mayor of the London borough of Newham - which is also calling for curbs on the machines - said: ‘It is clear that this report only has the interests of the industry at its heart. 'The £100 stake is harmful': Campaigner Matt Zarb-Cousin said it appeared the RGT was 'again being used to try to kick this issue into the long grass' ‘We were promised ""the whole truth"" about fixed odd betting terminals. 'Instead we have a half-hearted and woefully inadequate attempt which makes absolutely no concrete recommendations… to help problem gamblers, the communities they belong to or the nation’s high streets.’ The RGT insist their report is ‘world leading and independently conducted’ and gives them a wealth of evidence which could help identify problem gamblers. They point to one of the other studies, by NatCen social research, which looked at data on the behaviour of 4,000 gamers. The researchers were able identify problem gamblers using factors such as speed and duration of play, not just the stake. Mr Goulden said yesterday: ‘The researchers have shown that it is possible to distinguish between problem and non-problem gaming machine play, and they have provided many important insights about player behaviour. ‘This research has huge potential to inform the industry’s approach to minimising gambling-related harm and we strongly urge the industry to make every effort to improve how problem behaviour is more effectively monitored and managed in the future.’ There are 33,000 FOBT machines across the country and they account for half of bookmakers profits. Customers and betting shop managers have blamed them for fuelling gambling addiction. Clive Efford, Labour’s shadow sports minister, said: ‘It is disappointing that this research cannot tell us how levels of stakes and prizes impact on problem gamblers. This was promised by the Prime Minister and it is hugely embarrassing for him that it does not provide the information.’","Academics tested roulette-style game similar to controversial FOBTs .

"Joe Lynskey, pictured, was abducted and murdered by the IRA in August 1972 and his body buried in an unmarked grave believed to be in County Meath . Investigators scouring bogland for the remains of a former Cistercian monk have brought in a specialist sniffer dog to help with the search. Joe Lynskey went missing from west Belfast in August 1972. Almost 40 years later, the IRA admitted it had kidnapped, killed and secretly buried him. Lead investigator Geoff Knupfer said: 'We will use every means at our disposal to try to narrow the search area until hopefully we get to a point where we can bring in the forensic archaeologists to go beneath the surface. 'The cadaver dog is one of the resources we can use.' The dog had been specially trained to detect signs of human remains and will work alongside geophysicists using ground penetrating radar to identify anomalies under the surface which could indicate a grave site. Preparatory work at the site in Coghalstown Co Meath was started last month after the International Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICVLR) said it had received fresh information. The searches are being carried out close to Oristown Bog where the remains of 23-year-old Brendan Megraw were recovered last month. Mr Knupfer added: 'As with of all of the Disappeared we are facing a huge task in this case going back over 40 years and dealing with a search area of around six hectares (15 acres) in the first instance. 'We have to remember that it took four searches over nearly 15 years before we found Brendan Megraw. 'We are just at the beginning of the process for Joe Lynskey. 'But as the recovery of Brendan's remains at the beginning of October shows, where we have accurate information we will find the Disappeared.' Mr Lynskey was one of 17 people abducted, killed and clandestinely buried by republicans. Geoff Knupfer, pictured, confirmed that he was planning to bring in cadaver dogs to search for the remains . Kieran Megraw, left, spent almost 40 years campaigning for the return of his brother's remains. Brendan Megraw, right, was one of the 17 people abducted, murdered and buried in an unmarked grave by the IRA . Mr Knupfer's team successfully recovered the remains of IRA victim Brendan Megraw in October . That list includes Gareth O'Connor who was murdered in 2003. His body was recovered on June 11 2005 at Victoria Quay, Newry Canal, Co Louth. The Commission has investigated 16 of the Disappeared. To date the remains of 10 people have been recovered. Mr Knupfer said they were still keen to receive information. He said: 'We cannot over emphasise the importance of information coming to the ICLVR. 'And once again I can give the assurance of a cast iron guarantee of complete anonymity to those who bring information to the Commission.' Anyone with information on any of the Disappeared should contact the ICLVR on 00800 555 85500, by writing to ICLVR, PO Box 10827, Dublin 2 or via the website www.iclvr.ie. Last month, the Police Service of Northern Ireland arrested a leading republican over the 1972 abduction and murder of Belfast mother-of-ten Jean McConville. Bobby Storey was believed to have been the IRA's head of intelligence and was a close confidant of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. Mr Adams was also questioned by detectives investigating the crime in May. He said he was 'innocent of any part' of the murder.","Joe Lynskey was abducted and murdered by the IRA in August 1972 .

"An angler who won a fishing competition with a huge bass that he stole from an aquarium has been let off the hook by a judge who spared him from jail. Sneaky Matthew Clark, 29, pinched the 13lb fish from the tourist attraction but pretended that he had in fact caught it in a gruelling sea fishing contest. He won the £800 first prize and proudly posed for photos with his winning 'catch' dangling beside him. But a fellow competitor smelled something fishy when he recognised the bass from a recent trip to the aquarium with his family . Something Fishy: Angler Matt Clark, 29, pinched this 13oz bass from an aquarium in St Peter Port, Guernsey to win a sea fishing competition . The other fisherman quickly . alerted aquarium staff who realised that the fish was missing, as well . as competition organisers who informed the police. He was today ordered by a . judge to carry out 100 hours of community service after he admitted . burglary and fraud charges. Judge Phillip Robey told Clark that his acts had been 'mean to the aquarium and anglers', but spared him a jail sentence. He also ordered Clark to take an oath of good behaviour for two years, and told him that he would face jail if he broke the terms of the sentence handed to him at Guernsey Magistrates Court in the Channel Islands. The court heart how Clark, of St Sampson, Guernsey, had previously worked at the island's St Peter Port Aquarium and owed the manager, Dave Miller, £1,500. He hatched a plan to break into the building and steal the fish to win the competition before returning the bass to its tank and use his prize winning cash to pay off some of his debt. At 6.30pm on July 9 last year - the final day of the Bailiwick Bass Club Open Competition - Clark scaled cliffs and climbed a rope ladder to reach the building before he entered the aquarium through a back door. The bungling raider dropped the fish as he made his escape and injured it, but managed to pick it up again and carry it to the 8pm  'weigh-in' at a nearby fishing tackle shop Tackle Direct. The enormous fish tipped the scales at 13lb 13oz - trouncing the nearest competitor who only managed a catch of 10lb 3oz. Clark was congratulated by the other contestants and was due to pick up his winnings at a ceremony later in the week. Posing: Clark proudly posed with his 'winning' fish and had been due to collect his £800 winnings when another angler recognised the bass from the aquarium . However, fellow entrant Shane Bentley, 38, thought that he had seen the winning fish before. Speaking before the hearing, he said: 'Me and my wife were taking the kids to the aquarium and we'd seen a bass in a tank - it stood out because it had some very distinct markings on its head. 'I had gone to congratulate the winner because I heard it was a monster, and when I saw it I thought ""heck, that's a beauty"". 'It wasn't until the bass was lifted out of the tank for the photo that I thought ""that's the fish from the aquarium"". 'I immediately informed club members of my suspicions but they laughed. 'The next morning I took ten minutes off work to go to the aquarium. 'They hadn't opened but the women let me in and I said, ""where's that big bass with marks on its head?"". 'I looked in the tank but I couldn't see . the fish, then the woman looked as well and she couldn't find the fish. She then called the owner down and he couldn't see the fish.' Mr Bentley, who has been fishing for more than 25 years, immediately contacted the competition organisers, who alerted police.Officers seized the head from the winning fish carcass and photographs of the missing bass as evidence as they investigated. Evidence: Clark had planned to return the fish to the aquarium before anyone noticed it had gone, but was said to have panicked and sold it to a fishmonger . When he was arrested, Clark maintained that he had caught the fish off rocks near Beaucette. However, he later confessed in full. The court heard how competition . entrants had spent days battling bad weather in their efforts to catch . the biggest bass for a top prize of £800. Mr . Bentley, who himself stood in the rain for hours until he snagged a 5lb . bass, said it was 'fate' that he had been to the aquarium two weeks . before. The club has 66 members and the 2012 open competition had 29 entrants. Fishing club president Daryl Butcher said: 'It's unusual, to say the least.' Sam Maindonald, mitigating, said that Clark was under pressure from debt collectors and regretted stealing the fish. She said that as a result of the offences Clark had lost his home and partner, as well as contact with his children. A spokesman for the aquarium said that Clark had intended to return the sea bass but panicked and sold it to a fishmonger instead - who killed it. She claimed he had stolen the fish because he was 'arrogant' and 'so competitive he has to win'. 'The whole thing was completely bizarre and happened in a 24 hour period,' she said. 'Not exactly the average day for an aquarium. 'The fishing competition was on the Monday so on the Monday evening he broke in and stole the sea bass. 'That same night he took it along to the judges and produced it and was told he'd won the contest. But everyone there knew something was going on. 'He had intended to bring it back and put it in the tank but he knew he'd been rumbled and panicked. 'He took it to a fish seller who didn't realise it was stolen and chopped it up. All we got back was the head and tail. 'He only did it because he's massively arrogant and competitive. 'He had to to win the competition and decided to steal from us to do it.'

"The average female porn star is a brunette from California with a size 34B chest, a new series of detailed infographics has revealed. Analysis into 10,000 profiles on the Internet Adult Film Database, by writer Jon Millward, took into account each woman's height, weight, bra size, name, race and birthplace. Defying the stereotype of the buxom blonde, he found that the average bra size is a relatively modest 34B and that most female performers are brunettes, rather than blondes or redheads. Miss Average Adult Film: A facial morph using photographs of ten top female porn stars illustrates how the typical performer is a brunette from California with a size 34B chest . In fact, Mr Millward reveals, most people believe that the average porn star is a DD. This bra cup size actually ranks fourth, after B, C and D. She will typically weigh 117lbs, 48lbs less than the national average, and be 5ft 5in tall. He also found that 42per cent of women in the industry have a tattoo, and 40per cent have a piercing somewhere other than their ears. The raciest race? An overwhelming majority - 70per cent of porn performers - are white, the study revealed, with just 14per cent of them black, 9.3per cent Latina and  5.2per cent Asian . An overwhelming majority - 70per cent of porn performers - are white, the study revealed, with just 14per cent of them black, 9.3per cent Latina and  5.2per cent Asian. The ten most prolific female porn stars have slept with an average of 148 men over an average career length of 17.7 years . It seems the typical female performer is also most likely to use the name Nikki Lee, given that Nikki and Lee are the most common first and last names respectively. Jessica, Lisa, Kelly and Angel are also popular first name choices for women, while David is the most common for men. Typically, a woman in the industry starts her career at the age of 22 - a figure that has not changed over the past 40 years, he found, though the average starting age for their male counterparts has been getting progressively younger (from 29 to the current age 24). Fair game: Defying the stereotype of the buxom blonde, the study shows that most porn stars are brunette . The figures: The average female porn star weighs 48lbs less than the average woman. She is 5ft 4in tall and wears a 32B size bra . She will stay in the business for just three years and do 19 films in that time - this figure has fallen since the Seventies when women worked in porn for an average of nine years. The ten most prolific female performers, have an average career length of 17.7 years, and have slept with an average of 148 men in that time. The ten most prolific male porn stars, in comparison, have slept with an average of 1,013 women in a 22.4-year career. Four times as many female porn stars hail from California than anywhere else, Mr Millward reveals, with 939 of the porn stars profiled citing the West Coast state as their place of birth. The second most common birthplace was Florida, with 216 hailing from the Sunshine State. What's in a name? The most popular moniker for women in porn is Nikki, while David is the favorite for men. Lee is the most common last name, even though it is only the 24th most popular in the U.S. overall . State of affairs: Four times as many female porn stars hail from California than anywhere else, with 939 of the porn stars profiled citing the West Coast state as their place of birth . Mr Millward also charted the type of roles each woman is typically cast in, the movie titles, and the sex acts they are prepared to perform on camera. The most common female porn role, for instance, was 'teen', which appeared in 1,966 titles. 'MILF' (acronym for Mother I'd Like to F***) was in 954 film titles, while 'wife', 'cheerleader' and 'nurse' also ranked highly. Role play: The average age for a MILF is younger than one might imagine. At just 33, the women playing these roles are certainly younger than 'Stifler's Mom' in the American Pie series . Setting oneself apart: 42per cent of women in the industry have a tattoo, and 40per cent have a piercing somewhere other than their ears . The . average age for a MILF is younger than one might imagine, though. At . just 33, the women playing these roles are certainly younger than . 'Stifler's Mom' in the American Pie series, in which the acronym was . coined. Indeed, just seven per cent are over 40. Writing about the reasons he decided to undertake the extensive research project, Mr Millward says he had long wanted to 'plunder [the Internet Adult Film Database's] treasure trove of juicy information.' He explains that the study enabled him to 'find out . once and for all which stereotypes about porn stars are true, which are . bogus, and what these men and women have been doing for the last forty . years.'

"A member of the US Senate was caught this week trying to make a rather conspicuous edit to Edward Snowden's Wikipedia page .

Tell us how you really feel: An editor with an IP address traced back to the US Senate attempted to change Edward Snowden's wikipedia entry to call him a 'traitor' First noticed by Wikipedia watchdog Wikipediocracy, the change is not the first made by that user, but is the first malicious act, according to the IP address' Wikipedia activity log. The attempted edit, made August 2, was rejected by a moderator on the grounds it ‘seemed less than neutral,’ according to the posted rejection, which also listed the IP address and showed it was registered to the US Senate.

In a somewhat transparent move, the edit came one day after Snowden was granted a one year asylum in Russia. While opinions may be divided on what Snowden really is, Wikipedia generally snuffs partisan edits out pretty quickly. Other entries made by the Capitol Hill regular include deleting a word from the first paragraph of an entry for ‘The Five People You Meet in Heaven,’ clarifying that the FSIS is part of the USDA, not the FDA in an entry for ‘Pork,’ and correctly noting in the entry for the ‘Ruger Super Redhawk’ that the firearm is still ‘in production’ with ‘4” availability,’ among others.

"John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage  ended acrimoniously . An internet bride who made her fortune in the UK after marrying a British man she met online is now fighting her in the divorce courts for a 'fair share' of her wealth. Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, left Crimea for Leicester in 1999 after meeting John Yates through an international dating site and went on to earn more than he did. She had left for Britain for love and a better financial future because the average annual wage can be as low as £2,000-a-year at home. In her 12-years in the UK she has risen to a senior administrator at De Montfort University and amassed assets and cash. Now her truck-driving husband, who lives in a council house after they split two years ago, is taking her to court because he claims he deserves the 'fair share' of her wealth. Mrs Ivleva is living in their home in Leicester with her grown up son from a previous marriage, Robert, 26. Mr Yates says he is languishing with 'nothing' in council accommodation and insists he is due a 'fair share' of her money. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Ivleva told Mr Yates that she had divorced him in Ukraine, and this has sparked a bitter legal battle. She then tried to get her foreign divorce recognised in England in March but High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused. He said that Mrs Ivleva had 'trailed her coat' by keeping her husband in the dark about details of the Ukrainian proceedings until it was too late for him to do anything about them. Describing their relationship as a 'limping marriage', he said 'basic fairness' to Mr Yates demanded that he be given the opportunity to divorce his wife in England. In his 'emphatic' ruling, the judge said that, although the divorce had been advertised in a Ukrainian newspaper, Mr Yates spoke very little of his wife's native language. In the latest legal skirmish Mrs Ivleva's son spoke on her behalf as she challenged the judge's decision at the Court of Appeal. Split: The couple, pictured together in 2005, broke up two years ago and Mrs Ivleva has claimed that she already secured a divorce in Ukraine - but the British court won't accept it . She claimed to have suffered discrimination as a foreign wife and that the ruling amounted to an 'attack on the integrity' of the Ukrainian courts. However, sitting judge Lady Justice King sided with Mr Yates and described the judge's refusal to recognise her Ukrainian divorce as 'exemplary' and 'unimpeachable'. The ruling opened the way for Mr Yates to pursue his county court divorce petition and seek financial orders against his wife. He said outside court after the ruling: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing and I'm entitled to a fair share. 'I'm living in council accommodation from day-to-day. She can afford to go on holiday. I can't'. He added that he expected his decree nisi to go through on January 5, finally ending his marriage.","Marina Ivleva, 49, left Ukraine to marry John Yates from Leicester in 1999 .

"A California court is due to hear from Apple founder Steve Jobs this week - despite the fact he died from pancreatic cancer three years ago. Jobs, who revived the company's fortunes by designing the game-changing iPod, iPhone and iPad products, will appear before jurors in a video recorded before his death in an attempt to save the company from a $1billion fine. He will provide evidence to defend Apple from charges that the way it used its iTunes music store forced people into buying iPods and stopped them choosing cheaper mp3 players by rivals. Back fighting for Apple: Jobs, pictured above in 2006, will appear via video in a California court room to defend his company from claims of anti-competitive behavior . According to electronics companies and consumers, who have accused Apple of anti-competitive behavior under federal anti-trust laws, the iTunes software helped inflate the price of iPods by stopping other rival devices from getting a look in. The contentious software is no longer used - but according to the plaintiffs it let Apple make $350million in extra profit from 2006 to 2009. Old-school: The claims relate to 2006-2009, when iPods (left) reigned supreme. It is claimed the device's value was puffed up by software on the iTunes media player which dissuaded consumers from buying other devices, such as the Creative Zen player, a version of which is shown left . Under federal law, Apple could be liable to a fine of three times that amount - $1.05billion - provided the jury agree that the software was anti-competitive and agree with the estimate. Jobs died on October 5, 2011, eight years after he was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He struggled with the disease for years, but continued to be involved in most major product launches up until 2009.

"Dr Organic's Snail Gel face and body cream was so successful, manufacturers are now extending range . It is the perfect thing if you want to slow down the ageing process to a snail’s pace. Slime harvested from the creatures is the key ingredient in new range of anti-ageing products. The makers claim they can make users appear six years younger in just four weeks. Following the success of a Snail Gel face and body cream, manufacturers are now releasing a wider range of products backed by a £600,000 marketing campaign. The campaign will be fronted by the singer turned model – Louise Redknapp – while it is also understood to be used by A list celebrities such as Katie Holmes and Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts. The slime is a key ingredient in products devised by the Dr Organic range available exclusively through Holland & Barrett. The products contain a cocktail of proteins, antioxidants and hyaluronic acid which removes dead cells, reduces inflammation and helps skin retain moisture. The benefits for human skin were discovered by Chilean snail farmers who noticed their skin healed quickly without scarring when they handled the creatures which were being exported to France. Dr Oganic marketing director, Martin Lightowlers, said: ‘It sounds like something you wouldn’t want to put on your face, but you would be surprised. ‘It is obtained from snail farms that are created to support them, look after them and help build the population. Essentially, they are there to help the snails mate. Scroll down for video . ‘They are given a natural plant hormone, this helps them to secrete hormones to mate. ‘When they travel across glass plates to get to their partner the snail secretion is collected. That is then turned into a powder which is used in cosmetic ingredients. All the products use snail slime - Helix Aspersa Muller - together with natural extracts known for their anti-ageing benefits, including aloe vera and jojoba . ‘The reason the snail secretes this gel is so that it can regenerate itself or its shell, once it has been harmed. When it is used on the face it is helping to regenerate the skin cells.’ The original beauty gel sells for £19.99 for a 50ml pot, and this is now being joined by an eye serum, face mask, face cream and hand and nail elixir. All the products use snail slime - Helix Aspersa Muller - together with natural extracts known for their anti-ageing benefits, including aloe vera and jojoba. Dr Organic said that an additional anti-ageing ingredient called proteolea has been added across the portfolio and enabled the brand to claim that users would look ‘six years younger in four weeks’. The campaign for new range will be fronted by the singer turned model – Louise Redknapp (pictured) – while it is also understood to be used by A list celebrities such as Katie Holmes and Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts . Kate Waddell, director of consumer brands at design agency Dragon Rouge said the range is a good fit with the trend towards more extreme beauty and skin regimes. But she told The Grocer magazine that consumers would need some ‘serious reassurance’ and positive reviews from real women if they are to be won over. She said: ‘The key question with a snail slime-based product is when does the 'eeeww' factor tip the balance to 'wow' factor?’","Slime from snails is key ingredient in new range of anti-ageing products .

"Defiant: Barrister Camilla Block has refused to co-operate on the two-part ITV drama . The youngest daughter of Lord Lucan has spoken for the first time about her father’s mysterious disappearance and condemned a new TV drama about the case that shocked high society. Lucan vanished in 1974 after the death of his children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett. An inquest subsequently found that he murdered her. But barrister Lady Camilla Bloch said it was important to remember that her father had never stood trial and insisted that evidence against him was ‘circumstantial’. The mother of four also revealed she had refused to co-operate with a two-part ITV programme - called Lucan - which will recreate the moment Rivett is bludgeoned to death in the Lucan family home in Belgravia, Central London, on the night of November 7, 1974. She said: ‘As a lawyer I hope it’s not old-fashioned to point out that my father never stood trial. It is unfortunate that he is regularly referred to – in almost factual terms – as a murderer. ‘He has never been able to defend himself and the evidence was not conclusive. It was circumstantial.’ On the night in question, Camilla, who was then aged four, was asleep upstairs with her brother George, seven, in the four-storey house in Lower Belgrave Street. Ms Rivett, 29, was bludgeoned to death in the basement kitchen in what police believed was a case of mistaken identity. Camilla’s parents had separated the year before and the children were wards of court, with Lord Lucan having lost a bitter custody battle with his wife Veronica. In love: Lucan, who vanished in 1974, announced his engagement to Veronica Duncan on October 14, 1963 . He had taken to spying on his estranged wife and his children, and lived just 100 yards away in Eaton Row. Lady Lucan, 75, last night revealed she had also refused to co-operate with the TV production. She said: ‘I don’t think it is right that a criminal matter should be used for entertainment. The film is based on the most absurd book I have ever read on the Lucan affair so I didn’t think it was sensible to have anything to do with it.’ Skyfall star Rory Kinnear will portray Lucan – aged 39 when he vanished – as a reckless gambler but a devoted father who will stop at nothing to win custody of his children. His estranged wife is played by Catherine McCormack. Producers say they have gone to great lengths to piece together what they believe are the precise details of the crime. Viewers will see a desperate Lord Lucan weighing up the pros and cons of murdering his wife before entering her Belgravia home and lying in wait for her in the pitch-black basement kitchen. Mystery: The family's nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death on the evening of November 7, 1974 . Lucan removes the light bulb from the room and in the chaos that follows he mistakes Ms Rivett, played by Leanne Best, for his wife and beats her to death with a piece of  lead piping. The first episode, which will include a shot of Rivett’s lifeless body,  will end with the shocked peer’s  realisation that he has killed the wrong woman. Part two of the drama will begin with his subsequent attack on Lady Lucan, which left her with facial injuries. She manages to calm him down before escaping to a nearby pub. Lady Bloch, an eminent QC, said her thoughts were with the Rivett family and described them as ‘the real victims of this tragedy’. She said: ‘It is certainly not a drama I will be watching and it sounds as if it is in extremely poor taste. ‘My concern is for the Rivett family. My heart goes out to her sons and her broader family. ‘These programmes are very rarely welcomed by my family and certainly are not welcomed by the  Rivetts, for whom this will be very painful indeed.’ Lady Bloch said ITV had contacted her about the project several months ago but had not kept her up to date with its progress. She said: ‘I was advised in very general terms many months ago that a programme was being planned. ‘I wasn’t given any insight to the angle which was being pursued. And although I was told I would be kept up to date I haven’t had any further communication from ITV.’ She added: ‘ITV wrote to me to advise that they were making the programme and as I recall they asked whether I’d like to participate. ‘I responded thanking them for notifying me and I said that I didn’t wish to participate.’ Recreation: The drama - called Lucan - will recreate the moment Rivett is bludgeoned to death in the Lucan family home in Belgravia, Central London. Above, the programme is filmed in the capital last month . Lucan’s disappearance and the lack of an actual criminal trial means the case has attracted a seemingly endless series of conspiracy theories. There have been numerous alleged sightings of the peer - from India to South America and Africa - but none of them has ever been substantiated. He was declared legally dead in October 1999. The car in which in he fled the murder scene was later found in the port of Newhaven, East Sussex, and it is believed he caught a ferry from there to France. Lady Bloch refused to be drawn on her views on the crime. ‘I don’t have a perspective on it,’ she said. ‘I don’t have any insights that other people don’t have or a case theory.’ Lady Lucan last night said she was bored with the constant claims that her husband might still be alive and of the numerous unconfirmed sightings of him. She is adamant her husband took his own life shortly after the crime and that she had long ago learned to forgive him. Bloody: This shocking image from the new drama shows the body of Rivett lying on the floor . She said: ‘I believe my late husband committed suicide shortly after the murder of Sandra, most probably by bravely throwing himself on to the propellers of a ship in mid-Channel, hoping that his remains would be irrecoverable so that death duties would not be immediately payable as the children’s education had not been secured. 'My husband committed suicide because he was an honourable man.’ She added: ‘Of course, I have learned to forgive him.’ When asked about the British public’s continued obsession with the case, Lady Lucan replied: ‘I didn’t realise people were fascinated with such a dull subject.’ The new drama, written by the Bafta winner Jeff Pope, is based on John Pearson’s 2005 book Gamblers. The book explores the friendship between members of the notorious Clermont gambling club, which included Lord Lucan, John Aspinall, who will be played in the drama by Christopher Eccleston, Mark Birley and James Goldsmith. Shocking: In this still, Catherine McCormack is depicted as a blood-soaked Lady Lucan . The drama, which will be screened by ITV next month, begins with Pearson carrying out interviews for the book and the episodes are believed to stick very closely to his theories about the crime and Lucan’s subsequent fate. Producers are keeping precise details of the plot under wraps but it is understood the drama’s action will end in 1975. Sources have revealed that Lucan’s only son, George Bingham, has met the producers to seek assurances that he will not be portrayed as an adult, and that the show will steer clear of claims that Lucan was reunited with his children on a family holiday to Africa. A source close to the production said that the film would present Lucan as the killer. The source said: ‘There are some conspiracy theories out there that say that there was someone else in the house or someone wanted to kill Sandra Rivett but the film won’t make any time for those. ‘The researchers have concluded that it’s doubtful whether Lord Lucan even knew Sandra.’ The programme will claim that Lucan had concocted a ‘very complicated alibi’ but his plans were dashed when Rivett, rather than his wife, entered the room where he was hiding that fateful night. The sequence of events will show Lucan taking out the lightbulb in the kitchen in the basement of the house and then waiting for his wife to come in. The peer’s plan goes correctly up until the moment when the wrong person enters the room. In the dark he fails to recognise Rivett and hits her over her head repeatedly in a brutal attack. After the murder in the film, Lucan goes upstairs to clean off the length of lead piping and then hears his wife calling. He attacks her but she manages to escape. The 90-minute episodes will also focus on the  events leading up to the tragedy, including the breakdown of the couple’s marriage and the bitter custody battle  that followed. It will also depict the attempt by Lord Lucan to have his wife committed, which failed after she had been examined by psychiatrists and was declared of sound mind – a decision that later helped her to win the custody battle. The team behind the production have used photographs from the crime scene to help with their  re-creation of the murder. A spokeswoman for ITV last night insisted that it had given everyone connected with the case a chance to raise any issues. The broadcaster had not previously been aware of any concerns and believed the drama would provide new insights into the case. The spokeswoman said: ‘ITV has contacted everyone immediately connected with the story  and given them a chance to discuss any concerns. ‘No one connected had declared they were unhappy about us pursuing the drama. This includes the Lucan family and, in particular, the family of Sandra Rivett. ‘The drama seeks to provide a  new insight into the events and, crucially, attempts to answer  the riddle of what became of  Lord Lucan.’","Lady Camilla Bloch insists evidence against her father was 'circumstantial'

"Luke Shaw may be Britain’s most expensive defender, but he isn’t au fait with one of the country’s most iconic centre-halves. According to Shaw’s former England international team-mate Frank Lampard, the £27million Manchester United defender came unstuck when quizzed about Arsenal and England legend Tony Adams. Adams is one of England’s most decorated defenders, captaining the Gunners from the age of 21 and then his country later in his career. On the ball: Luke Shaw (left) signed for Man United in the summer, and Tony Adams in action for England . He won four Premier League titles, becoming the only player in English football history to have captained a title-winning team in three different decades, and was capped 66 times by the Three Lions. But Lampard claims Shaw, 19, wasn’t up to speed with the legendary defender when he came up in conversation at last summer's World Cup. ‘I was having a chat with Luke Shaw and I mentioned Tony Adams and he didn’t seem to know who I was talking about,’ Lampard, who retired from international football last month, told The Sun. ‘I said: “Are you winding me up?” And he said: “Who did he play for?” I knew then then it was time to retire.’ Time to celebrate: Adams lifts the Premier League trophy in 1998 (left) and four years later in 2002 .

"Whistleblower: A sacked PC who leaked details of Andrew Mitchell's pleb outburst said today he would do it again . A PC sacked for revealing that Andrew Mitchell called Downing Street officers 'f****** plebs' has said today he would do it again because the MP believed he was 'untouchable'. Whistleblower James Glanville, 47, believes the incident two years ago would have been 'covered up' because Scotland Yard  is 'more afraid of upsetting politicians than looking after their own'. Last week Tory MP Mr Mitchell lost his libel battle for calling police officers 'f****** plebs' who should 'know their place' because they would not let him through the Downing Street gates on his bike. Mr Glanville, who leaked details of the row in September 2012, was sacked, racked up £13,000 of debt because of spiralling legal costs and the strain also cost him his marriage. But the diplomatic protection officer, who served for 23 years and received a bravery award for tackling violent burglars, has no regrets about what happened. 'I'd do it all again tomorrow. I thought the public deserved to know how someone that senior in the Government behaved,' he told The Sun. 'I was incensed by what Andrew Mitchell had said and I knew it would get covered up. 'Mitchell has been allowed to discredit anybody and say whatever he wants. He thought he was untouchable. Now he has been exposed as the bully he is'. The former Met officer said he was furious because Mr Mitchell had been rude to police officers just days after to PCs were murdered in Manchester by Dale Cregan. 'We're stood there 24/7 in all weathers to protect these people. Why should we put our lives on the line if that's the sort of respect someone like Mitchell has for us?' Mr Glanville said he had thought it likely no one would take action over the incident, which he heard about a few hours after it happened, so he 'picked up the phone' to the newspaper. But three other officers have also lost their jobs in the aftermath of the incident, which was said to last no more than a minute. Evidence: CCTV issued by the Metropolitan Police shows Andrew Mitchell (bottom left) approaching officers prior to the 'childish' exchange with  officers at the gates of Downing Street in 2012 . Counter-action: PC Rowland, pictured last week, has sued Andrew Mitchell over his claims he falsely suggested that he had fabricated his allegations two years ago in a case that has cost at least £3million . Pc Keith Wallis was jailed and dismissed for emailing his MP pretending to have witnessed the confrontation. Pc Susan Johnson lost her job after she exchanged text messages and a phone call with Mr Glanville around the time he contacted the tabloid, and for failing to report that Wallis had sent her a copy of his email. Pc Gillian Weatherley, who was on duty on the day of the confrontation between Mr Mitchell and Mr Rowland, was sacked over leaks to the press. She sent a photograph of an email Mr Rowland had sent to his bosses about the row to Mr Glanville. Mr Glanville, who now works as a car salesman in Essex, has told The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn he was sorry Ms Weatherley was dismissed, insisting she had no idea he had been in contact with the press. He says that Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe and other management should have protected their workers. He said: 'The hierarchy should have backed their officers from the outset. But they didn't.' Last week Mr Justice Mitting reached the 'firm conclusion' that the 58-year-old MP used the 'politically toxic' word in Downing Street when he was not allowed to cycle through the main vehicle gates. Mr Mitchell, who resigned as a whip a month after the altercation, denied during his two-week libel action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) that he had said: 'Best you learn your f****** place - you don't run this f****** government - you're f****** plebs.' He said he would never call a policeman a pleb, 'let alone a f****** pleb', although he agreed he muttered under his breath 'I thought you lot were supposed to f****** help us' - but not directed at the officer. Swearing: Mr Mitchell (file picture from May 2011) also muttered under his breath 'I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us' Mr Mitchell, who faces a hefty legal bill of up to £3million, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' with the ruling. His political career is also in tatters over the incident . In a statement, Scotland Yard said: 'Mr Glanville was dismissed from the MPS without notice, as it was found that he had breached standards of professional behaviour in relation to honesty and integrity; confidentiality; orders and instructions; duties and responsibilities; and discreditable conduct, this included providing inaccurate statements to the investigation team. 'There was no attempt to 'cover up' anything on the part of the MPS. 'Both Mr Mitchell and Pc Rowland had agreed the matter to be concluded shortly after it happened.'","Whistleblower James Glanville, 47, lost his job after 23 years service .

Elsewhere an amber sunrise lit up the morning skies as seen over the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire which were blanketed by light fog . The coldest temperatures last night were seen in Scotland, where -1.7C was recorded in Balmoral. England and Wales were, expectedly, milder, though chillier air lingered in western areas. A change will be felt throughout the country today after a relatively warmer weekend, the Met Office said. 'There'll be a lot of crisp, winter sunshine for with Tuesday night into Wednesday morning expected to be the coldest at between -1 and -2C. 'Particularly in the south east corner it'll feel pretty cold, temperatures will not get much higher than 7 or 8C and there'll be a lot of cloud around which will make it feel colder.

Spawn was seen in North Predannack Downs nature reserve in Cornwall on November 21, the earliest sighting at the site since 2005. Rangers at the trust fear the frogs have been confused by the weather and that their spawn is now at risk of being killed for winter temperatures. 'Although spring is generally arriving earlier, to receive a frogspawn sighting before winter has properly begun is highly unusual,' said . Dr Kate Lewthwaite. 'Sadly it is unlikely the spawn will now survive the frosts we are experiencing. 'We need people to keep adding their valuable information to our survey to allow scientists to learn whether frogs are able to adapt or not. Elsewhere trees are blooming with pale pink blossoms.

This week's weather is slightly colder than what was seen in 2013, when the average temperature for December in England was more than 9C. But the unseasonably warm temperatures over the last few months made autumn one of the balmiest on record, and brought on the early arrival of a fall of lambs, according to one farmer. David Coupland said he was convinced the unexpected birth of two sets of the animals had been encouraged by the warm autumn weather.

"Baby Gammy and his birth mother have moved into a brand new home, thanks to $250,000 raised by donations from thousands of social media users. The 11-month-old had been living in a small one-bedroom unit in the care of his birth mother,  and through funds donated by Australians, has now moved into a three-bedroom home held in trust by charity Hands Across Water. Baby Gammy made headlines around the world when his surrogate mother claimed that his Australian parents had abandoned him when they realised he had been born with Down syndrome, but had taken home his twin sister Pipah, who appeared to be healthy. Scroll down for video . The 11-month-old had been living in a small one-bedroom unit in the care of his birth mother, and through funds donated by Australians, has now moved into a three-bedroom home . Despite the vulnerable financial position of his birth mother,  Pattaramon Chanbua,  baby Gammy was well cared for by the Thai woman, expressing her commitment to raising him with her husband Goy as one of her own, along with her two other children, reported 9 News. She said, through the aid of a translator, that baby Gammy was 'her responsibility'. West Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell deny the claims, and say they have been tirelessly trying to bring Gammy home to be with his sister. Ms Chanbua, 21, said that there are still health concerns for Gammy, who suffers from a lung condition as well as his diagnosis of Down syndrome. 'He eats a lot, and his development is good', Ms Chanbua said. Baby Gammy and his mother have moved into a new house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for his family through public donations . Baby Gammy made headlines around the world when his surrogate mother claimed that his Australian parents had abandoned him when they realised he had been born with Down syndrome . The 21-year-old, who has two other children aged six and three, has vowed to take care of Gammy . Gammy's new three-bedroom house is in the same area as the Chanbua family's unit, two hours outside of Bangkok. It has cream coloured walls and is shown to have furniture, a television set, and kids toys filling the rooms. The Thai woman said that the move to a larger house will be of benefit to Gammy, and allowed his two other siblings, six and three, to have the 'space to run around the house'. Hanging above the doorframe of Gammy's new house is a sign which reads ‘A home for baby Gammy’, and Ms Chanbua has hung a photo on the wall inside of Gammy's twin sister. Ms Chanbua expressed concern for Gammy's future if she was not there to look after him. ‘I am afraid one day if something happens to me, who will take care of him?', she asked through a translator. Hanging above the doorframe of Gammy's new house is a sign which reads ‘A home for baby Gammy’ Ms Chanbua hung a photo on the wall inside of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, who is living in Western Australia . The Farnells still has custody of Gammy's twin sister Pipah (middle) after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection . A further $120,000 has been collected from donations, and has been put aside to help pay for baby Gammy's medical bills and other needs as he grows older, reported the International Business Times.

"Click here to read the full story... The arrivals to Manchester of Eliaquim Mangala and Marcos Rojo have brought Doyen Sports firmly into the English spotlight. Each deal was protracted by the funding group’s involvement as the Premier League sought guarantees over the ownership of the players’ economic rights. But just who are Doyen Sports and what do they do? Doyen Sports is an investment fund supported by a collection of wealthy – and anonymous – businessmen speculating on the purchase of footballers to make money. Instead of buying up players’ economic rights, as with other third-party ownership schemes, Doyen loan money to clubs to assist in transfers of notable targets who would otherwise be unaffordable. Welcome along: Marcos Rojo was unveiled at Manchester United following his £16million transfer from Sporting Lisbon . When a player is sold a percentage hitherto agreed is returned, meaning Doyen reap a share of any profit. Alternatively repayments of initial loans are expected within three years at a set interest rate – as with any lending bank – but in general there remains an impetus for transfers to be made. On their website it reads: ‘Our partners include some of the world’s pre-eminent law firms, financial advisors, sports consultants and football agents, giving the company and its clients confidence and protection in the investment decisions.’ Who is behind the scheme? Nelio Lucas, a 35-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur, is the chief executive and main face of Doyen Sports. About four years ago he approached two wealthy businessmen and proposed his idea for enjoying football and making a profit from it – thus beginning the company. Lucas is said to have learned his trade under Pini Zahavi, the super-agent involved in bringing Roman Abramovich to Chelsea, and has close relationships with many of the game’s biggest boardroom figures, including Florentino Perez, Real Madrid’s larger-than-life president. New signing: But France defender Eliaquim Mangala is yet to make his debut for Manchester City . ‘The money is only one part, the most important part is the networking,’ Lucas said in an interview with Bloomberg from May. ‘I know all the sports directors, all the presidents. They’re my friends for so many years. There’s a friendship situation in order to negotiate.’ Jorge Mendes, the agent of Jose Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo, and Peter Kenyon, former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive, have been incorrectly linked to Doyen. Their vehicle is a third-party ownership model called Quality Sports. In April last year Doyen Global was launched to manage the commercial aspect of elite footballers, including Neymar. It is run by managing directors Simon Oliviera, a key strategist in David Beckham’s team for 10 years, and Matthew Kay, who has managed the images of Mourinho and Ronaldo among others. Not him: Jorge Mendes, the agent of Jose Mourinho (pictured), has been incorrectly linked to Doyen . How much money are we talking and which players are involved? So far €100million (about £80m) has been invested in players, with another €100m on the way. Lucas says the sums are ‘drops in the ocean’ for the group’s multi-millionaire backers. One of the company’s biggest and earliest transactions was in 2011, when Radamel Falcao switched from Porto to Atletico Madrid for £34.7m, even though the Spanish club was in deep debt. Last summer he moved to Monaco for £51m and is on the market again this window, although Doyen’s interest in his transfer ended when Monaco bought in full. Doyen claimed a third of Mangala’s transfer to Manchester City, having assisted Porto with his move in 2011, and are owed 75 per cent of Rojo’s transfer although a dispute with Sporting has broken out and no money has been handed over to date. On Doyen’s website names such as Alvaro Negredo, Alvaro Morata, Steven Defour and Jose Antonio Reyes are listed but it is not stated in what capacity they are linked. Subject: On Doyen’s website Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata (right) is listed but it is not stated in what capacity . Atletico Madrid have a wide-ranging financial agreement with Doyen that allows them to buy players they could otherwise not afford. ‘We are sharing the risk,’ Atletico chief executive Miguel Angel Gil says. ‘It’s an interesting transaction because if the player doesn’t do well the club doesn’t lose everything.’ Recently Doyen has announced an agreement with FC Twente and that it financed Porto’s deal for Algeria World Cup star Yacine Brahimi from Granada. What is the global reception to Doyen? Spain’s top-flight is very welcoming, with La Liga president Javier Tebas arguing Doyen offer the funds to provide smaller clubs the chance to compete when Real and Barcelona hog the TV money. Spanish football clubs have a combined tax debt of £550m. But the Premier League is extremely sceptical and would not allow Doyen to finance any deals entered into by clubs in England’s top division. Third-party ownership was outlawed after the Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano affair and even though Doyen state firmly their model is different and does not exert influence on clubs, the Premier League remain wary. They have concerns relating to funding schemes imposing penalties for non-sale of players. Doyen insist they do not employ such measures. Rule: Third-party ownership was outlawed after the Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano affair . A Premier League spokesman told Sportsmail: ‘Premier League rules prohibit Third Party Ownership as we believe that it threatens the integrity of competitions, reduces the flow of transfer revenue contained within the game, and has the potential to exert external influences on players’ transfer decisions. ‘When our clubs enter into negotiations to sign players from countries where the practice is permitted we work with them to make sure any third parties are bought out. This has to take place before a player can be registered to play in the Premier League.’ A row between Sporting’s new president Bruno de Carvalho and Doyen broke out when he claimed the club were being put under pressure to sell Rojo to United. Doyen insisted this was not the case and could take Sporting to court for their refusal to hand over any money. UEFA want to ban the practice, while FIFA have conducted various studies into its feasibility. Doyen are keen to distance themselves from other third-party entities and would welcome tighter regulations.

"A cash-strapped Islamic school has been accused of spending £1million of taxpayers' money on a brand new state-of-the-art facility in Pakistan. Council chiefs are investigating claims that the leaders of Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham, which is currently in desperate need of repair, have used public money to help fund a hi-tech school 5,000 miles away in the Pakistan city of Ziarat. Birmingham City Council confirmed it has launched a probe into the school's finances and said it is 'concerned about the severe deficit it has got itself into'. Birmingham City Council is investigating claims that the Islamic Al-Hijrah School, in the Bordesley Green area of the city (pictured), has used public money to fund a hi-tech school 5,000 miles away in Pakistan . It is the latest controversy to hit the school, which caters for 800 children aged between four and 16. In May, it was placed in special measures after being branded 'inadequate' in a damning Ofsted report, and a month later the whole governing body was sacked over financial troubles, including a £900,000 budget deficit. It now faces allegations that the trust used public money to build the boys-only school in Ziarat, situated just 240 miles from the Afghanistan border, which opened in 2004 and is said to be prospering. The trust's website boasts that the school provides children with an environment in which they can 'develop their Islamic principles'. In a seven-minute video on the website, the school also appeals to the public for charitable donations for the Pakistani school. The clip begins by showing the communities of Baluchistan, the largest of Pakistan's four provinces, and claiming that it is 'one of the poorest regions in the world.' The slick video then show the students wearing blue blazers and ties, working at wooden desks piled high with books and standing in regimented lines on the school's drill square with mountains in the background. The school faces allegations it used £1million of public money to build a boys-only school in Ziarat (pictured), situated just 240 miles from the Afghanistan border, which opened in 2004 and is said to be prospering . Pupils are seen conducting science experiments with extensive laboratory equipment while the video pans shows off the expansive buildings and perfectly manicured grounds. The narrator says that the school can only continue to give all students free board and lodging as well as an education through charitable donations. He says: 'Al-Hijrah Trust UK is a well-established charitable organisation run by the Muslim community in the UK. 'The trust is a pioneering institution focusing on establishing an educational system which delivers high academic standards within an Islamic environment. 'The existence of this institution is a token of love, help and solidarity from the Pakistani and wider Muslim community in the UK for the needy students of Baluchistan. 'All the educational needs of the students are addressed by Al-Hijrah Trust through donations and generosity of kind-hearted people like you.' However, in England, the school in the Bordesley Green area of Birmingham,  is apparently in a state of disrepair and desperately needs refurbishing. A school insider said: 'The school in Birmingham is falling apart, its roof is leaking and there is little space for outdoor play. 'Yet the trust has used £1million to build a new school in Pakistan. It beggars belief.' The Al-Hijrah sister school in Pakistan is situated in front of a backdrop of mountains and was set up in 2004 . The Birmingham school, which opened in 1988, became voluntary aided in 2002 and, therefore, secured funding from the city council. The council has confirmed a probe into the school's finances, including the allegations public cash was used to help fund the school in Pakistan, is now underway. A spokesman said: 'We were concerned about the severe deficit the school has got itself into and where that money might be going. 'We put a board in place in the school with access to financial records and we carried out a retrospective investigation. 'We have gathered enough information to warrant further investigation into the use of public funds and we continue to work with the relevant statutory agencies. 'If we find anything criminal it will be referred to the police.' The majority of the school's students are of Pakistani origin, and the senior school receives over 1,000 applications for 60 places a year, making it one of the most over-subscribed schools in the UK. The Department for Education said it was liaising with the authorities while the investigation takes place. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of these serious allegations which are being investigated by Birmingham City Council. 'We are liaising closely with them and continue to monitor the situation. 'The school is currently in special measures and we have approved the council's choice of interim executive board.' A number of teachers from the nearby Calthorpe Academy in the Highgate area of Birmingham have been drafted in to Al-Hijrah School in recent weeks as part of a 'buddying' scheme to try to 'share best practice'. However, sources claim the school is still riddled with problems, including continuing to segregate boys and girls. One person, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'Even the staff have separate meeting rooms for male and female teachers.' Waseem Yaqub (pictured), the former chairman of governors at Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham, has been issued with a High Court writ amid claims of harassment, intimidation and trespassing on the school site . Parents waiting for their children outside the school today condemned the idea of £1million being sent to fund the Pakistan facility. Father-of-three Mustansar Mahmood, 29, said: 'I would not be happy if I found out funds meant for this school were being spent elsewhere. They should not be. 'If they are given money to spend at this school, it should stay in this school. 'They could spend the money on a new building because this one is not good enough. 'If you go into Birmingham you can see other schools and they are more modern and much better. 'So if they are given money they have to use it here. 'If I gave you money to improve your life and you gave it away that would be wrong, and it is the same here.' Father-of-two Walrur Rahman, 40, has already taken one of his sons out of the school. He said: 'I moved my elder son to a different school this September, but that was just because he was struggling. 'I cannot see how they would get away with just giving this school's money to the one in Pakistan. 'If they have been taking the money then that is totally wrong because this school could definitely do with it.' In July, Birmingham City Council was forced to take out an injunction banning former chairman of governors Waseem Yaqub from the school. Mr Yaqub was accused of leading a harassment campaign against the new interim board, but he denied those claims. He has been issued with a High Court writ warning him that he faces a damages bill of up to £100,000 due to his conduct. The writ accuses him of harassment, intimidation and trespassing on the school site after he was sacked from his post. The Al Hirjah Trust has contacted us to make the following points: . ‘The claims that the Trust diverted £1 million designated for a school in the UK to build a school in Pakistan are entirely false. In 1997 the Al Hijrah Trust purchased the site of the Al Hijrah schools in Birmingham. Since gaining Voluntary Aided status in 2002 the Al Hijrah school has been a separate legal entity to the Trust and has been operating as such for over 12 years. As a voluntary aided school, Birmingham City Council has been responsible for managing the financial affairs of the school from commissioning annual official audits to ensuring compliance with financial standards. This removes any possibility of the Trust or governing body using the school's funding for any other project whether in Pakistan or the UK. The Al Hijrah Trust, a separate entity is a registered charity that runs many independent projects both in the UK and abroad to advance the provision of education in some of the poorest communities. The school in Ziarat, Pakistan, which was subject to yesterday's unfounded assertions is one such charitable project. Acquisition of the land and the costs of construction for this school were funded by the Provincial Government of Balochistan with whom the Trust was working in partnership.’ Probe: Police at Al-Hijrah School earlier this year . The disgraced former chairman of governors at Al-Hijrah School, Waseem Yaqub, was linked to the infamous Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham. Al-Hijrah, a state-funded Muslim faith school, was not one of the 21 inspected by Ofsted in connection with the so-called Trojan Horse plot to oust secular heads and governors at state schools and force through strict Islamic principles. However, most of the individuals who claimed to be key figures in the alleged plot had strong links to the Al-Hijrah Trust, the body which owns and, until May, ran the school. Tahir Alam, the plot's alleged ringleader, was secretary to the Al-Hijrah Trust and head of the Al-Hijrah Training Academy, a body which, according to its website, trains Muslim parents to 'empower the community to ensure our needs are met'. Mr Yaqub, the sacked chairman of governors, was seconded as a 'consultant' to Saltley School at the same time as its respected non-Muslim headteacher, Balwant Bains, was removed. However, Mr Yaqub denies any involvement in Mr Bains's departure. In June, the school's entire governing body was sacked over financial troubles, including a £900,000 budget deficit. It came a month after the school was placed in special measures after being branded 'inadequate' in a damning Ofsted report. Inspectors found the school had an unbalanced curriculum and said governors were 'too heavily involved in the day-to-day running'. In the wake of the report, Birmingham City Council disbanded the governors and appointed a new head and 'interim executive board' to run the school. It prompted protests from over 100 parents who expressed their anger at the entire governing body being sacked. At the same time, Birmingham City Council was also forced to take out an injunction banning Mr Yaqub from the school. Mr Yaqub was accused of leading the harassment campaign against the new interim board, but he denied those claims. He has since been issued with a High Court writ warning him that he faces a damages bill of up to £100,000 due to his conduct. The writ accuses him of harassment, intimidation and trespassing on the school site after he was sacked from his post.","Council investigating claims Islamic school used public funds in Pakistan .

"A gunman has killed two security guards and his stepfather and wounded a police officer before fatally shooting himself in the head. Evan Casey Bennett, 23, shot security guards Richard Ellison, 53, and Bobby Wood, 65, last Thursday night in South Carolina but wasn't immediately identified and captured. Police Chief Mike Gambrell said Bennett killed his stepfather Gregory Thomas Jones, 58, on Monday by shooting him in the face with a shotgun. Scroll down for video .

Bennett then went to Greenville County Law Enforcement Center, where he shot out windows and fired at an officer in the parking lot before turning the gun on himself. The officer, who has not been identified, was seriously injured after being shot three times and has undergone surgery. The police chief said Bennett was wearing a tactical vest and camouflage pants and carrying a knife when he arrived at the center, which houses the Greenville Police Department and the local sheriff's office. He was also carrying a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9mm handgun. According to WYFF4, Bennett's family said he had been threatening to kill someone in the weeks running up to the shootings but that they did not take him seriously. On Monday, family members confronted the 23-year-old following the security guard murders outside the Hollingsworth Textile Plant. Bennett killed his stepfather following the argument and reportedly said: 'The war is just beginning.'

"Watch out world, the Girl Scouts are going digital to sell you cookies. After nearly 100 years of selling door to door, Girl Scouts of the USA will allow its young go-getters to push their wares using a mobile app or personalized websites - but only if their scout councils and guardians say OK. 'Girls have been telling us that they want to go into this space,' said Sarah Angel-Johnson, chief digital cookie executive for the organization covering about two million girls. 'Online is where entrepreneurship is going.' Going digital: Girl Scouts Bria (left) and Shirell (right) practice selling cookies on a tablet now that the organization has allowed online sales . And the best news for these digital natives: They can have cookies shipped directly to your doorstep. More than one million scouts, from kindergarten-age Daisies to teens, were expected to opt in as cookie-selling season cranks up this month and the scouting organization gets digital sales underway. But digital sales are intended to enhance, not replace, the paper spreadsheets used to generate an estimated $800 million in cookie sales a year - at anywhere from $3.50 to $5 a box, depending on scout council. There are important e-lessons here, scout officials said, such as better articulating and tracking goals, learning to handle customers and money in a new way, and more efficiently processing credit card information. 'A lot of people have asked, ""What took you so long to get online?"" We spend a lot of time thinking how do we make this safe, scalable and smart,' Kelly M. Parisi, chief communications executive for Girl Scouts of the USA, said at a recent demonstration for select media. Councils were offered one of the two platforms but not both. For web-based sales, scouts customize their pages, using their first names only, and email prospective customers with links to click on for orders. They can also put up videos explaining who they are and what they plan to do with their proceeds. The mobile platform offers tabs for tracking sales and allows for the sale of bundles of different kinds of cookies. It can be used on a phone or tablet. Screen time: Girl Scouts are seen learning how to sell cookies on the organization's website using laptops . 'They can get them quicker than waiting for me to deliver them because sometimes it takes me a long time to deliver,' offered 11-year-old Priscilla at the preview. The adults at the event asked that only first names of scouts be used. Added seven-year-old Anna: 'My favorite part is that now I can sell more Girl Scout Cookies.' She pulled down about 200 boxes last year and has upped her goal to 600. Girl Scouts use their cookie money to pay for community service work or troop activities such as camping and other trips. The websites will not be accessible without an email invitation, requiring the girls to build client lists. And personal information is as protected as any digits out there, for both the scouts and customers, using encryption in some cases. Much of the responsibility to limit identifying details about scouts online falls on parents. Troop Leader Karen Porcher of the Bronx has an 11-year-old scout and is particularly psyched about the digital options. They live in a house rather than an apartment, and she and her husband work at home, eliminating at-office cookie and neighborly building sales. Sweet news: Customers can now have Thin Mints (pictured) and other Girl Scout cookies shipped directly to their doorstep . 'During cookie season my daughter is wearing her (scout) vest on the subway and people are so excited to see a Girl Scout,' Ms Porcher explained. 'Strangers actually will buy a case of cookies and wait for her to call. This is going to be amazing because now she can just say ""Give me your business card,"" or ""I'll take your email address,"" send the email and they can be delivered. This is gonna be sweet.' Ms Porcher also sees word-of-mouth value in getting cookies delivered quickly. 'People are going to be walking around with cookies and others are going to say, ""Whoa, how did you get those already?""' Zack Bennett of Manhattan has a nine-year-old scout who sold more than 1,000 boxes last year. She hopes to increase her goal to 1,500 this season and went through training to learn how to set up her new cookie website. But dad won't be letting her loose alone. 'I'll be sitting in the backseat to help her, certainly when it comes to credit cards, things of that sort,' he said. 'But it makes perfect sense to have it be on the computer. It's definitely time the Girl Scouts came into the 21st century.'","More than one million scouts are expected to start using a mobile app and personalized websites to sell cookies later this month .

"Heavy rains from Tropical Storm Dolly threatened flash floods and mudslides in mountainous areas as it moved in from Mexico's Gulf coast, where authorities had readied shelters and suspended school classes on Wednesday. The U.S. Hurricane Center said Dolly was located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south-southwest of Tampico early Wednesday morning. The storm's maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving to the west at 8 mph (13 kph). The storm was expected to bring 5 to 10 inches (12 to 25 centimeters) of rain to states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz, along the Gulf coast and inland. Life-threatening flash floods and mud slides were possible in mountainous areas. Deluge: A couple of cars lie in a portion of a collapsed street due to heavy rains in the Gulf port city of Veracruz, Mexico . Surveying the damage: A woman looks at the damage after part of a street and a home collapsed due to heavy rains. The Gulf states of Mexico are bracing for more bad weather as Tropical Storm Dolly crosses the Mexican coast . Fierce: Tropical Storm Dolly has formed off Mexico's coast over the Bay of Campeche. The storm's maximum sustained winds were close tonear 45 mph . Tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 140 miles (220 kilometers) but weakening was expected over the next 24 hours as Dolly moves farther inland. Tamaulipas state authorities said earlier in the day that shelters were being readied and that classes would be suspended Wednesday in several municipalities along the Gulf coast. Authorities in neighboring Veracruz state ordered classes in the whole state suspended. Authorities on Mexico's Gulf coast prepared shelters and closed schools Wednesday as Tropical Storm Dolly threatened with flash floods and mudslides . Not over yet: Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides are possible in mountainous areas.Tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 140 miles . Weakening is expected over the next 24 hours as Dolly moves further inland . Dolly’s formation on September 2 comes more than a week later than the usual formation date of the Atlantic’s fourth named storm, August 23. The 2014 version of Tropical Storm Dolly is the eighth appearance of a storm named Dolly in the Atlantic. Dolly made its first appearance in 1953 as hurricane that weakened before passing over Bermuda. Dolly’s most recent appearance, as a 2008 Category 2 hurricane that hit near the Texas/Mexico border, was its most damaging–$1.5 billion in losses were recorded. This was not enough to get the name Dolly retired, though. Dolly is next scheduled to appear inn 2020. The city of Veracruz had flooded and least two streets where electric workers had been doing underground work had collapsed, damaging a house and several cars. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Norbert formed off Mexico's Pacific coast on Tuesday. By the late evening, Norbert's center was about 120 miles (195 kilometers) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, or about 300 miles (480 kilometers) southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Hurricane forecasters said that on its current track, Norbert is expected to move away from the southwestern coast of Mexico early Wednesday, and approach the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula on Thursday. Maximum sustained winds were around 50 mph (85 kph), and the storm was moving north-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph). Wrecked: Neighbors look at the damage after part of a street and a home collapsed due to heavy rains. The storm is expected to continue moving inland over northeastern Mexico on Wednesday .

"The hostility Emily Scarratt suffered for wanting to play rugby as a teenager was made to look even more absurd when she sealed England’s World Cup triumph last Sunday with a superb individual try. Like the rest of her team-mates, Scarratt is only too aware of the cliches surrounding women’s rugby. ‘Leave it to the men,’ the dinosaurs say. ‘The rugby field is no place for girls’. VIDEO Scroll down for England Rugby's Stuart Lancaster unveils New Strip . Battle of the sexes: Emily Scarratt is changing the notion that rugby is purely a 'man's game' Touchdown! Emily Scarratt dives to score during England's World Cup final win over Canada . Fourth time lucky: England celebrate Scarratt's try that sealed victory after three losing finals . But everyone knows what happened to the dinosaurs and the same seems to be happening to those who argue that the rugby pitch is no place for women. The excellence of Scarratt and her team-mates is helping to change perceptions of a sport that has seen participation levels more than double in the past 10 years. It is, in business terms, a growth industry. ‘We’re aware of the stereotypes and the view that rugby is a “man’s game” and it’s a view we are working so hard to break down,’ the 24-year-old said at the clubhouse of her former club, Leicester Forest. ‘Those attitudes don’t annoy me because it creates more of a challenge to break them down. It’s a challenge to say, “We’re going to change your mind”. A lot of the people who think women shouldn’t play rugby have never watched it. I would urge them to watch a game. If they are real rugby fans, they’ll appreciate it.’ Girl power: England's success has started to change the perception of women's rugby . It is hard to argue. England’s 21-9 victory over Canada, in which Scarratt contributed 16 points, was the last of 30 matches in a compelling three-week competition in France which emphasised the quality and excitement of the sport. Scarratt’s successful goal-kicking percentage of 79 success was much better than Jonny Wilkinson’s in his last World Cup. An average player weighs about three stones less than a professional male player and that athleticism, linked to an attacking mentality, means there is a view that women’s rugby is better to watch. The dinosaurs roar louder. Scarratt grew up on her parents’ farm in Leicestershire unaware of stereotypes. ‘I was five when I started playing,’ she said. ‘My brother, Joe, is three years older and my dad took him down to Leicester Forest when he was about eight. I went along with no intention of playing, just for something to do on a Sunday morning. ‘A coach asked if I wanted to have a little pass around. I had a run around and was pretty much hooked from that point on.’ Best foot forward: Scarratt's goal kicking was more accurate than Jonny Wilkinson's . Scarratt, a rangy inside centre who is ‘5ft 11¼in — and don’t round it up’, played alongside boys until she was 12 before switching to a girls’ team. But as a teenager she realised she was breaking the mould — and she was strong enough to ignore the barbs. ‘I did encounter hostility towards me playing,’ she said. ‘I had a very sheltered life growing up on a farm but when I went to college I came across kids who had led much more of a city life who had grown up in a very different way. ‘I don’t want it to sound like a big bullying thing but I definitely encountered hostility. It was just people not understanding why you were able to play rugby or why you would even want to. Especially at that age when it’s more about what you look like, what your boyfriend’s called, how much make-up you’re wearing. ‘I was still interested in all that, but it wasn’t my main focus, which it is for a lot of girls. I loved playing sport, especially rugby.’ Thick skinned: The England centre admits she received some hostility as a woman rugby player . With growing interest from TV audiences, which peaked at just over 2 million for a final shown in 137 countries, it appears to be a matter of time before enough investment is available to enable Scarratt and her team-mates to turn fully professional. The England squad, coached by Gary Street, self-fund much of their season with many of them returning to their ‘proper’ jobs within 48 hours of winning the final in Paris. Scarratt, a PE teacher at King Edward’s School in Birmingham, tells one story of a match last season between her club, Lichfield, and a Bristol side featuring England prop and vet Sophie Hemming, who missed the first 60 minutes after receiving a call-out just before kick-off to deliver a calf. Does Scarratt worry that by turning professional, women’s rugby could fall into the same trap as the men by placing an emphasis on brawn and power over skill and artistry? ‘You need to be strong for rugby, but the fact we’re women does mean we don’t have the capacity to get so big and personally, I’d never want to get like that,’ she said. ‘I still want to look pretty in a dress! For other girls that’s important, too. I’m still able to do the job I can do looking like I do despite getting grief from the other girls for being puny.’ Feminine side: Emily Scarratt receives the England Women's Player of the Year award in 2013 . For now, all Scarratt really wants to do is savour World Cup glory. ‘You waver occasionally and wonder if all the effort is worth it but at moments like this it’s possible to step back and say, “Look what I’ve achieved, look what that hard work and effort have done”.’ It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .

"Japan has delayed the launch of its space probe for the second time due to bad weather. The Hayabusa2 will now blast off on a six-year mission to mine a distant asteroid aboard Japan's main H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in south of the country on Wednesday at 1.22 pm local time. The probe was originally scheduled to launch today but Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) postponed it to Monday after a forecast of thick clouds. Hayabusa2, pictured, will now blast off from Tanegashima Space Center on Wednesday at 1.22 pm local time . Hayabusa2 had been set to blast off aboard the H-IIA rocket, pictured, from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan today but the launch was postponed for the second time due to bad weather . The agency said it decided on the second postponement due to fears of strong winds, and warned that the launch could be delayed further depending on the weather. The 31 billion yen ($260 million) project will send the explorer towards the 1999JU3 asteroid in deep space. It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect materials unexposed to millennia of wind and radiation, in the hope of answering some fundamental questions about life and the universe. Hayabusa2 will take off only weeks after a European spacecraft's historic landing on a comet captivated the world's attention. An aerial image shows the H-IIA rocket lift off from the island of Tanegashima in May this year . The probe, which is about the size of a domestic refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and spend around 18 months near it. It will also study the surface by dropping tiny robots and if all goes well, asteroid samples will be returned to Earth in late 2020. The Hayabusa2 mission will blast off just weeks after the European Space Agency succeeded in making mankind's first ever landing on a comet this month. Scientists said initial data sent from the robot lab Philae showed traces of organic molecules and a surface much harder than imagined. Philae, released from its mothership Rosetta, has gone into hibernation on the comet, having used its onboard battery power after 60 hours of prodding and probing.

"An ecologist who fell to his death at a beauty spot where he regularly went birdwatching was suffering depression triggered by a battle to land his 'dream job', an inquest heard. Antony Wainwright, 42, from Westhoughton, Bolton, was said to have struggled to get the career he wanted after securing a 2.1 honours degree in ecology and environmental science at university. The father of two died after he fell over the edge of Cox Green Quarry in Egerton, near Bolton, in August. At an inquest into his death in Bolton on Friday, coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict as he described Mr Wainwright as 'a very intelligent man with an excellent degree'. Antony Wainwright, 42, from Westhoughton, Bolton, was found at the bottom of Cox Green Quarry in Egerton, in August. The inquest into his death heard how he had suffered from depression since leaving university . The ecological consultant had been heavily involved with sports facilities, especially golf courses, and provided ecological appraisals, surveys and a range of wildlife-related reports including studies of migratory birds. He was also a keen ornithologist and was the appointed recorder of birds for Greater Manchester, often visiting the quarry where he died to record bird sightings. Last January, he eventually got the job he wanted as an ecologist at the Sports Turf Research Institute in Bingley, West Yorkshire, but within months his marriage broke down. Shortly afterwards, he took an overdose of painkillers while on holiday in Malaga with his family. However, his family were said to be unaware of the overdose and it only came to light after he told doctors upon his return. After the breakdown of his marriage in June, he moved in with friends. His estranged wife Lyndsey told the inquest: 'We had talked about a reconciliation. 'We said we would consider it but just not now.' She said she knew he had suffered from depression and said it had centred on the fact he struggled to get into the career he really wanted. She told the hearing: 'I knew he suffered from depression. I think it had always been there but started really after university when he struggled to into the career field he wanted. 'The job he had now is his dream job. He had got his dream job, he was doing want he wanted. 'He loved work. He would often go out by himself and watch birds as a recorder but also because it was his passion. 'He would travel abroad a lot with his job and would go to Ireland a lot. He was set to travel to Ireland the Sunday after he was found.' Mr Wainwright was found dead at the bottom of Cox Green Quarry, near Bolton (pictured), on August 3 . The inquest also heard how Mr Wainwright was held in police cells in March 2011 after threatening to jump off a quarry following a drunken works party. He was arrested for being drunk and disorderly after police went to the quarry following reports he had run away from his friends after a 'significant amount to drink' and made a comment that would jump off. He was kept in a cell for the night but freed without charge. Ms Wainwright added: 'It was some work do. He was just drinking. I wouldn't say he intended to take any action - he had just been drinking far too much.' She said she last saw him on August 1 when he popped around to their family home to collect his driving licence to take with him for a work trip to Ireland. She said: 'I was at home with a work colleague and Antony returned home to collect his driving licence to go to Ireland. 'He was fine. He spoke to me and my friend, found his licence and left. He didn't contact me again.' Phillip Coyle, a friend of Mr Wainwright, told the inquest that he was aware of the police incident in 2011 and said the pair had discussed the breakdown of Mr Wainwright's marriage. He said: 'He told me once he got drunk with some do at work and he was at a pub near Cox Green Quarry and told police he was going to do something stupid. 'He told me he spent the night in a police cell to sober up. I think it was more of a joke to do with drinking too much basically. 'We had talked about his reconciliation. He said they were talking and had been going through peaks and troughs but good times were more than bad times. He seemed to be getting better.' Mr Wainwright had been living with Mr Coyle and his girlfriend Joanna Bednarz at the time of his death. Ms Bednarz told the inquest that he had seemed 'very happy' when she last saw him. She said: 'I knew him before the marriage broke down and he was much happier then but as is normal with the breakdown of marriage he was sad. 'He never mentioned any suicidal thoughts. I spoke to him on the Friday and he seemed to be very happy. 'Then we had a conversation about what he had planned for the weekend. 'At 7.30am on Saturday morning I heard him moving down stairs. I didn't see him. I thought he had gone to get himself a drink. At 8.15am we went downstairs and he had gone.' Mr Wainwright was found at the bottom of the quarry on Sunday August 3 after his friend put out a missing person enquiry. Police were alerted after a passerby reported seeing his car parked at the beauty spot for around 24 hours. He died from severe neck injuries. Coroner Mr Walsh returned an open conclusion and said: 'I have considered whether he took his own life by jumping from the top of the quarry to the ground beneath. 'I am sure he did the act that caused his death as there was no third party involvement but I am not sure he meant to take his own life.. He left no notes and nor did he indicate his intent. 'He was a very intelligent man with an excellent degree. He was someone who wanted to work as an ecologist and wanted to work in the open and he had achieved this.'","Antony Wainwright, 47, found at bottom of Cox Green Quarry in Egerton .

"The boss of Starbucks has provoked fury by implying that the firm will not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax in the UK for up to three years. Mark Fox said the coffee chain needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it begins turning a profit in Britain. But critics last night described the comments as an insult and urged customers to continue their boycott of the US firm. Scroll down for video . Starbucks chief executive Mark Fox insisted there was ‘nothing abnormal’ about the way Starbucks was run - but admitted it was not likely to make a profit for another three years . Starbucks has been facing a backlash from consumers after it emerged it had paid just £8.6million in corporation tax since coming to Britain in 1998. It did this by reporting financial losses for years, which it claimed were due to the steep running costs of its high street outlets. The group has also been branded immoral for funnelling revenues – known as royalties – out of the UK and into the Netherlands and Switzerland. But yesterday Mr Fox said these controversial arrangements ‘didn’t bother me at all’. In a reference to the tax scandal that broke two years ago, Mr Fox, who runs Starbucks in the UK, said: ‘Fundamentally, the piece that was aerating was around royalties – the fact a brand is paying a royalty to an entity outside the UK, and to me that’s very, very ordinary. Starbucks was at the centre of a tax-avoiding furore two years ago when it emerged it had only paid £8.6million in corporation tax – despite making £3billion in sales since opening in Britain in 1998 . ‘It happens across the sector and therefore it didn’t bother me at all. There was nothing abnormal about the way Starbucks is run in the UK. What is abnormal is that we haven’t been making a profit.’ The company is two years into a five-year plan to turn it into a profitable venture. When it starts making a profit, it has said it will begin paying tax. Mr Fox added: ‘As I look at the business now with eight quarters of growth, I don’t see a damaged brand, I see a brand starting to regain its mojo.’ But Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee, urged customers to boycott the company until it changes its ways. She said: ‘I think it’s an insult to ordinary hard-working taxpayers across the country. ‘Hopefully it’s a big enough insult to his customers that they will take their business elsewhere. They will not win back the trust of the public unless they unwind these immoral schemes.’ The latest row to rock the company comes on the eve of George Osborne’s Autumn Statement, in which he will warn that Britain faces dwindling tax revenues. Starbucks uses a host of measures to whittle down the profitability of its UK division. The practices, which have been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs, mean that it has not reported a profit in the UK since landing here in 1998. The most controversial measure involves registering the rights to its brand and logo to a holding company based in the Netherlands. For every cup of coffee sold on the UK high street, the company pays a 6 per cent royalty fee to its Dutch counterpart. A second way of pushing money away from Britain relates to how the firm buys its coffee. The beans are purchased by an outfit based in low-tax Switzerland. Despite never actually landing on Swiss soil, they are sold on at a mark-up to the Netherlands, which until recently was Starbucks’ European HQ. In the Netherlands the beans are roasted in its giant plant in Amsterdam before being sold on – again at a mark-up – to all of its other European operations. This means that the roasted beans are bought by Starbucks in the UK at a significant premium to the price initially paid by Starbucks in Switzerland. All of this contributes to lower UK revenues, making it more difficult for it to turn a profit. When the tax revelations emerged two years ago, the group volunteered to give £20million to the taxman over two years to try to prevent a widespread boycott of its coffee houses. These payments have now finished. But the comments from its chief executive, who joined the group only in January, have sparked a fresh wave of anger at its tax affairs. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s quite understandable that taxpayers don’t feel everyone pays their fair share. ‘But the power to fix that lies in the hands of politicians, who add complex loopholes and reliefs to the tax system year after year.’ Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to use Britain’s leadership of the G8 last year to clamp down on multinational firms that dodge tax. Google, Amazon and Starbucks have all been criticised for legal but controversial methods they use to funnel revenues out of the UK and into lower tax jurisdictions. The European Commission is trying to crack down on lucrative deals struck between US firms and governments across the continent that allow the companies to whittle down their tax bills. Google uses Ireland to process all of its European sales, but uses a complex structure to push much of its income out to the notorious tax shelter of Bermuda. Amazon claims that the beating heart of its European operations is a small office in Luxembourg, which it uses as a base for its business in the UK. Apple has also been criticised for holding vast amounts of cash in offshore accounts. Accountant Richard Murphy from Tax Justice Network, who worked on the initial investigation exposing Starbucks’ tax affairs, said: ‘Starbucks says it is not making a profit. But it has so far failed to convince anybody else. ‘When it makes its books open on the tablefor everyone to see we might accept what it is saying as the truth. ‘But until then we’re still in the dark and it still isn’t paying any tax.’ Starbucks has refused to comment on the latest remarks by Mr Fox, which he made in an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper. But a spokesman for the Unite union said: ‘Starbucks says these arrangements are ordinary. That depends entirely on how you define ordinary. ‘Many hard-working taxpayers, struggling to make ends meet, will be scratching their heads at Starbucks’ elaborate way of exporting their tax liabilities. ‘The Government has talked tough, but now it needs to act. Tax that is due to the British taxpayer is being exported. ‘It’s a ruse that they and other big multinationals use to avoid paying their fair share.'","Chief Executive Mark Fox said  chain aimed to be profitable by 2017 .

"Millions of Britons  will spend at least £650million on  Christmas presents online today in a sales extravaganza dubbed 'Cyber Monday' - but experts believe the scramble for bargains will actually peak in a week's time. Number of online shoppers: Six million . Average spend:  Around £110 each . Age bracket: Majority are between 25 and 34 . Peak times: 7am, Midday and 9pm . Total spend: £650million - £451,000 per min . Retailer website hits: 151million - up 26% . Christmas spending: £4.7billion this year . Shoppers will splurge around £100 each on average  with spending sprees expected to peak at around 7am this morning, at  Midday and finally around 9pm. Cyber Monday - the first Monday in December - has been the busiest internet shopping day in Britain, with UK consumers expected to spend an astonishing £451,000 a minute on gifts. But retail experts now believe that next Monday, December 8, will become known as Manic Monday because this is when Christmas shopping will peak online - reaching £675million or £470,000 a minute on the day. Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people will wait another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day. Analysts believe that in total £4.7billion will be spent on online gifts this Christmas in Britain. Natalie Berg, Global Research Director at Planet Retail, told MailOnline that the rise of Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Manic Monday could kill off the traditional Boxing Day sales. Scroll down for video . Starting again: Customers pushed each other out of the way as the crowd surges towards widescreen televisions at the Asda store in Wembley on Black Friday, but Cyber Monday could be even bigger . She said: 'There will be an impact on Boxing Day sales. While people are always keen to find a bargain there will be an element of sales fatigue because now people are starting to buy their Christmas presents at the end of November. 'Also retailers are creating a rod for their own back. Black Friday has taken off in a big way but while some businesses have been organised others jumped on the bandwagon offering discounts on everything. Hundreds of shoppers who fought over big screen TVs on Black Friday are now struggling to sell them . Today, lots of the heavily discounted televisions which sold out within minutes at the supermarkets, have appeared on online auction sites such as eBay . They include the 40 inch Polaroid TV, reduced by £80 at Asda, and 50 inch Blaupunkt HD TV, reduced by £100 to £249 in Tesco stores . But the sellers are struggling to get any interest on the bids . One enterprising punter is even trying to just sell the television box alone, but has attracted no bids so far . 'Now it will be very hard to persuade shoppers to pay full-price for anything ahead of Christmas'. Today despite huge discounts on offer, there were fears that customers could miss out on the deals if there is a repeat of Black Friday's widespread IT failures. Websites for John Lewis, Tesco, PC World, Argos and Boots crashed as they struggled to cope with demand from bargain hunters on a record-breaking day for purchases. Shoppers had to join an online queue for up to an hour to access the website for Currys, while John Lewis had to ask online visitors to order their purchases over the phone instead. And in chaotic scenes, police were called to brawls in some stores as customers wrestled over discounted goods. But while Cyber Monday consumers can shop from the safety of their own homes, there were fears that high volumes of traffic – particularly around an expected sales peak at midday – could cause retailers' websites to go into meltdown. Amazon will release new deals every ten minutes while eBay will reveal new deals every hour. Tesco and Morrisons will also be launching new deals, Marks and Spencer will discount more than 6,000 items and Game said it will cut the price of games consoles including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Ao.com, which sells televisions, washing machines and dishwashers, predicted it would achieve its highest sales in 14 years. Derek Eccleston, Commercial Director at eDigitalResearch said that Cyber Monday shoppers are likely to be full time workers who do not have the time to hit the shops. Their research has revealed typically they are aged between 25 and 34 and are shopping during 'down-time’ morning, lunchtime and evening. He said: 'Retailers need to brace themselves and ensure they have the right systems in place so that online shoppers are not left disappointed – error pages, slow to load websites and a lack of stock information will all lead to poor customer experience and missed sales'. There was chaos in stores across the country on Friday as bargain hunters fought - literally - for the best deals. Pictured, a staff member in Asda was forced to intervene after a customer fell to her knees in a desperate attempt to claim a TV, which was reduced from £219 to £139 . In detail: Experts believe sales for Christmas gifts will rocket on several key days, peaking on Manic Monday, December 8 . Scores of shoppers looking at beauty products were shocked when a rat scurried through Debenhams. The rodent dodged around counters in the beauty section of the department store's branch in Bedford. One shopper said: 'The store was packed with Christmas shoppers as it was lunchtime. 'The rat caused absolute pandemonium. Goodness knows where it came from or how it got into the store.' And an Amazon spokesman said: 'Cyber Monday has been the biggest day of the year for internet retailers but the incredible success of Black Friday means it will have to be a huge day for that to be the case this year. 'We are ready for whatever the day brings with thousands of members of the Amazon team across the UK prepped and ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered.' Black Friday appears to have set shopping records online and people are doing most of their shopping on tablets or phones. Nick Jones from Experian Marketing Services said: 'It's been busier than ever. As predicted, online visits to retail websites are ahead of last year by a considerable margin. On Black Friday we've recorded a 60 per cent year on year increase in the volume of traffic, there were a staggering 180 million visits to retail websites on Black Friday, even higher than we expected, and the peak days for activity are still yet to come. 'We have identified a number of key demographic types, who are believed to be behind the rise of online sales during the festive period. Online shopping is an important leisure activity for a wide variety of people, from active middle-income families with teenage children to young singles. 'These tech-savvy groups are typically early adopters of new technology trends, prolific online shoppers, and active users of mobile and tablet devices. The widespread use of the internet is certainly a key factor in driving online sales. 'We are approaching full connectivity here in the UK and that's certainly having an impact, with people finding time to take care of their shopping on the go, in their lunch hour, or at a time which is convenient to them via their various mobile devices.' For shoppers who are feeling charitable, Apple will be donating money to charity RED for every purchase made today to mark World AIDS Day. Meanwhile, the Charities Aid Foundation is launching Giving Tuesday tomorrow, when it will urge shoppers to give something back as an antidote to the retail frenzy. Stars including Helen Mirren, Michael Palin, Downton actress Joanne Froggatt, supermodel Lily Cole and athlete Dame Kelly Holmes are all backing the campaign. There are concerns shoppers could miss out on the Cyber Monday deals after IT systems failed on Friday after people logged on in their droves to get a bargain. Currys put in place a queuing system, which left some waiting up to an hour to get on to the website . Tesco Direct was unavailable for most of Friday as hundreds of thousands of people tried to place orders. It's hoped the systems will be ready for what is set to become the busiest online shopping day ever . Argos also suffered technical difficulties on Black Friday after experiencing a large volume of traffic when it reduced several items at 1am . Cyber Monday has surged in popularity in recent years, with many now delaying their online Christmas shopping until the sale begins. The event is popular with shoppers as it still allows four weeks for festive purchases to arrive in the post. Sales volumes are expected to be up by a third on last year as the US event gains momentum in the UK. Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are American events linked to the Thanksgiving holiday. Black Friday falls immediately after Thanksgiving and is mainly offered by 'bricks and mortar' shops, while Cyber Monday falls three days later for online customers. Royal Mail said ten million online shoppers have delayed buying presents until today in the hope of receiving discounts on their purchases. And payments service provider Sage Pay predicted that online retailers will rake in around £600million in 24 hours today. Darren Williams, of discount site PromotionalCodes.org.uk, said: 'British shoppers have become incredibly smart with their money over recent years and are prepared to hang on to get the best deals.'","UK consumers are expected to spend £650million in 24 hours on what could be come busiest online shopping day .

"The man was previously convicted by Abu Dhabi First Instance Court of recklessly driving under the influence of alcohol and destroying public propert . A driver fined £3,500 for drink-driving has asked the court to give him a lighter sentence – because he has a licence which allows him to consume alcohol. The Canadian man made the plea to the Appeal Court in Abu Dhabi yesterday. The man was previously convicted by Abu Dhabi First Instance Court of recklessly driving under the influence of alcohol and destroying public property. He was ordered to pay 20,000 United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED). He appeared before the Appeal Court yesterday where he admitted that he was guilty of drink driving and apologised for his actions. But he also told the court he should not be punished so harshly since he has a licence which allows him to buy alcohol in the UAE. He said: 'I would like to apologise to the court for what I did.

"Payday: John Pike, the former University of California-Davis officer who sparked outrage when he pepper-sprayed students in 2011, was awarded $38,000 in a worker's compensation settlement . The former University of California, Davis police officer who made national headlines in 2011 after he pepper-sprayed Occupy protesters has reached a worker's compensation settlement worth nearly $40,000. A judge on October 16 approved the $38,000 settlement between John Pike and the University of California. The 40-year-old former officer said he suffered depression and anxiety after death threats were sent to him and his family over the November 18, 2011, incident. University spokesman Andy Fell said the case was resolved in accordance with state laws. Video of then-campus Lt Pike dousing peaceful protesters seated on the ground with pepper spray went viral online. His address and other personal information were posted online afterward by the hacking group Anonymous, and he received scores of death threats. Pike was fired in July 2012 after eight months of paid administrative leave. The images of Pike unleashing an orange chemical cloud on the heads of students became a rallying symbol for the Occupy Wall Street movement. Anonymous disseminated Pike's personal information online. This included his home address, phone number and email address. A computer-generated voice in the video, posted in November 2011, said: 'Dear Officer John Pike. Your information is now public domain.'

According to a psychiatric report released in January, Pike faced 'continuing and significant internal and external stress with respect to resolving and solving the significant emotional upheavals that have occurred' in his life and had not shown evidence of substantial improvement.

Shannon Jones, from Potomac, Maryland, was choked by Benjamin Cayea until 'her face was blue and she had no pulse' at an apartment near Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, police said. Cayea then reportedly climbed into his girlfriend's car and drove to his friend Jacob Ives's home in a neighboring town, where he parked the vehicle and called Mr Ives in a 'hysterical' state.

"The Prime Minister may have been hoping for a Christmas miracle by parking himself in front a Christmas tree for his Canberra media conference on Monday in which he admitted that his government's performance had been 'a bit of a ragged one'. In a one-hour long conference, he backed down on plans to cut allowances for Defence personnel as well as a proposal to increase student loan interest rates. Mr Abbott also for the first time accepted that the decision made to cut the ABC budget by $250 million was 'at odds' with a pre-election commitment not to make any cuts the broadcaster. Scroll down for video . In a stunning one-hour long media conference, Tony Abbott backed down on Defence allowances and accepted that the decision made to cut the ABC budget was 'at odds' with pre-election promises. 'Whatever faults this government has, no one can accuse us of lacking courage, no one can accuse us of cracking on with things,' he said. 'I'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government, I'd be the first to admit that,' he said. 'I do believe that by any reasonable measure this has been a year of very considerable achievement for the government. 'I know that appearances do count and I do concede that the appearance last week was a bit ragged - in the end nothing matters more than performance.' On the ragged edge. 'I'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government, I'd be the first to admit that,' Tony Abbott said. Mr Abbott did admit that the ABC budget cuts went against his election pledge. 'I respect the ABC's work even if I sometimes take issue with some of their judgements,' he said. 'I accept that what we're doing with the ABC is at odds immediately prior to the election but things have moved on, circumstances are different.' He would not accept blame for the Victorian state election loss. 'People will speculate endlessly over whether federal factors had a role in a state election .. there were a whole range of factors at work here and I'm very satisfied we did what we could to play our part in the prosperity of Victoria,' Mr Abbott said. As to whether the Budget is in more trouble now than at the start of 2014 he went on to say 'obviously when you've got all of our major commodity prices under pressure, there's less revenue coming into major businesses, obviously because of these cyclical factors there's pressure on the budget that wasn't there at the start of the year'. As for his comments regarding the taking off of barnacles before Christmas, Mr Abbott said: 'It's very important that we crack on with budget repair .. plainly there are some things which are going to have a lot of difficulty in the Senate but if Plan A is in trouble obviously, you contemplate a potential Plan B.' 'Rather than having the best you've got to have something which is better but not as good as you would have wanted.' He defended the imposing of higher income taxes, as a 'perfectly reasonable and fair thing to do' despite breaking another pre-election pledge. As for the Medicare co-payment, Tony Abbott said: 'I know that it well may have trouble in the cross-benches. We are committed until an alternative which makes sense.' On the subject of the $7 Medicare Co-payment and its chances of getting through, the PM did not seem confident of its passage. 'There's been a ferocious campaign against it by the Labor Party,' Mr Abbott added. 'I know that it well may have trouble in the cross-benches. We are committed until an alternative which makes sense.' The federal leader earlier confirmed that he is abandoning plans to cut allowances for Defence personnel. But Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government isn't in a position to boost a below-inflation pay offer of 1.5 per cent a year for the next three years. 'All of us would like to see our defence forces paid more but what's possible with a $20 billion surplus is not always possible with a $40 billion deficit,' he said in Canberra on Monday. 'I think we just have to be realistic about defence force pay.' The government has notified the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal the changes to allowances are not supported by the government and asked that they be discontinued. Restoring the allowances will mean discretionary leave, food and motor vehicle allowances will remain. Mr Abbott says the decision will cost the Defence budget $17 billion. 'There won't be extra money put in so the CDF (chief of the defence force) will have to find the money,' he said.","Prime Minister 'I'm the first to admit the past week was a bit of a ragged one for the government'

"Two heavily pregnant Iranian refugees who refused to get off a bus at the Blaydin immigration detention centre in the Northern Territory for three days have been taken into detention. Maryam, her husband Adnan and their 10 year-old son Amir, along with Tahere and her husband Hossein had been on the bus since 10pm on Saturday, when they arrived in Darwin on a flight from Nauru. The women are both eight months pregnant, with Maryam experiencing complications, and were brought to Darwin with the belief they would be housed in the community for the weeks leading up to the births. Scroll down for video . The bus believed to where the two pregnant women, their husbands and one of Maryam's 10-year-old son spent the last three nights at Wickham Point Detention Centre in Darwin . Adnan and Maryam boarding a plane in Nauru bound for Darwin, according to the Refugee Action Coalition . It is understood that 10-year-old Amir left the bus on Monday afternoon and was accommodated in the facility at Wickham Point, about 40km south of Darwin. Two International Health and Medical Services midwives were monitoring the women, Immigration and Border Protection Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement. 'The women and their families were temporarily transferred to Australia for medical purposes. The families hold valid Nauruan visas and have been settled in that country.' They do not hold Australian visas, he said. 'The women have been placed in the facility best suited to their medical needs. Other family members have been accommodated voluntarily, according to their preference,' he said. They had been on Nauru for about 15 months and had been released as refugees and were living in the community for about six months, said Adnan's brother Soliman Shirvani. He said the women were relieved to finally be off the bus. Pregnant Iranian refugees, Tahere and Maryim, had refused to get off a bus at the Wickham Point Detention Centre (pictured) Mr Shirvani said when the women arrived in Darwin, they were told they didn't have the correct documentation and had to be taken into detention at Wickham Point, which they refused. Mr Shirvani spent four years in detention in Darwin before being accepted as a refugee and moving to Melbourne, and says he was concerned about how the women were coping in the bus in the intense heat. However, the ABC reported that there was air conditioning on the bus while Ian Rintoul, spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition said, according to sources within the centre, they received food, water and medical attention. 'They offered to pay rent for any accommodation outside of detention,' Mr Shirvani told AAP on Monday. 'It's too hard when you live outside and someone wants to take you to detention again, with a pregnant wife.' He did not know when his brother would be able to call him again. Mr Rintoul said the fact it took two and a half days to resolve the matter 'says everything about the contempt the minister has for pregnant women who have come here as refugees.' 'A bus was not an appropriate place for them to be kept,' he said. 'They should not be in immigration detention, they deserve respect as people found to be refugees. 'They should not be deprived of their liberty.' He said it was yet to be revealed what the terms of the agreement were. The office of Immigration minister Scott Morrison (pictured) has denied the Iranian women were told they would be resettled within the community . A spokesman from the Department of Immigration said the couples had not been told they would be housed in the community, but at Wickham Point. He said the women received the care appropriate to their condition.","Two Iranian women refused to enter Wickham Point Detention Centre .

"Billionaire Clive Palmer has opened up about his weight, telling an interviewer it does not hurt his feelings when people joke about his obesity. In this week's Kitchen Cabinet episode, host Annabel Crabb asks the controversial leader whether he is offended by his portrayal as a 'big balloon' in political cartoons. 'Well not at all, because I know a lot of people who are fat that have got great integrity and are people we can all love and have compassion for,' Palmer replied. 'And I wasn't always fat'. 'We all know that physical appearance in the final analysis is not the most important thing in life,' he said. Scroll down for video . Palmer, right, wields thick steaks. Crabb, left, is a vegetarian . Perhaps scarred by a mishap during filming where the mining magnate turned political mastermind nearly sets her on fire, Crabb suggested Palmer was no regular in the kitchen. 'I think he has not been there that often before,' said Crabb, who headed to Palmer's resort at Coolum to be served a salmon steak by the billionaire. Of course, Palmer - a business owner, the leader of the politically significant Palmer United Party who is difficult to miss in the media - may not have much time to hone his cooking skills. Not that he would confess it. 'He claimed to have been up all night making the food,' Crabb told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would reserve judgement on that. MasterChef? Clive escorts Crabb around his Coolum kitchen . Palmer whipped up a gazpacho - a cold vegetarian soup . Candid discussion: Crabb quizzed Palmer, left, about the effect his weight had on his politics . 'Far be it from me to insult any hosts of mine, there was an element of professional flair in the [entree] gazpacho [a cold vegetarian soup] that raised my eyebrows slightly. The interview did touch on weightier subjects. Palmer himself told the program he saw the role of politicians as involving coming in for 'one or two terms and getting out of there.' And Crabb said there was a question mark over his longevity in politics. 'I think he's there to make an impression. You can see that in the way he conducts himself everyday.' This being the man who is building a second Titanic, regularly storms out of televised interviews and, just yesterday, flayed multiple journalists during a press club question and answer session. And while much could happen to his political position in the coming months and years, Crabb neatly captured his way of doing things. Palmer stormed out of a Lateline interview with Emma Alberici in late November . Palmer is pictured here untangling himself from his TV cords . 'You're a public figure Mr Palmer - the public has a right to know,' anchor Emma Alberici said . 'In the mean time, I think he's certainly embracing the ""I'm here for a good time, not a long time approach,""' she said. In the cooking showdown, Palmer also reveals his sense of paranoia about people's loyalty, Crabb said. 'It's a really unusually high degree of anxiety and paranoia,' she explained to Daily Mail Australia. 'He told us that he doesn't allow his staff to even be on the Parliament House mainframe of computers because he doesn't want to spied on.' 'That's a pretty unusual degree of protectiveness against surveillance. And that's really interesting because it dictates how he deals with people and the government.' Indeed, Palmer is often spotted holding meetings around Canberra at various restaurants and bars. On Sunday evening, he held a rendezvous with his estranged former Palmer United Party colleague Jacqui Lambie at Canberra's plush Hotel Hotel. In an address at the National Press Club on Monday, Palmer said Lambie - a 'free and independent woman' - would continue to vote with the Palmer United Party on most issues. It wasn't because of anything he cooked. This week's episode of Kitchen Cabinet will be broadcast at 8pm AEDT on ABC1.","Clive Palmer opens up about his weight in TV interview .

Ms Hicks, who was sitting with her husband Derek, left the courtroom in tears as Ms Cross described the moment she realised Indianna was in trouble. The grieving mother had told the court she was reluctant to leave Indianna with Ms Cross, given she had recently been to the doctor with a cold and still had a runny nose. 'I did question leaving her and she insisted that she would be fine,' Ms Hicks said. Ms Hicks also said she was upset Ms Cross started caring for other children less than a week later, and that she had smelt cigarette smoke on Ms Cross and in her home, which she was also concerned about. But in her evidence, Ms Cross rejected both points, saying she had never smoked and she returned to work only in a reduced capacity four weeks after the incident.

"Few would describe life at Fulham as serene. But, when you’ve left behind the car crash that is Leeds United, that’s how it feels. Despite a run of poor results under Felix Magath, as Ross McCormack chats at Fulham’s Motspur Park training base, the troubles in Yorkshire couldn’t seem farther away. McCormack is, however, intent on setting the record straight surrounding his departure from Leeds - a switch which made him the most expensive player in Championship history when he moved for a jaw-dropping £11million. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Top 10 Ross McCormack transfer memes . New life: Ross McCormack left Leeds United under a cloud when he moved to Fulham for £11million . Adamant: McCormack (centre) insists he did not refuse to train and that he was forced out by Leeds . Controversial: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino claims McCormack forced through a move to Fulham . Goals: McCormack has been brought to West London in order to fire Fulham back to the Premier League . The striker, 28, claims the version put about by Leeds’ Italian owner Massimo Cellino - that the player refused to turn up for training - is laden with inaccuracy. ‘It’s pretty easy to respond to because it’s just pure facts,’ McCormack said. ‘I was told by the club not to train because they were talking to Fulham. ‘They didn’t want me injured with the size of the fee - it was important to the club that they didn’t miss out on that. I didn’t train on the Thursday or Friday. We were off Saturday and Sunday. Monday was the day the fee was agreed. Leeds were going to Italy for pre-season so I was down here doing my medical.’ Cellino asserts that was the day McCormack failed to show up for training. ‘Where that one came from, that I didn’t show up on the Monday to go to training, is ludicrous.’ There was no resentment in McCormack’s voice, no disbelief. The tone was one of grim acceptance. ‘It’s just the way that it was always going to be,’ he added. ‘It was never going to be “thanks for what you did last season, thanks for the help you’ve given the club”. It was pretty nasty in the end to be honest. New challenge: McCormack has left the car crash at Leeds but is now in a struggling Fulham side . Happy: McCormack says that his family were settled in Yorkshire and he had no desire to leave the club . Struggles: Fulham are languishing towards the bottom of the Championship under Felix Magath this season . Setting sights low: Cellino (right) has already sacked Leeds United boss Dave Hockaday (left) this season . Revolving door: Cellino (right) only parted company with former manager Brian McDermott (right) in May . ‘The conversations were that the club didn’t want me to leave - or Mr Cellino, Mr President… the chairman - he didn’t want me to leave. He said you can leave but it’s got to come across as you are initiating it. ‘So there was a transfer request put in all for the benefit of the club, where they can come across in a good light to the fans. ‘Unfortunately at the time the fans probably took sides with the owner. After a few things have come to light maybe they are turning a little bit. ‘At the time I didn’t want to go. I wasn’t the only player that didn’t really like what was going on. The only difference was that I was probably the only one who said what he felt. They didn’t take too kindly to that.’ Settled: McCormack is starting to get used to life at Fulham and has moved close to the club's training base . Price tag: McCormack moved to Fulham for a hefty £11m but insists that fee will not affect him this season . So, was it the case that Cellino smelled the cash and got shut of McCormack? ‘There you go. He named his price and he got it. It’s sad because that was somewhere I honestly thought I was going to finish my career. I believed it was my club. ‘I had a house there and was more than happy to retire there. My little man was settled and my missus liked it.’ McCormack now lives close by to Fulham with his girlfriend Courtney and son Layton and has settled well down south. The focus on a different pressure - arresting Fulham’s recent slide - is a relief as he prepares to link up with last season’s strike partner Matt Smith, who was also shown the door at Leeds. The huge fee paid by Fulham doesn’t daunt him, and he delivered a fair dollop of pragmatism with his reasoning, addressing why there was only a £5m difference between himself and Liverpool’s £16m signing Mario Balotelli. New partnership: McCormack will hope to strike up a good understanding with Matt Smith at Fulham this year . Big money: McCormack cost £5m less than Mario Balotelli, who moved to Liverpool this summer for £16m . ‘What you’ve got to remember is I had four years left on my contract at Leeds. Fulham had to pay a premium to get me out of that contract,’ he added. ‘It’s hard to sit here and say I could’ve gone to other clubs but I probably could have. But Fulham were willing to give Leeds the most money. Leeds said “you’re either going there or you’re not going at all”. ‘If you’re talking Balotelli, if AC Milan didn’t want to sell him then he wouldn’t be sold for £16m. I’d say there’d be an extra £10m on top of that because he’s worth it.’ It is only four years ago that Leeds paid Cardiff £300,000 for McCormack. ‘You’re worth what someone is willing to pay for you,’ he said. If only there was that kind of reasoning at the club the Scot left behind.

"A rare eyewitness account by one of the British heroes of the Battle of Rorke's Drift - where 150 soldiers fought off 4,000 Zulu warriors - has sold for £15,500 at auction. Assistant Commissary Officer (ACO) Walter Dunne's letter, dated January 24, 1879, describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended the outpost in South Africa. The ACO was recommended for the Victoria Cross for his role in the heroic stand, which was later immortalised in the 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine and Stanley Baker. Remarkable: 135 years after Rorke's Drift this letter, left, by Walter Dunne, right, has sold at auction . Brave: At Rorke's Drift 150 British soldiers successfully defended the outpost against 4,000 Zulu warriors . The high sale price was expected because of how rare the letter is and not least because the piece of paper was actually at the Battle of Rorke's Drift . The letter, which was bought by a museum, reveals how, together with a comrade, he fortified the mission station by organising a makeshift barricade from 200lb mealie bags which were stacked 5ft high. The following day, ACO Dunne picked up a delivery note for the mealie bags and used it to write the letter to friend Capt Warneford in Cape Colony in South Africa. He describes how, after the Zulus killed 1,500 British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot at Isandlwana, they headed to the outpost at Rorke's Drift, quickly surrounding the troops. The Rorke's Drift letter was discovered in an album of letters, paintings and other items collected by Captain WJ Warneford's wife Winifred. The sale at auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire, also saw letters from Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Foot, fetch £1,200 when they went under the hammer. They were bought by a collector who specialises in the Zulu wars. Lt Bromhead was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the battle. Letters from Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Durnford, who was killed at nearby Isandlwana, were also part of the sale. The letter was addressed to ACO Dunne's good friend Captain W. J. Warneford (pictured) Rorke's Drift/ 24 Jan.r '79/ . My dear Warneford, Sad news about the 1/24th. (1st Battalion, 24th Foot) 5Cd commanded by Col. Pulleine were cut to pieces and the camp sacked. 20 Officers are missing. About 1000 of the Kafirs came in here and attacked us on the same day (22nd). We had got about 2 hours notice and fortified the place with trap of grain biscuit boxes &c. They came on most determinedly on all sides. They drove our fellows out of the Hospital, killed the patients and burned the place. They made several attempts to storm us but the soldiers (B Co of 24th under Bromhead) kept up such a steady killing fire that they were driven back each time. We had only 80 men, the contingent having bolted before a shot was fired. The fight was kept up all night & in the morning the Kafirs retreated leaving 351 dead bodies. Dalton was wounded in the shoulder and temp clerk Byrne killed & 12 of the men... W A Dunne (over) Some of the missing are Pulleine, Col. Dunford, Capt. Russell, Hodson (killed), Anstey, Daly, Mostyn, Dyer, Griffith, Pope, Austin, Pulleine (2 Mr.) Shepherd (S... major) Wardell (killed), Younghusband, Degacher, Porteous, Carage Dyson, Atkinson - Coghill is believed to have escaped & also Melvill. Michael Caine pictured during shot from the film 1964 film Zulu, in which he plays Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead . Of ACO Dunne's letter, auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: 'We were very happy with that because it was a unique piece of history. We were delighted to have been given the opportunity of selling it. Material from Rorke's Drift is like hen's teeth - you just do not come across it.' ACO Dunne, who was in charge of the stores at Rorke's Drift, praises Lt Bromhead who was played by Caine in the famous film. The defence of Rorke's Drift was recognised with the awarding of no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses. ACO Dunne, from County Cork, was turned down for a VC but was mentioned in dispatches. After 35 years of service, he retired to Gibraltar in 1908 but died the same year at a nursing home. Mr Aldridge described the album as a 'fascinating chronicle of a colonial family in the early part of the 19th century - a tumultuous period of history'. Finest hour: Painting commemorating the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879 - a victory by the British against the odds . It was on January 22 1879, on the Natal border with Zululand, in South Africa, that the tiny British garrison of 140 men - many of them sick and wounded - fought for at least 12 hours to repel repeated attacks by up to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The defence was rewarded by Queen Victoria's government with no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses. The name of Rorke’s Drift led to the much-loved film starring Stanley Baker and Michael Caine. The movie, which is still celebrated more than 50 years after it was made, saw Baker play Lieutenant John Chard, while Caine played his right-hand man, Lieutenant Goville Bromhead. After fighting day and night the Zulus eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded. It was part of the wider Anglo - Zulu war took place during 1879. The conflict began because the Zulu kingdom presented an obstacle to British imperial ambitions in southern Africa. The British invasion of Zululand began on January 11 1879, with the British objective being an eventual federation in Africa. The battle of Isandlwana erupted on the 22nd of January 1879, 11 days after the British started their invasion. 20,000 Zulu warriors attacked 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and 400 civilians. The Zulus, who had more numbers, overwhelmed the British, killing over 1,300 troops, while around 1,000 Zulu soldiers were killed. The battle of Rorke's Drift started almost immediately after, ending on the 23rd. The Battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July 1879 effectively ended the Zulu-Anglo war, with the defeat of the Zulu forces by the British when over 5,200 British and African soldiers razed the capital of Zululand after defeating the main Zulu army. The war ultimately ended with a British victory, and Zulu independence.","Authentic, first-hand account of battle in South Africa sells for £15,000 .

"Clive Palmer has hit out at a journalist who dared ask a question about the fraud allegations against him, telling him to ‘think’ for himself. Mr Palmer attacked Courier-Mail correspondent Steven Scott while speaking at a Press Club lunch in Canberra after Scott tried to quiz him about a ‘fraudulent and dishonest payments’ court case he is embroiled in. The 60-year-old businessman is accused of misusing $12 million from two Chinese-owned companies and the case is currently before the Supreme Court of Queensland. Mr Palmer refused to allow Mr Scott to ask questions shouting ‘no,no,no’. ‘Why don’t you try to be an independent journalist?,’ he blasted. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer attacked a journalist during a Press Club lunch in Canberra . ‘I'm not going to let him get his question out. I'm not going to take that rubbish,’ he fumed. 'Have some guts to Rupert, don’t do what he tells you from New York... Stand up and be a journalist. Don’t read off that, think off your own brain and think of a question,' he raged. The PUP Leader attacked the Courier-Mail newspaper and its cartoons as a ‘national disgrace to journalism’. A journalist at The Saturday Paper, Sophie Morris, stuck up for Scott and fired back: 'Mr Palmer are you so convinced that Rupert Murdoch controls the views of all his journalists because you as a billionaire control the views of all your remaining senators?' Mr Palmer did not back down and replied: 'I don't control anyone’s views. Individual citizens can think how they wish but certainly Rupert Murdoch it would seem does, as he's sacked so many people in this country.’ The PUP Leader attacked the Courier-Mail newspaper and its cartoons . Palmer's tirade did not stop when another journalist stuck up for Scott . The mining giant went on: '500 people have been sacked from News Corporation in Queensland over the last three years, if you go to the annual reports of News Limited and have a look at that. The Australian hasn't made a profit for over 50 years so you've got to ask what its economic rationale for being there. ‘The editor of the Sydney paper was sacked last election, we had News Limited editors coming from New York telling them what they could write and we had the cartoons of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and people being demeaned as individuals rather than attacking their policies. ‘As I said it makes no sense to attack individuals we need to attack the ideas to get the right policies for the country.' Mr Palmer became irate after he was asked about his fraud case . Morris responded: 'Why are you attacking journalists doing their job? This is a journalist club he was asking a question.' Mr Palmer said he could not answer Scott’s question because it was about an active court case. 'I can't answer questions on that because the matter is before the court and it would be contempt of court. Now that's an answer and to persist with questions once you know that is really a disrespect for the court and fairness, and that's what it's about. ‘He raised serious allegations which are just allegations which have been raised before for six months by News Limited papers and lead nowhere.’","Clive Palmer attacked journalist Steven Scott .

"Liverpool defender Daniel Agger has completed a surprise move to his former club Brondby, the Anfield club have confirmed. The 29-year-old central defender spent 10 years with the Danish side after starting his career with the club before moving to Liverpool in 2006 for £6 million. The Denmark international has made 232 appearances for the Merseyside club, but has only lifted a single trophy - the 2012 Carling Cup at Wembley. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: There will be players leaving before Monday . Back hoome: Daniel Agger (above) poses in a Brondby shirt after his move from Liverpool . Great Dane: Daniel Agger has left Liverpool to return to his former club Brondby . Cult hero: Daniel Agger has built a 'unique connection' with Reds fans during his nine-year spell at Anfield . The arrival of Dejan Lovren from Southampton in the summer has seen Agger fall further down the pecking order under Brendan Rodgers. 'Liverpool have been such a big part of my life and my family's lives for so long, that leaving is extremely difficult,' Agger told Liverpoolfc.com. 'The opportunity arose for me to return home to Brondby and at this stage of my career it felt like the right decision for me. 'I wouldn't leave here to go anywhere else and that has been proven by my actions in recent seasons - I have turned down many offers to move to other Premier League and European clubs. 'I would like to thank the Liverpool supporters for the incredible backing they have given me in my time here and the warmth and generosity of spirit displayed to my family. Case for the defenceThe Denmark international was signed by Rafa Benitez (L) for £6m in 2009 . 'This has been our home and somewhere we have been very happy and settled. However, more recently I have started to feel the effects of playing regularly in a league that is as physically demanding as the Premier League is, and I would not want to stay if I did not think that I was able to meet that challenge week in, week out. 'The club itself is very special and I shall remain a supporter for the rest of my life. I regard every game I played at Anfield as a privilege.' One person who is certainly sad to see Agger leave the club is his Danish sporting compatriot Caroline Wozniacki. The former world No 1 tennis player, who is a devoted Liverpool supporter, posted a message on her Twitter account to express her surprise at Agger's departure. 'Woke up to the news @DanielAgger is leaving Liverpool. Don't understand Rogers didn't want to use him. Class player. He will be missed #ynwa,' she tweeted.

The manager said: 'We wish Daniel and his family well for the future. We've been discussing Daniel's future with him during the close season and I know this is a decision he has reached after much soul searching and deliberation.

"PayPal has fired an executive after less than two months in the job over an ill-advised Twitter rant in which he cursed out colleagues and called them ‘useless.’ Rakesh ‘Rocky’ Agrawal bashed his new colleagues after the company hired him as director of strategy – and then he blamed it on not knowing how to use an Android phone. The vitriolic, spelling error-riddled tweeting began around 1.00 a.m Saturday while he was out in New Orleans and ended with him saying he quit the firm.

'Duck you Smedley you useless middle. manager,’ he tweeted. ‘Christina Smedley is a useless. Piece of s**t.’ He then incoherently called for the head of a previously unknown employee. ‘People who should be fire from paypal Don Christmas a pool a kick.’ The tech industry veteran then claimed he could make Foursquare a $50billion company. ‘I can turn foursquare into a $50 bill OK n company let’s chat,’ he tweeted. Take that!: Agrawal started his profane ranting by sticking up his middle finger . Not a fan: His ranting began against Christina Smedley .

"More than half of police and crime commissioners have had misconduct complaints made against them. The police watchdog has received allegations of wrongdoing against 23 of the 41 officials who were elected in November 2012. The commissioners replaced police authorities in England and Wales in a bid to make policing more accountable, but as concerns grow over their conduct a parliamentary committee is due to investigate the high level of complaints. Scroll down for video . Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs committee, pictured, said he was concerned over the level of complaints made against crime commissioners and he would raise the matter immediately . The Independent Police Complaints Commission last night said only six of the 43 complaints had resulted in full investigations. Yet Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs committee, told the Times newspaper the number of complaints was disappointing, adding: ‘What it shows is that people appear to have lost confidence with the office to such an extent that there is the equivalent of one complaint per police authority.’ The Labour MP said he would write to police and crime panels to see what had been done about the complaints the IPCC had been unable to investigate. Among the cases referred to the IPCC is the recent resignation of South Yorkshire’s commissioner Shaun Wright. It is due to announce soon whether it will formally investigate allegations about his knowledge of child sexual exploitation while he worked at Rotherham council. Lancashire’s Clive Grunshaw was investigated by the watchdog over expenses claims he made as a county councillor. The IPCC said the Crown Prosecution Service is again considering material after initially ruling he would not face any further action. Kent’s Ann Barnes is being investigated for an allegation of driving without insurance. Kent's  Ann Barnes, pictured, is being investigated over an allegation of driving without correct insurance . And the IPCC is due to announce whether it will hand prosecutors the case of Durham’s Ron Hogg over allegations about benefits he received while serving with Cleveland police. Allegations of electoral fraud by PCCs in Hampshire and North Wales were investigated but no action was taken. An IPCC spokesman said 14 of the complaints were not investigated because they were allegations that the watchdogs had not registered with the Information Commissioner as information providers. Unless they are convicted of a crime, PCCs can only be ousted in elections held every four years. Following Mr Wright’s initial refusal to resign over the Rotherham scandal Home Secretary Theresa May indicated she would back a new law to allow PCCs to be sacked in extreme circumstances. The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners is also said to be considering the proposals, as well as ‘beefing up’ police and crime panels.","More than half of crime commissioners have been accused of misconduct .

"Jimmy Savile could have sexually abused up to 1,350 victims, treble the number who have come forward so far, the police officer that exposed him said today. Operation Yewtree, which is looking into allegations of sex crimes against the former DJ and presenter, as well as a host of other celebrities, has recorded 450 complaints against him. But former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Peter Spindler, who led Yewtree until earlier this year, told an NSPCC conference that as well as those who came forward there were 'probably double, treble who haven't'. Paedophile: There have been 450 complaints of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile - but it is alleged there could have been three times as many victims, according to former Met Chief Superintendent Peter Spindler (right) 'My best guess is that there are many other victims who won't have come forward because they don't want to talk about it,' he told The Sun. 'They've dealt with it, they've put it in the past. 'So even with the 450 that have come forward there must be many more. That's not just true for Savile, it's true for other offenders as well.' A report released earlier this year revealed the disgraced TV presenter was one of the UK's 'most prolific known sexual predators' and said his victims included an eight-year-old boy and a seriously ill teenager. The report by Scotland Yard and the NSPCC, released in January, found that Savile's reign of sexual abuse spanned 54 years. Since the initial claims emerged in early October last year the former Top Of The Pops host, who died in 2011 at the age of 84, has had 214 criminal offences recorded against his name, including 34 rapes, . Disgraced: Around 450 individuals have contacted police with allegations against Savile since the launch of Operation Yewtree . Mr Spindler stepped down from Operation Yewtree earlier this month to become an Assistant Inspector of Constabulary. Other have previously said the number of possible Savile victims could be much higher. Mark Williams-Thomas, who presented the original ITV documentary which first exposed the Jim'll Fix It star as a dangerous sexual predator, said he could have targeted hundreds more victims in his near six decades of abuse. In January he said: 'The first offence was in 1955 and the last in 2009, that's almost 60 years of offending. There could be at least double the number of potential victims, it's a mere drop in the ocean.'","Met detective behind Savile probe says there will be more than 450 victims .

"Juan Mata was annoyed to see his Manchester United team-mates resort to route-one football at times in Saturday's disappointing draw at Burnley. Louis van Gaal is still searching for his first win as Red Devils boss following the uninspiring goalless stalemate at Turf Moor. Angel di Maria, playing in a midfield three alongside Mata and Darren Fletcher, produced flashes of brilliance, but Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie both had off days up front and could not convert a host of chances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal discuss another poor United result . Frustration: Juan Mata said that he was frustrated as his team-mates resorted to long balls . United did not help their cause in the first half by launching long balls to their strikers, effectively bypassing a midfield containing nearly £100million of talent. Mata admits United lacked confidence in their build-up play on Saturday, which led them to start pumping long balls up field. 'Maybe in the build-up [there were confidence issues] as we were trying to build up from the back but sometimes we didn't do it well,' the Spaniard told MUTV. 'We played most of the time in their half which is good but, if you don't score from these chances, then it's not good enough. 'I believe, when we try to play football in the last third, we can create but we played too many long balls in the first half which is maybe why we didn't play as well.' Stalemate: Manchester United drew 0-0 with newly-promoted Burnley at Turf Moor . This match just how big a gap there is between United and the teams vying for the title. Chelsea tore Burnley apart in a thrilling first half at Turf Moor on the opening weekend of the season, but United failed to impose themselves on the game until late in the second half. United's faltering start has affected the team's self-belief, according to their manager. 'I don't think our confidence level was very high in the first half,' said Van Gaal, who suffered an embarrassing 4-0 defeat to MK Dons on Tuesday. 'But I think that's normal when a club like United loses the first match and draws the second one. 'The pressure is higher and you have to cope with that. I could see in the first half that the players were very nervous to play the ball. 'We restored that in the second half, and maybe that will raise our confidence.' Debut: British record transfer signing Angel di Maria made his Premier League debut against Burnley . The one crumb of comfort for United was the influence of Di Maria, who completed his record-breaking move to United from Real Madrid on Tuesday. The £59.7million man created a couple of openings with incisive passes and his running stretched the Burnley defence in the first half when he drifted out wide. Ashley Young thinks United have pulled off a major coup by signing the midfielder, who was one of the stars of the World Cup. 'I think it makes a big statement to people out there,' Young said. 'A lot of people might say we can't attract world-class players but we've just done that with the signings of Luke (Shaw), Ander (Herrera), Marcos (Rojo) and now Angel. 'Angel is a fantastic signing. Real Madrid have other top players in their team like [Gareth] Bale and [Cristiano] Ronaldo but he's the one who stood out for me in that team. Problems: Louis van Gaal is still without a Premier League win and is already  out of the League Cup . 'When you add quality to a squad that already has quality it can only help us.' Burnley manager Sean Dyche can only dream of being able to sign a player for almost £60million. The fact that the Clarets have only spent £45million on transfers in their 132-year history shows how impressive Saturday's draw was for the Premier League newcomers. 'Manchester United are in a transitional period but they are still very good,' said Dyche, who suffered defeats to Chelsea and Swansea in his opening two games. 'It's the strongest I've seen them since the start of the season so we are very happy. 'It's important we go into the international break after a really good performance and your first point on the board. 'And when the games come around again after taking stock of the season so far, we'll be ready to go hard again.'","Manchester United an Burnley drew 0-0 at Turf Moor .

"An asteroid the size of a whale was today on its final approach to a nail biting encounter with Earth on Sunday evening. Similar in size to the Chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over Russia’s Ural Mountains region in February 2013, Nasa says we will have a ‘very close’ shave - but that there is no risk. At the time of closest approach, asteroid 2014 RC will be one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 25,000 miles (40,000km). Scroll down for video . This graphic depicts the passage of asteroid 2014 RC past Earth on September 7. At time of closest approach, it will be one-tenth the distance from Earth to the moon. Times indicated on the graphic are Universal Time . At its closest point to Earth will be above New Zealand on 7 September at about 20.18 BST. At the time of closest approach, asteroid 2014 RC will be one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 25,000 miles (40,000km). Astronomers say the asteroid will pass below Earth and the ring of communications and weather satellites orbiting about 22,000 miles (36,000km) above our planet’s surface. To watch the approach live visit the Slooh space telescope. Astronomers have dubbed the asteroid 'pitbull' because of its small size and threatening path. The news comes just days after Brian Cox told MailOnline that the world is ill-equipped to deal with asteroid threats, which could someday wipe out humanity. From its reflected brightness, astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about 60ft (20 metres) in size. At its closest point to Earth will be above New Zealand on 7 September at about 20.18 BST. 'Amateur astronomers with small telescopes might glimpse the fast-moving appearance of this near-Earth asteroid,' Nasa said. Astronomers say the asteroid will pass below Earth and the ring of communications and weather satellites orbiting about 22,000 miles (36,000km) above our planet’s surface. It was initially discovered on the night of August 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Arizona, and independently detected the next night by the Pan-Starrs 1 telescope in Hawaii. An asteroid the size of a whale will have a ‘very close’ shave with Earth on Sunday, Nasa has reported. This image shows the orbit of asteroid 2014 RC around the sun. The asteroid is about 60ft (20 metres) in size . The asteroid was initially discovered on the night of August 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey (pictured) near Tucson, Arizona, and independently detected the next night by the Pan-Starrs 1 telescope in Hawaii . ‘While this celestial object does not appear to pose any threat to Earth or satellites, its close approach creates a unique opportunity for researchers to observe and learn more about asteroids,’ it added. Asteroid 2014 RC will not hit Earth, but its orbit will bring it back to our planet's neighbourhood in the future. The asteroid's future motion will be closely monitored, but no future threatening Earth encounters have been identified, according to Nasa. However, earlier this week, Brian Cox warned MailOnline that ‘there is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us.’ No one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox tells MailOnline. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it’ And no one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox told MailOnline. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it.’ He referred to the bus-sized asteroid, named 2014 EC, came within 38,300 (61,637km) miles of Earth in March - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet. The date of Earth's potential destruction has been set at 16 March 2880, when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet. Researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart, but somehow remains intact on its Earth-bound trajectory. They believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as van der Waals - and although this is considered a major breakthrough, scientists still don't know how to stop it. The discovery was made by researchers at the University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville. Previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and friction. The asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles (15km) a second relative to the Earth. It is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour. It is estimated that if 1950 DA were to collide with the planet, it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of TNT. Although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent, this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids. And it wasn’t the only one threatening Earth. Nasa is currently tracking 1,400 'potentially hazardous asteroids' and predicting their future approaches and impact probabilities. The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact.","2014 RC will be above New Zealand at 20.18 BST during closest approach .

"Asked in an interview with Sportsmail before the World Cup to name his favourite English defenders, Radamel Falcao struggled initially, and then came up with the names of John Terry and Gary Cahill. Remembering the hat-trick he scored against Cahill in the 2012 European Super Cup should send a shudder through the ranks of the Premier League's other defenders – if this is what he does against someone he rates, then what will he do to the rest? Manchester United have acquired the services of the man Diego Simeone called the world's best No 9 when he coached him at Atletico Madrid. VIDEO Scroll down to watch what Wayne Rooney and Ronaldo think of Falcao signing . Fresh start: Radamel has joined Manchester United on loan with a view to a permanent deal . Warm welcome: Falcao receives his new shirt from club legend and assistant manager Ryan Giggs . His record in finals played in Europe sums up what a big-occasion player he is. He got the winner for Porto against Braga in 2011's Europa League final and scored twice against Athletic Bilbao to retain the title. Then came that Chelsea demolition. At best, United will only be playing one final (the FA Cup) this year but they have acquired the services of a man who has played in three since 2011, scoring six goals and always ending up on the winning side. The son of Radamel Garcia, a rugged centre back who played most of his career in Venezuela, Falcao was named after Paulo Roberto Falcao, Brazil's No 15 in their 1982 World Cup dream team. Goal-getter: Falcao celebrates scoring for Monaco on one of his first appearances for the club in pre-season . Prolific: Falcao wheels away after netting for Porto against rivals Braga in the 2011 Europa League final . He soon showed himself to be worthy of the name with goals that earned him a move to River Plate aged just 15. 'He was like a rock,' said former Argentina defender Hernan Diaz, impressed at the unflustered nature of the new arrival he tried to intimidate on his first day. Falcao was already showing a resilience of character that would serve him well in the 27-dorm block of youth team accommodation alongside River Plate's Estadio Monumental, where he boarded a long way from his family in Colombia. In 2001, River's Under-16s went to Berlin to play in a 32-team tournament and he was all that anyone could talk about, shooting River into the semi-finals where he scored in the last minute against Real Madrid and then headed his team in front against Vitoria de Guimaraes in the final only to lose out 2-1. Injuries slowed his progress and one torn ankle ligament kept him out for eight months. He kept the faith through the long period of inactivity and 'keeping the faith' in Falcao's case can be taken literally. Deadly: Falcao celebratesscoring in the 2012 Super Cup against Chelsea (left) and scores against Athletic Bilbao in the 2012 Europa League final in Bucharest . He can be seen dedicating goals and trophies to the heavens as a teenage prodigy. This is a player who has not ruled out working for the church when he retires. The faith was tested again when he tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee in 2006 but again he showed that iron will to come back just as strong. He scored a hat-trick against Botafogo in the South American Cup in 2007 when his team were 2-1 down, playing with 10 men, and needing to win by two clear goals. The feat is still referred to as the 'Unforgettable Night' by fans who celebrated a title a year later with Falcao top scorer and Simeone as manager. After 72 goals in two seasons at Porto he moved to Atletico Madrid where he linked up again with Simeone. The coach instructed his new players that tactics would revolve around Falcao – their passes would find him, and he would do the rest. Hammer blow: Falcao sits next to Colombia coach Jose Pekerman as he is ruled out the World Cup in June . Two years older with another cruciate ligament injury, this time in the left knee, and a sabbatical in Monaco behind him, it remains to be seen whether Falcao is the same player that scored 52 goals in 67 games in La Liga. The desire from the player is definitely there. 'I like how competitive the Premier League is and how teams who are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition's goal,' he said at the end of last season. 'I want to play in the English league.'","Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United on loan on transfer deadline day .

"Former Arsenal striker Alan Smith would love to see Danny Welbeck at the Emirates and insists Arsene Wenger can transform him into a 'top player'. Welbeck has fallen out of favour at Manchester United under Louis van Gaal, and is expected to leave the club before the transfer window closes on Monday night. Smith believes he could be the solution to Wenger's striker shortage, tellingskysports.com: 'I think he would make an excellent signing for somebody. He's had unfair criticism over the last couple of years really, he's been playing out of position at United and shunted around the park. Goal: Danny Welbeck celebrates scoring against Los Angeles Galaxy during a pre-season friendly in July . Out of favour: Welbeck made his first United start of the season against MK Dons on Tuesday night . 'Yes, his finishing hasn't been up to scratch at times but that comes from not playing in your regular position. I think if he was given an extended spell through the middle, where he likes it, you would see a really top player develop. I would love to see him at Arsenal.' Giroud's injury looks set to rule him out until the new year, and Wenger may still decide to add to his squad. When asked to compare Giroud and Welbeck, Smith was quick to point out the difference in styles between the two players. 'Danny Welbeck's got most attributes. Olivier Giroud is a very good target man and is a very good header of the ball, and he'll get you 20+ goals, so that's not to be sniffed at, but Danny is different.

"The years of upheaval following Egypt's revolution has had a direct impact on tourism revenues. With westerners more cautious about visiting the country due to travel warnings and social unrest, it has meant the likes of the Great Pyramids and Tutankhamun's Tomb have seen a reduced footfall. The Egyptian government estimate that revenues have fallen by 95 per cent since the revolution, from £250 million in 2010 to just £10.5 million for 2014. Scroll down for video . Should be enjoyed: Westerners are being put off travelling to see The Great Pyramids of Egypt due to the country's 'instability' Although tourism has picked up in the Red Sea resorts, Cairo, Luxor and Aswan are still struggling to attract an income from visitors. This is leaving the antiquities ministry in a difficult predicament, with job losses a distinct possibility. Speaking to The Guardian, the editor of the Luxor Times, Mena Melad, said:  'It's dead. It's even worse than in 1997 after the massacre of the tourists' at the Hatshepsut temple in the Valley of the Kings.

The financial problems the country is going through was reflected in the July budget, when, with the aim to reducing the deficit by 10 per cent, new austerity measures were brought in. The focus of the reforms were aimed at galvanising the Egyptian people to support the government and give them time to turn around the country's crippling debts.

"A millionaire couple turned tradition on its head by handing out £100,000 cash in red envelopes to well-wishers during their lavish nuptials in China. The bride and groom, aged their mid-20s, arranged for 'volunteers' to hand out envelopes of money to onlookers lining the streets to watch their wedding convoy of supercars in Dongguan. It is Chinese tradition to give away 'little red envelopes' of cash at weddings, but it is the guests who gift the bride and groom with money, not the other way around.

The couple were not named, but the groom is reportedly the multimillionaire owner and manager of an e-commerce company that apparently only started trading a year ago. 'I only started trading recently and we had a huge financial windfall, and I wanted to make everyone shared in my good fortune to bring luck for me and my bride in our future life together,' the groom told local media. The envelopes contained amounts ranging between the equivalent of £1 to £10, a relatively large amount by Chinese standards and guaranteeing an enthusiastic reception for the bride and groom. They were taken to the ceremony in a stretch Hummer limousine, which was followed by a range of supercars, including Lamborghinis and Porsches.

"How do your fingers measure up? If you’re a man, it could reveal more about you than you thought. Researchers say that the length of a man’s index finger compared to his ring finger on his right hand is an indicator of his testicle size. And the study claims that the digit ratio could be used to predict testicle volumes of any male. Scroll down for video . Researchers in South Korea say finger ratios affect the size of testicles. Men with larger testes were found to have longer ring than index fingers. The study was based on 172 Korean men aged 20 to 69 years old. In the image above, the man with hand on the left would have smaller testicles than the one on the right . The study was carried out by South Korean researchers from the Department of Urology at Gachon University Gil Hospital in Incheon and Seoul National University Hospital. A previous study revealed that the size of men's and women's index and ring fingers is an indication of how attractive they are to the opposite sex. According to the findings, a woman whose index finger is longer than her ring finger is likely to have a symmetrical and more appealing face. For men, it is the opposite - those whose ring fingers are longer than their index fingers are more likely to be attractive to women. The discovery was made by Bernhard Fink of the University of Vienna, who measured the fingers of 100 men and women and photographed their faces using a digital camera. He used a computer programme to assess the symmetry of each face. They found that adult males with a ring finger longer than their index finger on their right hand had larger testicles. Conversely, men with a longer index finger compared to their ring finger have smaller testicles. Prior to the study it had already been suggested that second to fourth digit ratio correlated with the male reproductive system. This was based on the finding that Hox genes - which help lay out how a person’s body takes shape - control finger development and genital development during the embryonic stage. Previous research has suggested that the size of a man's testicle correlates with the volume of semen he produces. In the study a total of 172 Korean men aged 20 to 69 years, already hospitalised for urological surgery, were enrolled. First, the researchers measured the length of the second and fourth digits of each participant. Then, separately and independently, an experienced urologist measured their testes size. The results then showed that digit ratio was inversely proportionate to adult testicular volume - meaning that a longer ring finger correlated to larger testicles and vice versa. In the study the researchers also found that age and height did not have much effect on testicular volume, while weight had a marginal correlation. In the study the fingers and testicles of the volunteers were measured in size independently and highlighted the correlation between finger and testicle size. However in the research no correlation between testicle size and age or height was found .","Researchers in South Korea say finger ratios on the right hand of adult males is an indicator of the size of their testicles .

Isil fanatics appears to add the sickening killing of Steven Sotloff to . the long litany of barbaric acts that have been committed.’ He . said member states faced a ‘stark choice’, to either ‘ enfeeble’ the . alliance by letting investment dry up, or by ‘reviving its spirit’. ‘Let me be very clear about the UK’s . position,’ he said. ‘It’s time now to toughen up so that Nato can deal . with the aggression and the threats that we face. ‘That . means rapid reaction forces that are worthy of the name, that means . better sharing of capability, and it means the first ever public . commitment to increase defence spending. ‘That . will demonstrate to all those who threaten us that the state of our . transatlantic bond is strong. The unpredictable and uncertain threats of . today and tomorrow demand nothing less than that.’ Calling . for Britain’s Nato allies to increase their defence investment to prove . the alliance ‘means business’, Mr Fallon warned the United States will . not go on ‘picking up the cheque’ if Europe chooses to prioritise social . welfare spending when ‘threats are on our doorstep’. He . said: ‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way.

"Scotland golden boy Ikechi Anya has emerged as a transfer target for Celtic following his weekend heroics in Germany. A £1.5million move for the Watford winger was discussed by Parkhead coaching staff when Ronny Deila scoured the market for wing reinforcements last month. Celtic eventually settled on loan deals for Ghanaian Wakaso Mubarak and Aleksandar Tonev. Attracting interest: Scotland star Ikechi Anya is wanted by Celtic . Anya’s stock has risen following a composed strike against the world champions in Dortmund, however, and Sportsmail understands the Scottish champions have asked Anya’s representatives to keep them informed of his situation. Linked with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Cardiff in the summer, the 26-year-old is keen on a return to Glasgow, the city where he was born to a Nigerian father and Romanian mother. And Scotland manager Gordon Strachan believes Anya is destined for bigger things than the English Championship after his second Scotland goal in seven appearances. Magic moment: Anya scored against Germany in Sunday's qualifier . ‘The coaching staff scratch our heads at times and wonder why he is not playing in the English Premier League,’ said Strachan last night. ‘It’s not mugs he’s playing against here - it’s Germany, Croatia, Belgium and England. The Macedonians were no mugs either and he scored against them, too. ‘There is no doubt about it. He could go to a Celtic or to a club in the English Premier League no bother. ‘He can play different positions, too, which makes him even more valuable. He can play on the left as he did against Germany, he can play on the right side, he can even play left-back. He has not got a problem with any of them. Mobbed: Anya is pounced on by his Scotland team-mates after stunning the Germans . ‘And he has a love for the game which is so refreshing. I think he’s worked so hard to get to where he is right now that he doesn’t want to lose it.’ Anya’s 66th-minute strike against the Germans raised hopes – briefly – of a stunning start to the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Racing on to a Steven Fletcher pass, he outpaced the German defence and slotted the ball with aplomb past Manuel Neuer, widely hailed as the world’s best goalkeeper. ‘When he was running through I thought to myself: “Right, you’ve just sprinted for 30 yards and now you’re up against the best goalie in the world”,’ said Strachan. High praise: Scotland boss Gordon Strachan says Anya wouldn't look out of place in the Premier League . ‘But he stuck it away as if it was in a training game. The ball hasn’t trickled into the back of the net either, he knew exactly what he was doing. ‘His personality is really infectious. Every morning myself and the staff are the first ones up for breakfast. We make sure of it. Sometimes we are even there before breakfast opens up. ‘But every morning Ikechi is the first player through those doors. Always. Never fails. ‘He looks like he’s a guy who can’t wait to get out of his bed in the morning, to go training and to meet people. Other ones trawl in at different times but his personality is: “Right, I want to make the most of what I’ve got”. ‘Maybe it’s because he came into professional football so late on in life. You have to take a few knocks in life to appreciate what you’ve got and that might be the cas .","Anya's stock has risen since his goal against Germany in Sunday's qualifier .

"A celebrity minder assaulted by police in a convenience store with comedian Noel Fielding won more than £100,000 in compensation yesterday. A judge found that Jimmy Browne’s leg was crushed in an unlawful attempted arrest. Judge Rosalind Coe, QC, said two policemen recognised Fielding, who was dressed in a gaudy stage costume, as the star of the surreal BBC comedy show The Mighty Boosh. Mr Fielding (left) was dressed in gold boots and a boiler suit when he and his friend, James Browne (right outside the High Court in October), were stopped by officers outside a convenience store in north London . They targeted him and convicted killer Browne because they believed they might be carrying drugs. Browne, who did not work for Fielding, was found to have a small amount of cocaine, but no charges were brought. The minder – who was once jailed for 18 years for manslaughter during a robbery, and admits taking drugs in the past – used to be fit but now has a limp and cannot run due to his injuries. The ‘close protection security guard’, who worked for the late singer Amy Winehouse, was awarded £108,491 in aggravated damages for his ‘handicap on the labour market’ and what was called the high-handed and oppressive manner of police. He was found to have cocaine and methedrone, a stimulant that was not illegal at the time of the assault in April 2010 at the Everbest store in Kentish Town, North London. Judge Coe said the officers, named as PC O’Leary and PC Tucker, saw the pair on the street at 10.30am on Easter Sunday. They were ‘the last men standing’ after an all-night party. Mr Fielding (right, with Mighty Boosh co-star Julian Barratt) and Mr Browne were stopped by police as they made their way home from an all-night party. The comedian admitted that he was drunk and hadn't slept . The officers ‘were immediately aware of Mr Fielding’s celebrity status’, she said, and knew the area as a ‘drugs hotspot’. Fielding was wearing his stage outfit from a show the night before, including dungarees, gold boots, a ladies’ checked jacket, and dyed blond hair. The judge said that while Browne, 54, was not Fielding’s minder, his job meant he ‘was in the habit of looking out for people such as Fielding who might be the subject of unwelcome attention’. The men were ‘well known to one another’. After the party, Browne had been asked to clear up drugs paraphernalia. He had picked up eight papers of ‘what he knew to be likely to be drugs or traces thereof’, planning ‘to dispose of them outside’, Judge Coe said. PC O’Leary claimed he shouted to Browne to stop. He said Browne struggled and tried to conceal something in his hand, so he put him in an arm lock and carried him out of the shop. Mr Fielding (pictured in the Mighty Boosh) said he was aware of a struggle between Mr Browne and the officers, but he did not see any violence, London's High Court heard . Mr Browne was previously a very fit man whose hobbies included fencing, skydiving and running, London's High Court (pictured) heard. But he was left with a leg injury and now sometimes has to use a wheelchair . But Browne claimed he was attacked from behind without warning. The judge said neither was ‘entirely honest’, but the officer deliberately exaggerated. He was ‘not telling the truth’ and showed ‘deliberate dishonesty’ in his account of what happened when an ambulance arrived. Browne’s leg was smashed and he spent a month in hospital. His leg became infected, and he later suffered another broken leg and a broken arm when he fell badly during recovery. The judge found Fielding, who was ‘an honest and straightforward witness’ was ‘unnecessarily restrained’ by being ‘manhandled to the floor and handcuffed without being told why’. She said Browne’s previous convictions were ‘of very limited relevance’, but added he had no tax returns or bank accounts and ‘seems to have no work history’. CCTV footage from the store – which the High Court judge said was ‘likely to be of the utmost importance’ – was damaged beyond use as it was transported between the offices of the Metropolitan Police’s solicitors.","Noel Fielding and James Brown were stopped by police after all-night party .

"One of the world's most wanted Nazi criminals died in exile in Syria four years ago and will never be brought to justice, a leading Nazi hunter has said. Alois Brunner, who would have been 102 years old today,  is allegedly buried in Damascus, where he is said to have been working as a government adviser on torture. Brunner has frequently been described as the 'right hand man' of Adolf Eichmann, the architect of the Holocaust, and was responsible for the deportation of 128,500 Jews to death camps. Scroll down for video . Pure evil: Alois Brunner, pictured in the 1930s, left, and in 2007, who was responsible for the deportation of 128,500 Jews to death camps during the Second World War, died in 2010 and is buried in Syria . Dr Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israel office and chief investigator in Brunner's case, said he is '99 per cent sure' Brunner is dead and buried in Syria, after receiving new intelligence from a 'reliable source. A former German secret service agent who had served in the Middle East has confirmed what the organisation had feared, Dr Zuroff told the BBC, which is that Brunner has been dead for at least four years. Born in Austria in 1912, Brunner rose in rank within the SS and worked as the assistant of Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann was 'the brains' behind the Holocaust and Hitler's Final Solution. Eichmann also fled after the war, but was captured in Argentina by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, tried in Israel and executed in 1962. Nazi chief: Brunner has frequently been described as the 'right hand man' of Adolf Eichmann, pictured during his trial in Israel in 1962, the architect of the Holocaust . During the Second World War, Brunner sent 47,000 Jews in Austria, 44,000 in Greece, 23,500 in France and 14,000 in Slovakia to camps where most were murdered. '[Brunner] played a key role in the implementation of Hitler's Final Solution to murder Jews,' Dr Zuroff told the BBC. The Simon Wiesenthal Center's  list of 'most wanted' Nazi War Criminals 2014. 1.

Last known location: Canada) Brunner escaped to Syria in the early 1950s, where he is said to have lived and worked using the name Dr. Georg Fischer. Brunner was tried and sentenced to death in absentia in France in 1954, but as the Syrian government refused to acknowledge that Brunner resided in the country, he was never extradited. He is believed to have been working for President Hafez al-Assad, the father of current president Bashar  al-Assad, as a government adviser on torture, security and terrorism. Several attempts were made on his life by Israeli intelligence, and he lost several fingers and an eye in two separate letter bombings organised by Mossad in the 60s and early 80s. The death of Brunner came to light after he was removed from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of 'most wanted' Nazi War Criminals, which is published annually. 'He was a notorious anti-Semite, sadist, fanatic Nazi,' Dr. Zuroff told the New York Times today. 'The only known interview we have with him was to a German newsmagazine in 1985, in which he was asked if he had any regrets, and he said, ""My only regret is I didn't murder more Jews"".'","Nazi hunter '99 per cent sure' Alois Brunner died in Syria in 2010 aged 98 .

"Controversial 'baby hatches' have been proposed for introduction in New South Wales hospitals, following the abandonment of two newborn babies in a week. The naked body of a baby girl was discovered buried in the sand at Maroubra Beach in Sydney's East on Sunday morning,  after a baby boy was found alive in a drain in Quakers Hill just a week ago. In the wake of such events, Police Minister Stuart Ayers called for the introduction of safe drop boxes for babies which allow mothers to anonymously deposit their babies within a certain time frame of the child's birth. Scroll down for video . Police Minister Stuart Ayers called for the introduction of safe drop boxes for babies which allow mothers to anonymously deposit their babies . Minister Ayres said that more options needed to be made available to vulnerable mothers who needed support, reported The ABC. 'I think that everything has to be on the table for us to be able to support particularly mothers but families that are in desperate need of help and assistance,' Minister Ayres said. 'There's no doubt that we find ourselves with two cases that are currently under investigation that require us to think seriously about what we need to do to help families that are in crisis.' The baby girl discovered buried in the sand was found by two members of the Under 6 Nippers team as they were digging in the sand dunes about 20 metres from the water's edge. Aged six and seven, the two boys found the 'very small' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly Sunday morning session at the southern end of Maroubra Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Police were called to the scene at about 10:05am to investigate the 'suspicious' incident, and officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body by about 1pm.

Aged six and seven, the two boys found the 'very small' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly Sunday morning session . Dr Andrew Pesce, obstetrician, former president Australian Medical Association, and head of Women's Health for Sydney West Health Service said that the 'baby hatches' could play an important part of comprehensive efforts to improve the safety of newborn babies and their mothers. 'It wouldn't be the only solution, but as part of a several-pronged approach it could have it's place,' Dr Pesce told Daily Mail Australia. Last week, a woman was charged yesterday and refused bail, as is accused of leaving her son in a 2.4 metre deep drain in Quakers Hill in Sydney's west when he was just one day old. The drain was covered by a concrete slab which weighed over 200kg and took six people to lift, including two police officers who had arrived at the scene. They were then able to extract the baby boy, who was wrapped in a striped hospital blanket covered in dirt with the peg still attached to his cut umbilical cord. 'When the baby boy was found in the drain there were typical responses about how rare an event it was, and then a week later another baby is found buried in the sand, so how do we know that it is a rare event?' said Dr Pesce. 'We can see that there are cases coming to light where something has gone wrong and a huge amount of harm has occurred, and these are just the cases that we know of,' he said. 'My understanding is that these baby hatches have been in practice in countries like Germany for close to a decade, where there are 100 centres around the nation where women can leave a baby without details,' Dr Pesce said. The Sternipark organisation in Germany opened it's first facilities in 2000, and says that in that time it has 'rescued' 41 babies which have been put up for adoption.

Dr Andrew Pesce,  head of Women's Health for Sydney West Health Service said that the 'baby hatches' could play an important part of comprehensive efforts to improve the safety of newborn babies and their mothers . Studies have indicated however, that the introduction of baby hatches has had no impact on the number of babies killed or abandoned, reported German journal Spiegel. Karen Healy, National President of the Australian Association of Social Workers and Professor of Social Work at the University of Queensland said that the baby hatches did not address the core problem at the heart of the issue. 'The hatches do not address the fundamental problem of concealed pregnancies and creates other problems,' Ms Healy told Daily Mail Australia. 'What is really needed is support for the mother in helping them come to terms with having a baby,' she said. Ms Healy said that the hatches could have the potential to encourage people to think of abandoning their children, and pointed to cases in Germany where babies with disabilities, older children, and babies that had already died were put in the drop-boxes. 'The studies make point in saying that pregnant women who are in denial are not in a fit state to put baby in haven, which means these children are still at risk of being harmed- they are in a different category to those women who would deposit a child,' she said. 'To me, the solution is to make sure that these women who are most at risk are identified, which might mean no woman leaves the hospital alone, because  there seems to be a loophole that very vulnerable women are slipping through.'

Dr Pesce agreed with this sentiment, but maintained that the hatches could provide a solution that might save a few lives. 'Asking what the real issue is here is quite an appropriate question, and the baby hatches can only be a part of the solution.' 'I wouldn't want to see anything like this mean there was less funding or support for women, especially mothers at risk, but the hatches would not be a high-cost operation, they would be an add-on,' he said. 'I can just see that there are situations where this might save the life of a baby or their mother.' Inspector Andrew Holland says they are yet to identify the mother of the baby girl found in the sand, and urge her to come forward and seek medical assistance. Officers have expressed their concerns for the welfare of the mother as police are doubtful she gave birth in a hospital. Officers hope that a post-mortem exam to be carried out on Monday will bring them closer to finding the child's family. Police are also trawling through hospital, and deaths, births and marriages records in the hope of identifying the baby.

The pair are currently on international duty with England as Roy Hodgson's side prepare for the friendly match against Norway on Wednesday ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on Monday. Welbeck, told he could leave Old Trafford after failing to impress Louis van Gaal since the Dutchman’s arrival this summer, was originally offered on a season long loan deal for a bargain £3m. But the 23-year-old was determined to force a permanent move to give himself a fresh start and that helped Arsenal force down United’s original £18m asking price before settling a five-year contract for the player. Out of favour: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal allowed Welbeck to leave the club after signing Falcao . Return: Welbeck has scored 20 league goals for United in 90 appearances since 2008 . Wenger had several times claimed he wasn’t in the market for a new striker, despite losing last season’s top scorer Olivier Giroud until after Christmas through injury. But that emerged as a smokescreen as he made failed overtures for first Loic Remy then Radamel Falcao, before turning his attention to Welbeck. And with Tottenham put off by the size of the numbers involved, Arsenal officials worked late into the night to complete the formalities. Mesut Ozil was one of several Arsenal stars to tweet their delight at Welbeck's signing, saying: 'I'm glad to welcome you, Danny! wish you as much goals as possible! #WelcomeWelbeck #NewStriker #No23 #COYG'. Fresh start: Welbeck has enjoyed previous loan spells with Preston North End and Sunderland . Wenger has long been an admirer of Welbeck and has considered a move for him in the past, but he had always viewed the United man as a player who is best suited to playing on the flanks, posing a goal threat from wide. Sportsmail can reveal that Wenger originally had Welbeck earmarked as a possible replacement for Lukas Podolski, who was set to leave Arsenal earlier this summer. But with the Gunners so short of striking options following Giroud’s serious ankle injury, the Germany forward will be asked to play in a central role. Welbeck, who has 26 caps for England at the age of 23, has eight international goals. He has scored 20 league goals in 90 appearances for United since 2008. Goals: Falcao has been prolific throughout his career, earning several big money moves .","Jack Wilshere welcomes Danny Welbeck to Arsenal .

"The Taliban claimed responsibility today for a double truck bomb attack on Afghanistan's US trained intelligence agency which killed 18 people and injuring 150. The co-ordinated attack on the complex in Ghazni, central Afghanistan was the biggest Taliban offensive in recent weeks. Two trucks packed with explosives were used in the attack. One of the vehicles was parked outside the rear gate of the National Directorate of Security building, while the second truck was left outside a police building containing a rapid reaction force. Afghan security forces guard the area after the Taliban attacked the local headquarters of Afghanistan's US trained intelligence agency in a dawn suicide attack . More than 150 people were wounded, mainly by flying glass after the twin powerful explosions this morning which were claimed by the Taliban earlier this afternoon . Two trucks laden with explosives were detonated simultaneously during this morning's double suicide attack in Ghazni province in central Afghanistan . Both trucks were detonated simultaneously at sunrise before a group of Taliban attempted to storm both buildings armed with rocket-propelled grenades, assault rifles and light machine guns. One of the bombs left a ten-metre hole crater in the ground. The attack also destroyed the city's library and two museums. Provincial governor for the Ghazni region Musa Khan Akbarzada said that 19 Taliban were involved in the atrocity. He said: 'The bombs were so powerful that many civilians were wounded . because of falling roofs and shattering of windows in their . homes.' The attackers fought a gun battle with members of the US trained NDS as they tried to storm the compound. Dozens of the wounded were taken to a lone hospital in . Ghazni where doctors were forced to treat many of them outside. The attack in Ghazni, one of the provinces that surround the . capital city of Kabul, is the latest in a series of offensives . launched by the Taliban in the summer fighting season. The blast shattered windows in surrounding buildings injuring scores of civilians who had to be treated for their injuries in the street as the hospital was overwhelmed . Following the blasts, more than a dozen Taliban engaged Afghan security forces in the NDS compound in a fierce gun battle killing an estimated 19 insurgents . This latest attack is the second in less than a week following a similar bombing on Afghan government institutions in the eastern city of Jalalabad . Insurgents have carried out complex attacks on government . installations, including in Logar and Wardak provinces which are . the gateways to the heavily guarded national capital. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility . for the attack and said dozens of Afghan soldiers were killed. 'It is a success for us and failure to our enemies that they . didn't even notice how our fighters in big numbers reached the . intelligence agency with explosive-laden cars and carried out . attacks.' He added: 'Their 13-year-old occupation is now seen as a historical shame. It was planned that Afghanistan's next leader would participate in the Wales Summit. Now their plans have come to naught.' The attack on the NDS was the second in less than a week . after a similar bombing in the eastern city of Jalalabad.

An Afghan solider stands guard at the site of one of the explosions, near a massive crater. The powerful blast ripped a 20 metre hole in a wall protecting the compound .

The network based along the border with Pakistan is believed . to be behind some of the most audacious attacks in Kabul . including the bombing of the Indian embassy and the 2011 attack . on the US embassy. A prolonged political deadlock over a disputed presidential . election has added to anxiety over the threat posed by the . Taliban once most foreign combat forces leave by the end of this . year.

"U.S. President Barack Obama has been urged to take decisive action against the Islamic State amid concerns the terror group will target America. Obama was told by security experts that the country is facing a growing threat from militants, who have already taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. He was advised that these fighters are now looking toward the U.S. or Western Europe as their next targets, where they would likely 'kill with abandon'. Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama (left) has been urged by security experts to take decisive action against ISIS, while Texas senator Ted Cruz (right) has claimed that America should bomb the group 'back to the Stone Age' It comes as Texas senator Ted Cruz has claimed that America should deal with the threat of ISIS by bombing them 'back to the Stone Age'. The 43-year-old Republican, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, told Fox News: 'They want to go back and reject modernity, well I think we should help them. 'We ought to bomb them back to the stone age.' Cruz made his comments at a summit for Americans for Prosperity in Dallas on Saturday, during which he also spoke of the U.S. border immigration crisis and the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, the two security experts, of the House and Senate intelligence committees, gave their warning to Obama at  Capitol Hill news conference in Washington on Sunday. 'Growing threat': Obama was told by security experts that the country is facing a growing threat from militants, who have already taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. Above, ISIS rebels march in Syria . Without offering specifics on any . threats or suggestions how to confront them, the pair said Obama . soon needs to develop a comprehensive strategy to crush the fighters. 'His foreign policy is in absolute . free-fall,' said Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who heads the . House Intelligence Committee. In another TV interview, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the . Senate intelligence panel, said Obama is perhaps 'too cautious' in his . approach to combating ISIS. 'This is a group of people who are extraordinarily dangerous,' Ms Feinstein said. 'And they'll kill with abandon.' 'They'll kill with abandon': In an interview, Senator Dianne Feinstein (pictured), the California Democrat who leads the Senate intelligence panel, said Obama is perhaps 'too cautious' in his approach to combating ISIS . The . pair of lawmakers, who have access to some of the nation's most . sensitive secrets and receive regular and detailed briefings from the . nation's spy agencies, offered dire predictions of an attack on the . United States or its European allies if the militants are not . confronted. 'They have . announced that they don't intend to stop,' Ms Feinstein told NBC. 'They have . announced that they will come after us if they can, that they will, . quote, ""spill our blood"".'' The . threat, Mr Rogers said, could include Americans who have trained with . Islamic State fighters. He told Fox News Sunday there are hundreds of Islamic . State-trained Americans who can return to the country with their U.S. passports. 'I'm very . concerned because we don't know every single person that has an American . passport that has gone and trained and learned how to fight,' Mr Rogers . said. He added that the U.S. intelligence agencies were tracking the Americans who are known to have . traveled to the region. If they helped Islamic State fighters, he said, . they should be charged under laws that prohibit Americans from aiding . terrorists. 'ISIL would like . to have a Western-style attack to continue this notion that they are . the leading jihadist group in the world,' he said, using another . name for the group. The top . Democrat on his intelligence panel, Republican C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of . Maryland, was more skeptical. He said more needs to be known before . judging whether they plan to commit terrorist acts in the U.S. any time . soon. Michigan Republican: Mike Rogers described the U.S. President's foreign policy as being 'in absolute free-fall' The group's priority now seems to be to hold on to territory it . has gained rather than export violence. 'It is extremely urgent, but you don't just rush in,' he told CNN. It . was a view shared by Republication Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat on . the House Armed Services Committee, who told CBS: 'We can't simply bomb first and ask . questions later.' Senator John . McCain, an Arizona Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations . Committee, urged fast action and said Islamic State fighters 'must be . defeated, not contained,' because they represent a direct threat to the .

The Islamic State group has . financing, military structure and weapons unlike any other militants, . she said. Obama said . Thursday he did not yet have a strategy for dealing with the Islamic . State organization, a remark that brought criticism from Democrats and . Republicans. In an interview published early this year by The New . Yorker, the president appeared to minimize the group by comparing it to a . junior varsity basketball team. The White House said he was speaking . about a different threat posed by a range of extremists across the . world. Interview: During the Americans for Prosperity summit, Mr Cruz (pictured speaking to TV crews at the event) was joined by a number of other Republican White House candidates, including Kentucky Senator Rand Paul . Mr Feinstein said she . thought the basketball analogy was wrong — 'I think it's a major varsity . team' — but would not say whether she thought Obama projected weakness . by admitting he had no strategy. 'I . think I've learned one thing about this president, and that is he's . very cautious,' she said. 'Maybe in this instance, too cautious. I do . know that the military, I know that the State Department, I know that . others have been putting plans together. And so hopefully, those plans . will coalesce into a strategy.' During the Americans for Prosperity summit, Mr Cruz was joined by a number of other Republican White House candidates, including Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Governor Rick Perry and Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Just days earlier, Mr Perry and Mr Paul had criticised Obama's 'we don't have a strategy yet' approach to the Islamic State threat. 'Yesterday, the president admitted he had no strategy to deal with ISIS,' Mr Perry said. 'The deepening chaos in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine is all the clear and compelling evidence the world needs of a president one step behind, lurching from crisis to crisis.'","Obama told by security experts that U.S. is facing growing threat from ISIS .

"The tempestuous love life of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton captured the imagination of a generation, and now a rare love letter written by the glamorous actress to her then husband has come to light, giving a rare glimpse into the fiery passion between them. The steamy letter shows how she desperately fought to save their doomed marriage right to the end. The letter opens with the line: 'I . wish I could tell you of my....pure animal pleasure of you.' And ends saying: 'Anyway, I lust thee'. The note, thought to be the only Taylor-Burton love letter ever to become available for public sale, was written by the late actress days before the pair separated and three months before they divorced for the first time.

But on their 10th wedding anniversary and just days before they split, Taylor wrote of her love for her husband and her anxieties about their marriage. She addressed the letter ‘My (still) husband’ and signed off ‘Your (still) wife’ and in between wrote: 'I wish I could tell you of my love for you, of my fear, my pure animal pleasure of you, my jealousy, my anger at you. 'Most of all my love for you and whatever love you can dole out to me. I wish I could write about it but I can only boil and bubble inside and hope you understand how I really feel.'

"A shocking advertising campaign for fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’. Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display. In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’. Scroll down for video . Photographs of its 'School Days' range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’. It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt. The brand launched its Back-to-School range earlier this month with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’ The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show. The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. The brand launched its Back-to-School range earlier this month with the slogan, 'Your first assignment is to dress accordingly' ‘Furthermore, we considered the images imitated voyeuristic ‘up-skirt’ shots which had been taken without the subject’s consent or knowledge which, in the context of an ad for a skirt marketed to young women, we considered had the potential to normalise a predatory sexual behaviour.’ The fact that the model’s face was not visible meant the public would ‘understand that the model was, or was intended to appear to be, a schoolgirl.’ The ASA concluded: ‘We considered the ads had the effect of inappropriately sexualising school-age girls and were therefore offensive and irresponsible for that reason too.’ They acknowledged that American Apparel, which is popular with teenagers, ‘had removed the images before we had contacted them’, but said they were ‘nonetheless concerned that the images had appeared in their advertising at all.’ Following objections, the firm quickly pulled the offending pictures from its Instagram account and website. The company said the images were not intended to represent an underage model but had been ‘posted by a junior and relatively inexperienced member of their social media team’. The rest of its School Days collection – featuring models in mini-skirts, knee socks and crop tops stood next to lockers – remains online. American Apparel has also courted controversy previously over its promotional campaigns . Two garments are named ‘the Lolita skirt’ and ‘the Lolita top’, in a possible reference to the sexualised schoolgirl in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel ‘Lolita’. Last year, the retailer was labelled ‘sexist’ and ‘sleazy’ for an advertisement for a unisex shirt which showed half-naked women alongside fully clothed male models. The business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, including the US and the UK. American Apparel (UK) Ltd said its images featured non-airbrushed everyday people ‘and their approach was not graphic, explicit or pornographic.’ The brand said ‘their models were happy, relaxed and confident in expression and pose and were not portrayed in a manner which was vulnerable, negative or exploitative.’ It also argued it was well-known for its provocative campaigns and customers were well aware of this before they chose to actively follow American Apparel’s social media accounts or browse its website.","Photographs of ‘School Days’ range .

The officer named as Eston Kohver 'was abducted while on duty on Estonian territory by unknown individuals who came from Russia. Talinn (pictured) has claimed the policeman was abducted at gunpoint while on duty in their territory . He was captured using force at gunpoint,' said Tallinn prosecutors. 'He was fulfilling his duties preventing cross-border criminal activity. The abductors jammed radio communication and used smoke grenade.' The alleged abduction took place in southern Estonia near the Luhamaa border crossing with Russia. Moscow claimed last night that Mr Kohver, 44, was 'detained on Russian territory'. 'A Taurus pistol with cartridges, cash in the amount of 5,000 euros, special equipment for clandestine audio recording, and materials constituting intelligence-gathering instructions have been seized from the offender,' said the FSB, successor to the Soviet-era KGB.

"Many drivers, tired of long journeys and tedious traffic jams, are looking forward to when self-driving cars will be an affordable option. And while Google and car makers are working on the next generation of vehicles, a $10,000 (£5,900) gadget could beat the big firms to controlling your car remotely, as soon as next year. The Cruise RP-1 claims to be the world’s first ‘highway autopilot’ and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front. Easy driver: The Cruise RP-1 (pictured) claims to be the world's first 'highway autopilot' and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front . The Cruise RP-1 claims to be the world’s first ‘highway autopilot’ and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front. It comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver. The 'sensor pod' relays what it detects back to the ‘Cruise computer’ to make real-time decisions on where to position itself on the road. It uses computer vision and obstacle detection algorithms to work out where to place the car. If a car pulls in front suddenly, the system can brake and adjust the speed quickly. At launch, the RP-1 will only be available for Audi A4 and S4 models built after 2012 - but more cars systems are in development. It can only currently be used in California and is not intended as a replacement for a driver. The gadget can be pre-ordered for $10,000 and is expected to be ready next year. The gadget, designed by Kyle Vogt,comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver. It can be pre-ordered and is expected to be ready next year. By comparison, Google has said that its automated cars will arrive between 2017 and 2020. Vogt said: ‘Seven years ago I worked on an autonomous vehicle project but I was frustrated that the computational and sensing systems used were too expensive and too bulky to use…in a regular vehicle.’ So he designed the Cruise RP-1, which sees the road and cars around a vehicle by using a sensor pod mounted on a car’s roof. Through a combination of sensors, . cameras, radar, and other measurement systems, the ‘sensor pod’ relays . what it detects back to the ‘Cruise computer’ to make real-time . decisions on where to position the car on the road. Cruise control: The gadget, which comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver (pictured), can be pre-ordered for $10,000 and is set to arrive next year . The technology is reasonably cheap because it uses sensors already harnessed in other vehicles. ‘Using advance computer vision and obstacle detection, the RP-1 keeps you in your lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of you,’ the company said. ‘It’s always watching the road even if you are distracted - and frees you from the pain of commuting, stop-and-go traffic and long trips. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.’ If the car sees danger or that a car has just cut in front, it can brake or change speed . ‘The radar allows us to determine the velocity and direction of any car around you to ensure there is enough distance for your car to come to a complete stop if there is ever a problem,’ the company explained. The all-seeing eye: Through a combination of sensors, cameras, radar, and other measurement systems, the 'sensor pod' (pictured) relays what it detects back to the 'Cruise computer' to make real-time decisions on where to position itself on the road . If the RP-1 is ‘in doubt’ about what it sees – such as sketchy lane markings – it alerts the driver using visual and sound alerts to ask them to take over driving completely. The system can be installed into any Audi A4 or S4 built after 2012, although the company plans to roll out versions for other cars next year. The autopilot can be turned on and off with a button integrated beside the driver, whereas the ‘brains’ of the system is stowed in the boot of a car and takes up less than two feet of space. Currently, the system can only be used on major highways in California - specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has been mapped by the company, Recode reported. There are no plans to release it in the UK. The company stresses that its system is not a replacement for a driver, who must sit in the driver’s seat and be prepared to take full control of the car at any time. ‘All state and federal driving laws still apply while the RP-1 is in operation,’ it warned. Brains in the boot: 'Using advance computer vision and obstacle detection, the RP-1 keeps you in your lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of you,' the company says. It does this using sensors and a computer in the boot (pictured) that makes the calculations needed to drive the car .","Google's self-driving cars are expected to be ready by 2020 .

"An incredible photo has captured the moment a shark leaps out of the water at a Coffs Harbour beach, just metres away from surfers and paddle boarders. During a surf contest at Macauley's, on the north coast of New South Wales on Sunday, the photo shows the clam before it's presence is known and there's a frenzy in the water to get out quickly.

"A struggling mother-of-three, who is battling terminal cancer, and her blind husband have received $1 million of donations after appealing to the Australian public for financial aid. The couple who first appeared on A Current Affair last month, have thanked the generous donors who have brought some joy into the lives of the Piper family. Alex Piper's husband suddenly became blind in both eyes 16 years ago and the mother-of-three did not hesitate to take on the role of the family breadwinner. Then, four years ago when the now 41-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer, Alex maintained her job throughout months of radiotherapy and chemotherapy while barely uttering a murmur of complaint. After being diagnosed with stage four stomach cancer and dropping down to a mere 41 kilograms, the Piper family from NSW called out for help by taking their story of struggle and survival to the public. Scroll down for video . Matt and Alex Piper have shared their story with the public in an effort to raise money for their family . The family of five have been struggling financially since Matt became blind 16 years ago, forcing Alex to take on the role as the sole breadwinner of the family . 'It doesn't even feel real, it's like a dream,' Ms Piper told A Current Affair on Monday. 'It's nice to think I've got something to look forward to, some joy, instead of being in pain and not feeling well. I have something else to focus on.' 'We are just so appreciative of everything, the generosity and the money that is there to further Alex's future in life and hope it's going to be worthwhile,' Mr Piper said. Alex and her husband Matt first met as teenagers before they finally began dating at 21 years of age. Only two years after the duo married, things took a turn for the worse when Matt lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind. Further damage to the nerves in his hands and arms rendered him unable to pursue a career as a masseuse, but the father of three - Charley, 13, Honey, 10, and Willow, 5 - admits the hardest thing about his condition is having never seen his children.

Only two years after the duo married, things took a turn for the worse when Matt lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind . 'It hurt hard. My heart was broken for a very long time,' Matt told A Current Affair last month. 'To overcome that - I feel and touch now. I've been blind for 16 years now.' 'I saw Alex walking down the aisle and that picture I still have a strong image of in my mind.' Alex was forced to provide for her family solely on her own, but things took a turn for the worst when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2010. Despite the emotional and physical demands of the disease, the 41-year-old continued to go to work each day, even after the cancer was found to have spread to her bones and stomach a year later. 'I only had two weeks off work. I did radiation and chemotherapy and I worked the whole way through and I wish I'd taken time for myself,' Alex said.

'The doctors have their views on what's possible and what's not possible, but I like to have my own views,' she said. So far, more than $1,002 has been donated to help the Piper family after Alex's aunt, Amanda Fraser, took to MyCause.com to share her niece's story. 'The strain is starting to show, hence our call to arms with this campaign, as we've finally convinced Alex to let us try and assist,' Ms Fraser wrote. 'She is a fighter, she is positive… but Alex can no longer cope with the struggles of bringing up a young family and loss of income. 'The much needed funding that we raise, will be utilised to both ease the financial burden on the family, help to cover the mortgage and allow us to continue to try and find the best and most innovative treatments possible.'

"More than 1,400 flood defence projects to protect vulnerable homes will be given the green light today. The Treasury will set out details of the schemes set to benefit from £2.3billion in investment following the mass flooding that hit many areas last winter. It means around 300,000 more homes will be protected. The National Audit Office warned recently that half of the UK’s flood defences are running at ‘minimal level’ and likely to give way if there is heavy rain again this year. Swamped: A family stand nearly waist-deep in dirty water inside their home in the village of Moorland, Somerset, during last winter's severe flooding . Ministers will today commit to spending £15.5million on flood defences in Somerset over the next six years, which they hope will benefit 7,000 properties. It includes £4.2million to be spent on the Somerset Levels which were worst affected by flooding last winter, the wettest since records began in 1910. There will also be major investment in areas such as the Humber Estuary, where £80million will be spent, and £196million for a programme in the Thames Estuary. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘We all saw the destruction and heartache caused by flooding last year and that is why this investment is vital to build up Britain’s defences for the future. ‘The projects we are announcing today will protect some of the country’s most at-risk locations, ensuring that we will be as prepared as possible for future severe weather.’ Officials claim the six-year programme would help prevent more than £30billion of economic damage. The Village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels last year. Pictured is the home of Sam Notaro, 40 and his father Joe Notaro, 62, who took their own steps to ensure that the house was not overwhelmed . Other flood defence projects will include schemes at Tonbridge, Yalding and surrounding communities in Kent – which will receive more than £17million – £73million for the Boston barrier in Lincolnshire, £42million for a scheme in Oxford and £47million for coastal defence improvements for Rossall, Lancashire. Friends of the Earth said leaked documents suggested there was still a half-a-billion-pound shortfall in the budget for flood defences over the next parliament. The environmental charity’s climate campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ‘A year after Britain’s wettest winter ever, the Chancellor’s leaked flood defence plans simply don’t hold water. ‘Faced with rising sea levels, the Government needs to be investing far more in flood defences to protect households and prevent climate change from the outset. ‘But these leaked plans show that Mr Osborne isn’t taking the threat of climate change seriously: having foolishly neglected defences over the last Parliament, he’s proposing to do the same over the next one.The Chancellor must use his Autumn Statement to invest enough in flood defences to keep pace with global warming, and redouble efforts to wean the economy off flood-inducing fossil fuels.’ A rescue team pulls a boat with an evacuee on board through flood water in The High Street on December 5, 2013 in Boston, Lincolnshire . Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘Communities at risk of flooding won’t buy Government spin on what is simply a re-announcement of capital funding confirmed a year ago. ‘This is not new money – at the beginning of this parliament David Cameron cut the flood protection budget by over a £100million a year. As a result we are playing catch-up on flood defences. 'The Committee on Climate on Change has already said that the Government’s plans could leave 80,000 additional properties at serious risk of flooding.’ Other announcements in today’s ‘national infrastructure plan’ will include new housing developments, and talks with a company bidding to build the world’s first tidal lagoon energy plant in Swansea Bay. The developers of the £800million project have said their application is the first step to developing technology that could meet 10 per cent of the UK’s electricity needs from the tides. If it goes ahead, the scheme would involve a six-mile wall built around Swansea Bay, creating a lagoon in the Severn Estuary with turbines that can harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day. The scheme would provide renewable power for 120,000 homes for 120 years, saving 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year and creating 1,850 construction jobs as well as 150 long-term jobs in operation and leisure facilities on the lagoon. Other projects being announced include a deal with Toshiba, GDF Suez and NuGen to provide a guarantee to assist the financing of a new nuclear power plant at Moorside, near Sellafield in Cumbria. Up to £50million will be available to support innovation in manufacturing ultra-low emission vehicles. It has also been confirmed that £15billion of new roads are to be built in the biggest road-building programme for half a century.","Half of UK’s flood defences are running at ‘minimal level’, says watchdog .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has backed down on a major element of his government's proposed pay deal for Australian Defence Force personnel, in a win for renegade independent senator Jacqui Lambie. On Monday morning, Mr Abbott said the government would not continue with its plans to cut the discretionary leave, food and motor vehicle allowances for the nation's 57,00 servicemen and women. But it's not a total victory for the Tasmanian senator, who was photographed discussing the matter over a drink with her estranged former party boss Clive Palmer. Scroll down for video . It's a been a long time: Senator Lambie, right, refused to speak to her one-time party leader Clive Palmer for weeks. But on Sunday night, the two shared a drink at Canberra's Hotel Hotel, taking to tall tools to discuss a pay deal for Australian Defence Force personnel . Once were friends: Senator Lambie and Mr Palmer worked closely together for around a year before their relationship took an acrimonious turn. Ms Lambie was elected to the Senate last year following support from Mr Palmer's party . Mr Abbott said he will press ahead with his plan to offer ADF personnel a below inflation 1.5 per cent pay increase - a pay cut in real terms. 'I want to acknowledge we are listening to the defence community on this subject,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Canberra. Last night, onlookers snapped Ms Lambie and Mr Palmer sipping beverages at the city's swanky Hotel Hotel. Senator Lambie confirmed the rendezvous this morning, telling reporters the ADF matter was a major discussion point. 'I did have a meeting with the devil himself,' the Tasmanian former army veteran told reporters, before adding, 'but I did not sell my soul.' Earlier on Sunday evening, Ms Lambie said in a statement that she would not accept a partial measure on the ADF deal. 'It’s all or nothing on the ADF pay deal,' she said. 'I’m not going to take any prisoners. It’s time to empty the magazine, fix bayonets and charge. Change of clothes: Ms Lambie is rarely pictured wearing her distinctive Palmer United Party shade of yellow any more . 'Our Diggers have done a magnificent job for Australia and deserve a fair wage rise, which keeps track with inflation and returns all their holidays and allowances.' Ms Lambie was hoping to meet with Mr Abbott on the matter on Monday morning but it was postponed. Her unusual discussion with Mr Palmer, however, raised some eyebrows, coming at a time of tension between the former colleagues. Just weeks ago, the mining magnate issued a statement headlined 'Jacqui Lambie is a liar' and claimed she had been plotting to set up an alternate political party. Palmer dumped Ms Lambie as the party's deputy Senate leader after she stopped talking to him and attending meetings last month. She quit the party in late November.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott backs down on a key plank of his defence pay deal .

"Shock: Our ability to deal with a financial crisis may reduce as we get older (picture posed by model) Our ability to make sound financial decisions peaks at 53 and then declines, a study claims. Academics at Harvard University said cognitive performance declines in the mid-50s because we lose our ability to solve new problems. It also warned that by the time pensioners reach their 80s, half will have serious cognitive impairment which renders them unable to make good financial choices. There was bad news for the young too – they may also struggle to make an important decision about their money because they do not have the financial knowledge acquired through experience. It follows a recent study by the Money Advice Service which found that one in five over-55s could not choose the better deal from two financial products. Separate research by the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing found men’s memory remained stable until they reached 60 to 64, after which it declined. Ros Altmann, the Government’s older workers champion, who also studied at Harvard, claimed the latest research was ageist. ‘Everybody is different so there is no point in making stereotypes,’ she told the Telegraph. ‘There are plenty of people in their 80s who are still very mentally capable.’ The study is particularly timely because millions of people aged over 55 will soon be able to withdraw their entire pension and spend it as they wish as part of radical Government reforms. With new freedoms come new responsibility though, as they decide whether to take the money in one go, in several parts or buy an annuity, a guaranteed income for life. Problems: Pensioners are given little let-up in their financial worries as the years wear on (posed by model) The Government-backed workplace pension scheme Nest said pension firms should allow customers to put in writing what they want to do with their pot well-ahead of their actual retirement.

There are no products that allow this kind of forward-planning yet.","Harvard University academics said performance declines in mid-50s .

"Uruguay's radical plans to create the world's first state-run marijuana marketplace could be jeopardy following yesterday's presidential election . Tabare Vazquez was elected president for the second time in a decade, continuing the leftist coalition’s rule in the South American nation. His win is a show of support for the leftist coalition that has governed the country for the past decade and ought to secure the government’s radical marijuana plans. However, with polls showing that most Uruguayans oppose the marijuana laws and want them repealed, and Vazquez’s promise to proceed with the plan unless it produced negative results, the project might be at risk. Cheer and fear: It is feared that the re-election of Tabare Vazquez, pictured after winning the presidential elections yesterday, may put the plan to create the world's first state-run marijuana marketplace at risk . During his first run as president from 2005 to 2010, Vazquez governed as a relatively cautious moderate, avoiding the constitutional changes and polarization that have shaken countries such as Venezuela. Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist, topped centre-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday's vote. During his campaign, Lacalle Pou criticized the marijuana plan, saying he would shut down the state-run pot market, while allowing domestic cultivation of the plant. The law was voted through under current President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla known for his humble lifestyle and straight talk. Both Vazquez and Mujica belong to the Broad Front coalition, which has been in power for a decade and has passed laws same-sex marriage, abortion and marijuana. Winner: Tabare Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist, topped center-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday's presidential vote . Same-same, but different: Even though current President Jose Mujica, right, and president elect Tabare Vazquez, belong to the same left-leaning coalition that has moved to create the world's first state-run marijuana marketplace, the pair are known to have clashed within the party . Not so pro: The pro-marijuana laws were passed in May this year, but the implementation is going slower than the government planned, and polls how that 60 per cent of Uruguayans oppose them . This time around, Mujica's popularity and a strong economy helped propel Vazquez into office, where he is now seen as the candidate of continuity, not of change. Vazquez, who starts his new term on March 1, has at times clashed with Mujica within the coalition. The president-elect cuts a much more sober figure than Mujica, who still drives around in his beat-up Volkswagen Beetle and is known as 'the world's poorest president', and the marijuana law, his landmark initiative, may face an uncertain future in Vazquez's hands. Under the law, the first of its kind in the world, marijuana users were supposed to be able to choose a supply source - pharmacies, cannabis clubs or home-grown plants - and buy or grow the drug in a regulated, fully legal market. Vazquez, who made strict anti-tobacco legislation one of his top priorities in his first term, has spoken out forcefully against smoking pot, called the idea of pharmacy sales 'incredible' and said that if elected he would make 'any corrections necessary' to the law. There are also other threats against the law, with recent polls showing that despite its international popularity, more than 60 per cent Uruguayans oppose the marijuana laws and want them repealed. Joy: After the law was first voted through, pro-marijuana campaigners partied in the streets of Montevideo . Uruguayan authorities are still in the process of rolling out the pot marketplace, and although the law went into effect in May, it will not become reality until after Vazquez takes office. Just last week it was announced that the implementation of the marijuana law is progressing slower than the Mujica government had planned. Last Wednesday, the National Drugs Board said Uruguay could start selling marijuana in pharmacies in March, although the government had initially been aiming for year-end. Mujica's marijuana legislation allows each household to register to grow up to six plants while users inscribed into an official list may buy up to 40 grams per person a month at pharmacies. The number of people registered to be allowed to grow cannabis at home has jumped to 1,200 from 600 a month ago as fears have eased that the conservative opposition might win the vote and derail the legislation. The reform is being followed closely across Latin America where the legalization or decriminalization of some narcotics is increasingly viewed as a better way to end the violence spawned by drug trafficking than the U.S.-led 'war on drugs.' Uruguay is one of Latin America's most liberal societies and smoking marijuana has been legal since 1998. It estimates it has some 150,000 recreational smokers.","Tabare Vazquez, 74, elected president of Uruguay on Sunday .

Subs not used: Hennessey, Hangeland, Williams, Bannan. Goals: Gayle (1), Puncheon (48), Zaha (90). Bookings: Mariappa (41), Chamakh (44), Murray (88). Referee: Mike Jones. For Zaha, it is about rebuilding a reputation damaged by a season in the shadows at Manchester United after his £15million move last summer. Warnock, meanwhile, wants to ‘pay back’ the club some four-and-a-half years after leaving for Queens Park Rangers. Both he and his opposite number Alan Pardew could make a case that their side deserved to win this pulsating contest. Palace flew out of the blocks as Dwight Gayle netted inside the first minute. Pardew’s men equalised through Daryl Janmaat - their first league goal of the season - before Jason Puncheon restored the visitors’ advantage just after half-time. But 18-year-old substitute Rolando Aarons headed the hosts level before he assisted Mike Williamson for what appeared to be the winner two minutes from time. Zaha, though, had other ideas. And Warnock said: ‘You can’t ask much more than what they gave me. They played like I thought they could. ‘The one thing I love about football is when you’ve got a group of players who want to come in and train, want to tackle, want to put their heads in. So for however long it lasts I’m going to enjoy it.’ On point-saver Zaha, he added: ‘I said to him “smile a lot”. He’s not being playing much and if he enjoys himself he’ll be a threat in this league. It’s a big season for him’. Meanwhile, Pardew reflected: ‘We’ve conceded a goal after 30 seconds and straight after half-time, but have come back each time. ‘We then got carried away when we took the lead. It was at a time in the game when we should have seen it out. Zaha is a player that we’ve talked about here and admired him, so it’s more galling that he’s scored the equaliser.’ All the attention before the game had been on Warnock and Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback, signed on a free from rivals Sunderland, who was included in Roy Hodgson’s England squad this week. Under pressure: Newcastle United left-back Massadio Haidara (right) competes with Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon (left) for the ball during the match at St James' Tackle: Jason Puncheon (centre) of Crystal Palace had a magnificent game for Palace despite having fallen out with new boss Neil Warnock in the past . Welcome return: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock (right) enjoyed a good start to his second reign as Eagles boss with a 3-3 draw at Newcastle United . But it was Aarons - called up to the Three Lions Under-20 set-up for the first time on Thursday - who threatened to steal the headlines until Zaha’s last-gasp intervention. Gayle’s close-range opener was cancelled out when Janmaat poked in via a deflection before half-time, only for Puncheon to volley an emphatic second for the visitors after the break. Newcastle were short on ideas until the introduction of Aarons and he sprung highest to head home from a Remy Cabella corner, bringing parity and relief to St James’ on 73 minutes. And it was his trickery and cross-cum-shot which allowed Williamson to stab in his first for the club after the ball had rebounded off the upright.

Absentee: Newcastle United fans unveiled a banner with a picture of banished winger Hatem Ben Arfa mocked up at Che Guevera, with the word 'HOPE' underneath . Pardew said: ‘There are times when we’ve come up against packed defences and it’s difficult. You just need that sub to make the impact and Rolando certainly did that today. ‘I have given a lot of good players their debut - Mark Noble, Jonjo Shelvey, Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain among them - and he’s up there with them. He’s got something about him.’ But it was Zaha who stole the show at the death, much to the annoyance of Pardew. ‘They came here and wasted time from the first minute. They are then 3-2 down and they get seven minutes added time - in the spirit of the game I thought that was wrong,’ he said. On the subject of spirit, Warnock had no complaints. ‘Tony (Pulis) must have done a fantastic job,’ he said. ‘Because they’ve got a great camaraderie here.’ CLICK HERE for all facts, stats and graphics from the big match at St James' Park.

"A marketing ploy launched by Malaysia Airlines in an effort to win back customers has backfired after it was deemed insensitive in light of two air tragedies that killed more than 500 people. The struggling airline has changed the wording of its ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’ contest – promoted just months after the twin air disasters – after it was widely criticised for the word choice. ‘Bucket list’ is a term that refers to the things a person wants to experience before they die. Insensitive: Malaysia Airlines has been criticised for a free flight giveaway named 'My Ultimate Bucket List' The ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’ free flight giveaway was offered to customers in Australia and New Zealand, but the campaign turned into a disastrous public relations move for an airline that is desperately trying to revive its image. Malaysia Airlines’ ill-conceived contest asked customers who had already booked flights to submit an entry and, in 500 characters or less, explain which destinations are on their bucket list for a chance to win one of 12 economy class return tickets to Malaysia or an iPad. It said: ‘What and where would you like to tick off on your bucket list, and explain why?' The state-owned airline has pulled references of ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’ off its website, with links now directing to error pages. The contest still exists but it is now asking customers to describe their ‘ultimate to-do list'. In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, the airline confirmed it has altered the contest's name and it did not intend to offend anyone. It said: ‘Malaysia Airlines has withdrawn the title of a recent competition running in Australia and New Zealand, as it is found to be inappropriate at this point in time.’ ‘The competition had been earlier approved as it was themed around a common phrase that is used in both countries. ‘The airline appreciates and respects the sentiments of the public and in no way did it intend to offend any parties. ‘The initiative of the competition is designed to inspire and encourage travellers to dream, plan and book their next holiday with Malaysia Airlines.’ Twin tragedies: Malaysian army personnel carry the remains of victims who were aboard Flight MH17 . People were quick to criticise the airline for its word choice. Twitter user Neil Cotton wrote: ‘Malaysia Airlines calls their new promotion “My Ultimate Bucket List” – SERIOUSLY! U know what that means, right?’ A user named M. Gaston said: ‘This is a sick, sick joke, right?! Marketing/PR needs to be fired.’ Mike Chin wrote: ‘Can there be a worst competition name than Malaysia Airlines (MAS)’s “My Ultimate Bucket List” competition’. [sic] . In addition to giving away free flights, the cash-strapped airline has slashed prices on certain routes after being hit by plunging ticket sales following the tragedies. Photos posted on social media have shown nearly empty cabins on some flights. Heartbroken: The wife of Flight MH17 captain Eugene Choo carries his portrait as victims' bodies are returned . The airline was already struggling with financial woes when the disasters occurred, and last week it announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs as part of a £1.1 billion overhaul that is expected to lead to some routes being eliminated. In July, 298 passengers and crew were killed when Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine – in an area controlled by pro-Russia separatists – while it was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam. And 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after Flight MH370, travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, veered far off course and disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March. No wreckage has been found and the plane is thought to have crashed some 1,100 miles off Australia's west coast.","Malaysia Airlines opened contest to residents of Australia and New Zealand .

"'Bonkers': Robert Peston has dismissed accusations of homophobia after using the term 'Queer Street' The BBC's Business Editor Robert Peston has dismissed homophobia claims against him as 'bonkers', after he used the term 'Queer Street'. Mr Peston used the term on his blog to describe the European financial crisis. He also posted a link to the blog on his Twitter account, where he has 95,000 followers. In praising the UK's handling of the situation, he wrote: 'The Debt Management Office, has taken a reassuringly long-term approach to managing the UK government's debts - and without its prudence, we might all be in Queer Street or Skid Row by now.' However, Mr Peston was criticised soon after as people accused him of homophobia over the use of the word 'queer', which has long been used as an insult against the gay community. One tweet from follower Peter Scott, said: 'Tsk tsk Mr P, not quite homophobic but a bit homo-frowny'. Two hours later Mr Peston was moved to comment on the row and dispatched another tweet. It read: 'Some of you seem to think my use of the phrase ""Queer Street"" is in some way homophobic. Bonkers.' The tweet included a link to the Wikipedia page detailing the origin of the term Queer Street. While Peston was criticisied in some quarters, he has been robustly defended in others. The offending phrase: The term 'Queer Street' was used in the final paragraph of his original blog post . Hitting back: Mr Peston's response to the accusations of homophobia . One of his followers, Joan Wilson, lamented the Twitter criticism: 'If there were more reflection and less reaction, this country wouldn't be in this state.' But Mr Peston, who is married to novelist Sian Busby, was also defended by the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. He said the row was an over-reaction because the BBC reporter had not meant the word to be derogatory. 'People are being oversensitive, I appreciate their good intentions but he wasn’t using it in a gay put-down sense,' he told The Telegraph, . 'The etymology of the word ""queer"" as Robert Peston used it has nothing to do with homosexuality.' While the origins of the term are debated, 'Queer Street' is generally associated with a place of financial difficulty . One of the various explanations of its etymology is that it is a distortion of Carey Street in London, which was once associated with debtors' courts.","'Some of you seem to think my use of the phrase ""Queer Street"" is in some way homophobic.

"Most teenagers of the Eighties dreamed of zooming around on their own hoverboard like Marty McFly in the Back To The Future movies. And now they can... over water, at least. While Marty seemingly zoomed around above the ground, the new gadget uses high-powered water jet to allow the rider to hover above the water.

"Soldier: A new investigation has finally been launched into the death of Private Cheryl James, 18 . The family of a teenage soldier who mysteriously died at the notorious Deepcut barracks 19 years ago have asked for her body to be exhumed for a new inquest into her death. Private Cheryl James, 18, was one of four young recruits who suddenly died in unexplained fatal shootings at the scandal-hit Surrey base between 1995 and 2002. It is hoped the new investigation into her death could finally shed some light on the long-running mystery of the Deepcut deaths which has spanned over two decades. The shootings, which were treated as suicide, sparked accusations of bullying and an army cover-up and led to a campaign spearheaded by the Mail to uncover the truth. Today a new investigation was finally launched into the death of Pte James. Lawyers for her family told a judge presiding over a pre-inquest review hearing that it was essential that her body should be exhumed and re-examined by a pathologist. Alison Foster QC said the body could yield new ballistics evidence that would be central to finding out how the teenager came to suffer a fatal shot to the head. Pte James, of North Wales was found on November 27, 1995, with a single shot to the head between her right eye and the bridge of her nose after she had been on sentry duty. Just months earlier, in June 1995, Private Sean Benton, 20, of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with five bullet wounds to his chest. Probe: It is hoped the new investigation into Pte James's death could finally shed some light on the long-running mystery of deaths at Deepcut barracks (pictured) in Surrey which has spanned over two decades . Parents: Doreen and Des James (pictured) have long refused to accept that their daughter committed suicide using her own rifle . Over the next few years, two more young recruits would die from gunshot wounds in the barracks. In September 2001, Private Geoff Gray, 17, from East London was discovered with two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty. Private Sean Benton . The 20-year-old of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead at Deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995. Despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance, the Army says he committed suicide. Private Cheryl James . The 18-year-old of Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in November 1995. An Army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death. Private Geoff Gray . The young recruit,17, from Hackney, east London, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in September 2001. Five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found. A coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area. Private James Collinson . The 17-year-old, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in March 2002. The Army says he killed himself, but his parents do not accept this, insisting he had been happy. No inquest is held. The following year, on March 23, Private James Collinson, 17, was found dead with a gunshot wound through his chin while on guard duty. The families of the tragic soldiers have refused to accept their children committed suicide and hired a ballistics expert who claimed in 2003 that it was unlikely that any of the soldiers had shot themselves. A new two-month long inquest will now be held into Pte James’ death after the High Court quashed the ‘open verdict’ delivered at her original 1995 inquest. Two judges ruled that the initial inquest, which was held three weeks after her death and lasted less than an hour long, had been insufficient. The soldier’s parents Des and Doreen James have long refused to accept that their daughter committed suicide using her own rifle. Represented by Liberty, the family finally saw a new inquest ordered after taking new evidence to the High Court in July. Today, the investigation finally got under way in Woking, Surrey, with Judge Brian Barker opening proceedings at the town’s civic offices with a ‘few moments of reflection’. It will be up to Judge Barker, the Recorder of London, to set the parameters for the upcoming inquest and to decide whether to exhume Pte James’s body. Mrs Foster also suggested that the judge should make a site visit to Deepcut, to assess the distances involved on the Army site for himself. A second hearing will be held in February to review progress on the disclosure of sensitive documents from the police and MoD. Retired company director Mr James, 65, from Carreghofa on the Shropshire-Montgomeryshire border, said he was happy to see the investigation was finally on its way today. Speaking after the short hearing, he said that the pre-inquest review had come just days after the 19th anniversary of his daughter’s death. ‘It’s coincidental and ironic that finally we are on the journey. It’s a lovely feeling,’ he added tearfully. Before the hearing today, Mr James said he was not looking for revenge, just answers, after his experience of his daughter’s first inquest. ‘So many questions were left unanswered that day,’ he said. ‘To me, and many others, it was all a charade. ‘The powers-that-be, the police and military, seemed to want everything swept under the carpet and showed no interest in unearthing the truth about what really happened. ‘I just need to know what happened to her, for all the facts to be properly analysed. Cheryl deserves nothing less.’ The new inquest is expected to be held sometime after Easter next year following two more pre-inquest reviews.","Private Cheryl James, 18, was one of four recruits who suddenly died .

"A supercar fanatic fed up with missing out on offers of dates from women who spotted him diriving his Ferrari F430 has launched an app that he hopes will be the key to revving up Britain's sex lives. Marc Ackerley found himself swamped with date requests from attractive women who caught sight of him behind the wheel of his £170,000 Ferrarri. Women were apparently so desperate to meet him that they contacted a local luxury car dealer to be put in touch with the owner. Marc Ackerley (R) with Lawrence Cookson (L), who . developed the app, was fed up with missing out on offers of dates so . created a way of tracking someone down via their car registration . Fuelled by this new-found female attention and his worry that he was missing out on offers from women who had admired him (and his car) from afar but wouldn't think of contacting a car dealership, the businessman set up Platewave. The app which allows admirers to contact any car owner in the country. All you do is sign up to the website or app and send a message or a 'wave' to any registration plate. The recipient can only see it if they sign up to the app themselves and when they do, their messages will be waiting for them. Marc, from Alderley Edge, Cheshire, said: 'I started getting phone calls from my car dealer, asking if I had been out that day in my Ferrari. He told me that he'd had a number of calls from ladies who had spotted me driving my car and wanted to go out for a drink with me. Supercar heartthrob: Marc's car dealer was swamped with date requests from attractive women who spotted Marc driving around in his £170,000 Ferrarri F430 so he looked for a way to help them find him . 'And it got me thinking, what were the chances that other people had spotted me but didn't know how to track me down, or didn't think to contact me through my dealer. 'Or what if I had only been in the area on business, and lived elsewhere. How would they find me? 'The odds are stacked against me ever getting those messages or those women ever finding me - so I started to think about how I could make it easier for people to get in touch. This is the 21st century, it shouldn't be that difficult.' Motor-mad stud? Sign up for free and find love, says Marc of his new app . Light bulb moment: Fuelled by his new-found female attention and annoyance of always missing their offers, the entrepreneur set up Platewave . That's clever! The app allows admirers to contact any car owner in the country . So the 58-year-old entrepreneur launched the Platewave website, followed by mobile apps which allow people to connect with potential partners almost instantly. Marc added: 'Every penny people spend on a car, over what they need, is a statement, a way of standing out from the crowd. 'No one needs a flashy car, but we buy them to attract attention and if it's a really nice car, then people will stop and take an extra look. 'People always go for the very best that is available to them - it's just a fact of life that money attracts people. 'But if I saw the world's fittest woman getting into a battered old fiesta, I would hardly care what car she was driving. Not just for attracting love: Marc says there are many other uses for it, such as seeing a dog in distress in a hot car, and you want to text the owner to let them know . 'Dating sites are renowned for people putting up old pictures, and it can always be a disappointment when you meet someone and they look nothing like that anymore. 'But if you have just seen someone getting into their car, you know exactly who you are messaging.' And despite its obvious benefits as a tool for singletons to track down lovers, Marc insists the app can be used for a whole host of reasons. He added: 'There are so many uses for it - it can be whatever you want it to be. The amazing thing about it is that it gives you a way to connect instantly with someone, you never know who you're going to see or what car they might be driving. The new Tinder? Marx thinks dating sites are renowned for people putting up old pictures but his app won't disappoint, he promises . 'But if something interesting happens, then Platewave gives you a way to get in touch. 'You might have seen someone driving a car you like, and want to get in touch. Or imagine it's a hot summer's day and you can see a dog in distress in a hot car, and you want to text the owner to let them know. 'I think it could be a really big thing - the possibilities are endless.'","Marc Ackerley, 58, swamped with date requests via his car dealer .

"Three elementary schools were put on lockdown amid fears of a student allegedly seen carrying a gun on one of the campuses in southwestern Arizona on Tuesday. Zuma police say no gun was found after the evacuations over a false report of a student seen carrying a weapon at Rancho Viegjo Elementary but for many upset parents that information arrived much later than hoped. Outside Salida Del Sol Elementary School armed men were  seen escorting students to a cafeteria while the children kept their hands placed on their head. Lockdown: Students from Salida Del Sol Elementary School  are evacuated to the school's cafeteria by armed police officers after three schools went into lockdown on Tuesday . Sighting: A report of a student seen with a gun initially prompted the lockdowns of three schools in the area that lasted for four hours . Across the street parents from Rancho Viegjo were seen lined up, some visibly shaken and crying while voicing confusion on what was going on. Yuma police say they responded to that school about 10am and did a 'systematic search' of the campus while school buses shuttled students to another school several miles away. Police say students at Salida Del Sol Elementary, H.L. Suverkrup Elementary School and WACOG Preschool also were bused to another location before their parents could take them home. Police did their best to calm parents but many voiced frustration from the little amount of information released. Prepared: Police lined Rancho Viejo and Salida Del Sol Elementary Schools on Tuesday morning when both schools, along with WACOG Elementary School, were placed on lockdown . Worst fears: Concerned parents of students also waited outside for word from police which only slowly trickled in to them . ‘I called the schools, but they wouldn’t release any information,’ Israel Rosales who has children at two of the schools told the Yuma Sun. ‘It’s very frustrating. It’s like we are on the outside looking in and the only thing we can do is worry. I’m wondering what my kids are going through. I know they are scared.’ Some students experienced the same upset reaction to the scare, including a 10-year-old Rancho Viejo student who said she was comforted in the process after told that it was only a drill. ‘Now I feel really safe,’ Naomi told the Sun while back at her mother’s side. ‘I was really happy that the police were there and they kept on telling us that it was pretend because I stopped getting scared for a little while.’ Other parents like Kimberly Grable, though upset, expressed understanding for the blanketed situation. Calming: Yuma Police Sgt. Clint Norad talks with a group of concerned parents across the street from Salida Del Sol Elementary School during the lockdown which did not fine a weapon . 'I know there were some frustrated . parents but at the same time ... I’ll stand out here for five hours in . the hot sun because I know they’re taking care of the kids and making . sure that they’re safe.' Ms Grable, a parent of a sixth grader at . Rancho Viejo told the Sun. A mother on the school's Facebook page similarly thanked them for their effort. 'I just want to say thank you to all the staff at Rancho Viejo for not taking todays incident lightly. You guys did a great job contacting the police and keeping our children safe from possible danger. I am thankful that I was able to hold my child again and tell her I love her,' wrote Sara Mariah Podborny Rivera. Safe return: No injuries were reported nor was a gun found on any of the campuses before the students were returned to their parents waiting outside . The lock downs were lifted just after four hours. Superintendent of the Crane Elementary School District Robert Klee says students and staff followed procedures and no injuries were reported. ‘As superintendent, I’m very pleased with the response of our students and staff from both schools. They followed procedures and everything went as smoothly as possible and nobody was harmed,’ he said at a press conference following. He said the school underwent a practice lockdown only last week in case of such an event.",Lockdown in southwestern Arizona lifted after four hours without a weapon found .

The Tourist, starring Johnny Depp, was one of the first films to show the devices (pictured) Shannon, who stars as a corrupt estate agent in 99 Homes, said that his e-cigarette was a crucial part of his character, in an interview with The Times. The prop was suggested by Ramin Bahrani, the film’s director, who believes that e-cigarettes may come to denote characters who are too slick and charming to be trustworthy. 'Ramin gave me one e-cigarette and I started tooting on it like…I can’t think of a good metaphor,’ said Shannon, who starred in Revolutionary Road. ‘I couldn’t stop fiddling with it. It was always in my hand.‘ . ‘It’s like one of those old cartoons with the steam blowing out of the smokestack, and that’s what Caver is like – this smokestack that’s about to blow all the time.’ He said that it came in most useful when his character was trying to evict a desperate man, who responds by threatening to shoot his family and himself. Cigarettes denoted glamour and rebellion for film icons such as Audrey Hepburn and James Dean . Electronic cigarettes are s a battery-powered vaporisers which simulates tobacco smoking . ‘I think the whole film inevitably led to the place where he’s standing in front of Frank Greene’s house and not knowing what to do with himself. That’s where the e-cigarette comes in handy.’ Asked if it would catch on as a prop for villains, Shannon said: ‘Who knows? Probably. Other directors are going to copy it.’ The Tourist, starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, was one of the first films to feature electronic cigarettes. Depp is  seen using the device on a train, when questioned why he is smoking in public place, which is obviously banned, he explains how electronic cigarettes are exempt from the public smoking ban. Traditional cigarettes denoted glamour and empowerment for female stars like Marlene Dietrich and Bette Davis. And Audrey Hepburn’s cigarette holder in breakfast in Tiffany’s became a character-defining prop. Smoking enhanced Marlon Brando’s sex appeal in A Streetcar Named Desire and signified rebellion for James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. Smoking has declined sharply since a legal agreement in 1998 under which tobacco companies are restricted in using films for product placement. Smoking enhanced the sex appeal of film icons including Sophia Loren and Humphrey Bogart .","Oscar nominee Michael Shannon says e-cigarettes are ideal props for villains .

"A page from the original Book of Mormon, journals, manuscripts and religious commandments are among the dozens of priceless Mormon artifacts now available on display together for the first time. They are part of a new public exhibit in Salt Lake City that features some of the faith's most treasured artifacts dating back to the early days of Mormonism. In one glass case sits a weathered page from the original Book of Mormon manuscript that Latter-day Saints believe was translated from ancient Egyptian and dictated to scribes by founder Joseph Smith 185 years ago with help from God. Scroll down for video . The Book of Mormon manuscript, left, with other religious artifacts in their display cases at Salt Lake City . An original Mormon Book of Commandments is also available for viewing at the Foundations of Faith exhibit . In other nearby cases are Mr Smith's first journal and the first printed editions of books that contain commandments, doctrine and covenants based on early revelations Smith received while forming The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York in 1830. The priceless collection of 26 books, manuscripts and documents was unveiled yesterday at a news conference with church leaders that marks the latest example of the faith being more forthcoming about its history and tenets. Steven E. Snow, church historian and recorder, said: 'These four display cases comprise our most precious documents. 'They go to the foundation of our faith. These are our spiritual roots.' The religion founded with 30 followers now counts 15 million worldwide after experiencing a tripling of membership in the past three decades. As Mormons became more prominent in America and questions emerged about the burgeoning faith, some criticized it as being secretive about its beliefs and practices. In recent years, the Salt Lake City-based church has taken concerted steps to change that image. A year ago, it began releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the church. A printing plate used in the creation of the Book of Abraham - one of founder Joseph Smith's doctrines . A page from The Pearl of Great Price - a text containing several five sections detailing the religion's birth . Another page from The Pearl of Great Price which purports to translate ancient records . The religion also has issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of its history that it once sidestepped, such as the faith's past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy. The church's website has become a treasure trove of information about its doctrine, gospel and practices. Professor of literature and religion Terryl Givens said the new 'Foundations of Faith' exhibit, which opens to the public this week at the church's Salt Lake City history library, is another illustration of the religion's push to open its vault and take on questions. The collection should generate widespread interest among Mormons who will be able to see, in person, the artifacts associated with keystone events in church history, he said. The items have been in the church vault, taken out from time to time to show, but they have never before been displayed in one collection. Church leaders hope the exhibit will bolster members' faith and help non-Mormons better understand the religion. Church historian Richard Turley pictured speaking to reporters at the exhibition press conference yesterday . Mr Snow said: 'We need to be open and transparent. 'There are questions that arise occasionally, and we need to deal with them in an honest, forthright way, which we are trying to do.' The document likely to draw the most interest is the page from the Book of Mormon, considered the religion's most valuable manuscript. Before he was killed by a mob in 1844, Mr Smith buried the entire manuscript in the cornerstone of a building under construction in Nauvoo, Illinois, the city Mormons fled to in the mid-1800s to avoid religious persecution. The water-damaged manuscript was found in the rubble of the unfinished hotel some 40 years later. The church has only about one-fourth of the manuscript in its archive today. A copy of the Book of Mormon, which contains writings from ancient prophets, features in the display . The exhibit also includes a collection of sacred hymns chosen by Smith's wife, Emma, in 1835; documents that show the early foundation of the faith's organization for women and girls; and the first translations of the Book of Mormon into non-English languages such as Danish and Spanish. Church officials would not give a monetary value for the collection, saying only that many items are priceless and irreplaceable. They have implemented new security measures in the library to protect them. Philip Barlow, professor of Mormon history and culture at Utah State University, equated the experience of seeing the documents to Americans viewing the U.S. Constitution for the first time. 'There's something really important about the tangibility for the public of these documents in their original form,' Barlow said. 'It's a link with the past that has a sort of visceral power to change consciousness.'","A 185-year old page from Book of Mormon among the priceless documents .

"Lleyton Hewitt was unable to cause another upset at the US Open as he went down in straight sets to sixth seed Tomas Berdych in the first round. The 2001 champion knocked out Juan Martin del Potro last year and went on to reach the fourth round but he found the power of Berdych too much to handle. Hewitt led 4-1 in the second set but lost the next five games and Berdych eased to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory - his 100th in grand slams. End of the road: Lleyton Hewitt, who won in New York in 2001, lost at the first-round stage to Tomas Berdych . The Czech said: 'I feel pretty good. It's a tough opponent, a big challenge. 'The conditions were extremely tough today. The heat, the wind, and facing Lleyton for the first round, it's nothing that what you really want to have. 'But when you are prepared and feel good, that's a perfect start.' It has been a strange season for Hewitt, who has won multiple titles for the first time in a decade but has only won one match across the four slams. The 33-year-old was predictably asked whether he would be back at the US Open, giving the non-committal answer of: 'I don't know. I get asked that every week.' On the run: Berdych was too strong for the Australian and was a convincing winner in straight sets . Interested spectator: Berdych's girlfriend Ester Satorova watches her partner progress to the second round . Seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov began his first grand slam as a top-10 player with an impressive 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 victory over American Ryan Harrison. Dimitrov is a dark horse for the title after his exceptional season, highlighted by beating Andy Murray in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon, but this was his first ever win at the US Open. The Bulgarian, who lost in five sets to Portugal's Joao Sousa last year, said: 'I'm really happy to win my first round. It means a lot to me coming to this tournament as a seed. I have high expectations for myself.' Eleventh seed Ernests Gulbis beat Frenchman Kenny de Schepper 6-1. 6-4. 6-2 while 14th seed Marin Cilic had a light workout, with opponent Marcos Baghdatis retiring through injury when trailing 6-3, 3-1. Feliciano Lopez, the 19th seed, was also the beneficiary of a retirement in the fifth set of his clash with Ivan Dodig. Eyes on the prize: Grigor Dimitrov began his first grand slam as a top-10 player with an impressive victory . The Croatian had his thigh strapped but decided he could not continue and handed Lopez a 1-6, 7-5 2-6 6-4 1-1 victory. Kevin Anderson, seeded 18th, was staring at a first-round loss when opponent Pablo Cuevas served for the match in the fifth set but he recovered to clinch victory on a deciding tie-break. There was a painful end to American Steve Johnson's hopes against qualifier Tatsuma Ito. Johnson was leading by two sets to one and 1-0 in the fourth when a leap for a smash brought on an extreme bout of cramp. He lay on the court unable to move for a number of minutes, with the umpire having no choice but to penalise him for slow play. After losing a point and a game he climbed back to his feet and attempted to carry on but every movement made the cramp worse and he eventually retired in tears, although he refused a wheelchair and managed to walk off court. Wednesday's defeats for Johnson and Harrison mean only three American men have reached the second round - John Isner, Sam Querrey and Tim Smyczek.

"Scientists believe they have discovered how to 'switch off' autoimmune diseases, prompting hope the breakthrough could pave the way for a new treatment for multiple sclerosis. Researchers at the University of Bristol, who describe the work as an 'important breakthrough', say it could improve the lives of millions around the world. The study reveals how to stop cells from attacking healthy body tissue. The team discovered how cells convert from being aggressive to protecting against disease, rather than the body's immune system destroying its own tissue by mistake. Scientists at the University of Bristol have discovered how to 'switch off' autoimmune diseases, which they hope will pave the way for new treatments for multiple sclerosis. Pictured is a brain scan of a patient with MS . It is hoped the insight will lead to the widespread use of antigen-specific immunotherapy as treatment for many autoimmune disorders. Conditions which could be affected by the research include multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. MS alone affects around 100,000 people in the UK and 2.5 million people worldwide. Professor David Wraith, of the university's School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, led the 'exciting' research - which was funded by the Wellcome Trust. 'Insight into the molecular basis of antigen-specific immunotherapy opens up exciting new opportunities to enhance the selectivity of the approach while providing valuable markers with which to measure effective treatment,' Professor Wraith said. 'These findings have important implications for the many patients suffering from autoimmune conditions that are currently difficult to treat.' In the study, scientists were able to selectively target the cells that cause autoimmune disease by dampening down their aggression against the body's own tissue, while converting them into cells capable of protecting against disease. This type of conversion has previously been applied to allergies, in a treatment known as 'allergic desensitisation', but its application to autoimmune disorders has only recently been appreciated. The 'important breakthrough' could have implications for millions of people who suffer MS across the world, many of whom will become confined to a wheelchair as a result of the disease. File picture . The researchers have now revealed how the administration of fragments of the proteins that are normally the target for the attack leads to correction of the autoimmune response. Their work also shows that effective treatment can be achieved by gradually increasing the dose of antigenic fragment injected. Nick Rijke, executive director of policy and research at the MS Society welcomed the new study. He said: 'This is a really interesting and encouraging study, and adds to our understanding of how scientists might be able to alter the way the immune system responds in people with MS. 'A previous trial of a similar therapy was unsuccessful in people with MS, but this latest study, although conducted in mice, offers new options for future clinical trials that one day could lead to a low risk treatment for people with the condition.' In order to analyse how this type of immunotherapy works, the scientists looked inside the immune cells themselves to see which genes and proteins were turned off by the treatment. They found changes in gene expression that help explain how effective treatment leads to conversion of aggressor into protector cells. The outcome is to reinstate self-tolerance, where an individual's immune system ignores its own tissues while remaining fully armed to protect against infection. Researchers say that by specifically targeting the cells at fault, the immunotherapeutic approach avoids the need for immune suppressive drugs. These drugs are often associated with side effects such as infections, development of tumours and disruption of natural regulatory mechanisms. The treatment approach is currently undergoing clinical development through biotechnology company Apitope, a spin-out from the University of Bristol. 'Sequential transcriptional changes dictate safe and effective antigen-specific immunotherapy' is published in Nature Communications today.","Team at Bristol University have described their work as a 'breakthrough'

"A slimmer who vowed to lose weight after suffering the humiliation of needing a seat-belt extension on a plane has shed a sensational 10st. Mother-of-two Aimee Diri was travelling to Portugal in July 2012 when she discovered, at 20st 2lb, she was too big to strap in. The embarrassing episode kick-started Aimee's dramatic weight loss, which saw her shed half her body weight. Scroll down for video . Aimee has managed to lose 10st, dropping from 20st 2lb (left) to a slim 10st (right) Now the 36-year-old is a svelte 10st, and has been named Slimmer of the year at her local Slimming World group. 'I vowed to myself that I would never go on holiday again that size,' said Aimee from Northfield, Birmingham. 'I was really embarrassed. It felt horrible. 'It was the first time I felt self-conscious. When we arrived I didn't want to be around the pool, and I couldn't get in the fairground rides with the kids. 'It was definitely the trigger.' Six months later Aimee and husband Manuel booked their summer holiday and, determined to lose weight, Aimee signed up to Slimming World in January 2013 a size 26. 'I wanted to lose six stone by the time I went on holiday in the July,' she said. 'There was no way I was going away again feeling so bad.' Waitress Aimee would soon have to change her eating habits. A constant grazer, she admits she would skip dinner and instead snack on crisps, biscuits, chocolate and other junk all evening. Aimee admits her diet was excessive - involving snacking on junk foods in secret and often skipping meals . 'I look back and cringe at what I used to eat. 'I was a secret eater really, and used to eat a lot when I had put the kids to bed and was on my own.' Aimee, mother to Isabella, six and Luca, three, joined her local group run by Paula Hooper at the Quarry Sports and Social Club. She started on a new healthy eating plan, ditching the naughty snacks and switching to home-cooked meals and lots of fruits and vegetables. The super-slimmer lost her target 6st for her summer holiday, and set her sights on losing even more. And this summer Aimee finally reached her goal of 10st, and even felt confident enough to wear a bikini on holiday. Aimee has totally transformed her diet to lose the pounds, eating healthy home-cooked meals . 'I have lost a whole one of me - it's crazy,' said Aimee. 'When I look back at my old self, I wish that someone had told me. 'It's all about the confidence- that is what Slimming World gives you the confidence and the support to know you can do it.' Paula Hooper, who runs the Northfield group, says: 'I'm so proud of Aimee, Not only does she look fabulous, she's improved her health and is bursting with energy. 'She's a huge inspiration to everyone in our group and I hope she inspires other women in Northfield to change their lives in the same way.'","Aimee gained weight through excessive snacking .

"Manchester United hope to formally announce the signing of Angel di Maria on Tuesday after agreeing terms on a British record transfer fee of £59.7million plus add ons with Real Madrid. United officials held meetings with their Real Madrid counterparts on Sunday evening and resumed talks on Monday as they bartered down the £75m asking price. The scale of the extra fees due from United will depend on performances and the prospect of Di Maria winning the Ballon D'Or. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria's career highlights . Spotted: Di Maria is on the left hand side of the back seat on his way into United's training ground . On the look out: Di Maria peers out of his United car as he arrives for the completion of his transfer . World class: Di Maria has been a key figure for both Real Madrid and Argentina over the past few years . The Argentina midfielder posed with fans at Madrid airport on Monday afternoon prior to flying into Manchester on a private plane to meet up with United manager Louis van Gaal late on Monday night. Van Gaal had been at Carrington overseeing the first team squad's 4pm warm-down session and training ahead of Tuesday night's Capital One Cup second round tie at MK Dons. Di Maria's arrival will give the club a welcome lift following a disappointing start to the season that has delivered just one point from their opening two Premier League games but there is concern that his signing, as stellar as it is, fails to address United's real needs and Van Gaal is pressing the club to deliver two more players over the coming days. Ajax utility player Daley Blind and Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal are among those being considered. Creative: The winger should bring a new spark to Louis van Gaal's side, which has been lacking this season . The Manchester United megastore at Old Trafford ran out of the letter 'R' as supporters clambered to buy Angel Di Maria shirts. A sign was put outside the shop on Monday night informing fans that there were no 'R' letters left in black print. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . Madrid are also agreeing terms over United right back Guillermo Varela. The 21-year-old Uruguayan only joined United a year ago from Penarol but will move to Real's B team Castilla to play under Zinedine Zidane. The deal is likely to be a loan with a view to a permanent £3m transfer. Di Maria will join up with his new United team-mates at training on Thursday and the club hope to formalise his work permit and registration by noon on Friday if he is to figure against Burnley on Saturday. A work permit, however, has yet to be arranged for his compatriot Marcos Rojo with the Bank Holiday helping to delay the process. Di Maria, hailed as the best player in Spain, 'surpassing even Lionel Messi' according to former Argentina coach Cesar Luis Menotti, has at least got United supporters excited. Pedigree: Di Maria was a crucial member of Real's Champions League-winning side last season . A need for more such names is underlined by the fact United face MK Dons on Tuesday night in the Capital One second round without seven first-team players. Chris Smalling has joined Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Jesse Lingard and Rafael on the sidelines. Danny Welbeck, Javier Hernandez and Shinji Kagawa are set to be involved from the start, with youngsters Reece James and James Wilson also in contention to play. Juventus have made an enquiry about the availability of Hernandez after Arsenal stalled on the proposed loan of Lukas Podolski.

"The British jihadist suspected of killing US journalist James Foley sparked fears of a terror attack at a music festival when he asked to perform before a huge crowd, it emerged today. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - thought to have been behind Mr Foley's gruesome murder in Syria - raised worries among music bosses while trying to get work as a rapper. He reportedly asked music industry figures in Los Angeles to 'get him to America' before turning angry when he was turned down over his links to extremism. Scroll down for video . It was feared Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary  would target revellers at a U.S. music festival, it was reported today . It is said he wanted to perform at the Coachella event in Indio, California and grew angry when turned down . Bary - suspected of being the 'Jihadi John' terrorist -  performed under the name L Jinny before leaving his parents' £1million home in Maida Vale to fight in Syria. He has since been named as a prime suspect in the killing of Mr Foley, who was shown being killed by an extremist with a London accent in a video broadcast around the world last month. The Sun today reported that American music managers Jeff Crawford and Jennifer Harris-Crawford became concerned about Bary when he asked them to help him perform at the popular U.S. music festival Coachella. After initially expressing interest in his music, they pulled out when they discovered his father, Adel Abdel Bary, was awaiting trial for terror charges. Ms Harris-Crawford told the paper: 'He could be performing and also arranging bombs there. I had this vision of something horrible happening.' The couple said Bary sent them angry messages after they withdrew offers of support and sent them lyrics to a rap which involved references to beheadings, it was reported. Bary reportedly sent U.S. music managers Jeff Crawford and Jennifer Harris-Crawford lyrics about beheadings . Bary is suspected of being the so-called 'Jihadi John' militant who killed U.S. journalist James Foley on camera . It emerged last week that Bary's 54-year-old father is now locked up in New York awaiting trial for the bombing of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Early photos of Bary posted online show him wearing western clothes such as Adidas hoodies and rapping in a recording studio. But later images show him in military fatigues and a mask wielding a machine gun, an AK-47 and an M16 assault rifle. He is one of three British men who have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed Mr Foley in the brutal propaganda video which shocked the world last month. The three men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the Islamic State capital of Raqqa, Syria. The revelations about his planned trip to the U.S. came the day after David Cameron announced police will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects trying to join jihadists fighting in the Middle East. The Prime Minister also unveiled new powers to force jihadis living in the UK to relocate and said airlines will be compelled to hand over passenger lists to increase security.

"Vets who operated on a dog who was rushed to hospital after becoming sick were shocked to find he had swallowed 43 socks. The three-year-old Great Dane, was rushed to the DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital in Portland, Oregon, after his owners became concerned when he began to retch and vomit. But when vets operated on pet they found the reason he was unwell was because he had ate the garments, solving the mystery of why the family's socks kept going missing. All 43 socks, which were removed by surgeons, from a three-year-old Great Dane's stomach at the DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital . The family took the dog to the animal hospital after he fell ill and was described as being generally miserable. Vets then examined the Great Dane and performed x-rays, which revealed what they described as 'a large quantity of foreign material'. It was then decided to perform exploratory surgery and two hours later, surgeons had removed 43 and a half socks from the dog's stomach. Luckily the dog was unharmed and after spending a day in the hospital was free to return home to his family. Surgeons carried out exploratory surgery after this x-ray showed a 'large quantity of foreign material' inside the dog's stomach .

"Manchester United's fringe players put in a pitiful display against MK Dons - with a humiliating 4-0 defeat highlighting why they cannot break into Louis van Gaal's first-team plans. Captain for the night Jonny Evans could not have put in a worse display as he gave away the ball for Dons' first goal and disappeared from sight in the second half.  Javier Hernandez and Anderson were particularly awful and Danny Welbeck also struggled. Here, Sportsmail dissects the performances of some of United's fringe players. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: We created chances but we made errors . Embarrassing: Manchester United were beaten 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup second round . Night to forget: Jonny Evans was dreadful for United and his mistake led to the first goal for MK Dons . Hammer blow: Will Grigg celebrates scoring the first goal in MK Dons' 4-0 victory over Manchester United . Jonny Evans . Although not a fringe player, Evans may have played himself out of Van Gaal's first-team plans after an inept display against a League One side. With the arrival of Marcos Rojo and with more signings expected, Evans' place in the team can no longer be guaranteed after this display. The first goal was definitely his fault as - under no real pressure whatsoever - he casually passed the ball directly to Ben Reeves, who played in Will Grigg to open the scoring. Evans also went missing for the second goal - as did the whole defence - and continued to be caught out of position in the second half. As captain, Evans was expected to lead the young side to victory but instead his indecisiveness and wastefulness in position caused his team-mates to become nervous. Not the way to introduce yourself to a new manager. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Struggle: Jonny Evans was unable to lead United well as captain and his mistakes led directly to goals . Out-muscled: Evans struggled all evening and he could not cope with the MK Dons forwards running at him . Anderson . Played a wonderful early ball through the middle to Hernandez on 10 minutes that the Mexican wasted, but that was unfortunately about as good as it got for the midfielder. He put in an awful sliding tackle on double-scorer Grigg on the half-hour mark for which he should have been booked, and that was about as close as he got to winning the ball most of the night. Anderson ambled around the pitch for long periods without looking like controlling the game. He was thoroughly out-played by a League One midfield, which basically says it all. He totally lost the run of Grigg for MK Dons' second goal and allowed him to chest in unmarked. United must off load him ASAP. Please help me: Anderson put in an awful display for United and looks certain to be shown the exit door . Struggle: Anderson was bullied by a League One midfield in MK Dons and he was terrible most of the night . Javier Hernandez . This really was not the Mexican's night. Any potential suitors in the transfer market will not have been impressed with this display and may be getting cold feet over any deal. Hernandez slipped over in first minute after a wonderful ball through from Welbeck and from then on looked rushed and low in confidence in front of goal. On at least two occasions Hernandez should have scored for United but both times he blew his chances. First of all he turned his back on the ball in the 76th minute when he had a wide-open goal to aim at in an utterly baffling move. Then he had a chance from six yards with three minutes left on the clock that was blocked but the Javier Hernandez of two years ago would have buried it. Extremely disappointing display. Waste: Javier Hernandez did not take any of the chances that fell his way and was extremely poor . Struggle: Hernandez looked short of match sharpness and should have scored at least twice on the night . Shinji Kagawa . Perhaps the only one of the fringe players who can leave Milton Keynes feeling like he may still have a future under Van Gaal. He lasted just 20 minutes after he failed to recover from a heavy collision in the ninth minute. Kagawa was left with a bloodied nose, blurry vision and mild concussion and left the pitch not knowing where he was - perhaps for the best! Van Gaal has described Kagawa as someone who 'cannot hold' in midfield, so the arrival of Angel Di Maria will limit the attacking opportunities available to the playmaker even further. Cut short: Shinji Kagawa was forced off the field with mild concussion and blurriness in the 20th minute . Unable to shine: Kagawa was not able to make his case to be regular starter after having his evening cut short . Danny Welbeck . Strangely Welbeck was one of the few United players to start well but, as the visitors faded, the forward disappeared completely in the second half. A wonderful counter-attack and ball in the box to Hernandez highlighted a brilliant start for Welbeck who looked pacey and full of intent, but he soon found himself starved of service. He had one powerful effort from 20 yards that just crept wide but apart from that he rarely looked like scoring. If he is to leave United you would think there will be plenty of suitors, but the game against MK Dons highlighted the frustration of Welbeck the player. He can look so good yet he just does not deliver so often when it matters. Lively: Danny Welbeck started the game well but United faded in the first half and stopped providing him the ball . Frustrating: Welbeck looked good to begin with but, as United faded, Welbeck completely disappeared .","Braces from Will Grigg and Benik Afobe help MK Dons to famous victory .

"The World Health Organization has released global suicide statistics that reveals the United States is about average worldwide while the nations of Guyana, North and South Korea have the highest rates. More than 800,000 people each . year worldwide commit suicide - around one person every 40 . seconds - with many using poisoning, hanging or shooting to end . their own lives, says the study released Thursday. In its first global report on suicide prevention, the United . Nations health agency said some 75 percent of suicides are among . people from poor or middle-income countries and called for more . to be done to reduce access to common means of suicide. Global suicide rate: The report found that suicides take place all over the worldand at almost any age. Globally, suicide rates are highest inpeople aged 70 and over, but in some countries, the highest rates are found among the young. High suicide rates also persist in more developed nations. South Korea, for example, has the world's third highest rate -- 28.9 out of every 100,000 people. The United States is grouped along with countries such as Australia, Spain and much of Europe whose rates are between 10 and 14.9 per 100,000. The report found that suicides take place all over the world . and at almost any age. Globally, suicide rates are highest in . people aged 70 and over, but in some countries, the highest . rates are found among the young. In the 15 to 29-year age group, suicide is the second . leading cause of death globally. The WHO's director general Margaret Chan said the report was . a 'call for action to address a large public health problem . which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long.' Pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most . common methods of suicide globally, the report said, and . evidence from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United . States and Europe shows that restricting access to these means . can help to stop people from committing suicide. In the 15 to 29-year age group, suicide is the secondleading cause of death globally. Suicide rates as a whole go up as the country's income rate goes down . Governments should also set up national prevention plans, . the report said, noting that currently only 28 countries are . known to have such strategies. The report found that in general, more men die by suicide . than women. In richer countries, three times as many men kill . themselves as women, and men aged 50 and over are particularly . vulnerable. In poor and middle-income countries, young people and . elderly women have higher rates of suicide than their . counterparts in wealthy nations, the report found. And women . over 70 are more than twice as likely to commit suicide than . women aged between 15 and 29. 'No matter where a country currently stands in suicide . prevention, effective measures can be taken, even just starting . at local level and on a small scale,' said Alexandra . Fleischmann, a scientist at the WHO's department of mental . health and substance abuse. Other preventative measures include encouraging responsible . reporting of suicide in the media, such as avoiding language . that sensationalizes suicide. Early identification and management of people with mental . illness and drug and other substance abusers is also important. 'Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, . including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted . suicide, together with provision of community support, are . essential, because people who have already attempted suicide are . at the greatest risk of trying again,' the report said. The WHO report was published ahead of world suicide . prevention day on September 10. Samaritans can be contacted by phone on 08457 909090 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK, or call 1 (800) 273-TALK in the US .","Poor and middle-income countries rank the worst in the study .

"More than $12,000 worth of camera equipment is currently sitting at the bottom of the sea off the coast of New Zealand. But the owner of the equipment, 360Heros CEO and Founder Michael Kintner, is in no hurry to retrieve it from the shark infested waters. That's because Emmy-award winning wildlife cinematographer, Andy Brandy Casagrande, watched from the safety of a shark cage as an enormous great white shark tore into the GoPro scuba diving gear. 'MIKE – I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE VERY BAD NEWS – A PICTURE SAYS A THOUSAND WORDS – SEE ATTACHED – I CAN'T BELIEVE IT – BUT THE WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO HAPPENED YESTERDAY – I ONLY JUST NOW BUILT UP THE COURAGE TO TELL YOU,' Mr Casagrande wrote in full capitals to Mr Kintner, according to their webiste. Scroll down for video . A great white shark tears into over $12,000 of camera equipment off the coast of New Zealand . Footage of the destruction was captured by wildlife cinematographer, Andy Brandy Casagrande, and a 360Heros cameraman . 'WHILE SHOOTING WITH THE 360 RIG- AFTER SHOOTING AWESOME TOPSIDE & BEHIND THE SCENES 360 – I TOOK THE RIG UNDERWATER & AFTER AN HOUR OF GETTING AWESOME FOOTAGE – I PUSHED THE ENVELOPE TOO FAR & AN AGGRESSIVE WHITE SHARK BIT & LITERALLY ATE THE 360 – COMPLETELY – ALL 6 CAMERAS IN ONE BITE.' Mr Casagrande described the incident in more depth in an interview with the Mercury Press, stating: 'I watched as the first Great White Shark engulfed the rig - it realized it wasn't a natural prey item and decide to regurgitate it'. 'However, directly after the first shark spit it out a second shark rushed up and engulfed before spitting it out. 'It was almost like they were playing football with it!' They were working in the waters to capture footage of some great whites for Discovery Channel's Shark Week . Mr Casagrande was working in the waters to capture footage of some great whites alongside the 360Heros team for Discovery Channel's Shark Week, when the incident occurred. Luckily, he still managed to capture footage of the destruction occurring from the cage, which shows the equipment falling from the sharp teeth of one of the enormous fish. The GoPro rig, which the shark could be seen taking a bite out of, held six GoPro cameras worth more than $400 each while the scuba diving gear was worth more than $10,000, Mercury Press reported. Devastated by the financial loss, the company is now using the event to promote how far they are willing to go for the perfect footage. Mr Casagrande said that as one shark spat the camera out, a 'second shark rushed up and engulfed it before spitting it out. It was almost like they were playing football with it!' 'A hungry great white had just turned months of preparation and planning into an expensive snack,' their website states. 'Thanks to one hungry shark, our gear, SD cards and the historic footage they contain are currently sitting on the ocean floor.' However, all loses aside, 360Heros couldn't help but lighten the mood. '360Heros is offering a $5,000 reward for the return of this gear following its unintended decent into the water off New Zealand.'","The incident occurred just off the coast of New Zealand .

'When . he left at the beginning of August, we understood there was a risk he . could become sick with this deadly virus but I knew that he needed to go . and be with the Liberian people who needed a hospital to be open,' she added. Debbie spoke of her husband's dedication to helping those in Liberia in need who fell victim to the deadly virus.

She said that her husband's wish is that workers do all that they can to avoid exposure to the virus, reports the Boston Globe. 'He is not someone who can stand back when there is a need that he can take care of.

"Manuel Pellegrini must have been looking for Mario Balotelli’s ‘Why Always Me’ T-shirt on Thursday night. Life could hardly get any worse for Manchester City in the Champions League. For the third successive season they were handed a ‘Group of Death’. There’s no sugar-coating it — Group E is gruesome, brutal, grim. If Pellegrini was to pick one scenario he didn’t want ahead of the draw, this wouldn’t have been far off. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City: Vincent Kompany wants the quadruple . Deja vu: Manchester City and Bayern Munich will meet in the group stages for the third time in three years . Possible: James Milner celebrates the third goal when the sides last met, in a 3-2 win for City . His mood will not have been helped by knowing that, down in London, Jose Mourinho had his feet up, with Chelsea surely as good as in the knockout stages after being given a relatively easy ride. For the second successive season, City will face Bayern Munich; the Bundesliga giants wounded by last season’s failed attempt to retain their title. Riding on the crest of Germany’s World Cup win, Pep Guardiola’s side will be one of the toughest teams to beat this season. City’s nightmare does not end there, though. Two clashes against a rejuvenated Roma will provide a huge test of their European credentials. In an uncanny twist, Roma and City crossing paths throws open the possibility of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole going head-to-head for the first time since they left Chelsea this summer. Pellegrini will know the fixtures against Roma and CSKA Moscow are paramount to City making it to the last 16. Quick return: The draw gives Ashley Cole a first chance to return to England when Roma meet City . Tricky tie: Roma are a much better side than in previous years, led by a resurgent Gervinho . And if he thought things could not get much worse, he only needs to look at a daunting eight-day stretch next month when he must squeeze a trip to Bavaria between crucial League clashes at Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. ‘It’s a tough one,’ said City’s sporting director Txiki Beguiristan. ‘Our challenge is to be first in the group because that gives you an advantage. ‘The objective is higher now. That’s why we improved the team, to give us a chance of winning the domestic competitions but also to be better in Europe. There are five, six, eight other clubs that can win it but we can as well. Why should we not set out to win the Champions League?’ Thursday’s draw would also not have made comfortable viewing for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Perhaps not quite to the same extent as Pellegrini, but Wenger will yet again have to pit his wits against one of Europe’s most impressive young coaches in Jurgen Klopp. Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season . Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year . But facing Borussia Dortmund, 2013’s beaten finalists, will not paralyse Wenger’s expensively-assembled squad with fear. After losing to the Bundesliga side on matchday three last season, the Gunners went to Dortmund and recorded a famous 1-0 win against the odds, Aaron Ramsey scoring. Arsenal secretary David Miles said: ‘It’s tough but it’s one from which there’s a pre-requisite to finish first and avoid the likes of Barcelona at the start of the knock-out stage.’ Anderlecht and Galatasaray are likely provide a more modest test. While Liverpool ponder the challenge of Real Madrid, Basle and the Bulgarians of Ludogorets, Mourinho must have had by far the best night’s sleep. Special one: Jose Mourinho will be very please with Chelsea's comfortable Champions League draw . When he holds his weekly press conference at Chelsea’s Cobham HQ on Friday, the Portuguese will inevitably dispel the notion that his side have been handed an easy European ride. But the Special One himself could not have handpicked a more comfortable group. With all due respect, Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Maribor hardly reads as a who’s who of European football’s elite. Much to Brendan Rodgers, Pellegrini and Wenger’s annoyance, no doubt. VIDEO Three European giants drawn in Group F .","City face German giants Bayern Munich for a third time in four years .

"North Korea says it's ready for a 'full scale nuclear war' and called South Korea's president a 'crafty prostitute' with president Obama as her 'powerful pimp.' The North Korean insults come after President Obama visited  South Korea and its president Park Geun-hye for two days in which both leaders asked that North Korea not proceed with its nuclear program. The Committee for Peaceful Reunification of Korea CPRK)  said, 'Park Geun-hye's recent behavior with Obama was like a mean immature girl begging gangsters to beat up someone she does not like. Or a crafty prostitute eagerly trying to frame someone by giving her body to a powerful pimp.' South Korean President Park Geun-Hye (R) and US President Barack Obama (L) arrive to receive a briefing from United Nations Commander General of US-ROK Combined Forces Command in Seoul during Obama's two day visit . The Korean Newws Agency (KCNA) said the official English translation of North Korea's description of Park was as a 'capricious whore.' North Korea called Obama 'master' and Park Guen-hye his 'puppet' and said that Park would pay a 'dear price,' reports The Guardian. Satellite imagery has shown an increase in activity at North Korea's nuclear test site and Park warned that Pyongang was ready to execute another atomic test. Both Obama and Park threatened North Korea with harsher rules and economic sanctions on the already poor country. They encouraged China to speak against it's ally's nuclear threats. The CPRK called the both Park and Obama's statements 'intolerable insults' against their leadership. US President Barack Obama (L) and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye (R) attend a joint press conference at the presidential Bule House oin which they discussed North Korea's nuclear threats . 'In particular, Park Geun-Hye continued to viciously take issue with our dignity, system and nuclear programmes,' it said. They said her remarks were as though she were 'froth(ing) at the mouth.' 'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the US and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,'  said the KCNA translation. The CPRK claimed that Obama should have 'postponed or shelved his trip' following the ferry full of schoolchildren that sank in South Korea. The CPRK said that Obama was 'utterly indifferent to the sorrow' felt by South Korea after the ferry incident. 'The latest visit by Obama only reaffirmed our long-held belief that might, not words, are the only option to deal with the old enemy US and strengthened our resolve and determination to stick with our policy to fight a full-scale nuclear war,' they said. Pyongang is North Korea rejected South Korea's proposal to absorb the North into the South . 'Park Geun-hye will pay a dear price for abandoning the opportunity we earlier gave and choosing a path of anti-unification and anti-peace and a path to confrontation and war,' they continued. They also likened Park to a 'comfort woman,' a term used to describe women who were sexually enslaved by Japanese soldiers during World War II. The comments will be a controversial topic in South Korea as it's still a touchy subject regarding their relationship with Tokyo. North Korea has been known to criticize South Korean leaders including Park's predecessor Lee Myung-Bak. The attacks on Park have been even more offensive and sexual in nature since she is the first female president in Seoul. Park has expressed her wish to build a trusting relationship with Pyongang but she says she will also remain strong if she faces provocation. Pyongang rejected her proposal to prepare for unification and to attempt to absorb North Korea into South Korea. 'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the US and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,' the KCNA translation said of Parks allied relations with the United States.","North Korea says it ready for nuclear war and satellite imagery has shown activity at their nuclear sight .

"A visibly-harassed Francois Hollande is said to be 'devastated' over a book by his ex-partner Valerie Trierweiler, which brands the French president callous and cynical. Mr Hollande, pictured at the Nato summit today looking irked, is facing a media storm back home in France after Ms Trierweiler's intimate memoir portrayed him as a snob who secretly mocks poor people. The book is a particularly unwelcome distraction at a time when Mr Hollande is under pressure in Wales for a deal between France and Russia over a warship. Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, he said the deal to supply two Mistral-class helicopter carriers was neither cancelled nor suspended, but the conditions for deliver were 'not in place'. Bad day? Francois Hollande takes a call at the Nato summit in Wales, as the scandal of Valerie Trierweiler's develops back home in France . Hollande has also been dealing with the sensitive issue of delivering a warship to Russia. France has come under pressure to scrap the deal and has seemingly suspended it for now . Back home Mr Hollande found an unlikely backer in his former partner Segolene Royal. The mother of Mr Hollande's four children dismissed the attacks made by his former lover  Valerie Trierweiler as 'rubbish'. The book,Thank You For This Moment, received a furious backlash in France, where politicians' private lives are not publicly aired. Ms Royal, speaking on France's BFMTV early on Thursday, repeated several times that she would not comment on questions of a personal nature but reacted when the interviewer pressed her on Mr Hollande's alleged contempt for the poor. 'It's rubbish, it's the exact opposite of the political commitment of a great leader of the left,' she said. 'Do you think it's true?' Royal shot back to the interviewer. 'Can you think it is true about a politician you have known for years...? Segolene Royal has shot down the humiliating claims against her former partner as 'rubbish' 'One must judge politicians by their acts,' she said, adding that Mr Hollande had a proven record of working for better conditions for the poor.' Mr Hollande is reported to have sent a friend a text message saying he is 'devastated' by the book, which casts him as callous and cynical. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'I call for respect in the lives of everyone and dignity in public debate. 'With these outrageous attacks, by mixing public and private life, we are dragging down the debate'. With a stagnant economy and high unemployment, he added that the French  had far more important things on their mind such as 'jobs, housing and the high cost of living'. An unlikely ally came in the shape of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, normally one of his fiercest critics, who dubbed the book a 'dishonour for France.' She went on to describe the memoir, which became Amazon’s top seller on its first day,  as a 'profoundly indecent settling of scores' and a form of 'vengeance'. Miss Trierweiler received an advance of some £70,000 for the first kiss-and-tell account of a serving head of state. The 49-year-old journalist, whose maiden name is Massonneau, recalls spending Christmas with her working-class family and Mr Hollande. She writes that Mr Hollande quipped: 'They're not very nice, the Massonneau family.' She says her family 'is so typical of his electors', adding: 'He stood for election as a man who does not like the rich. In reality, the President does not like the poor. He, the man of the Left, calls them the toothless ones. He's very proud of his humour.' Ms Royal, pictured in Paris on Thursday, appeared visibly irritated with her interviewer's line of questioning. She dismissed Valerie Trierweiler's book outright, defending her ex . Ms Royal, who has four children with the French president, sprung to his defence following the stinging book . She also describes the collapse of their nine-year affair after a gossip magazine published pictures of Mr Hollande visiting his mistress on a moped. And she reveals he sent her 29 texts in one day trying to win her back – while still seeing his lover, TV actress Julie Gayet. Extracts detailing the 'cruelty' of a 'passionate, possessive and mad' affair appeared yesterday in Paris Match magazine. Mr Hollande sacked Miss Trierweiler as his first lady on January 25 in a short official statement. But she says he had already lied brazenly to her about Miss Gayet, 42. She claims to have confronted him when rumours spread in December 2013, saying: 'Swear to me on my son's life that it's false and we won't talk about it any more'. He swears, and dismisses it as nonsense.' Miss Trierweiler pictured with French President Francois Hollande, who she has portrayed as a hypocrite . Miss Trierweiler, pictured on August 20, in Normandy on charity work. Her book about her relationship with Francois Hollande has caused him a severe headache in France . When the truth emerged, she spent eight days in hospital for 'stress'. Disturbingly, she writes: 'Julie Gayet was top of the morning news. I'm cracking up, I can't hear anything, I rush to the bathroom. I take the small plastic bag containing sleeping pills. Francois follows me. He tries to snatch the bag. 'I run into the bedroom. The pills scatter on to the bed and floor. I manage to grab them. I swallow what I can. I want to sleep. I feel the storm about to break around me, and I don't have the strength to resist.' After their split, Mr Hollande attempted to remain in contact, said Miss Trierweiler, on one day 'sending me 29 text messages'. Miss Trierweiler – known as the Rottweiler – claims that on August 12, his 60th birthday, when many were speculating he might marry Miss Gayet, Mr Hollande texted his former lover: 'It is up to you to say yes to me'. Elysee Palace sources said the President – nicknamed Flanby, for a brand of caramel pudding – had been 'completely unaware of this book'. Meanwhile Paris Match, where Miss Trierweiler works, describes it as 'both a scream of love and a slow descent into hell, a dive into the intimacy of a couple. Two people and nothing else – Valerie and Francois.' Over 12 pages, it tells the story of Miss Trierweiler's 'passionate, possessive, mad love for this man whom I loved, who made me laugh, and who destabilised me deliciously'. Miss Trierweiler says she felt 'dehumanised' throughout the Socialist politician's rise to power because she was seen as his mistress, and talks of feeling 'illegitimate' when Mr Hollande won the presidency in 2012. Of the day he came to power, she writes: 'He's cold, he doesn't smile. I'm his stooge, but I have no value.' The 320-page memoir is on sale in France following a massive 200,000 print run carried out in the strictest secrecy. It is almost unprecedented. In 2013, Cecilia Attias, the second wife of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, cashed in with a book called A Desire for Truth. However, it came out a year after he left office, and contained no intimate details.","Hollande is reported to have sent a friend a text message saying he is 'devastated' by the book .

"Pacemakers could soon be powered by energy from the beating heart, finally ending the need for a battery. A prototype of a battery-free cardiac pacemaker has been developed by a Swiss researcher based on an automatic wristwatch. The technology harvests energy from the motion of the heart with the help of 200-year-old principles used to power self-winding watches. One of the current kind of pacemakers (pictured) could become redundant after researchers make a prototype for a battery-free cardiac pacemaker and they could soon be powered by energy from the beating heart . This means it could remove the need for operations to replace pacemaker batteries about every seven to ten years. It would also do away with leads that connect the pacemaker inserted in the chest wall with the heart, sending programmed electrical pulses that keep the heart beating regularly. About 40,000 people in England had a pacemaker to control abnormal heart rhythms fitted last year. Researcher Adrian Zurbechen, from the Cardiovascular Engineering Group at the University of Bern in Switzerland, said laboratory experiments show the idea can work. He said ‘Pacemakers have two weak spots. ‘Leads are prone to fracture and the lifetime of batteries is limited. ‘Replacing batteries with alternative power sources would spare patients from repeated interventions and make leads obsolete.’ Mr Zurbechen revealed details of the experimental device at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona, Switzerland. The technology is based on a traditional clockwork wristwatch which winds automatically because the rotor inside is turned whenever the watch accelerates due to the movement of the wearer’s arm. This rotation progressively winds a mechanical spring that, once fully charged, unwinds again and spins an electrical micro-generator. To develop a pacemaker that operated in a similar way, the researchers copied the wristwatch mechanism, removing unnecessary parts to reduce weight and size and developing a custom-made housing with eyelets so it could be stitched directly onto the heart muscle tissue. Four years ago Professor Rolf Vogel, a cardiologist and engineer at the University of Bern, had the idea of using an automatic wristwatch mechanism to harvest the energy of heart motion. Mr Zurbechen said ‘The heart seems to be a very promising energy source because its contractions are repetitive and present for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ‘Furthermore the automatic clockwork, invented in the year 1777, has a good reputation as a reliable technology to scavenge energy from motion. The new pacemaker means it could remove the need for operations to replace pacemaker batteries about every seven to ten years and do away with leads that connect the pacemaker inserted in the chest wall . ‘Batteries are a limiting factor in today’s medical implants. Once they reach a critically low energy level, physicians see themselves forced to replace a correctly functioning medical device in a surgical intervention. This is an unpleasant scenario which increases costs and the risk of complications for patients.’ To test the prototype, the researchers developed an electronic circuit to transform and store the signal into a small buffer capacity and then connected it to a custom-made cardiac pacemaker. The system worked in three steps. First, the harvesting prototype acquired energy from the heart. Second, the energy was temporarily stored in the buffer capacity. And finally, the buffered energy was used by the pacemaker to apply minute stimuli to the heart. It was then implanted into pigs where it has successfully restored heartbeat to 130 beats per minute. Mr Zurbechen said ‘We have shown that it is possible to pace the heart using the power of its own motion . ‘The next step in our prototype is to integrate both the electronic circuit for energy storage and the custom-made pacemaker directly into the harvesting device. This will eliminate the need for leads.’ ‘Our energy harvesting system is located directly on the heart and has the potential to avoid both disadvantages by providing the world with a batteryless and leadless pacemaker.’ He said the technology has the potential for use in many similar devices, including defibrillators and drug delivery pumps.","Swiss researcher has developed cardiac battery-free pacemaker prototype .

"A safety gadget has been devised for athletes to prevent serious head injuries occurring. The Jolt Sensor device monitors the movement of players, keeping track of any dangerous impacts. Any potential threat causes the clip - worn on the player's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees, as well as parents and coaches on the sidelines. Scroll down for video . The Jolt Sensor device monitors movements of players, keeping track of any impacts that happen. A threat causes the clip - worn on the player's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees, as well as parents and coaches in the event of a potentially dangerous impact . The gadget was created by CEO Ben Harvatine from St. Louis, Missouri after he suffered from concussion himself. A concussion is a brain injury and all are serious. Most occur without loss of consciousness. Recognition and proper response to concussions when they first occur can help prevent further injury or even death. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury, or TBI, caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head that can change the way your brain normally works. Concussions can also occur from a blow to the body that causes the head to move rapidly back and forth. Even what seems to be a mild bump or blow to the head can be serious. Concussions can occur in any sport or recreation activity. So all coaches, parents, and athletes need to learn concussion signs and symptoms and what to do if a concussion occurs. It is hoped the Jolt Sensor will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury. The company are aiming to start shipping the product in April 2015, with a Kickstarter campaign currently taking place to raise £36,000 ($60,000). 'I don't know the actual moment that I got my concussion,' said Mr Harvatine in a video. 'Between dehydration, a boiling hot practice room and repeated knocks to the head, I didn't know why I was dizzy. 'I just pushed through it like I always did. By the time I realised something was wrong, it was too late. I struggled to find the right words, any words, as I staggered into the trainers' room. 'Through the ensuing hospital visits and months of recovery, the same thing kept crossing my mind. How could this have been prevented?' The gadget was created by Ben Harvantine from Missouri after he suffered a head injury. When activated and an impact is detected, referees and coaches  can be alerted to serious head injuries and take action. It is hoped the gadget will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury . The sensor, which has a range of over a hundred yards, stays connected anywhere on the field to ensure a dangerous impact never goes unnoticed. When an incident is detected, officials, parents and coaches can be immediately notified that the athlete should be medically evaluated on the sideline with the app's built-in cognitive test. The results of this test are compared with baseline scores and used with the impact data to enable parents and coaches to make more informed decisions. All of this data is then stored in the cloud, for quick and easy access by the athlete and their doctor.

"The killer behind the horrific elementary school killing spree would have seen the children he shot dead as ‘little more than trophies’, an expert psychologist has said. A lone gunman – believed to be 20-year-old Adam Lanza - opened fire at around 9.30am this morning at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.  It is understood at least 29 people have been killed – including 22 children - and is the worst spree shooting in American history. Professor Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University and an expert in spree killings, said the murderer would have seen killing the children as a way of enacting revenge on those he was angry with. Scroll down for video . Shocking news: At least 29 people are believed to be dead - including 22 children - after a gunman opened fire today at an elementary school in Connecticut . An aerial view of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where the worst spree killing in American history happened today . Tragedy: A woman leans on a man as she weeps outside a building set up to counsel family members affected by a shooting nearby at Sandy Hook Elementary School . ‘To him the children are just a lump of meat that happen to help him prove his point,’ he explained. ‘If this was a revenge spree then he would see the children as useful trophies because each death would injure those he wanted to hurt. ‘This was the case in the Dunblane school massacre. Thomas Hamilton had no connection to the school but saw the killing of the children as a way to punish the community as a whole.’ It is understood Lanza headed to the elementary school where he killed the head teacher before targeting a class taught by his mother. Expert opinion: Professor Craig Jackson is the head of psychology at Birmingham City University and specialises in spree killings . Professor Jackson said: ‘It is possible that this spree stemmed from a domestic row and after he killed once, he decided to continue shooting. 'As he had already killed one person, he may have seen keeping on going as the only option. ‘But then the main question is, why shoot the children? There must have been a motive for that. He must have felt he had a grievance with the community that he wanted to punish. ‘Many spree killers target children as a way to get even with the local community. ‘I’m sure many survivors will report that he was calm and focused.  These sort of killers aren’t crazed, they know what they are doing and choose who they kill. 'Victim selection is not random, and statements from many spree survivors describe how something about them, their looks, their history with the killer, or even how they pleaded for their life was able to make the killer's attention shift from them. ‘The Columbine High School massacre is an example of this, where the killers let some people go but shot others dead. 'This makes them feel powerful and in control.’ Professor Jackson explained that all spree killers have certain things in common – they are unstable, narcissistic, immature and consistently blame others for their failures. He continued: ‘They often believe they should be doing better in life than they are doing and believe it is others’ fault that they are not. ‘They may believe teachers held them back, or blame their parents, but it is never their fault. ‘This outlook builds throughout their lives and then it comes to a point that something tips them over the edge.’ He said the killing of his mother points to trouble at home but the thing that sent the killer over the edge could also be down to problems at work or university. The Batman killer James Holmes had been kicked out of his university for failing his exams shortly before his shooting rampage at the midnight screening of the Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, on July 20. Stunned: People leave the scene outside the Sandy Hook Elementary School following a shooting inside the school in Newtown, Connecticut . Run: Officers evacuate students from Sandy Hook Elementary . On high alert: Heavily armed Connecticut State troopers at the Sandy Hook Elementary School as young children are evacuated from the scene . Murderer: Adam Lanza, a troubled 20-year-old loner with a history of autistic behavior, is the monster behind a horrific shooting at a Connecticut elementary school that left 26 people, including 20 children, dead . Professor Jackson added that spree . killers are often loners who don’t have partners or children – though . there are some exceptions to the rule, such as Derrick Bird who killed . 12 people and injured 11 others before killing himself in Cumbria, . England, in 2010. He . said: ‘Spree killers are normally aged between their 30s and 40s. This . killer is in his early twenties, so it is unlikely that he had a partner . or a child, but not impossible. ‘It is unusual at his young age to carry out a spree killing at an elementary school. When they are this young, they tend to carry out their shootings at their university campus. ‘A prime example is Seung-Hui Cho, a South Korean student, who killed more than 30 people in a spree killing at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States, in 2007. 'Our hearts are broken': American President Barack Obama gave an emotional address to the nation after the killings . Small town: Newtown in Connecticut has a small population of around 60,000 . 'There have also been two spree killings at universities in Germany and another two in Finland in the last eight years. ‘So . it is unusual for a man his age to choose an elementary school. It . appears the main connection must be because of his mother.' But he added it wasn’t surprising that the killer was not taken alive. ‘Many spree killers don’t intend to survive and often will stay alive until police arrive who they will force to shoot them. ‘It is then that police, particularly in America, will start checking the killer’s home for booby traps and weapons. The Batman killer left pipe bombs and booby traps in his apartment. On March 13, 1996, Thomas Hamilton walked into Dunblane Primary School in Scotland and shot 16 children and their teacher dead before turning the gun on himself . Killers: Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people in their rampage through Columbine before taking their own lives in 1999 . Gunman: Jacob Tyler Roberts, 22, opened gunfire at an Oregon mall on Tuesday, killing two people . ‘They often evacuate the street in . case of this but it seems unlikely any would have been set in this case . if he lived with his parents. ‘It also seems that an argument may have triggered the killings rather than a well-thought-out attack.’ But Professor Jackson said his main concern is that the killings will spark a copycat attack. He continued: ‘It is often the case with spree killings that get wide-spread media coverage that another will happen a few weeks afterwards. ‘This was the case with the Batman killer and Dunblane. Three weeks after Dunblane, Martin Bryant murdered 35 people and injuring 21 others in the Port Arthur massacre, in Tasmania, Australia, in 1996. He said he had hoped to beat the number of people that Thomas Hamilton had killed.’ Headlines: Virginia Tech shooter Cho Seung-Hui sent media packages out before his rampage .

"A young teacher displayed astonishing bravery and sacrificed her life saving as many children in her first grade class as she could after she came face-to-face with gunman Adam Lanza. Victoria Soto, 27, had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary for five years. Her final moments were spent ushering her students into a . closet when Lanza entered her classroom and she tried her best to shield the children from the evil gunman. Soto was a highly regarded young teacher who was popular with her pupils. One young student, Jacob . Riley, told Mailonline that Soto was known for chewing gum in class - something not . usually allowed for teachers. He said he had often teased her about her . habit and she had playfully teased him back. Scroll down for video . Passion: Victoria Soto had a passion for education and always knew she wanted to teach . Selfless: Victoria Soto threw herself in front of her first grade students and was killed protecting them . 'She . took her kids, put them in the closet and by doing so she lost her life . protecting those little ones,' Soto's cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News. 'She was found huddled over her . children, her students, doing instinctively what she knew was the right . thing. I'm just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm,' he continued. 'It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes she's a hero,' he added. A deeply distraught 10-year-old boy who is a former student of Miss Soto described her as 'really nice and funny.' Four teachers were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School . trying to save their students from gunman Lanza, the son of a . woman who worked at the school. The other three teachers have been identified as principal . Dawn Hochsprung, 47, school psychologist Mary Sherlach, 56, and Lauren Rousseau, 30. Devastated friends of Rousseau said she was having 'the best year of her life' after landing her first full-time teaching job only months ago. Twenty-eight . people died in the shooting rampage, including 20 young children . between the ages of five and ten, alleged gunman Adam Lanza, who took . his own life, and his mother, who was shot before the school massacre. When . Lanza started firing at the school in suburban Newtown, Connecticut, . some teachers dove under tables - but Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach didn't hesitate. Hero: Vicki Soto, 27, was trying to shield her first grade students from the gunman when she was shot . Murderer: Adam Lanza, killed himself after murdering more than two dozen others, including 20 school children . They ran into the hallway to confront the danger and were murdered execution-style as a result. Little did she know that Adam had . already killed his mother at the home they shared nearby. He took three . of her guns and used her car to drive to the school. Diane Day, a school therapist, told the Wall Street Journal that she and several other teachers were in a meeting with Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach when the shooting began. 'We were there for about five minutes chatting and we heard, ""pop pop pop,""' she said. 'I went under the table.' The . principal and the school psychologist had other ideas. They jumped out . of their seats and ran toward the sound of the gunfire. 'They didn’t think twice about confronting or seeing what was going on,' Ms Day said. Rabbi Shaul Praver told MSNBC that Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach were killed execution-style. Tributes for all educators poured in on Friday night. Former school superintendent John Reed told the Connecticut Post that Mrs Sherlach was warm and cared deeply for her students. 'If . there ever was a person, by qualifications and personality, to work . with children, to be a school psychologist, it was Mary,' he said. She . was married with two grown daughters in their 20s and enjoyed . gardening, reading and the theater, according to her school biography.

"Ryan Lanza was working at his desk at the Ernst & Young when he saw TV news reports that he had killed 30 people at an elementary school in Connecticut. It was the moment that a stunned Ryan realized what his brother Adam might have done. Lanza quickly told his boss: 'I need to go.' He then walked out of his Times Square office, according to a co-worker who spoke to MailOnline on condition of anonymity. Scroll down for video .

Murderer: Adam Lanza who shot dead his mother and then went on a gun rampage at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut leaving 26 dead . Thirty minutes later, New York police officers stormed the office. Between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning, Lanza defended himself in a series of bizarre Facebook posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his ID was found at the scene. Lanza, 24, seemed unaware that his younger brother, Adam Lanza, had gunned down 20 children and six adults at Sandy . Hook Elementary School, in Newtown before taking his own life. 'Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn't me,' he insisted on his Facebook page on Friday. 'I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me. IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT . WORK IT WASN'T ME.' Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan Lanza's, told the AP that he sent Ryan a Facebook message Friday asking what was going on and if he was alright. According to Wilshe, Lanza's reply was something along the lines of: 'It was my brother. I think my mother is dead. Oh my God.' Questioning: Ryan Lanza is led away for questioning by police after his brother is named as the killer . Adam Lanza attended Newtown High . School, and several local news clippings from recent years mention his . name among the school's honor roll students. A neighbor in Newtown, Rhonda . Cullens, said she knew Nancy Lanza from monthly get-togethers the . neighborhood women had for games of bunco, a dice game. 'She was a very nice lady,' Mrs Cullens said. 'She was just like all the rest of us . in the neighborhood, just a regular person.' Cullens recalled that . Mrs Lanza liked gardening and decorating her house look nice for the holidays. Mrs Cullens said that Mrs Lanza joked that no one noticed because the house was out of view, up a hill. The mix-up . came after an official mistakenly transposed the brothers' first names, . while a New Jersey reporter said Ryan Lanza told him the killer may have . had his ID. He is now being questioned by police in Hoboken, New Jersey, but police said he is not a suspect. Adam Lanza, 20, was dressed in black military gear and a . bullet proof vest when he opened fire in the principal's . office and then moving to a kindergarten classroom where his mother, . Nancy, taught. Sources told the New York Post that . Lanza had 'had a dispute with' his mother, who was found dead at her . home.

But others are convinced that the 63-year-old has joined other tycoons and celebrities in wanting to avoid taxes – including a 75 per cent top rate on income – introduced by Socialist President Francois Hollande. Mr Arnault applied for a Belgian passport soon after the Socialists won elections last year. Mr Arnault, who owns numerous homes around the world including one in London, applied for a Belgian passport soon after Mr Hollande’s Socialists won presidential and parliamentary elections last year. Critics immediately attacked him for leaving the country that is associated with all the brands which made his fortune - including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac. Nicolas Demorand, the editor of national newspaper Liberation, attacked him for ‘forgetting the country which has made him King’, adding : ‘Bernard Arnault is running the risk of fuelling suspicion about him, harming the image of his brands and weakening the employees who give them life.’ Mr Arnault has transferred his 31 per cent stake in Groupe Arnault, the family holding that controls LVMH, to Pilinvest, a Belgian firm that he specifically set up for the purpose. The stake is worth around 5.5 billion pounds, and Mr Arnault insists he wants to keep it in the hands of his five children after he dies. He has established a structure destined to prevent any of them selling their shares in the event of his death. Critics have attacked him for leaving the country associated with all the brands which made his fortune - including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac . It is believed he is trying to avoid taxes including a 75 per cent top rate on income being introduced by President Francois Hollande . A source close to him said the structure was lawful in Belgium, but would not be so in France. ‘He has got two obsessions - controlling his group and ensuring that it survives him,’ said the source. Earlier this year, Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu became another high-profile Frenchman moving his assets abroad . The Belgian Office of Foreigners has suggested it might block Mr Arnault’s request for a passport, but the final decision will be taken by the Brussels parliament. Belgium has a much more lenient tax regime than France – raising an inheritance tax of three per cent, compared to11 per cent in France. Unlike France, there is no wealth tax in Belgium either. Mr Arnault is also likely to be concerned by Mr Hollande’s plan to bring capital gains tax in line with income tax – effectively raising it from 19 per cent to 45 per cent, and possibly to 75 per cent if the Socialist President goes through with his threat to make that the top income tax rate for earnings over €1 million a year. Earlier this year, Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu became another high-profile Frenchman moving his assets abroad. The Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac card obtained a Russian passport, bought a house in Belgium, and put his multi-million pounds Paris town house on the market.","Bernard Arnault, head of .

"There is no connection between the development of autism with childhood vaccinations, University of Sydney researchers recently found. The first systematic international review was conducted for the research involved more than 1.25 million children for five cohort studies and a further 9920 for five case-controlled studies. Results from both showed that there was no statistical data to support a link between commonly-used vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough and the development of autism or autism spectrum disorders. Scroll down for video . No evidence to link the development of autism with childhood vaccines, according to recent research by University of Sydney . The Sydney Medical School's associate professor Guy Eslick said these vaccines were the ones which had received the most attention by anti-vaccination groups. 'A rising awareness of autism cases and the claimed but not proven link to childhood vaccinations has led to both an increased distrust in the trade between vaccine benefit outweighing potential risks and an opportunity for disease resurgence.' 'This has in recent times become a major public health issue with vaccine-preventable diseases rapidly increasing in the community due to the fear of a 'link' between vaccinations and autism.' Professor Eslick said this was particularly concerning given the fact that there were 11 measles outbreaks in the US since 2000 and NSW also saw a spike in measles infections in 2012. The research involved more than 1.25 million children for five cohort studies and a further 9920 for five case-controlled studies . 'Vaccine-preventable diseases clearly still hold a presence in modern day society, and the decision to opt out of vaccination schedules needed to be urgently and properly evaluated,' he said. The professor added that to date, there had been no quantitative data analysis of any relationship between autism, autism spectrum disorders and childhood vaccinations. 'Our review is the first to do so, and we found no statistical evidence to support this idea,' he said. 'Furthermore, our review found the components of the widely-used vaccines (thimerosal or mercury), nor the measles, mumps and rubella combination vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or an autism-spectrum disorder.' No statistical data to support a link between commonly-used vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough and the development of autism or autism spectrum disorders . The increase in parents deciding not to vaccinate their children has substantially decreased 'herd immunity' among populations, subsequently increasing the risk of catching potentially more serious infectious diseases, the professor also added. 'The risks incurred by not immunising a child is increasing substantially as the level of immunisation coverage in the population falls,' he said. 'The data consistently shows the lack of evidence for an association between autism, autism spectrum disorders and childhood vaccinations, regardless of whether the intervention was through combination vaccines (MMR) or one of its components, providing no reason to avoid immunisation on these grounds.' The results were published in the medical journal Vaccine.","The systematic international review, first of its kind, conducted by University of Sydney researchers .

"They are words of comfort from a mother to her daughter, assuring her never to forget how she is loved, even in her 'darkest of times'. And, as Erica Lafferty struggles to deal with the death of her mother and the letter's author, Dawn Hochsprung, never before has she needed the loving words more. Mrs Hochsprung, the Sandy Hook Elementary School principal, became one of Adam Lanza's 26 victims on Friday as she heroically charged towards him in a bid to save the school's children. Lafferty, her youngest daughter, has now revealed that her mother would write her 'Just Because' letters to tell her what the young woman meant to her. Scroll down for video . Missed: Sandy Hook school principal Dawn Hochsprung, who died in the massacre on Friday, would write letters to her daughter, Erica Lafferty (right), to tell her how much she loved her . Struggling to contain her emotions, Lafferty read one of the letters on the Today show on Tuesday. 'Today I stopped and thought what a wonderful daughter I have,' the front of the card reads. 'And I thought I'd tell you.' 'My dearest Erica, you are and forever will be my sweet baby girl,' Mrs Hochsprung wrote. 'You . possess a piece of my heart and soul and I will never be complete . without you. 'Remember this in your darkest times. You are never alone. Your mum.' On another page, she added: 'Be safe. Be well. Be happy. No one deserves it more.' Loving: One of the cards to her daughter bears the now poignant message: 'Be safe, be well, be happy' Letter: Lafferty said she came across her mother's heartfelt note in the aftermath of her killing . Lafferty read out the heart-breaking letter after she discovered it while searching for photographs in the aftermath of her mother's killing. She explained it was written after 'the first time I moved out. I went back and forth [to home] a couple of times because I was a mumma's girl and always needed her close.' Smiling, Lafferty also paid tribute to her caring, selfless mother as she spoke to Today. 'To say she was a wonderful person is the understatement of the century,' she told Savannah Guthrie as her fiance, Christopher Smegielski, stood beside her in Newtown, Connecticut. 'She put her life into making everyone else's lives so much better. Her . smile lit up every building she walked into. Support: Lafferty, who weds this summer, appeared on the show with her fiance, Christopher Smegielski . 'She made an impact on . everyone that she's ever come across. Every adult, every child - . especially the kids. [They were] the light of her life.' Lafferty added that she was finding it 'tough' after her mother's death. Hochsprung, 47, died as she tried to stop Lanza, 20, from entering the building, where he fatally shot six adults and 20 children. 'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on. 'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.' As Lafferty struggled to control her tears, her fiance stood beside her. Traumatic: One of the third grade students said . that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that . she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say 'put your hands . up' Happy: George Hochsprung said he and wife Dawn planned to spend . years together at a house they had built . 'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter,' Smegielski said. 'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible.' The mourning family has also seen support from across the country, and even from President Obama, who posed for photographs holding Hochsprung's granddaughter. Obama met with families of victims ahead of an interfaith memorial ceremony in . Newtown on Sunday night, and Hochsprung's daughter Cristina Hassinger posted images of him and the baby to . Twitter. 'My mom would be SO proud to see . President Obama holding her granddaughter,' she wrote alongside the photograph. 'But not as proud as I am of . her.' Mrs  Hochsprung's husband has also spoken about how his world was shattered in light of her death. Proud moment: Obama holds Dawn Hochspring's granddaughter as he visits Newtown on Sunday . Devastated: Her daughter tweeted the picture and expressed her grief at losing her mother . George   Hochsprung said that the . initial anger he felt after hearing that his wife confronted Lanza  has . gone away since he heard from two of the teachers that she helped save. 'Dawn . put herself in jeopardy and I have been angry about that - angry - until . just now, today, when I met the two women who she told to go under . shelter while she confronted the gunman and she could have avoided that, . but she didn't and I knew she wouldn't,' Mr Hochsprung told CNN. I'm not angry anymore, I'm just very sad.'Dawn 'ran out, and actually tried to subdue the killer. I don't know where that comes from, Dawn was five-foot-two.' Though the specifics of the timeline of events inside the school are still being ironed out by investigators, it is thought that Mrs Hochsprung was the one who may have thought to turn the intercom system on so that the entire school would be immediately alerted to the impending danger. Emotional: George got choked up and Erica began weeping during an interview about the principal's life . One of the third grade students said . that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that . she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say, 'Put your hands . up'. Tales of her heroism are helping Mrs Hochsprung's relatives process their grief, but only slightly. 'Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream,' Mr Hochsprung said. 'And the dream was a chronological dream it was going to be Dawn's house: I was going to die because I'm much older than Dawn, it was going to be Dawn's house. 'Dawn's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful. 'We built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be Dawn's house ultimately, with all the children. And now it's me - I don't think I can do that.' Crime scene: Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning . Mr Hochsprung met Dawn when she was his boss, working as the assistant principal in the area middle school while he was teaching seventh grade math. It was actually one of his students who told him the devastating news on Friday morning. 'One of the kids came up with a computer and said: ""Something's happening at Sandy Hook school and you're wife's been killed"",' George told CNN. The Hochsprung family is made up of George's three daughters from his first marriage, Dawn's two daughters from her first marriage, and their collective 11 grandchildren. A tearful Erica said that if she was given the chance to say one . final thing to her mom who she called 'my rock', it would be simple: . 'Come back, just come back.' See below for video .

'Peter was informed by a news . reporter who was waiting outside his house that his son was involved in . the shooting,' said a neighbour who has known Shelley for over a decade.

'He quickly declined to comment, rolled up the window, parked in the right side of the two-car garage and closed the door.' The stunned father is then said to . have sat at a table in the front of his three-bedroomed house with a . phone to his ear and his palm to his right cheek. Once Shelley returned home the couple . left and as revealed by the MailOnline have not been seen since by any . of their neighbours.

According to the Stamford Advocate . the couple had arranged a joint custody agreement for Adam, who was 17 . at the time of their divorce. As part of this parental agreement, . Adam was to live primarily with his mother and Peter was allowed . 'liberal visitation and vacations.' Nancy Lanza was shot dead by her son . Adam at the home they shared in Sandy Hook before he traveled to the . elementary school where he killed 20 children and six staff members. While neighbours on the small, quiet . suburban street said that they too were shocked at the involvement of . one of their neighbours in the tragedy, they claimed to know little to . nothing about them.

Murderer: Adam Lanza shot dead his mother . and then went on a gun rampage at Sandy Hook elementary school in . Connecticut leaving 26 dead . Shelley is understood to have been married to David Cudiner, 55, of Fairfield, Connecticut. Peter Lanza grew up in Kingston in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. His late father, Adam Lanza's . grandfather, Peter S. Lanza, was an investment broker and insurance . salesman and Peter Jr followed him into a career in finance. According to his resume on LinkedIn, Peter Lanza is tax director and vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services in the New York City area. Father: Peter Lanza, a wealthy executive for General Electric, who is believed to earn $1million a year, moved out of the family home in 2006 . He . has been an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern University in Boston . since 1995 and also teaches a partnership tax class in the master's in . taxation degree program at Fairfield University in Fairfield, . Connecticut, according to CNN. On . LinkedIn, Peter wrote of his experience: 'Career dedicated to . developing and refining partnership tax planning and transactional . skills' and 'Work closely with many of the preeminent partnership tax . advisers in the United States on a daily basis.' Shelley Cudiner is a reference librarian and business liaison at the University of Connecticut's Jeremy Richard Library. On the college's website, she wrote: . 'I serve all our undergraduate students and graduate students, with an . emphasis on the business, biology, economics, and psychology . departments, order materials for our degree programs, and coordinate . bibliographic instruction.' Despite going to ground over the . weekend, Peter Lanza took the time to release a statement earlier on Saturday regarding his . son's involvement in the shocking tragedy. 'We too are asking why,' he said in a statement. 'Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired. 'Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy.' He said that all living members of the . Lanza family, including himself and Adam's older brother Ryan, have . been fully cooperating with police and plan to help in any way that they . can as the repercussions of the shooting are felt. 'No words can truly express how heartbroken we are,' he said in the statement. Adam's first victim was his own mother, Nancy, whose dead body police eventually found at the Newtown home that she shared with Adam. It took several hours to confirm that she was the victim, however, since she had been shot in the face and was hard to identify. Nancy Lanza's home in Newtown, Connecticut, where she was found shot dead from a gunshot wound to the face . Mother: Out of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, came a disturbing picture of Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza and his first victim, his mother Nancy, pictured . Peter Lanza divorced Nancy in 2009 . citing 'irreconcilable differences.' Friends and neighbors said the divorce, as far as they knew, was amicable. Jim Leff, a musician who knew Nancy through a local bar and music spot that she frequented, called her a 'lovely person.' But he said he never became close friends with her because she was 'high-strung.' 'What held me back was my impression that she was a little high-strung,' Leff wrote on his blog. 'But . now that I've been filled in by friends about how difficult her . troubled son (the shooter) was making things for her, I understand that . it wasn't that Nancy was overwrought about the trivialities of everyday . life, but that she was handling a very difficult situation with uncommon . grace.' Ryan, Adam's 24-year-old brother was immediately embroiled in the shooting as Adam reportedly had Ryan's ID on him when police found his body in the Sandy Hook elementary school. Questioning: Ryan Lanza is led away for questioning by police after his brother is named as the killer . In fact, he was at work in the . Manhattan office of Ernst & Young when television news reports . started connecting his name to the shooting in Connecticut, and that was . when he started to understand that his brother may have been involved. Lanza . quickly told his boss: 'I need to go.' He then walked out of his Times . Square office, according to a co-worker who spoke to MailOnline on . condition of anonymity. Thirty minutes later, New York police officers stormed the office. Between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning, Lanza defended himself in a series of bizarre Facebook posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his ID was found at the scene. Lanza, 24, seemed unaware that his younger brother, Adam Lanza, had gunned down 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown before taking his own life. 'Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn't me,' he insisted on his Facebook page on Friday. 'I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me. IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN'T ME.' Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan Lanza's, told the AP that he sent Ryan a Facebook message Friday asking what was going on and if he was alright. According to Wilshe, Lanza's reply was something along the lines of: 'It was my brother. I think my mother is dead.

"Cockpit camera footage of Virgin Galactic's doomed space flight shows pilot Michael Alsbury breaking out in a panic after realising a deadly mistake has been made by activating the ship's wings. In the footage, he appears to realise pulling a lever activating the wings is a mistake before desperately attempting to rectify it by switching off the engines - seconds before the ship disintegrates. The revelation he recognized there was an error comes as the former president of Virgin Galactic stated the crash was caused by nothing 'other than pilot error'. Scroll down for video . A piece of debris from Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo lies in the Mojave desert after it disintegrated in mid air . Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board check out the site of the downed spaceship . These images show the space craft ascending then detaching from its mothership before it begins to break up . Co-pilot Alsbury, 39, was killed in the crash, while pilot Peter Siebold, 49, survived a 10mile parachute back to earth with only a shoulder injury. Investigators have stated the spacecraft's 'feathering' system - which rotates the tail to create drag - was activated before the craft reached the appropriate speed. Cockpit footage taken in the seconds leading up to the disaster shows Mr Alsbury pushing the lever to unhook the wings at 30 seconds past 10.07am, The Guardian reported. Panic sets in as he instantly realises his mistake and desperately attempts to turn the engine off. This is unsuccessful - the wings begin to deploy only four seconds later -  and at that point the video, and all other data, is lost. Will Whitehorn, former president of Virgin Galactic, said it looked likely the crash was due to pilot error . Former Virgin Galactic President Will Whitehorn told the paper: 'There's nothing that tells me that this was anything other than pilot error, sadly. 'I think he just unlocked at a time he shouldn't have. 'The [National Transportation Safety Board] are trying to understand why he did that, was there something in the system that told him he should do it, or did he just make a mistake, and I think it's going to be the latter.' A Virgin Galactic spokesperson declined to comment on the contents of the footage. Meanwhile federal investigators who have been in the Mojave Desert trying to find out why the experimental spaceship crashed are wrapping up their work in Southern California. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said that yesterday, investigators left the area about 120 miles north of Los Angeles where SpaceShipTwo broke apart on October 31. The safety board will take months more to finish interviews and analysis of physical evidence before publicly stating what it thinks caused the crash. Authorities say Mr Alsbury unlocked the system before planned, but this was one of two steps necessary to change the craft's configuration and was not enough on its own to do so. Activating the feathering system requires the pulling of a lever, not unlike a gun that fires only when the trigger is pulled, not just because the safety has been disengaged. But unlocking the system may have set off a chain of events that led to disintegration of the craft. Virgin Galactic is building a replacement spaceship and says test flights could resume as early as next summer if it finishes building a replacement craft. The sleek composite shell and tail section of the new craft are sitting inside the company's manufacturing facility in Mojave, California. After more than two years of work, it's beginning to look like a spaceship, but Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said there's much more to be done, from relatively simple things such as installing windows to the more complex fitting of flight controls and other wiring.","Cockpit footage shows Michael Alsbury pull lever, activating ship's wings .

"India announced this morning it had successfully test launched its new nuclear-capable missile which could hit Beijing and China - and beyond. The country's government hopes the $500million Agni V missile, which was launched at 8.07am Indian time, will turn the nation into Asia's main superpower. The Agni V missile has a range of 5,000km (3,100 miles), and is seen as key to helping India in its border disputes with China. Scroll down for video of the launch . Blast off: The Agni V missile bursts into life this morning during its successful test launch . High altitude: Indian Defence officials said the rocket rose to 600km and successfully deposited its payload . Threatening: A new map released shows the nuclear weapon could also reach far into Europe and eastern Africa . A new map released shows the nuclear weapon could also reach far into Europe and eastern Africa. Defence Minister AK Antony said: 'The nation stands tall today.' Vijay Saraswat, head of India's Defence Research and Development Organisation, said: 'India has emerged from this launch as a major missile power.' Indian Defence bosses said the weapon . rose to an altitude of more than 600km (370 miles), that its three . stages worked properly, and that the missile deployed its payload as . planned. The test . missile was launched from Wheeler Island off India's east coast. It rose . on a pillar of flame, trailing billows of smoke behind, before arcing . through the sky. China is far ahead of India in the missile race, with intercontinental . ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in the country. 'While China doesn't really consider India any kind of a threat or . any kind of a rival, India definitely doesn't think in the same way,' said Rahul Bedi, a defence analyst in New Delhi. Close: A bird flies perilously near to the missile launch area . Pioneering: Here are the first artist's impression of Agni V, which was seen and tested this morning . C Uday Bhaskar, the former head of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses, said: 'At the moment there is a huge assymetry in China's favour.' After it adds the missile to its arsenal, however, 'India's deterrent profile in the region would be appropriately burnished'. India already has the capability of hitting anywhere inside arch-rival . Pakistan, but has engaged in a splurge of defence spending in recent . years to counter the perceived Chinese threat. The Indian navy took command of a Russian nuclear submarine earlier . this year, and India is expected to take delivery of a retrofitted . Soviet-built aircraft carrier soon. The new Agni, named for the Hindi word for fire, is part of this . military build-up and was designed to hit deep inside China, Bedi said. Currently, the longest-range Indian missile, the Agni-III, has a range of only 2,100 miles or 3,500 kilometres and falls short of many major Chinese cities. India has also been suspicious of Beijing's efforts to increase its influence in the Indian Ocean in recent years and sees the weapons race as a way to fight back. 'It will be a quantum leap in India's strategic capability,' said Ravi . Gupta, spokesman for India's Defence research team, which built the . missile. Government officials said the missile should not be seen as a threat. 'We have a declared no-first-use policy, and all our missile systems, they are not country specific. There is no threat to anybody,' Gupta said. 'Our missile systems are purely for deterrence and to meet our security needs.' The launch window for the missile test, which is being conducted on Wheeler Island off India's east coast, opens Wednesday evening and closes on Friday. The Agni-V is a solid-fuel, three-stage missile designed to carry a 1.5-ton nuclear warhead. I . It stands 57 feet tall, has a launch weight of 50 tonnes and was built at a reported cost of 25 billion rupees, and will be moved around the vast country by road or rail. Rival: China has long been able to fire missiles to every Indian city but now they have fought back and could easily strike Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, pictured . 'Agni-V is a game-changer and a technological marvel,' V.K. Saraswat, scientific adviser to the defence minister, told  The Hindu newspaper. The missile could also be used to carry multiple warheads or to launch satellites into orbit. The planned test comes days after North Korea's failed long-range rocket launch. North Korea said the rocket was launched to put a satellite into space, but the U.S. and other countries said it was a cover for testing long-range missile technology. India's launch sparked none of the same global condemnation aimed at Pyongyang, an internationally isolated regime that has been banned by the UN from testing missile technology. Even if India's test is deemed a success, the missile will need four or five more trials before it can be inducted into India's arsenal at some point in 2014 or 2015, Bedi said.","Agni V can travel 3,100 miles so could also reach into Europe and Africa .

"French duo accused of having sex with Zahia Dehar when she was 17 . Maximum sentence for sleeping with underage prostitute in France is three years in jail . Both players deny the charges . French football stars Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema are facing up to three years in prison for allegedly sleeping with an underage prostitute. The attacking duo who earn some £17million a year between them - deny knowingly paying for sex with Zahia Dehar when she was under 18. Their Paris criminal trial, which opened on Monday, will shine a light on the high-living lifestyles of celebrity footballers and their lovers. Scroll down to video . On trial: Franck Ribery (left) and Karim Benzema (right) have been acquitted on charges of soliciting an underage prostitute . High fashion: Ms Daher recently attended a Versace fashion show . Ms Dehar, now 21, has become one of the most famous names in France since the players were first arrested, building up a career as a fashion icon, reality TV star, and the muse of designer Karl Lagerfeld. Neither she, nor the players, are expected to attend court, instead leaving the process to their lawyers. Paying for sex is legal in France, but only if all parties involved are more than 18 years old. The maximum sentence for sleeping with an underage prostitute is three years in prison, and a fine of around £40,000. Model: Zahia Dehar, now 21, contends Ribery flew her to Munich as a birthday present to himself in 2009 when she was under 18 . Ms Dehar was 17 when she was paid in 2009 to fly from Paris to Munich, where Ribery plays for European Champions Bayern Munich, to sleep with him as a 26th 'birthday treat'. Carlo Alberto Brusa, Ribery's lawyer, said his client did not know how old Ms Dehar was at the time. Mr Brusa said today: 'Mr Ribery is a mature person who has faced difficult times. He is as concerned as anyone who finds himself in the criminal justice system, but at the same time calm.' New life: Dehar has become one of the most famous names in France since the players were first arrested . Mr Dehar is known to have lied about her age to all the footballers she slept with, including Real Madrid forward Benzema, said Mr Brusa. Ms Dehar has withdrawn as a civil plaintiff in the case, so will not be seeking damages. 'She is not asking for anything,' said Daniel Vaconsin, her barrister. The trial is going ahead after France's highest court ruled that only those aware that a prostitute was underage can be found guilty of breaking the law. Brazil bound: Benzema (left) and Ribery (right) are hoping to be part of the France for the World Cup . Ribery's brother-in-law is also . charged with soliciting a minor for sex, and five other accused face . maximum prison terms of 10 years on charges relating to the case, . including 'aggravated pimping'. Benzema, who is accused of paying for sex with Ms Dehar in a Paris hotel when she was 16, denies that any encounter took place. Ms Dehar has already testified that she had sex with both players for money after lying to them about her age.

"A Muslim activist has labelled Islamic State militants 'w**kers' and says teenagers who travel to Syria to join the terror group deserve to be 'locked up'. Zaky Mallah, from Sydney, made the comments during an appearance on Channel Ten's The Project. Mr Mallah was the first person to be charged with terrorism back in 2003 after he made a video which Federal Police and ASIO said contained a planned suicide attack on federal government offices in Sydney. Scroll down for video . Muslim activist Zaky Mallah, from Sydney, called Islamic State militants 'wankers' and says teenagers who join the terror group deserve to be 'locked up' He spent two years in the maximum security Multi-Purpose Unit at Goulburn prison awaiting trial, before being acquitted. Mr Mallah's comments come one day after a propaganda video for Islamic State featuring Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir surfaced. Earlier this year, the 17-year-old disappeared from his Bankstown home in June, telling his mother he was going fishing. On Wednesday night, The Project's Carrie Bickmore asked Mr Mallah what he would say to teenagers looking to travel to the conflict zone. His comments come after Abdullah Elmir, from Sydney, appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State . The activist said he would 'discourage them' from joining the beheading extremist group and urged them to think about what they were doing to their families, and took aim at Islamic State. 'These idiots, these wankers [IS fighters]... are giving Islam and the Muslim world and Islamic community in Australia a bad name,' Mr Mallah told The Project. 'For those who are considering to join ISIS, I hope ASIO is onto you. 'I hope your passport is refused and I hope you are arrested and locked up until you wake up to yourself and realise the harm you are doing to the community and greater Australia.' Mr Mallah said using social media as a recruitment tool was why it seemed like more teenagers were taking action and travelling to the Middle East. 'With social media and YouTube, there's a lot of ISIS videos – it's like hardcore porn – a person gets interested in such footage, black banners running around and you see people from all around the world coming together for a cause,' he said. 'A lot of these people in Islamic community see this and say ""Why not?"" and before you know it, they're at the airport flying making their way to Turkey and then they're at the border ready to cross into Syria.' Mr Mallah was the first person to be charged under the Australian terror laws in 2003, but was acquitted . Having made his way to Syria himself in 2012 to fight with Free Syrian Army rebels, Mr Mallah said it was 'very easy' to get into the country - all you had to do was pay $50 and someone was more than willing to help you. Mr Mallah told Daily Mail Australia that all he wanted was to see Syria free from Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'I know the Islamic community in Sydney, we’re very passionate,' he said. 'The Sunni Muslim community wants to get rid of Bashar al-Assad.' Mr Mallah said Australia's Syrian community wanted to go over to the Middle East and fight but it was illegal for them to do so. 'Maybe Australian authorities can let us go over and fight as long as we don't join ISIS,' he said. 'ISIS is the most brutal group and people think joining it will help.'","Sydney's Zaky Mallah made the comments on Wednesday's The Project .

"The billionaire casino mogul who has breathed new life into Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign with millions of dollars in donations is facing a federal investigation over whether his company violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribing foreign officials. The investigation stems from a lawsuit filed by a former executive at the Sands Macau in China, the company has said. Steven C. Jacobs claims he was told the keep quiet about investigations of local officials and the possible presence of the triads - Chinese organized crime - in the casino. Sheldon Adelson, who founded and runs Las Vegas Sands Corp -- one of the largest casino and resort companies in the world, has denied the allegations in the lawsuit and said the company is cooperating with federal investigators. Big supporter: Sheldon Adelson (left) has propped up Newt Gingrich's campaign with $10 million in donations to the former House Speaker's super PAC . Adelson has donated an estimated $10 million to Gingrich's super PAC 'Winning our Future' and promised to give up to $20 million. Worth an estimated $21 billion, Adelson is the eighth richest man in America and has almost single-handedly financed Gingrich's second campaign surge. The large donation has allowed Gingrich supporters to buy TV ads in key states, helping the former House Speaker to defeat Mitt Romney in the South Carolina Republican primary. But the attention has brought Adelson's business practices into the spotlight. The lawsuit was filed in October 2010 and the company announced the federal inquiry in March of last year. Allegations: The former head of the Sands Macau casino (pictured) filed a lawsuit against Adelson's company after he was fired . Adelson addressed the concerns at a public forum last year saying the investigation is 'not a serious matter.' 'When the smoke clears, I am 1,000 percent positive that there won't be any fire below it,' he said, according to ABC News. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice began looking into Las Vegas Sands Corp. as a result of allegations about its practices at Sands Macau casino and hotel, which operates on the Chinese island that has become the largest gambling mecca in the world, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Jacobs, who ran the resort, says in his lawsuit that he was wrongly fired from the company after he objected to allegedly illegal actions that he was asked to perform. Among them: Jacobs claims Adelson wanted him to hire a Chinese lawyer to dig up 'negative information' on local Macau officials that the company could use as leverage, the Sun reported. Lit up: Adelson's best-known property is the Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas strip . Jacobs says he also disagreed with Adelson over increasing the casino's use of junkets -- trips to Macau by groups of high-rolling gamblers organized by third-party groups. Some junkets in Macau have been organized by members of Chinese organized crime syndicates. Reuters reported in 2010 that alleged triad crime boss Cheung Chi-tai, who was connected with a junket to the Sands Macau, was running one of the VIP rooms at the casino, according to witnesses. That information came out at a trial of four men convicted of breaking a Sands dealer's arms and legs, allegedly on Chi-tai's orders, according to Reuters. In his lawsuit, Jacobs says Adelson ordered him to keep Chi-tai's name and any information about possible triad involvement secret from the casino's board of directors. The Las Vegas Sands Corp. has strenuously denied Jacobs' claims and says he was fired for striking unauthorized deals and violating company policy.","Sheldon Adelson is the founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., which owns the Sands Macau in China .
